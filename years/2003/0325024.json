 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, establishing a Distributed Computing Laboratory (DCL) based on a Beowulf cluster, aims at supporting multiple research projects, in particular: \r\n\tNeuro-Fuzzy Systems Modeling, Simulation, and Applications,\r\n\tCluster Architecture and Networking,\r\n\tGeneral Distributed Computation Techniques, and\r\n\tEnhancement of Spatial Resolution in Electrocardiography through Improvements in Numerical Methods.\r\nThis last project will serve as a bridge to the new Border Health Science Center in El Paso. The DCL will afford students the opportunity to carry out hands-on projects in Artificial Neural Networks, Operating Systems, Computer Network Protocols, and Computer Architecture. Initially the following 3 projects will directly benefit from the infrastructure proposed:\r\n\tDistributed Processing Research,\r\n\tSimulation of Neuro-Fuzzy Hybrid Systems, and\r\n\tEnhancement of Spatial Resolution in Electrocardiography.\r\n\r\nFor educational and outreach activities, the Lab will serve as a hub that creates a pipeline of minority and women students from high school through graduate school. The cluster will be utilized in three interleaved efforts: To\r\n\tPerform specialized outreach to intelligent minority and female high-school students labeled \"at risk;\"\r\n\tProvide enrichment of educational activities in CISE; and\r\n\tInvolve students in research, using the DCL as a catalyst to promote multi-disciplinary collaborations that would benefit from this form of computing.\r\n\r\nEach objective contributes to creating a pipeline for minority students that creates a larger number of motivated entering students, leads to higher retention and attainment of degrees, and provides qualified professionals experienced in CISE research activities. Thus, the work is geared to attract and retain under-represented students, developing a solid collaborative research backbone, enhancing its educational program, and improving participation of a diverse student population in computer engineering disciplines. The outreach plan includes a DCL summer camp with students in the project participating in UTEP's Engineering and Science EXPO. Enhancement of the educational program is expected to lead to improved recruitment and retention, increased transition towards graduate programs, and a stronger integration between research and education at the graduate and undergraduate level\r\n",
