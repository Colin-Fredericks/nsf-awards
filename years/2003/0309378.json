 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convergent evolution provides a unique window into the process of adaptation. Replicated adaptations can range from morphological similarity to parallel molecular changes. Convergence at the molecular level may occur through either structural or regulatory changes and may be constrained by pleiotropic effects. The proposed research investigates the molecular basis for multiple convergent floral color adaptations to hawkmoth pollination. The degree of molecular convergence in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway will be determined using a combination of biochemistry, DNA sequencing and gene expression analysis. This study will determine the extent of molecular convergence and evolutionary constraint during adaptation, a fundamental process of evolution.\r\n\r\nThis study will have a direct impact on our understanding of how new adaptations arise. In a time of global climate change, organisms will be faced with unprecedented rates of environmental change. Their ability to adapt to these new environments will be of utmost importance in maintaining biodiversity. Evolutionary constraints on adaptations could partly determine the fate of many plant and animal species. A better understanding of the molecular basis for adaptations may help predict those species that are in peril of extinction and help guide conservation priorities to avoid extinctions due to global warming.\r\n",
