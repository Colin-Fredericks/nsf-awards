 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wang\r\n     Protein motors convert chemical energy to mechanical work\r\nwhile operating in an isothermal environment.  The molecular\r\nmechanism responsible for the energy transduction is still not\r\nclear.  The current experimental technologies permit measuring\r\nforces and motions of a single protein motor to the precision of\r\npiconewtons and nanometers.  The main focus of this project is to\r\nuncover the energy transduction mechanism of protein motors from\r\nsingle molecule experimental data.  First, the investigator\r\ndevelops robust and effective tools for extracting the motor\r\nforce profile from the measured time series of motor position.\r\nThe motor force profile shows the motor driving force as a\r\nfunction of motor position.  It contains information about the\r\nmotor mechanism.  The investigator also explores what else besides\r\nthe motor force profile can be extracted from the experimental\r\ndata.  The theoretical and numerical tools developed are useful\r\nfor the studies of reaction diffusion processes in general.  Then,\r\nthe investigator applies the tools developed to study the force\r\ngeneration mechanism of kinesin and other protein motors.\r\nThroughout the model building, new experiments are suggested to\r\nexperimental colleagues to resolve the unsettled issues.\r\n     Protein motors play a central role in many cell functions.\r\nFor example, myosin drives muscle contraction; kinesin drives\r\nintracellular vesicle transportation and moves chromosomes during\r\nmitosis.  Understanding the operating principles of protein motors\r\nis crucial to comprehending how biological systems function.  It\r\nis also important to bioengineering applications: controlling\r\nprotein motors artificially, incorporating protein motors into\r\nartificial systems, and manufacturing nano-scale artificial\r\nmotors.  This project seeks to reveal the operating principles of\r\nprotein motors from experimental results.  In laboratories, the\r\ntime course of a single protein motor can be recorded.  The\r\ninvestigator eas develop theoretical tools to recover the motor\r\nforce profile from the recorded time courses.  Then the force\r\ngeneration mechanism is investigated.\r\n",
