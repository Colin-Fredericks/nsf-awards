This workshop, supported by NSF, ARO, ONR, and AFOSR, considers software engineering issues in embedded systems. The workshop is devoted to exploring the critical problems associated with cost-effective development of high-quality software systems. The purpose of the workshop is two-fold: first, to assess the state-of-the-research in current \"point solution\" approaches to specific problems in this domain; and second, to define a roadmap for future research that bridges gaps left by\r\ncurrent tools and methodologies and articulates a more complete set \r\nof technology requirements to guide goal-driven research. The first objective is addressed through presentations by leaders in a variety of relevant areas. The second objective is addressed through presentations of position papers and extensive open discussion periods.\r\n\r\nThe workshop convenes in Chicago in September 2003. Participants are US and international researchers, selected for their expertise in one or more system and software engineering challenge areas related to embedded systems.\r\n",
