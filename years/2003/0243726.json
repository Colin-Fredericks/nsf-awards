Students will be assigned an individual research project to work in the Fall Semester with faculty research mentors at Osaka University, Sophia University (Tokyo), and Kyoto University in collaboration with USC faculty. In addition, two USC U.S. graduate (Ph.D.) students will also travel to Japan together with the REU group and serve as mentors to the students while also doing research in Japan. Research projects will be on topics such as the catalytic role of supercritical water in organic reactions; molecular simulations of gas permeation through organic membranes; shock tube studies of the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons; the synthesis of molecular composites; emission control during the pyrolosis of coal; and synthesis of nanoporous materials using copolymer gel templates. In addition to the individual research projects, the REU program will include group activities to enrich the participants' education and research experience and facilitate collaboration and long-term relationships with Japanese collaborators. Group activities will involve technical, social, and cultural events such as tours of industrial research facilities and participation in local community festivals. Students will be recruited from chemical engineering programs throughout the United States. USC will also focus on recruiting students from underrepresented groups at institutions such as North Carolina A&T State University; Florida A&M University-Florida State University College of Engineering; and the University of Puerto Rico. This REU Site is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering and the NSF Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
