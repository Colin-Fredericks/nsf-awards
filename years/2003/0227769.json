 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sara Young directs the American Indian Research Opportunities program at Montana State University. Her mentoring is beyond the ordinary, especially when the unusually difficult logistical factors of the work are considered. In her unique and successful mentoring of students in Montana, she has been able to overcome many challenges, such as the demanding geographic environment. Young has worked with both students and families to achieve successful outcomes for Native American students. She has also worked with a coalition to achieve positive results. The rate of students graduating from her program and going on to attend college is high as a result of Young's mentoring and of the very positive role model that she poses to Native American students.",
