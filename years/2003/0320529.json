 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to demonstrate Surveyor Telescope for Atmospheric Research (STAR) as a viable real-time nighttime ozone monitor. STAR is reaching fruition as an atmospheric extinction monitor in support of other optical instrumentation. STAR can also be used for direct data collection by using the extinction properties of absorption lines and bands. To demonstrate this data, which include information from the Chappuis bands of ozone, are analyzed, interpreted and validated against published sources. The anticipated result is to incorporate data analysis algorithms in the data collection routines so real-time data reporting will be demonstrated. STAR is also poised to measure atmospheric water vapor and upon further study has multiple applications for atmospheric research.\r\n     Such an instrument will aid the understanding of global atmospheric changes by allowing detailed, regular, worldwide nighttime measurements of relevant quantities. Having divulged its potential as an ozone monitor, and through a preliminary survey of the atmospheric studies community, interest in STAR has already been established, and its market potential has developed well beyond initial expectations.\r\nKeywords: atmospheric extinction, ozone monitor, computer imaging telescope, nighttime\r\n",
