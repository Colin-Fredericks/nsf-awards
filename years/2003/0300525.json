Each of these topics entail a synthesis of techniques\r\nand results from various mathematical fields with the goal of progress\r\ntoward solutions of fundamental problems, and each has seen progress\r\nachieved by Friedlander and his collaborators.  Firstly, Friedlander\r\nproposes to investigate algebraic K-theory and algebraic cycles on\r\nalgebraic varieties, with the expectation that his investigation will\r\ncontribute both specific computations and general properties of these\r\nfundamental invariants.  Friedlander will seek to produce topological\r\nconstructions associated to objects arising in algebraic geometry\r\nwhich closely reflect subtle aspects of algebraic cycles and algebraic\r\nK-theory.  These constructions, many planned in conjunction with Mark\r\nWalker, are envisioned to involve a blend of techniques from stable\r\nhomotopy theory and recent techniques developed by Voevodsky for motivic\r\ncohomology.  In particular, Friedlander plans to investigate further the\r\nsemi-topological K-theory of varieties and its connections with algebraic\r\nand topological K-theory.  The second topic involves the introduction\r\nof new spaces determined by the representation theory of a finite group\r\nscheme which provide a new perspective on cohomological support varieties.\r\nThe goal of this research, in part to be achieved in collaboration with\r\nJulia Pevtsova, is to produce finer invariants in the general context of\r\nfinite group schemes which are accessible to computations and which extend\r\nour understanding of (modular) representations.  Finally, in joint work\r\nwith Vincent Franjou, Friedlander proposes to study the cohomology of\r\npolynomial bifunctors with the aim of improving earlier computations by\r\nhimself and others to cases more closely related to questions in K-theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematics continues to reveal beautiful relationships which are both\r\nuseful and surprising.  This project involves the study of shapes\r\n(topology) which arise as the solutions of polynomial equations.\r\nSuch a study uses geometric insights and algebraic manipulations,\r\naugmented by constructions and computations of many mathematicians over\r\nthe centuries.  Some of the questions considered still seem dauntingly\r\ndifficult, but partial progress towards their solutions will lead to\r\nadvances in different branches of mathematics and mathematical physics.\r\nA second aspect of this project is the study of formal algebraic objects\r\nwhich arise as symmetries of familiar structures.  Once again, geometry\r\nis blended with algebra to provide motivation for questions to be asked\r\nas well as to suggest methods of solution.  A third aspect consists of\r\nefforts to maintain the strength of the national effort in mathematics by\r\nmentoring graduate students and junior faculty, by organizing mathematical\r\nmeetings, by editorial efforts for journals and special volumes, and\r\nby participation in the on-going discussion of policy issues for the\r\nAmerican Mathematical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
