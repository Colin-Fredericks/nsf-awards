 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nHybrid systems  consist of  discrete time systems  interacting with\r\ncontinuous time systems. Most frequently they arise when a discrete\r\ncomputational device functions in a continuous physical environment.\r\nSuch systems have become very common, thanks to the proliferation of\r\nsoftware in  controlling physical systems. Modeling and analysis of\r\nhybrid systems is, therefore, paramount for efficient development of\r\nhigh quality safe devices.  Formal models of hybrid systems have been developed by combining discrete\r\nstate transition formalisms with continuous dynamical systems. Developing\r\nanalysis technology for such expressive formalisms is a challenging task.\r\nIn  recent  years,  several  analysis  tools  have  been  developed  for\r\nspecialized classes of hybrid models that either restrict the continuous\r\nbehavior or the discrete behavior severely. The continuous component of a\r\nhybrid  system,  in  particular,  presents a  great  challenge  to  the\r\ndevelopment of sound analysis techniques.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop sound and effective techniques and tools for\r\nanalysis of large hybrid system models.  The approach centers around the\r\nconstruction of  approximate  abstractions  for hybrid  systems  using\r\nintelligent abstraction mappings that yield effective  computability  and\r\nscalability.  The project builds on the hybrid abstraction technique that combines\r\npredicate abstraction for discrete systems with qualitative abstraction of\r\ncontinuous  dynamical  systems.  It focuses on (i) improving techniques to generate\r\nthe most appropriate abstraction mappings by structurally analyzing the\r\ncontinuous dynamics; (ii) the exploitation of the modular structure of the\r\ndiscrete and continuous components, and the compositional structure of the\r\nhybrid system; and (iii) developing the necessary symbolic methods for\r\neffective automation.\r\n\r\nThe tools and techniques developed under this project will have broader impacts by making analysis\r\namenable to intermediate and large hybrid system models in application areas such as embedded system\r\ndesign for automotive and other applications and bioinformatics.  It also\r\nhelps students develop intuitions about complex system behaviors without\r\nanalytically solving them. The results are disseminated through research\r\npublications and the tools are made available for academic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
