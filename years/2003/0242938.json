Professors Edward B. Coughlin, University of Massachusetts, and G. Sundararajan, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai are the organizers of the workshop in a discipline that has come to hold a special position in research and development by virtue of the applications in organic and polymer syntheses.  India has many active researchers in the field, but the multi-disciplinary aspects of organometallic chemistry have not been evaluated.  The workshop will unite academicians and industrial scientists in the field of organometallic catalysis and olefin polymerization, and will identify specific research areas for future collaboration such as the synthesis of organometallic catalysts, single-site catalysts in the olefin polymerization reactions, and applications in the field of catalytic organic synthesis.  \r\n\r\nOrganometallic chemistry is a thrust area identified by the Government of India Department of Science and Technology (DST).  While in India the number of chemists involved in this research area is growing, only a handful of groups are involved in research on olefin polymerization using single-site catalysts.  The fruits of this research are not yet realized by Indian industry.  This  workshop will bring to focus the requirement for active research in this area.  The proceedings will be brought out in CD format and then published as a special issue to commemorate the workshop.  The DST jointly supports this activity.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel funds for ten American participants at the US-India Workshop: Recent Advances in Organometallic Catalysis and Olefin Polymerization, to be held in Pondicherry, India on December 2003.  Professors E. Bryan Coughlin, University of Massachusetts Amherst and G. Sundararajan, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras are the organizers of the workshop on this important topic in the area of catalysis chemistry and polymer synthesis.  The US delegates are a high-powered team recognized for research related interactions between academia and industry and they will ensure the success of the workshop.  The Indian participants represent a broad range of interests from academia, industry, and government.  The composition of US and Indian scientists at this workshop is likely to initiate new collaborative activities.  The US PI is a very promising young investigator with significant industrial experience and commendable outreach activities; the US delegation includes younger scientists and representatives of underrepresented groups.  This workshop will be supported by the Government of India's Department of Science & Technology (DST).   \r\n",
