 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) is continuing for eighteen months the work of the Alternatives for Rebuilding Curricula (ARC) Center.  The project will maintain its current institutional organization with a national center at COMAP and satellite centers at TERC, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The role of the national center is to oversee the entire project and to guide efforts that reflect common visions across the three curriculum projects (Investigations in Number, Data, and Space; Everyday Mathematics and Math Trailblazers).  Satellite centers focus their resources on school and districts that are using their curricula and they collaborate with one another and the national center on projects that advance the common objectives of all ARC sites.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the ARC Center are the following.\r\n\r\n*To complete the development and testing of a Building Capacity for Change program that is intended to introduce a range of improvement options to school districts in underserved areas of the country.\r\n*To augment the findings of the Tri-State Student Achievement Study (Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington) in order to probe the findings in greater depth.\r\n*To conclude the individual pilot projects at each satellite.  Two satellite centers are seeking alternative ways to provide staff development to large numbers of teachers.  The third satellite is identifying critical factors in urban implementations.\r\n",
