 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe general objective is to develop an analytical model for unreinforced\r\nmasonry (URM) building models subjected to quasi-static lateral forces in combination with gravity\r\nloads. A case study of the need for such research is presented by the 1994 Northridge earthquake during which,\r\na large number of unretrofitted URM buildings have been damaged. Retrofitted URM buildings however,\r\nperformed much better, and the damage to these structures was less catastrophic. The research\r\n will enhance the existing body of knowledge by developing simplified system-based analytical\r\ntools for investigating the effectiveness of composite materials in repairing and/or retrofitting masonry\r\nbuildings. Based on results from previous and proposed experimental results, this research will permit a\r\nwide range of both broad and specific investigations on the behavior of unreinforced and FRP-reinforced\r\nmasonry buildings as systems, and will compliment and expand the current research data from\r\nexperimental and analytical studies on building components.\r\n To accomplish the project objectives, the following\r\ntasks will be crried out: develop an analytical model using commercially available computer software\r\npackages to analyze URM building systems; conduct experimental investigations of selected building\r\nsystems to validate URM model accuracy; conduct small component experimental investigations on key\r\nFRP-URM material properties to generate missing data needed for the analytical model; expand the\r\nanalytical model to incorporate the new FRP-URM material properties derived from small component\r\ntests; conduct experimental investigations of selected building systems to validate FRP-URM model\r\naccuracy; and calibrate the model based on the results of the validation tests.\r\nThe broader impact resulting from the proposed activity includes the involvement of freshmen\r\nengineering students to use this project to assist them in the development of their critical thinking and\r\nproblem solving skills. Furthermore, Civil Engineering seniors will participate in the project and will\r\nhave an opportunity to emphasize engineering systems, the impact of research on design and technology,\r\nand the importance of multi-disciplinary design. In addition, the participation of North Carolina A & T\r\nState University, a non-Ph.D. granting HBCU with a 90%+ student population that is African American,\r\nwill provide a unique opportunity for involvement of under-represented students in this project.\r\n\r\n",
