 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance and durability of microdevices in sliding contact is \r\nstrongly dependent on interfacial phenomena like adhesion, friction, wear, \r\nand friction/vibration interaction.  It is becoming increasingly recognized \r\nthat problems of stiction, adhesion and other critical phenomena such as \r\nbouncing vibrations occur dynamically in the presence of time-varying loads \r\nand motions.  As high-speed contacts operate under ever more challenging \r\nconditions, contact or sticking can, in principle, occur at any time.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  In this research, a systematic approach to dynamic \r\ncontact studies of microsystems will be performed based on system \r\nindependent interfacial models that are coupled to the system dependent \r\ndynamics of the interface.  A unique feature of the proposed approach is \r\nthe direct incorporation of the intermolecular (adhesion) forces and \r\nkinetic friction models based on continuum mechanics into a dynamically \r\nmoving contact interface.  This will enable contact length scales from \r\nmicrometer to millimeter range and beyond to be covered.  Also, two unique \r\nmicrotribometers will be built to measure key dynamic properties of \r\nrealistic miniature systems, and to conduct dynamic contact and friction \r\nexperiments for model verification and for studying such phenomena in \r\nHDI's, and MEMS.  The outcome of this research is to: (a) Develop a \r\nrigorous kinetic friction model for microdevices; (b) Use the model to \r\npredict interfacial forces, damping and kinetic friction, thus providing a \r\npowerful tool for controlling adhesion, friction and wear in microsystems; \r\n(c) Predict the motions of contacting and pseudo-contacting HDI's and MEMS \r\nas a function of design parameters like roughness, material properties, and \r\nsystem dynamic properties, thus avoiding large vibrations and impact forces \r\nand the associated catastrophic consequences.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The research plan will advance the knowledge of tribology \r\nand microtribolgy, while the education plan of this research will \r\ndisseminate it outside the research group and beyond the University.  The \r\neducational goals of increasing the awareness of micro/nanotribology and \r\nengineering in general, will be accomplished by: (a) establishing an \r\noutreach K-12 program targeting students grades 1 through 5 (cub-scouts) \r\nand high school students, (b) enhancing a basic tribology course using \r\nmodern teaching techniques and also recruiting underrepresented students to \r\nwork on projects and disseminate the information to the public, (c) \r\ndeveloping a new graduate class in friction/vibration for miniature systems \r\n(microtribodynamics) that will include current research findings, and (d) \r\nactively participating in local and professional societies to promote \r\nengineering and tribology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed integrated research and education plan will advance further \r\nthe development of micromachines, which has a major potential impact on \r\nsociety through transformation of a wide range of technologies, and at the \r\nsame time increase the awareness and significance of friction and tribology",
