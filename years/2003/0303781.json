 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the eighth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium, which will be held on August 10-11, 2003, in Acapulco, Mexico. The consortium will be collocated with the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (NCAI), which will be held from August 10-15 in Acapulco. ACM/SIGART and AAAI together organized the first seven Doctoral Consortia, which have also been collated with either NCAI or  IJCAI (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence). \r\n \r\nAt the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing their dissertations on AI-related topics present their proposed research, and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers as well as from the other students.  This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also enables them to explore their career objectives. This workshop contributes to the professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing field in the coming decades.\r\n",
