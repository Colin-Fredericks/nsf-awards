This project is a combined theoretical and experimental study to understand hydrogen development and the hydrodynamics of bubbles in an alkaline electrolyzer. Other parameters to be investigated include current density, applied potential, electrolyte and electrode materials, spacing between the anode, cathode and membrane, and temperature and ambient pressure.  A two-phase mathematical model will be developed for the electrolytic process. The model will consider heat and mass transfer, concentrations and ion transport, electricity field, and chemical reaction occurring at the anode and the cathode.  Experiments will be designed and performed to validate and improve the mathematical model. The fluid velocity, gas fraction, and bubble growth rate will be measured using Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) at Northeastern University.  The ultimate goal of this research is to investigate and develop methods to increase the efficiency of electrolytic production of hydrogen by means of hydrodynamic enhancements. \r\n\r\nScope: Hydrogen is one of the promising alternative sources of energy. There is limited systematic investigation on how to quantify and efficiently exploit this energy.  The two collaborators plan to combine their expertise in experimental work and mathematical modeling to study this interesting scientific problem. The US PI has considerable experience and has access to extensive facilities at Northeastern University.  The Turkish scientist has strong experience in mathematical modeling of two phase heat transfer.  This research should improve our understanding of the processes involved in electrolysis to produce hydrogen using water and photovoltaic solar energy. The research will help in establishing the technical framework for cost-effective production and usage of hydrogen energy in Turkey and potentially for other developing countries.\r\n\r\n",
