 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract\r\nA TestStar IIs test system will be acquiired for Penn State Eries School\r\nof Engineering and Engineering Technology (SEET) material test lab currently used to support undergraduate\r\nprograms in Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET), Plastics Engineering Technology (PLET) and Mechanical\r\nEngineering (ME). The equipment will create an infrastructure to enable research in the characterization of\r\nmonotonic and dynamic material properties of elastomers, plastics and various metals over a range of temperatures\r\nand loading conditions. It will also be used to support the achievement of learning objectives established for\r\nundergraduate instruction in dynamic testing methods. Opportunities for applied research will be derived from\r\nongoing funded research conducted collaboratively with Leigh University, by proposed research with regional\r\nindustry partners, and through the support given to the Plastics Technology Center (PTC) that serves Northwest\r\nPennsylvania.\r\nResearch will be applied and focused on the advancement and understanding of the dynamic and monotonic\r\nproperties for elastomeric, plastic and various metal materials over a range of temperatures. Specifically, dynamic\r\ncharacterization of these materials, generation of monotonic material data with emphasis on using this data to\r\nsupport non-linear finite element analysis (FEA), and generation of data to support various fatigue methodologies\r\nincluding fracture mechanics and strain-life approaches will be considered.\r\nThe activity will advance discovery and understanding in the identified research areas while at the same time\r\ncreating an infrastructure promoting learning in the field of dynamic testing. To this end, dynamic testing laboratory\r\nand instruction modules have been created for courses in mechanical engineering and in mechanical and plastics\r\nengineering technology. Thus, the proposed activity will strengthen the Schools strategic initiative to foster\r\ninterdisciplinary interaction between its students and faculty.\r\n The development of the facilities  would benefit the\r\nPlastics Technology Center (PTC) outreach efforts conducted in partnership with the Northwest Pennsylvania\r\nResource Center (NWIRC) and Penn State Erie. The center provides high-end product design and development\r\nservices to business start-ups and small manufacturers. The equipment would provide the center with a\r\nconvenient internal resource for collecting plastic material data needed to support their customers and programs.\r\n Further, the facilities developed by this will be used as an additional\r\nresource to support Penn State Erie successful Math Options Program (which has currently enabled a 7% female\r\nenrollment in the School) to further the programs goal of helping prepare women for tomorrows careers in science,\r\nengineering, math, and computer technology.\r\n",
