 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this GOALI project, Carnegie Mellon proposes to develop a web-based Background Curriculum, allowing computer-aided simulation, design, modeling and prototyping skills to be transparently overlaid onto and distributed through the traditional engineering curriculum.\r\n\r\nThis proposal involves a partnership between Carnegie Mellon University, Parametric Technologies Corporation, Drexel University and Pine-Richland High School.   An objective of this project is to grow our experience base and create a readily transferable suite of web-based course modules that others can  use  to  teach  and  motivate  their  students.  Undergraduate  students  at  Carnegie  Mellon  will collaborate with faculty and develop a series of modules for use in mechanical engineering undergraduate courses.  Colleagues with expertise in assessment and cognitive psychology from the CMU Eberly Center for  Teaching  Excellence  will  assess  the  effectiveness  of  our  efforts  by  using  focus  groups,  survey instruments, and software for tracking web page use patterns.  A work product of this project will be a suite  of  freely available  web-based  course  materials  appropriate  for  use  as  a  template  for  integrating computer  modeling  and  design  skills  into  any mechanical  engineering  undergraduate  program,  and  for exposing high school students to the excitement of the mechanical engineering profession.\r\n\r\nDissemination  of  our  work  product  will  be  a  critical  aspect  of  this  project.    Carnegie  Mellon  will partner with Drexel University to integrate the web-based course modules developed at Carnegie Mellon into the Drexel curriculum.  In turn, Drexel will provide assessment and feedback data for refining and improving the  learning  modules.  High school students and the instructors in the Pine-Richland   High School   Engineering Systems course will use a subset of the web-based modules and computer-controlled prototyping hardware with the objective of exposing their students to the excitement, hardware, and tools of the mechanical engineering profession.\r\n\r\n",
