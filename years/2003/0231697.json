 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and demonstrate a novel three dimensional (3D) ear camera technology that enables audiologists to acquire multiple 3D images of external ear (auricle) and ear canal, and to produce complete 3D digital ear model that serves as a \"digital ear impression\". The digital ear impression data will be sent instantly to manufacture's lab via the Internet, dramatically reducing the delivery time. The digital impressions enable the hearing aid manufacturers to take advantages of the latest breakthrough of CAD/CAM and rapid prototyping technologies.  This technology will permit mass product customization of hearing aid devices within a one-day time frame. \r\n\r\nThe commercial potential would be a process that would drastically reduce the time for custom-fit hearing-aid devices. Even including the quality insurance, electronics calibration, and shipping, the entire process would be shorted from weeks to a few days. More importantly, the digital impression technology will improve the quality of fit, thus enhance the hearing functionality for impaired people.\r\n",
