Led by Professor Mark Hersam of the Materials Science and Engineering Department at Northwestern University, this program entitled \"NUE: Development of a Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education Global Network\" is developing an internet infrastructure for the worldwide exchange and dissemination of nanotechnology undergraduate educational ideas and materials.  Initially, a pre-existing course in nanomaterials at Northwestern University will be used as a prototype for developing modules on the NUE Global Network in collaboration with the International Virtual Institute led by Professor Robert Chang.  The nanomaterials course employs novel pedagogical techniques, including interdisciplinary problem-based learning and peer assessment, that are well-suited for undergraduate teaching and learning in the emerging field of nanotechnology.  Once the web-based interface has been formalized for this course, the NUE Global Network will be expanded to other courses at Northwestern University and other institutions of higher learning.  Ultimately, the NUE Global Network is designed to evolve into a nanotechnology educational forum that will allow educators, students, government, and industry to interact in a truly global sense.\r\n\r\n",
