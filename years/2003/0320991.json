 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant supports a high performance computational cluster to enhance the research, training, and educational activities at Delaware State University (DSU), one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The sixty-four node linux-based Xeon cluster will be capable of supporting research in the sciences at DSU and will enhance and foster collaborations with researchers at other universities as well as in industry. A diverse interdisciplinary group of faculty and students in the sciences utilizes the high performance computing platform for the following research activities: (1) Systematic studies of the challenging problems of defect properties and alloying in technologically-relevant materials using first-principles calculations; (2) Parallel data-mining algorithms, developed for use on distributed-memory parallel computers, for mining of massive data sets  in biotechnology, remote sensing and home security, precision agriculture, and  environmental sciences; (3) Novel neural network based classification tools employed to classify and determine  function-structure from MRI brain images of Alzheimer's disease patients; (4) Numerical calculations in atomic physics to study the ionization of atoms or ions by  electron impact. (5) Investigation of the optical and electronic transport properties of novel epitaxial ternary and quaternary III-V antimonide materials and SiGeCSn group IV bulk alloy layers, heterostructures, quantum-confined structures, and devices.  \r\n\r\nThe computational cluster is used in the research training and research-related education of upper-level undergraduates by engaging them in small research projects during the academic year and summer months and by the integration of parallel computing into the undergraduate science curriculum. Acquisition of this state-of-the-art equipment dramatically strengthens and increases the research productivity, while supporting the research training of undergraduate and graduate students and enhancing collaborations within academia and industry. The cluster will be utilized as a recruiting tool to attract and hire additional faculty researchers in the sciences. In addition, DSU graduates broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in the scientific community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
