 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PI proposes to explore the applicability of classical 3-dimensional \r\ntopology techniques in the study of the ``finite type\" invariants of \r\nknots and 3-manifolds. She would like to investigate the relation\r\nbetween intrinsic invariants (e.g. knot genus, satellite structures) \r\nof knots that cannot be distinguished by their finite type invariants.\r\nFor this she proposes to use the general machinery that has been developed\r\nover the years to understand how the topology of 3-manifolds changes under \r\nsurgery. The resulting work  will shed some light on how the finite type \r\nknot invariants relate to the topology of the knot complement and could\r\nlead to progress on the open  question of whether these invariants\r\ndistinguish all knots. She would also like to search for relations between \r\nthe Jones polynomial of knots and the fundamental group of the 3-manifolds\r\nobtained by Dehn surgery on knots.\r\n\r\nThe research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional topology the\r\ncentral objects of study of which are spaces called 3-manifolds. A\r\n3-manifold is an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3-dimensional\r\nspace but whose global structure can be complicated. A main goal of\r\n3-dimensional topology is to understand these structures and achieve a\r\nclassification of 3-manifolds. An important part of 3-dimensional topology\r\nis also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in\r\n3-manifolds) and their classification. One of the ways that topologists have\r\nbeen approaching these problems is through the use of ``invariants\". In the\r\nrecent years, ideas originated in physics, lead mathematicians to the\r\ndiscovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The central\r\ntheme of the PI's project is to understand the properties of these\r\ninvariants, using ideas from traditional 3-dimensional topology and from\r\nphysics, and investigate the extent to which they distinguish\r\nknots and 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\n",
