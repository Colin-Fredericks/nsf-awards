 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nSchulson\r\nOPP-0328605\r\nHibler\r\nOPP-0328728\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators describe new numerical and laboratory experiments that should elucidates the physical mechanisms that underlie the formation and  subsequent  behavior  of  failure  zones  that  form  within  the annual arctic sea ice cover. The failure zones, termed. linear kinematic features (LKFs), often occur in conjugate sets of sub-parallel faults that traverse a large fraction of the arctic basin. Upon formation, the ice cover generally dilates somewhat and subsequently oscillates, thereby enhancing transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere as well as increasing oceanic salt flux as new ice forms on open water. The LKF.s/faults most probably affect the ice thickness distribution in that, upon subsequent convergence of the ice  pack,  pressure  ridging  occurs.  The lineaments  (and other large-scale  fracture  features)  are similar  in  appearance  to  smaller-scale  compressive  shear  faults  seen  in laboratory specimens, suggesting, when the fractal character of ice breakup is also taken into account, that the physics of fracture is scale independent.   Three different sets of numerical  experiments  will  be  performed.  In the first series, idealized and numerical  grid  experiments  will  be  carried  out  to  examine  the  effect  of  different  flow  rules  on  fault formation and on the attendant weakening of the pack. In the second set, idealized spatially-varying wind forcing will be used with heterogeneous initial strength and a laboratory-generated flow rule to investigate the characteristic opening and closing of deformation faults as well as their angle of intersection. In the third series, high-resolution basin-wide modeling will be performed using a full-thickness ice distribution formulation. These simulations will be compared  with  a  variety  of  recently  acquired  deformation  data, most notably with recently declassified thickness-distribution data from upward-looking submarine sonar observations. Such comparisons will access the utility and applicability of this research to numerical air-ice-ocean models for the numerical investigation of climate. Five sets  of  systematic  biaxial  compressive  experiments  will  be  performed  in  the  laboratory  on blocks of salt-water ice.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: In focusing on the development of a scale-independent sea-ice model, particularly applicable to spatial resolutions less than 10 kilometers and to the resolution of failure zones/faults, this research represents a new paradigm for sea ice dynamics.  Under this paradigm, high internal ice stresses leading to localized fracture occur over short periods of time and rapidly decrease as a fault is formed.    This differs  significantly  from  conventional  formulations  (of  the  ice  pack  and  its  thickness distribution) which are used in current numerical investigations of climate and which implicitly assume a smoothly-varying deformation field in both time and space. The expectation is that the new model will more  realistically  capture  the  distribution  in  sea  ice  thickness  and,  thus,  will  be  more  useful  in  the numerical modeling of climate and its sensitivity to the polar sea ice cover. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research will constitute an intense intellectual enquiry carried out \r\nwith the assistance of graduate students at two universities active in polar research. It will contribute to the intellectual development of a new generation of investigators, as well as enhance the research environment of the two institutions. In addition, through the revelation and understanding of new physical effects, the study  will  enrich  both  the  undergraduate  and  graduate  teaching  of  the  Principal Investigators. The activity will contribute also to a working partnership in polar studies between Dartmouth and The University of Alaska. To enhance scientific and technical understanding, the results of the work will be disseminated broadly, through presentations to workshops and societal meetings and through contributions  to  the  technical  and  scientific  literature.  A review  article  or  book  chapter  is  also planned.   \r\n \r\n",
