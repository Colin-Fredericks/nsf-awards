 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a self-sensing piezoelectric actuator.  The piezoelectric actuator will act at the same time as the sensor that will provide information to the actuators and as its own actuator. No separate sensor is needed.   The self-sensing piezoelectric actuator uses an unconventional impedance approach for both dynamic (AC) and static (DC) force measurements By using \r\npiezoelectric materials, the load sensor will have a much wider dynamic range  than those of conventional strain gage sensor. The simplicity  in structure  and electronic circuitry have made this design inexpensive, when compared to crystal resonator pressure sensors,  and  feasible for a wide range of applications in both sensing and control industries. During Phase I, a pre-prototype self-sensing and actuating unit will be developed for the proof of concept.  A variety of targeted tests will be carried out in this phase to test and examine the accuracy and limitations of the innovation. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications include machine components; intelligent structures, intelligent self-acting machine components including bearings and  seals, high-precision positioning devices, advanced electronic \r\nconsumers goods, toys.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
