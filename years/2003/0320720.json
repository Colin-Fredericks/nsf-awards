 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the acquisition of a multipurpose ultra high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV) STM-AFM with full spectroscopic capabilities and a temperature range extending down to 25K. This equipment is critical for a multitude of nanoscience studies. The system includes several unique upgrades provided by both the manufacturer and the researchers. Included are advanced surface preparation, nanostructure formation, and surface characterization capabilities. The STM-AFM will be used in research to explore quantum dot and wire electronics and nanoscale Schottky barriers, quantum effects in molecular self-assembled nanostructures, selective reactions on atomically tailored surfaces, tribochemistry at the nanoscale, nanocrystalline semiconductors, piezoelectric and ferroelectric nanopatterned films, optical emission from nitride nanostructures, and light-induced transport effects. \r\n\r\nScanning probe systems are unique in their ability to measure materials properties at the nanometer scale. The STM is itself based on quantum mechanical tunneling to construct images with atomic scale resolution. The value of STM is increased substantially when coupled with scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques. Images of surfaces can be constructed from the atomic scale attractive and repulsive interactions between a sharp tip and a surface. This technique, termed atomic force microscopy (AFM), is substantially enhanced with electrical measurements coupled through the tip at the same time as topographic imaging is recorded. The variable temperature scanning probe system will be integrated with two other scanning probe systems to establish a laboratory for the Characterization of Nanostructure Properties. This laboratory will provide the opportunity for over thirty students and post doctoral researchers annually to be involved with research and exploratory education projects in nanoscience research. Moreover, results from the laboratory will be incorporated directly into graduate and undergraduate courses now being offered at NC State. The PIs have been active in building diversity through their recruiting of graduate students from underrepresented groups, their involvement in the NC State REU programs, which have a tradition of diverse student involvement, and through collaborations with faculty of nearby North Carolina Central University and Shaw University, both HBCUs.\r\n",
