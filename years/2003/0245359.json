Both analytic and\r\nnumerical results suggest that most of  systems fall in one of the following\r\nclasses: elliptic (quasiperiodic) and hyperbolic (exhibiting \r\nsensitive dependence on initial conditions). Systems close to elliptic systems\r\nare described by the famous Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theory. By contrast\r\nsmall perturbations of hyperbolic systems have been analyzed only\r\nin a few special cases. This proposal aims at the general perturbation\r\ntheory for hyperbolic systems. This includes both the description of the\r\nperturbed dynamics up to the certain specific times as well as computing equilibrium characteristics of the perturbed\r\nsystem. Because there is sensitive dependence on \r\ninitial conditions, it is hopeless to deal with perturbations of  individual\r\norbits. Rather, using the fact that hyperbolic systems usually have\r\nstrong stochastic properties, I will study parameter dependence of frequencies\r\nof visits to a given domain in the phase space. My previous work on \r\nstatistical properties of hyperbolic systems is essential to this project.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent years it has been understood that many systems\r\nwe encounter have chaotic behavior. On the other hand there\r\nare several models of chaotic systems which can be exactly solved, which can\r\nbe analyzed mathematically. However it can be asked how much one\r\ncould trust  predictions made on the basis of these models since \r\nthe specific features which allow us  to precisely solve these models might \r\nmake them in some sense exceptional. In particular since chaotic systems are\r\nvery sensitive to initial conditions it is conceivable that a slight\r\nchange in the parameters of the system could drastically change their\r\nbehavior. The goal of the current project is to describe the conditions\r\nwhen this drastic change does not happen. The main idea is that most\r\nchaotic systems are so complicated that changing parameters does not\r\nlead to an appearance of a new pattern of behavior but \r\nrather to changing slightly probabilities of already existing patterns.\r\n",
