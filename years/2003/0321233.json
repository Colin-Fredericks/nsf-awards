 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, from a RUI institution in an EPSCoR state, developing tools and documentation, aims at reducing the learning curve and lowering the preparatory barriers that inhibit scientists from taking advantage of multi-processor computations. The project, proposing a 100 node Beowulf cluster, is expected to:\r\na.\tAssist in the conversion of single processor applications to a parallel computational environment, and\r\nb.\tReduce learning time and code porting time for scientists to effectively utilize the computational power of multi-processor systems.\r\nThe work spans two colleges, Engineering and the Arts and Sciences, and enjoys participation across six academic departments. Various problems, including topics in hydrology, seismology, civil engineering, atmospheric fluid mechanics, oceanic currents, wave propagation, mathematics (numerical methods and solving ODE's in parallel), electromagnetics, neural networks, will be ported to the cluster and include,\r\na.\tInelastic Wave Propagation, Soil Dynamics, Soil Permeability, Atmospheric Modeling,\r\nb.\tParallel Computation, Character Recognition.\r\nc.\tHydraulic Tomography, Waveform Relaxation Methods,\r\nd.\tHigh-Energy Astrophysics, and Nanotechnology.\r\nThe interaction between a team of computer scientists, client scientists, and students should result in a user paradigm facilitating the conversion of the diverse scientific problems. The platform should serve as an asset for future research and educational activities.\r\n",
