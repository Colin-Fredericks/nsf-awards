Stephen Wilson\r\n\r\nA major international conference on homotopy theory and algebraic\r\ntopology will be held July 28 - August 1 in Kinosaki, Japan.  The\r\nconference will honor Professor Goro Nishida of Kyoto University\r\non the occasion of his 60th birthday.  Professor Nishida has been\r\nthe dominant force in algebraic topology in Japan for the last 10\r\nyears.  With his name associated with the conference,\r\nparticipants will be attracted from all over the world.  It will\r\nbe a major meeting place for mathematicians who do not normally\r\nmanage to get together.  The conference will focus on the broad\r\nrange of subjects which Professor Nishida has influenced which\r\nare still critical to today's research agenda in the field:\r\nlocalization, periodicity in homotopy theory, Morava K-theory,\r\ninfinite loop spaces, homology and cohomology operations, modular\r\nforms, group cohomology and classifying spaces.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for funding to supply transportation for\r\nresearchers from the U.S.A. to attend the conference.  The\r\nconference itself is funded by Japan including the local support\r\nof our participants.  This conference will be the major\r\ninternational conference in the field for the year 2003.\r\nDistance and cost makes it difficult for Japanese and American\r\nmathematicians to mix on a scale like this with any frequency.\r\nThis will be the biggest opportunity in over a decade (since\r\nProfessor Toda's 60th birthday conference) for many non-Japanese\r\nto attend a conference in this field in Japan.  Such an\r\nopportunity may not come again for another decade.  This grant\r\nwill allow several graduate students and recent Ph.D.s to attend.\r\nIt will also fund the largest contingent of U.S. women to ever\r\nattend a conference in our field in Japan.  In addition, it will\r\nfund some researchers who have regular contact with Japan through\r\nprevious visits and graduate students.  This contact will have a\r\nmuch broader impact on research than just the conference.\r\nParticipants will establish research relationships which will\r\nlast for many years and help stimulate more interaction.  We\r\nwould also expect to recruit numerous Japanese graduate students\r\nto come to the U.S.A.  Bringing such students abroad is difficult\r\nto arrange, and the kind of personal interactions that occur at\r\nsuch conferences speed up the process enormously. The presence of\r\na cadre of Japanese students with research experience in the USA\r\nis enormously important for scientific exchange in the long run.\r\n",
