The proposer will study these groups and their relation \r\nto a number of  important and long-standing problems in modern mathematics, \r\nsuch as the Burnside and Milnor Problems in Group Theory, Atiyah \r\nConjecture in Topology, Kadison-Kaplansky Conjecture in Functional Analysis. \r\nThe results obtained in this project have useful applications in Cybernetics \r\nand Computer Science, as well as Cryptography and Theory of Algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombinatorial Group Theory is one of the most rapidly developing parts \r\nof modern mathematics. Starting with works by Poincare and Klein this \r\narea received contribution from some of the most prominent \r\nmathematicians of the twentieth century, such as von Neumann, Milnor and \r\nothers. In recent decades Combinatorial Group Theory became an object of \r\nespecially intensive research due to newly found connections with \r\nStatistical Physics, Quantum Chaos Theory and Computer Science. New \r\npromising directions of mathematical research have been developped, one \r\nof them being the theory of branch groups. This theory has strong \r\nconnections to several mainstream open problems in modern mathematics. \r\nTremendous progress acheived in recent years indicates that the \r\nexploration of these connections leads to most fruitful ideas and results.\r\n",
