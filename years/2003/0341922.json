 "awd_abstract_narration": "IMC is the primary venue for presenting new research results on collecting and analyzing mea-surements\r\nof the Internet. Last year's workshop, held in Marseille, France, had more than 100\r\nattendees, with a waiting list of additional people wishing to participate.\r\nThis proposal requests funding to aid graduate students enrolled in institutions in the United\r\nStates in attending this premiere conference. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount\r\nimportance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have the opportunity\r\nto present their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with many others performing\r\nleading-edge research in the field.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposal will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet\r\nMeasurement Conference, raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration,\r\nnew investigations, and higher quality research.\r\nBroader Impact: This proposal, by enabling students to attend who might not otherwise\r\nbe able, will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more\r\ndiverse audience. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we hope\r\nto widen the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a\r\nwide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should\r\nbe able to attend and benefit from the conference.",
