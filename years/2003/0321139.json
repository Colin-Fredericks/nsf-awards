 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Knox College under the direction of Dr.\r\nJanet Kirkley to acquire a real-time thermal cycler and fluorometer.  This\r\nequipment will enable Knox College faculty and students to perform quantitative\r\npolymerase chain reaction (QPCR).  This technique has a wide variety of\r\napplications, and access to QPCR will enhance undergraduate research,\r\neducation, and training.  Because of the ease and speed of QPCR, students will\r\nbe able to answer more sophisticated questions directed at understanding how\r\ncells function at the molecular level.  This equipment will replace older, more\r\ntime-intensive methods as well as provide new research capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will be used by undergraduate student researchers and\r\ntheir faculty mentors to: 1) study how temperature regulates the activation of\r\nmacrophage cells, which promote inflammation; 2) investigate the role of the\r\nprotein intersectin in the development of the frog Xenopus laevis; and, 3)\r\naddress structure-function relationships in the bacterial GrpE protein.\r\nStudents will use this equipment in the context of ongoing research projects.\r\nOther techniques can be developed using the real-time capability of the thermal\r\ncycler, and Knox faculty and students will be encouraged to incorporate use of\r\nthis versatile equipment in their research programs.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will substantially enhance undergraduate research and\r\neducation at Knox College.  It will allow students to explore complex molecular\r\nevents in cells, leading to a greater understanding of the molecular processes\r\nnecessary to sustain life.  Preparation for careers in science will also be\r\nenhanced by students acquiring skills in QPCR, a valuable, cutting edge, widely\r\napplicable technique.",
