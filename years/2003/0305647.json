The objectives of the project are to study the molecular controls for vegetative growth of plants using tuberization of potato as a model.  The project will identify potential connections between source and target in this signaling pathway, and the mechanism for signal transmission from leaf to the target apical meristem.   The project will focus on microarray analysis in both source and target organs exposed to inductive conditions over discrete developmental stages. \r\n\r\nThe US researcher brings to the collaboration expertise in the role of transcription factors and their interacting partners in regulating cell growth in target organs of a signaling pathway.  This is complemented by the Spanish researcher's expertise in the mechanism of light perception, signal production, and transport inherent in the source organ.  The Spanish group has leading expertise in photoperiodic regulation and the role of phytohormones in development.   The results of the collaboration are expected to an improved understanding of signaling mechanisms that would optimize growth in a significant world food crop.  \r\n",
