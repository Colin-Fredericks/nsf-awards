 "awd_abstract_narration": "This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) for engineering services to the United States Antarctic Program's (USAP).  \r\n\r\nThe following tasks are included: \r\n\r\nSupport to USAP\r\nPerform review, oversight, and short-notice, limited scope engineering tasks, including written comments or letter reports in response to taskings.  $32,800.\r\n\r\nReview and Engineering Critique of Polar Drill Development\r\nProvide polar-specific engineering and logistics critique and review to the USAP drill development contractor.  $30,500.\r\n\r\nSafe Sea-Ice Thickness for Vehicle Travel\r\nDevelop an engineering-based and generalized set of guidelines to govern vehicle travel on sea ice.  $43,400.\r\n\r\nWind Turbine Induced Seismic Noise\r\nDetermine the vibration emitted by commercial wind turbines and investigate whether this source of noise would affect the performance of the Global Seismic Network (GSN) station QSPA operating at the South Pole.  Phase I is estimated at $65,400.\r\n\r\nETL for USAP Runways\r\nExpand the Air Force protocol developed for the Pegasus runway to address the sea ice runway and skiways and establish a draft ETL for routine runway evaluation and AF certification of the sea ice runway.  $34,000.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo to South Pole Traverse Development\r\nCollaborate with USAP and other specialists and experts to address engineering issues pertinent to traverse development, including:  GPR training, surveys and analysis; assistance on route selection and refinement; and performance evaluation of traverse vehicles.  $343,700.  \r\n\r\nSimilar services have been provided by CRREL and their contractors for many years.  The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional.  It is expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner.  CRREL is a government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor.  CRREL has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict of interest.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for CRREL to continue with the ongoing tasking.  This award is recommended for the amount of $549,800 as estimated by CRREL to be funded from operations funds.  \r\n\r\n",
