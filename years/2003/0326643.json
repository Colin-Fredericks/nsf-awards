 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The purpose of this project is to provide financial assistance to\r\nengineering students to attend the 2003 American Control Conference (ACC 2003),\r\nsponsored by the American Automatic Control Council. The focus of the conference will\r\ncenter on theoretical issues, engineering methodologies, and industrial applications in all\r\nareas of control research and development.\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to expose students to current advances in control\r\ntheory and applications. As part of a new initiative, the PI will organize student-oriented\r\nsessions for ACC 2002 to help these future professional engineers prepare for their\r\ncareers. Travel support for student attendees, in the form of ACC 2003 Student Travel\r\nGrants, will be advertised nationally. Women, minorities, and disabled students will be\r\nespecially encouraged to apply.\r\nBroader Impacts resulting from the Proposed Activity: Graduate students who\r\nattend the conference and participate in the student-oriented activities are likely to\r\npursue careers in the field of control theory and its applications.",
