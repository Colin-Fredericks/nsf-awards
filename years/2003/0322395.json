 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivation for studying walking robots arises from diverse sociological and commercial\r\ninterests, ranging from the desire to replace humans in hazardous occupations, to the restoration of\r\nmotion in the disabled, the possibility of using legged locomotion in terrain that is unsuitable for\r\nwheeled locomotion, and the psychological appeal of machines that operate in anthropomorphic or\r\nanimal-like ways. Feedback control is an integral part of achieving bipedal locomotion.\r\nControl system design for biped robots poses numerous challenges due to the many degrees of\r\nfreedom in the mechanisms, the intermittent and unilateral nature of the contact conditions with\r\nthe environment, and underactuation. The most technologically advanced biped robots today are\r\nwalking on the basis of a heuristic control principle that imposes a flat-footed walking motion in\r\norder to avoid dealing with the underactuation that comes with foot rotation (i.e., toe roll and\r\nheel strike). Professor Grizzle's research will develop the analytical foundations of walking with an\r\nanthropomorphic gait. By not relying on heuristics, significantly improved feedback controllers will\r\nbe designed that allow the natural rotation of the foot during the stance phase of walking, while\r\nstill guaranteeing stability of the walking motion. Beyond a certain speed, walking is no longer\r\nefficient (or even possible). The extremely challenging problem of controlling a running motion\r\nof a bipedal robot will be investigated, both theoretically and experimentally. These results will\r\ngreatly enhance the ability to design machines that can perform human-like tasks. Another portion\r\nof the research will look at controlling a robot with a passive knee (active damping but otherwise\r\nunactuated), analogous to walking with a modern prosthetic.\r\nProfessor Grizzle is actively engaged in undergraduate and graduate student education. NSF\r\nsupport of this research proposal is enhancing the research and education infrastructure at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan through the construction of a biped robot prototype. The robot affords\r\nexperimental facilities and numerous projects for students. This research grant provides for the\r\ntraining of one PhD student, and a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) supplement to\r\nthis grant will provide a meaningful research experience for two undergraduate students. Special\r\nattention is being paid to recruiting at least one of these students from an underrepresented group.\r\nProfessor Grizzle is also more broadly sharing the excitement of a research career in engineering\r\nby making presentations on bipedal walking robots to undergraduate student groups, and high\r\nschool students. On the basis of his research findings in biped robot locomotion control, Professor\r\nGrizzle is forging research relationships with colleagues in neurology and rehabilitation. His goal\r\nis to transfer the deeper understanding of bipedal posture and locomotion that is resulting from\r\nthe study of robots, to the development of improved rehabilitation therapies for a class of patients\r\nwho have suffered strokes or spinal cord injuries.\r\nThe research findings of this grant are maintained on Professor Grizzle's web site; see above for\r\nthe URL.",
