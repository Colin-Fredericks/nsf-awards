 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert Waymouth of Stanford University will develop a new kinetic strategy for the synthesis of olefin polymers of defined sequence distribution. A specific objective is to prepare and study new coordination compounds that can present multiple coordination sites or kinetic states for olefin insertion. Professor Waymouth's approach for these studies is to design coordination complexes that can interconvert between two or more kinetic states during the course of the polymerization reaction, with each state having a different stereoselectivity or kinetic selectivity toward the comonomers. The interconversion of the coordination complexes will be examined for the preparation of strereoblock polymers, block copolymers, copolymers and alternating copolymers. The current state of understanding does not allow the prediction, a priori, of how the structure of a given coordination compound will influence its kinetic selectivity towards two different monomers; thus an important objective of the proposed studies is to develop a better understanding of the relationship of catalyst structure to copolymerization behavior.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Robert Waymouth whose research effort will engage students in a highly interdisciplinary research area that combines organic and organometallic synthesis, catalytic olefin polymerization, and analysis of polymer structure and properties. The focus is on fundamental patterns of catalytic reactivity, but this research program is in an important area of technology and many students are highly sought by companies working in the areas spanning catalysis, polyolefin manufacturing, materials chemistry and nanotechnology. Professor Waymouth has been successful in licensing technologies to interested industrial partners that were initiated with NSF funding, leading, in one case, to a major NIST award to BP Amoco. Additional objectives include continuing to recruit outstanding female students and mentoring both graduate and undergraduate women students, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in industry.\r\n",
