 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports the US-India Workshop: Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry and Combinatorics, India, December 2003.  Professors Hema Srinivasan, University of Missouri and Verma Jugal, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay are the organizers of this two-part workshop.  The first segment, a combinatorial and computational algebra school, will take place at the Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Allahabad, December 8-13, 2003; a complementary second segment is a special session of the Joint Meeting of the American and Indian Mathematical Societies, Bangalore, December 16-20, 2003, which focuses on mainstream commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  The objective is to bring together researchers and students in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and combinatorics to develop closer interactions among research groups in the U.S. and India working on related problems.  The computational school and the special session on Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are designed for young/junior scientists to learn new techniques and to present research results to their peers.  \r\nScope:  India mathematicians have made significant contributions in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.  This activity will be valuable for the professional development of both junior and senior scientists and will open doors for future interactions, collaborations, and learning. .  Full support is provided for the workshop organizers and for 12 young scientists; partial support is provided for senior mathematicians and recognized leaders in the field.  The NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences is providing cofunding for this workshop.",
