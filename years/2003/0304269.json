This project focuses on the development of course and laboratory modules related to the study of nanotechnologies and systems.  An interdisciplinary project team involving faculty and researchers from industrial/manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and mathematics will be involved in this initiative.  They include New Mexical State University, Dona Ana Branch Community College, Xomics USA, NIST, Sandia National Lab, and Monterrey Tech ITESM Monterrey, Mexico..",
