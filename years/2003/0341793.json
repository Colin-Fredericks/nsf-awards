 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to design and optimize water-in-oil droplet emulsions using novel microfluidic devices with sub-femtoliter volume control and rapid generation rates (>1000 drops/sec). To achieve these goals, we will investigate the nanoscale interfacial forces that control droplet generation, droplet fission, droplet fusion, and intra-droplet mixing/reactions, with and without the presence of amphiphilic molecules. Preliminary results demonstrate microfluidic devices capable of controlling the local shear forces between oil and water interfaces to generate nanojets for droplet emulsions (nanoDEs). These devices generated monodispersed droplet emulsions (0.5m-50m diameter) at high rates (100 drops/sec) corresponding to the input flow rates. Our target is to generate droplet emulsions 100 nm in diameter and droplet generation rates greater than 1,000 drops/sec. In contrast to what has currently been done by others, the proposed research aims to devise new techniques and platforms for forming each individual vesicle with complete nanoscale control of parameters in order to \"program\" its size, shape, compositional structure, and ultimately its functions and properties.\r\n\r\nDeliverables for the project include new instrumentation for directed self-assembly of amphiphilic vesicles (AV), new methods to precisely control nanoscale self-assembly process, new characterization methods and tools to monitor vesicle interactions and reactions, the design of new manufacturing processes to implement biological cell machinery in the artificial \"transporter vesicles\", and understanding of interfacial tension hydrodynamic flow for droplet/vesicle self-assembly.\r\n\r\nThe grant will also make an impact on infrastructure for research and education. The new equipment from this grant and other required existing instruments for the project will be housed in the soon-to-be built building for the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Cal-(IT)2).\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the PI intends to introduce a \"Freshman Seminars\" course to promote nanobiotechnology to incoming freshmen. This will have the broader impact in attracting future new US citizens as well as underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in nano science and engineering.\r\n",
