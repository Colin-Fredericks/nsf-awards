 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maize is a major crop in the U.S. and a classical genetic system, particularly well suited for cytogenetics. Its genome is divided among 10 chromosomes, and gene locations can be charted in one of three fundamentally different ways-analysis of trait linkage for a genetic map, DNA sequence determination for a physical map, and microscopic visualization for a cytogenetic map.  Integration of the three map types in fruit flies and humans has proven to accelerate genetic research.  The production of a similar trio of integrated maps for maize would advance understanding of the genetic material of one of the world's most important cereal crops.\r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of recent advances in cytogenetics and new plant genomic resources from other NSF Plant Genome Research Program projects.  The goal is to produce a cytogenetic map of the entire maize genome.  The rapid and cost-efficient method this project will employ is to use segments of sorghum DNA (maize-marker-selected sorghum BAC clones) as probes to stain the corresponding regions on maize chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  The results will be integrated with other genome maps and released immediately into GenBank and MaizeGDB for public access.  The project will advance downstream research by aiding in physical map assembly, establishing new reagents for chromosome research, and providing insights into the evolution of maize and related grasses.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables for this project will be the development of FISH mapping tools and the placing of  500  loci on the cytogenetic map of the maize genome. \r\n\r\nA local outreach project, the Maize 10 Maze project, will use the new cytogenetic map to guide the production of a field replicate of the maize genome in which individual rows represent single chromosomes. This self-guided public tour of the maize genome will raise public awareness of how plant genome research can benefit society, relating genome research to issues of public interest such as food production, plant biology, renewable energy, and genetic diversity.\r\n",
