 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support the attendance and participation of graduate students in the Fifth International Conference on Boiling Heat Transfer in May of 2003.  This is a well-established conference that involves the most productive researchers presenting the most advanced work in the field of boiling.  The topic continues to be crucially important in the thermal transport arena, especially in the areas of microscale phenomena.  The proposed participation of 14 students wll be restricted to currently enrolled graduate students attending universities in the United States who are co-authors of a paper being presented at the conference.  The requested support will help to promote the goals of the conference through NSF participation.  It will also foster the professional development of the next generation of boiling and two-phase flow researchers in the thermal transport community.",
