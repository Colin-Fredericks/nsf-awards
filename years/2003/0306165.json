 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award supports a project with the goal of gaining an increased understanding of the hybrid rutheno-cuprates magnetic superconductors known as Ru-1212 and Ru-1222, by means of measurements of transport, magnetic, and thermal properties in extreme conditions of magnetic field and pressure.  The crystal structure of these materials is derived from the structure of the high-Tc superconductor YBa(2)Cu3O(7-x) (Tc near 90 K).  A unique feature of these rutheno-cuprates is that the superconducting state below 45 K coexists with the weak ferromagnetism established at higher temperatures.  Although these layered materials are quasi-two-dimensional from a crystallography point of view, both the magnetic and superconducting orders are three-dimensional, which suggests that the Ru-O magnetic layers couple through the Cu-O layers, while the superconducting Cu-O layers couple through the Ru-O magnetic layers.  These experiments will permit a better understanding of these intriguing magnetic superconductors. This project will create unique research, educational, and mentoring opportunities for the undergraduate and Masters degree students at this institution.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to carry out an experimental study of the hybrid rutheno-cuprates magnetic superconductors, by means of measurements of electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties in very high magnetic fields and pressures.  These materials are structurally similar to the high-temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu3O(7-x), which shows zero electrical resistance below 90 K.  A truly intriguing feature of these rutheno-cuprates is that the magnetic order coexists with superconductivity below 45 K.  Although coexistence of these two phenomena is very rare, studies of such materials have lead to many important findings in the past.  Since the rutheno-cuprates are layered materials, it is conceivable that the reason superconductivity and magnetic order coexist is that the coupling between the superconducting Cu-O layers and the magnetic Ru-O layers is weak.  The experiments proposed will permit a better understanding of these quite unusual magnetic superconductors.  This project will create unique research, educational, and mentoring opportunities for the undergraduate and Masters degree students at this institution.\r\n",
