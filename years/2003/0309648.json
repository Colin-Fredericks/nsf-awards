It also addresses problems in\r\nincompressible fluid mechanics and general relativity, and applies the\r\nresults to a variety of important physical problems. A common theme of\r\nmuch of the proposed work is how nonlinearity leads to the formation\r\nand propagation of various kinds of singularities, such as shock waves\r\nin compressible fluids, or space-time singularities in general\r\nrelativity. Specific topics proposed for study are the following:\r\nshock wave reflection; shock wave propagation in random media;\r\nnonlinear hyperbolic surface waves in elasticity and\r\nmagnetohydrodynamics; the Prandtl boundary layer equations and\r\nvorticity wave, mean flow interactions in incompressible fluid\r\nmechanics; and the effect of nonlinearity on gravitational waves in\r\ngeneral relativity.\r\n\r\nWaves (such as sound waves, seismic waves, light waves, quantum\r\nmechanical waves,or gravitational waves) are a central feature of many\r\nphysical systems, from the atomic to the cosmological scales. At lower\r\nintensities, waves superpose and they may be described by linear\r\ntheories, but at higher intensities nonlinear effects becomes\r\nsignificant, leading to qualitatively new phenomena (like shock waves\r\nand solitons). Nonlinear waves are much more difficult to analyse\r\nmathematically than linear waves, and are often of great practical\r\nimportance. For example, shock waves form around aircraft that travel\r\nclose to the speed of sound. One aim of this project is to study\r\nbasic, but not fully understood, shock wave phenomena, such as their\r\nreflection from walls. Among other topics, the project also includes a\r\nstudy of nonlinear surface waves, such as the Rayleigh waves which are\r\ngenerated by earthquakes and are used in a variety of ultrasonic\r\ndevices, and a study of the formation and propagation of space-time\r\nsingularities in gravitational waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
