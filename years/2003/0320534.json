 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this grant, the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez will acquire a magnetic property measurement system that will support research and education \r\nefforts in nanotechnology and materials science and engineering. The system, based on a superconducting  interference device, will allow accurate determination of direct current magnetic properties (including magnetic anisotropy) of magnetic powders and films, as well as bulk materials. The \r\nequipment will allow characterization of novel magnetically-active materials \r\nsuch as magnetic nanoparticle suspensions and powders, soft and hard ferrites, metal and alloyed metallic nanoparticles, diluted magnetic semiconductors, and magnetically-active thin films. These materials have applications as novel magnetically-active colloidal extractants, in-vivo imaging agents, targeted magnetic carriers, magnetic cell sorters, sensors, high-density recording media, spintronic based systems, and components for microelectromechanical and \r\nnanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS). The magnetization measurement capabilities and functionalities afforded by the magnetic property measurement system are truly unique and will serve to enhance ongoing and future research efforts in nanotechnology and materials science and engineering at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez. Furthermore, there are no \r\nsimilar devices available in Puerto Rico, making acquisition of the \r\nrequested instrument a vital step in furthering the university's research goals, as well as a valuable addition to the Puerto Rico research infrastructure.  There is a strong link between the university and several Minority Serving Institutions through the Nanoscale Interactions, Structures, and Applications Center. \r\n",
