 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for\r\nnumerically solving hyperbolic conservation and balance laws,\r\nHamilton-Jacobi equations, and related problems. Such schemes are not\r\ntied to the specific eigen-structure of the problem, and hence can be\r\nimplemented in a straightforward manner for a wide variety of nonlinear\r\nequations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient\r\nphenomena. This project aims to further improve the family of Godunov-type central\r\nschemes, recently developed by Kurganov et al. The main ideas behind the\r\nconstruction of the new, less dissipative central schemes are to use\r\nmore precise estimate of the smooth and nonsmooth parts of the solution\r\nby considering non-rectangular control volumes; to use a more accurate\r\nprojection of the evolved data onto the original, non-staggered grid;\r\nand to avoid the loss of information when very accurate fully-discrete\r\nschemes are reduced to a much simpler semi-discrete form.\r\nThe second main goal of the project is the application of central schemes\r\nto various multi-phase and multi-fluid flow models, the Saint-Venant\r\nsystems of shallow water equations (which describe flows in rivers and\r\ncoastal areas), multi-layer shallow water systems, models of transport of\r\npollutant in shallow water, the Euler equations of gas dynamics subject\r\nto a static gravitational field, chemotaxis models, reactive flows (in\r\nparticular, the models describing stiff detonation waves), extended\r\nthermodynamics, shallow water equations on a rotating sphere, acoustic\r\nwave propagation, heterogeneous elasticity, granular material flows.\r\nNaturally, these applications involve multiple space dimensions, complex\r\ngeometries and moving boundaries/interfaces, This would require further\r\ndevelopment of the theory and implementation of central schemes. In\r\nparticular, semi-discrete central schemes on unstructured and triangular\r\nmeshes will be derived, and different adaptive techniques will be\r\nincorporated into the central framework.\r\n\r\nRecent development of modern technology requires reliable, efficient,\r\nhigh-resolution methods for solving time-dependent partial differential \r\nequations (PDEs), including multidimensional systems of hyperbolic\r\nconservation and balance laws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and related\r\nproblems. In the past decade, a family of simple, universal,\r\nRiemann-solver-free finite volume central schemes has proven to be\r\nan appealing alternative to the more complicated and problem oriented\r\nupwind schemes. The advantages of central schemes are particularly\r\nprominent when they are used to solve complicated multidimensional\r\nsystems of PDEs arising in such important fields including fluid\r\nmechanics, gas dynamics, geophysics, meteorology, magnetohydrodynamics,\r\nastrophysics, multi-component flows, granular flows, reactive flows,\r\nsemiconductors, non-Newtonian flows, geometric optics, traffic flow,\r\nimage processing, financial, biological modeling, differential games,\r\nand optimal control. This project is focused on the further development and improvement of\r\ncentral schemes, and on their practical applications. The new central\r\nschemes will be incorporated into a general-purpose adaptive mesh\r\nrefinement (AMR) and adaptive moving mesh (AMM) codes, which will be\r\nfreely accessible for the scientific and industrial communities. These\r\ncodes will serve as a reliable and robust \"black-box-solver\" for a\r\nrather comprehensive class of time-dependent PDEs.\r\n",
