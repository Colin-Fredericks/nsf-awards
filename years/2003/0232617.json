 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research high bandwidth individualized wireless network (IWN) which is personalized to maximize flexibility and capability for individual users and minimize interference, crosstalk and extraneous information. A wireless network will be established which uses a standard protocol like IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet standard or the Bluetooth standard. Talking Lights optical selection technology will allow users to select among transmitted signals, personalize the transmission for individual users, provide CART captions and permit assisted conversations.\r\nThe system will be developed in connection with experts on education of deaf and hard of hearing students and will be evaluated and tested in schools specializing in education of the handicapped to maximize user friendliness and value. \r\n\r\nAnticipated Results and Commercial Applications: As a result of this project, a new technology for communication of information will be developed which enhances the capability of wireless networks. A single network will be able to carry a broad variety of information. Modified IWN ballast transformers will be commercial products sold to replace current ballast transformers and allow fluorescent lights to perform dual use as locators. IWN optical will be commercial products sold to users. The software used to enable optical control of the wireless network will be a commercial product. Once installed, the modulated light sys-tem can also be used for assistance to hearing impaired and visually impaired users, assisted audio, direction finding, description of exhibits and many other applications\r\n",
