 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a high-power Terahertz (THz) source concept and an overall THz system definition for fabrication and testing under a subsequent Phase II program. THz electromagnetic radiation, in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 THz, is the next frontier in imaging science and technology. THz radiation promises to find broad application in areas that embrace\r\nmedical imaging, counter terrorism and homeland security, and land mine detection. New initiatives and advanced technology developments in the THz band have, to date, been very limited because, while potentially rich, the source technology, at least for high-power applications such as imaging, has not been developed. A unique and extremely high power THz source that is orders of magnitude brighter in average power than previous source technologies, thereby enabling rapid, wide field-of-view (FOV) THz imaging for the first time will be developed.  The resultant source coupled with a detector system can in principle be used for rapid, nondestructive, stand-off detection of hidden weapons, contraband materials such as plastic explosives, and chemical and biological agents.\r\n\r\nBy developing and demonstrating a novel, compact, high-power THz source, this research seeks to capitalize on an emerging capability to utilize THz radiation for non-destructive evaluation. Potential applications include but are not limited to: walkthrough portals for personnel screening, through-wall imaging for emergency personnel, stand-off explosive and contraband detection, land mine detection for humanitarian relief, crowd and material screening.\r\n",
