 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0138440\r\nJames R. Arvo\r\n\r\nThe most familiar principle of geometrical optics asserts \r\nthat a ray of light impinging on an ideal mirror will emerge \r\nin such a way that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.    The trajectory of a photon (or a billiard ball, \r\nusing another common metaphor), is thus completely determined \r\nby its initial conditions and the geometry of the mirrors it subsequently encounters.  The geometry of such trajectories \r\nhas been of interest in numerous fields, including plane \r\ngeometry, computational geometry, and computer graphics, \r\nyet they comprise a vanishingly small subset (a set of \r\nmeasure zero) within the class of all optical paths that \r\nfall within the purview of geometrical optics.  In particular, \r\noptical paths resulting from non-specular reflections \r\nconstitute a vastly larger class. Moreover, they are of far \r\ngreater importance to image synthesis as they result from \r\nphysically realizable models of reflection.  Nonetheless, \r\nnon-specular paths have thus far been largely overlooked as \r\na source of interesting geometrical problems. The main \r\nobjective of this research is therefore to launch an\r\ninitial investigation into the basic geometrical properties \r\nof non-specular optical paths, both in the traditional \r\ncombinatorial  sense, such as finding a optimal paths \r\nconnecting two points, and in the continuous sense, such \r\ns finding extremal paths, or computing the measure of all \r\nk-segment paths connecting two regions.  A secondary \r\nobjective is to explore connections with probabilistic \r\nmethods, such as standard Monte Carlo visibility techniques \r\nand Metropolis light transport, which will likely be the \r\nfirst direct beneficiaries of this work.\r\n\r\nThis work is expected to contribute primarily to the\r\nmathematical foundations of image synthesis by identifying\r\noptical paths as interesting geometrical entities in \r\nthemselves, and by exposing some of their fundamental \r\nproperties in terms of density, measure, and computational \r\ncomplexity.  Moreover, it is expected that this new \r\nperspective will ultimately be instrumental in studying \r\nthe accuracy and computational complexity of realistic \r\nimage synthesis in general, about which very little is \r\nknown currently.  While the problems investigated here \r\nwill invariably have much in common with previous work on\r\ndirect and indirect illumination problems in computational\r\ngeometry, the approaches taken will have a distinctly more\r\ncontinuous flavor, drawing heavily from fields such as \r\nmeasure theory, differential geometry, and geometric \r\nprobability. Finally, it is expected that this work will \r\nserve as a segue into a longer-term investigation of \r\ncomputational complexity in computer graphics by \r\nestablishing basic tools and connections with other disciplines.\r\n",
