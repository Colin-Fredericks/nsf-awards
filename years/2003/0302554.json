 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with investigating the feasibility of developing a new class of sensors.The\r\ntarget application of these sensors is semiconductor manufacturing.The common theme shared by\r\nthis class of sensors is that they are based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).EIT is an\r\nin vivo imaging technology that has found widespread use in biomedical applications, but its use\r\nin semiconductor manufacturing applications as suggested in this proposal is novel.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nSemiconductor manufacturing is a vital industrial engine that continues to drive worldwide eco-\r\nnomic growth.The next generation of integrated electronics calls for the reliable and cost-effective\r\nmanufacture of 0 .13 micron linewidth circuits across large 300 mm substrates.It is widely recog-\r\nnized that sensors will play a vital role in realizing this objective,by providing the means to optimize\r\nprocess parameters,engineer more complex equipment,and by enabling integrated process control.\r\nThe proposed research offers the possibility of in situ sensors for monitoring processing conditions at\r\nthe wafer surface during semiconductor processing.The EIT based sensors that will be developed\r\nin this work can offer unprecedented spatial resolution with modest cost-of-ownership.These\r\nsensors would enable rapid equipmen diagnostics,recipe optimization,and eventually closed-loop\r\nequipmen control.Effectively,this would lead to improved yield,time-to-yield,and throughput.\r\nThe proposed research is the seed componen in this overall vision.\r\nFinally,and most importantly,is the immediate and direct impact of the proposed work in bring-\r\ning students uniquely versatile in both hardware and system aspects to the semiconductor industry.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is its novelty.The proposed work is interdisciplinary in\r\nnature,bringing techniques and ideas from biomedical applications to the semiconductor industry.\r\nThis will require the imaginative blend of analytical ideas with hardware design.\r\nSensors are traditionally viewed as stand alone hardware components.The proposed work takes\r\na more nuanced approach where the systems aspect of sensors is vital to their function.The\r\nparticular tomography problems that arise in the context of this proposal are novel and will require\r\ninnovative analytical approaches.In contrast with biomedical tomography,the objects being imaged\r\n(the proposed sensors)have the luxury of being optimized.The medical analogue is that of being\r\nable to arrange bones,organs,and tissue in positions that are favorable to the imaging technique.\r\nFirst principles analysis will permit the design of the proposed sensors for optimal sensitivity.",
