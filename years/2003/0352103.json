 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference is aimed at developing an international dialogue on systemic educational reform.  The dialogue will advance discovery and understanding of educational reform, while promoting teaching, training and learning. The initiative will be used to analyze and compare various learning models and pedagogic approaches to science and mathematics teaching, with the long-term aim of improving mathematics and science achievement at the K-12 level.\r\n\r\nThe conference will develop new research strategies and partners at the national and international level, who will link the systemic reform efforts in the US in context with similar efforts around the world. The dialogue between UNESCO representatives and staff from education and science divisions and the US science and mathematics communities will be renewed and strengthened. \r\n\r\nResults of the conference will be published both in print form and on the AAS website. Alliances developed through the conference among university-based academics, policy-makers in development agencies and school-based science and math educators will help bridge the gap between the research produced by development agencies and that produced for academic audiences. The conference would be an important step towards establishing closer dialogue, identifying potential collaborative efforts, and promoting internal reforms to improve science and math education around the world.\r\n",
