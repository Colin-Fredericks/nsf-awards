 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program focuses on the organosulfur chemistry of natural products isolated from plants with insecticidal, agricultural, or medicinal value, and whose organoleptic properties imply the presence of organosulfur derivatives other than the ubiquitous sulfur containing compounds such as cysteine and methionine. Major objectives include 1) isolation and characterization of novel potentially useful gamma-glutamyl cysteines, 2) C-S lyase crystallization, structure determination, and mechanistic study, 3) assessment of the variety of cysteine sulfoxide precursors responsible for organosulfur headspace volatiles observed in selected plants, 4) chemotaxonomic classification of plant species, 5) determination of the lachrymatory principle(s) in plants, 6) thiosulfinate chemistry and optical activity, 7) determination of formation pathways of observed organosulfur natural products, and 8) synthesis and characterization of observed novel compounds. A three-pronged approach to integrate teaching and education will be taken, involving a K-12 scientific outreach program, mentorship at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and pedagogical innovations in teaching and research.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Rabi Musah, of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York, Albany, is exploring the chemistry of sulfur-containing natural products. Garlic is the best-characterized organosulfur containing plant. It has become increasingly evident that other plants possess considerably different organosulfur chemical makeups. Given the rich diversity of compounds and chemistry observed in garlic and onions, it is likely that numerous other novel compounds with interesting and important chemical and biological properties are present in other plants. Through a variety of integrated approaches, Professor Musah will explore the isolation, characterization, and attendant chemistry and biochemistry of organosulfur products from natural sources. In addition, Professor Musah will develop a K-12 scientific outreach program and implement a mentorship program at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",
