 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n  Who gets what?. is a central question of political contestation in the United States and \r\naround the world.  Answers to this question can come in a variety of forms.  For example, the \r\nCivil Rights movement in the United States was about what rights would be given to African \r\nAmericans, and the abortion debate concerns the values government will authoritatively enforce.  \r\nBut at its heart, .Who gets what?. is a question of material well-being.  Essentially, the question \r\nis .Who gets the money?. \r\n  An empirical answer to this question is available in the distribution of income, or income \r\ninequality.  Income inequality, then, is a key outcome of any political-economic system, and a \r\ngreat deal of research in economics, sociology, and political science has focused on explaining \r\nthis outcome.  Previous research has shown that changes in labor markets, the demographic \r\ncomposition of populations, and wage-setting institutions help to determine income inequality.  \r\nThis project examines these factors, but goes beyond by focusing on how government acts to \r\ninfluence inequality in the United States. \r\n  Research in political science has suggested that the primary mechanism through which \r\ngovernments influence distributional outcomes is direct redistribution . taxing the wealthy to \r\nprovide benefits for the middle and lower classes (Bradley et al. 2003; Hibbs and Dennis 1988; \r\nPage and Simmons 2000).  The first component of the analysis in this project builds on the \r\ncurrent state of knowledge by using aggregate time series data to test the connection between the \r\nideological tone of policy and government.s redistributive effect.  Previous studies have used \r\npartisan control of government as a proxy for policy.  In the context of a country like the United \r\nStates, where party discipline is comparatively weak, partisan control is a noisy indicator of the \r\nideological content of policy.  This project provides for more robust analysis by explicitly \r\nexamining the policies considered and enacted by government.  The findings obtained thus far \r\nsuggest that liberal shifts in policy cause increases in redistribution. \r\nThe second component of this project considers a relatively unexplored mechanism \r\nthrough which government can influence distributional outcomes . manipulation of economic \r\nopportunity.  Almost every type of government activity, from environmental or corporate \r\nregulation to defense spending, enhances economic opportunities for some groups to the \r\nexclusion of others.  Inequality is influenced to the extent that the rich or poor are \r\ndisproportionately advantaged by these activities.  This project assesses the distributional \r\ninfluence of government manipulation of economic opportunity by analyzing the connection \r\nbetween government policy and inequality before taxes and transfers.  Initial analysis suggests \r\nthat policy influences inequality as much through manipulation of economic opportunity as \r\nthrough redistribution. \r\n  The final component of this project consists of interviewing policy elites and requires \r\nadditional funding for its successful completion.  More specifically, funding of this project would \r\nprovide the ability to reside in Washington, D.C. for approximately four months to conduct \r\ninterviews of political appointees, high-level civil servants, and interest group leaders whose \r\nactivities influence distributional policy making and implementation.  Given that the question \r\n.Who gets what?. is so politically central, distributional considerations are likely central to the \r\nthinking of policy elites, and many may have sophisticated conceptions of how government \r\nactivity influences distributional outcomes.  This part of the project would aid in understanding \r\nthe degree to which policy elites consider distributional outcomes when defining policy options \r\nand crafting national policy, as well as inform the empirical aspects of the project.",
