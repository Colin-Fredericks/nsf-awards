He will also study stacks and gerbes from the\r\nviewpoint of differentiable geometry, and investigate their relationship\r\nto Lie groupoids. He plans to continue his study of twisted Poisson\r\nstructures, and also the universal lifting conjecture. The latter\r\nimplies many non-trivial results in Poisson geometry including the\r\nKarasev-Weinstein symplectic realization theorem and the integration\r\ntheorem for Lie bialgebroids of Mackenzie and the investigator. This\r\nproject also involves the study of deformation quantization. The\r\ninvestigator will continue to study quantization of classical dynamical\r\nr-matrices using his previously developed deformation quantization\r\ntechniques. Also, he will study quantization of Dubrovin Poisson\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nPoisson geometry is largely motivated by physics, and is in fact a\r\nmathematical tool used to give a theoretical framework encompassing\r\nlarge parts of classical mechanics. Lie groupoids are useful tools in\r\nstudying the symmetry of various geometric problems in Poisson geometry.\r\nQuantization is developed in order to gain a better understanding of the\r\nrelationship between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. At\r\npresent, there are various applications of Poisson geometry including\r\ncontrol theory, machining automation, and robotic manipulation.\r\n",
