 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe science literacy needs of future teachers and other non-science majors are being addressed through implementation of a multi-site college level interdisciplinary science course sequence based on the National Science Education Standards and focused on real-life issues. Instructional capacity is also being addressed through faculty professional development and curriculum materials upgrades involving faculty from five institutions (University of South Florida, Hillsborough Community College, Manatee Community College and St. Petersburg College from Florida and Fairmont State College in West Virginia). Project direct outcomes include a network of 15-25 prepared instructors, 10-12 upgraded modules (beta versions), and measures of improved science literacy of the target student population, a diverse population of college students including those preparing to be teachers. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Faculty in the program are introduced to recent literature on learning and practice these strategies through the implementation of the \"Science That Matters\" courses and curricular material. Faculty reflection and feedback is used to improve instruction and the curricular materials.  Measures of student outcomes included Test of Logical Thinking (TOLT), The ACT's Collegiate Assessment of Academic Progress (CAAP), a project developed writing assessment measuring intellectual progress, and faculty assessment of student learning.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project provides a model two course sequence and curricular materials for achieving science literacy among non science majors/future elementary school teachers. Implementation at diverse institutions and among diverse student populations provides valuable guidance for implementation around the nation and for continuing improvements to materials. The modular curricular materials and the evaluation instruments are broadly applicable and useful to a diverse audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
