 "awd_abstract_narration": "The number of students graduating in engineering or other STEM disciplines is being increased by use of a combination of recruitment and retention strategies. The program has four components; two directed toward retention in engineering, another toward recruiting females into engineering or other STEM majors and the fourth one is a more global recruiting effort to increase the number of engineering majors.  \r\n\r\nA one-week program for beginning sophomores and transfer students is designed to improve retention.  The program designated a \"Redshirt Camp\" embodies a learning community to enhance students' abilities in problem solving, areas of mathematics and MATLAB programming.  The intent is to enable the students to be successful in courses in circuits, statics and, thermodynamics.  During the ensuing year, students will attend follow-up workshops scheduled for weekly two-hour meetings.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment effort primarily is directed toward the number of women entering engineering or other STEM disciplines by engaging them in a one-week GRADE (Girls Reaching and Demonstrating Excellence) camp for 9th - 12th grade females.  The fourth component is the Independent Study Mentorship for high school juniors and seniors.  Students will be paired with local engineers to become aware of the opportunities and requirements in engineering careers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is increase the annual graduation of engineering majors by 100 to 120 individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
