 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This project addresses the need to promote conceptual understanding, process skills, and motivation in introductory botany and zoology classes by integrating course content with inquiry-based, hands-on activities and experimentation.  The models for this curriculum reform are the physics course designed by Lopez, et al. (Proceedings of the VII Interamerican Conference on Physics Education, 2000) and the Concept Advancement through Chemistry Lab-Lecture (cAcL2) initiative of Oliver-Hoyo at North Carolina State University (http://www2.ncsu.edu/chemistry/moh/moh.html).  The new curriculum also adapts exemplary teaching practices such as cooperative learning (T. Lord, The American Biology Teacher, 1998) and problem-based learning (M. Sundberg, In Student-Active Science.  Models of Innovation in College Science Teaching, 1997).  In this classroom environment, students can immediately develop and test hypotheses about questions that arise during course content discussions.\r\n\r\nThe PIs are collaborating with Drs. Lopez, Oliver-Hoyo, Lord, and Sundberg in the design of the new curriculum, as well as in action research to assess the new research-based courses.  These collaborations enrich the interdisciplinary nature of the new curriculum.  Materials and model teaching strategies are shared with inservice teachers, teacher candidates, graduate students, and other faculty members through summer workshops and a website.\r\n",
