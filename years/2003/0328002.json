 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to synthesize and characterize new functional polymers from renewable and sustainable resources.  Specifically, ionomers based on itaconic anhydride (ITA), which is derived from citric acid, will be prepared.  Three types of systems will be synthesized: random ionomers based on highly branched poly(L-latic acid) and two types of telechelic ionomers with polycaprolactone and poly(ethylene glycol) backbones.  The functional groups will be introduced by copolymerization or end-capping reactions involving ITA, and the ionomers will be formed by the hydrolysis and neutralization of the ITA repeat units.  The microstructure and the physical and viscoelastic properties of the polymers will be characterized as a function of ionic concentration and the choice of the counterion.  Probing experiments to assess the application of the ionomers in a variety of applications (hydrogels, compatibilizers, coatings and adhesives) will also be carried out.           \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                  Renewable plant- and wood-based raw materials are attractive alternative starting materials for polymers as the monomers are less costly than petroleum-based monomers and the polymers can be designed to be biodegradable after use, thus eliminating much of the environmental and disposal problems associated with petroleum-based plastics.  This research explores a new direction for bio-derived polymers, namely the synthesis of functional polymers to replace petroleum-based polymers in applications such as hydrogels, coatings, adhesives and compatibilizers in polymer blends.  The research addressess the basic chemistry and physics of bioderived polymers.  The research will also train undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry and engineering and in provide them experience in the emerging field of \"Green Chemistry\".\r\n",
