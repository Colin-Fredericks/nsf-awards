There will be six invited plenary speakers: Vitaly\r\nBergelson of Ohio State, W. Wistar Comfort of Wesleyan\r\nUniversity, Niky Kamran of McGill University, Jan van Mill of\r\nVrije Universitaat, Peter Olver of the University of Minnesota,\r\nand Alex Simpson of the University of Edinburgh. There will be a\r\nworkshop in Set Theoretic Topology led by Stevo Todorcevic of the\r\nUniversity of Toronto.  All of the plenary speakers are\r\nrecognized authorities in their fields, and Todorcevic is widely\r\nrecognized as one of the two best set theorists in the world. In\r\naddition, six special sessions are planned: Set Theoretic\r\nTopology, Topological Dynamics and Ergodic Theory, Topological\r\nGroupoids and Their Applications, Topological Groups and\r\nSemigroups, Topology and Computer Science, and a session in honor\r\nof W. Wistar Comfort.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this conference, and of the entire series are: (1)\r\nbring to the participants the leading researchers and the latest\r\ndevelopments in topology and related areas; (2) foster\r\napplications of topology to these related areas; (3) expose\r\ngraduate students to the excitement and intense research activity\r\nof such a conference and help train them to do work in\r\napplications of topology; and (4) facilitate communication and\r\ncollaboration among topologists from a wide geographic area, both\r\nfrom this country and overseas, at a time of year which is\r\nconvenient to many faculty members.  As is witnessed by the\r\nspecial session on Topology and Computer Science, applications of\r\ngeneral topology have been growing in recent years.  A particular\r\nbenefit of this conference series has been the extent to which it\r\nhas successfully encouraged the participation of women and\r\nunderrepresented minorities. (Three of the most recent\r\nPh.D. graduates from Howard university, all black females, each\r\nattended and presented talks at at least one of the conferences\r\nin the series.)  The location of this conference at Howard\r\nUniversity will make it convenient for the active participation\r\nof several black graduate students.\r\n",
