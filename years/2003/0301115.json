Olevsky, San Diego State University\r\n\r\nThe research program is aimed at the development of a generalized theory of consolidation of nano-powders. This model approach takes into consideration the agglomeration phenomena, possible in-situ damage development and instability of the grain growth typical for final stages of the nano-powders sintering. Both deterministic (continuum mechanics) and stochastic approaches are used for the analysis of the material behavior. The experimental input is reduced to a minimal number of free sintering and sinter-forging tests necessary to determine the constitutive properties of nano-powders. The developed theoretical concepts will be verified by the experiments conducted with three different types of nano-powder materials: metals, ceramics and metal-ceramic composites. The developed computer codes will enable the prediction and optimization of macroscopic shape distortions, density, agglomerate characteristics, grain size and grain morphology spatial distributions. \r\nThe proposed effort includes the basis of an on-line process (consolidation) control for a wide range of nano-powder component designs, which are used in nano-materials related industries. Realization of the project will provide an important insight on in-processing nano-structures evolution and, from the practical point of view, will render a chance to lower still high production costs due to the optimization of consolidation.\r\nThe proposed program is expected to contribute to the advancement of the Materials Engineering area of the general Mechanical Engineering curriculum of the San Diego State University. A new graduate course on Mechanics of Powder Processing will be developed. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the theoretical and experimental investigations. Students will be involved in internships by local industries collaborating with PI on optimization of nano-powder consolidation. The project will contribute to the enhancement of the Joint Doctoral Program with University of California, San Diego.\r\n\r\n",
