 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to design, fabricate, test and evaluate an innovative\r\npanelized system for residential construction made from bio-based composite materials, which\r\ncan be fabricated simply and inexpensively. The panels will be of a sandwich type construction,\r\nconsisting of a foam core sandwiched between outer sheets or irskinsle. The panels will be\r\ndesigned with or without iiwebsld between the skins. The composite materials will consist of\r\nsoybean based resins and all-natural reinforcement, such as recycled paper, chicken feathers,\r\nand Nano clays.\r\nThe specific objectives of the proposed research are to:\r\n(1) Design a prototype, multi-function, bio-based composite panel suitable for residential\r\nconstruction\r\n(2) Develop low-cost processes for manufacturing large sandwich panels made from bio-\r\nbased composite materials, and\r\n(3) Test and evaluate the panels for normal, in-plane shear, axial compression and bearing\r\nload capacity.\r\n The research plan is organized into three primary tasks. Task 1, Design of the\r\nprototype multi-function panel, will involve basic research to improve the performance of the\r\nresin and composite system, and design of a generic, multi-function panel. Task 2, Alternative\r\nlow-cost fabrication processes for composite panel systems, will explore innovative methods for\r\nfabricating large composite panels. This will include an efficient VARTM process, and also what\r\nwe term composite casting. Finally, in Task 3, Testing and analysis of the composite panel,\r\npanels will be tested in bending, in-plane shear, axial compression and bearing, to determine\r\ntheir stiffness, load capacity, ductility and failure mode. Analytical models of the panels will also\r\nbe developed to be used in design and analysis of the system.\r\nThe research will benefit society at large by providing an Advanced\r\nPanelized System for residential construction that is made entirely from all-natural, bio-based\r\ncomposite materials. The system will reduce our dependence on petroleum products and\r\nreduce deforestation. The research brings together expertise in civil engineering, chemical\r\nengineering, materials science and composites manufacturing: the multi-disciplinary nature of\r\nthe research will provide a unique opportunity for students and faculty to learn from each other\r\nand explore, together this very interesting and quickly expanding of field. Results of the study\r\nwill be made available to the community through archival journals and the World Wide Web.\r\nThe PIs will use the resources of the RISE program at the University of Delaware to recruit and\r\nencourage the participation of minority students on the project.\r\n",
