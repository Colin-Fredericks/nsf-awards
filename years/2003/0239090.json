 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a set of research and educational endeavors as part of the PI's career development plan to establish a Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Laboratory at Rowan University. The research will address the problem of incremental learning of new in-formation without losing previously acquired knowledge, using an ensemble of classifiers approach. It will also addresses related issues that can benefit from an ensemble approach, such as estimating classification confidence and learning in non-stationary environments.\r\n\r\nThe research will be tightly integrated into a variety of traditional and nontraditional educational activities. Traditional activities include developing undergraduate and graduate courses, laboratory exercises and seminars, while nontraditional activities include forming integrated research and learning communities (IRLCs) to introduce research based education to undergraduate curriculum. These communities will consist of students of all classifications, freshman through graduate (vertical integration) with a conscious effort of integrating diverse gender, ethnic, and racial backgrounds (horizontal integration). Communities will be working on different aspects of the project, with individual members responsible of tasks that are commensurate with their intellectual and academic skills. These activities will develop research, analytical thinking, problem solving, team building and communication skills of the community members, while providing maximum multidisciplinary research exposure to both undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
