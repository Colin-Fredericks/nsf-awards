 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Americas Program award will support Dr. Robert Opila of the University of Delaware for a planning visit to the Instituto de Fisica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil to discuss a proposed joint research project with Professor Jonder Morais.  The proposed project would focus on interfaces of importance to electronic and photonic devices.  Among the topics the research would focus on are injection of electrons and holes into organic conductors for light emitting diode and photovoltaic applications, charge transfer at dielectric/semiconductor and dielectric/metal interfaces for electronic and magnetic applications, and methods to limit the susceptibility of semiconductor lasers to metallic contamination.\r\n\r\nThis area of research has direct technological interest and relevance to the global semiconductor industry.  The visit will enable the researchers to discuss not only the proposed research, but also the teaching and training of the students associated with each group in terms of expected student exchanges.  Such exchanges would not only transfer research knowledge and expertise directly, but they also contribute to the students' cultural education.\r\n",
