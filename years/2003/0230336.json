Russo\r\n\r\nThe Carpathian arc marks the suture of a now-closed major embayment of\r\nTethys, the expansive ocean basin that once stretched along the southern\r\nmargin of Eurasia from the western Mediterranean to Indochina.  The arc\r\nis unique in several respects:  Closure of the remnant Tethys here entails\r\nsome degree of very recent (Miocene-present) continent-continent collision\r\nand disappearance of, most likely, a part of the Tethyan oceanic lithosphere\r\ninto the upper mantle.  However, study of Carpathian tectonics may have wide\r\napplication, since the processes now visible there must have taken place\r\nelsewhere in the past along the diachronously closing Tethys margin.\r\n\r\nThe unusual seismicity, volcanism, and surface deformation at the Vrancea\r\nbend zone of the Carpathian arc (45.5 N lat., 25.5 E long.) has yielded\r\na debate about their cause(s):  one viable tectonic scenario invokes\r\nsubduction of a piece of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere, a remnant of which\r\nis presumed to be just detaching from continental lithosphere of the\r\nEast European and Moesian platforms.  A second model holds that oceanic\r\nlithosphere subduction ended some time in the late Miocene, and that since\r\nthen a portion of East European or Moesian platform continental lithosphere\r\nhas been delaminating along a horizontal mid-lithospheric interface and\r\ndripping down into the upper mantle.  The predicted distribution of high\r\nvelocity `slab' and low velocity asthenosphere in the upper mantle beneath\r\nVrancea zone differs between these models and can be determined seismically\r\nby a combination of tomography (ongoing in Romania and independent of this\r\nproject) and measurements of seismic attenuation and shear wave splitting,\r\nwhich delineate the distribution of cold lithosphere and warm asthenosphere,\r\nand the flow directions of any upper mantle asthenosphere.  The active\r\nseismicity at Vrancea can be exploited to delimit both slab distribution\r\nand upper mantle flow directions via measurements of seismic attenuation\r\nand shear wave splitting.  Targeted tests of mantle responses to Tethys\r\nclosure will include establishment of the presence and thickness of\r\nmantle asthenosphere beneath the study region, observations of mantle\r\nflow directions, estimation of seismic attenuation and associated\r\ninferences concerning mantle temperature fields, and, ultimately, a\r\nstrong test of competing hypotheses put forth to explain the unusual\r\nseismicity and volcanism of the Carpathian arc.  Finally, improved\r\nunderstanding of seismic wave propagation and attenuation in the study\r\nregion will directly enhance our understanding of seismic hazard in\r\nthis populous area.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n",
