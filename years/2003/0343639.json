 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systemic Research, Inc is seeking support to host an Annual Invitational Urban Key Indicator Data and Evaluation workshop in the spring of 2004.  The workshop will target PI/PDs data managers, evaluators, and selected NSF funded study group members.  This workshop intends to build on previous workshop by focusing exclusively at the classroom level to high local districts use data from student achievement scores, school and classroom profiles, and evaluations to extend their understanding of science and mathematics.  This workshop will target approximately 130 participants with the potential to reach hundreds of teachers and thousands of students through the information gained from the plenary and other workshop sessions and activities. \r\n\r\n Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nSystemic Research, Inc, (SR) intends to host an invitational workshop to promote the use of data and evaluation to enhance NSF-funded urban sites in their understanding and use of data.   For several years SR has held workshops for PI/PDs data managers, and other district and national leaders to facilitate the use of data as a management and planning tool for improving science and mathematics education.  Therefore, SR has been a leader in helping school districts establish and enhance how they collect and use data.  This approach has greatly.  With prior knowledge of collecting data for several urban-focused programs and working with representatives in over the years adds immensely to the likelihood that strategies and practices shared and learned at the workshop will greatly enhance how districts use data to improve practice.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nBuilding on past efforts (See www.systemic.com) this workshop intends to promote further dissemination of lessons-learned by helping local district leaders effectively address local issues regarding the use of data and evaluation. In addition to sharing information and best practices at the workshop, SR maintains a website with conference proceedings, copies of presentations, links to other relevant sites, and links to research studies on urban reform.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
