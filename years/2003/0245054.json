 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation of women at all levels of faculty and academic leadership, particularly at the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional practices, policies, climate, and culture.  Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) proposes a multifaceted project called Academic Careers in Engineering and Science (ACES) to increase the number of women faculty in science and engineering at all academic ranks.  The ACES project will operate on 3 levels: (1) At the highest levels of leadership of the University, including the President, Provost, and Deputy Provost.  This leadership is committed to fundraising for 5 endowed chairs to attract senior women scientists and engineers and to annual evaluation of deans' progress toward transformational change.  (2) At the school and departmental level with intensive coaching, mentoring, networking, and training and development of deans, chairs, faculty, and students in 4 test departments in Phase 1, and extension of the best practices to all science and engineering departments in Phase 2.  (3) At the campus-wide level with distinguished lectureships for senior women in science and engineering, mentoring opportunities, a spousal hiring network, and a unique minority pipeline initiative including faculty exchanges with Fisk University and summer research internships.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the proposed institutional transformation will be increased transparency and accountability as well as more equitable practices, procedures, and structures.  Throughout the ACES project, CWRU will self-study, evaluate, and disseminate the findings so that other private institutions can benefit from their work, building on a resource equity study begun two years ago.  Case Western Reserve University is at a pivotal time in its history, and is poised to make transformational change at every level of the university.\r\n",
