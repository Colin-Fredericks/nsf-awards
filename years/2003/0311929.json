 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visscher Abstract \r\nThis project is investigating the underlying mechanisms of carbonate  precipitation  in biologically active sediments by performing a geobiological study on a gradient  from  lithifying to non-lithifying microbial communities from microbial mats in a hypersaline  pond  (Eleuthera, Bahamas).  Field measurements and in situ manipulations are being combined with a variety of laboratory  experiments to isolate and characterize the  biological processes and environmental variables that control carbonate precipitation.  The PIs are examining microbial community composition, metabolic rates, and EPS characteristics in relation to carbonate mineral formation.  Environmental parameters which are being investigated include water chemistry (e.g., pH, [Ca2+], [CO32-]) and light intensity.  Microbial metabolism (production/consumption  of  inorganic  carbon)  on  carbonate  precipitation are being investigated by experimenting with pure and mixed  bacterial  cultures in both batch and continuous culture.  By focusing on precipitation and dissolution along a natural gradient  from lithifying  mats  to gelatinous EPS-rich  mats, the PIs hope to understand the general rules that govern calcium carbonate precipitation by microbial communities.   This information is being used  to develop a mechanistic  theory describing mineral  precipitation in biologically active sediments.  Since the main  microbial  guilds  (cyanobacteria,  sulfur oxidizers,  sulfate reducers)  responsible  for carbonate precipitation are found in numerous environments, the theory developed will address the entire carbonate  factory,  the  role of microbes in the formation of  geologically important  mineral products  and  the lithification  and  preservation  of  biological materials.  \r\n",
