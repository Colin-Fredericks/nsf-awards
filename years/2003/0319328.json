 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to  develop a laser that can be used in a variety of applications requiring high average power such as to drive a nonlinear crystal for efficient frequency conversion to generate radiation at the desired wavelengths.  A novel cooling approach will be used to remove heat from the laser crystal.  Preliminary heat transfer analysis show that a rod cooled with the new technique can be pumped at a rate that is a factor of ten higher than the rate used to pump a rod using conventional cooling techniques.  A demonstration device will be assembled in Phase I so that the volumetric efficiency and system performance can be measured. The same cooling technique can be used in cooling the crystals used in non-linear frequency conversion.  It is anticipated that a compact, efficient, high power, inexpensive IR laser can be developed using this cooling approach. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications of moderate to high average power lasers can be found in the remote measurement of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, molecular species, meteorological parameters, surface topography, vegetation and subsurface ocean layers. They can also be used in long-range wind shear measurements, laser ranging, and atmospheric back scatter. A variety of laser wavelengths are necessary for these measurements to be successfully performed. Variable wavelengths can be used in monitors and video displays.  The manufacturing of high average power lasers will have a broad impact on commerce and society if these lasers can be used to make color computer displays. This application could generate new jobs in the manufacturing segment. \r\n",
