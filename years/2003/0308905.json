 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator, in conjunction with a material scientist, will derive and use models based on upscaling and first principles (conservation laws, second law of thermodynamics) to predict behavior of concrete and specific smart materials.  New physical concepts which have been previously derived theoretically for swelling porous materials in general, will be tested experimentally.  The modeling\r\napproach not only provides more accurate models for complex materials, but also yields new insight into \r\nhow microscopic structure affects macroscopic behavior.  The results may lead to ideas for engineering new materials (such as smart materials) or improving the quality of existing materials (e.g. concrete).\r\n\r\nThe successful development of the model will depend on relating theoretical parameters to those which are measurable.  Dr. Yunping Xi of C.E. at Boulder will provide the expertise as far as understanding the\r\ncritical physical processes which must be captured and the necessary experiments needed to determine material coefficients.\r\n\r\nThe specific impact of this proposal is an improved understanding of the physics of concrete and smart materials, as well as an improved model which may be used to better predict and understand\r\nmacroscopic behavior.  Broader impacts include educating graduate students, applied mathematicians, and material scientists of theoretical knowledge and practical needs associated with material science sufficient for increased collaboration between the two communities.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
