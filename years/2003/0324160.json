 "awd_abstract_narration": "+The objective of the project is to create an active learning community of academically talented, financially needy students majoring in Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics.  The project provides 25-30 scholarships per year,  and targets to increase the enrollment, retention and success of low-income and academically talented students in these fields. It builds on a pilot project called Galileo Scholars, which was launched through corporate support to provide scholarships, and academic support services for academically talented students pursuing majors in science, math, and engineering or technology fields. The students are supported by a range of enhanced services that are designed to bolster their success such as the Virtual Campus, the writing of an educational plan, the field trips, and the scholars' roundtable.  Through coordinated activities, the project also provides for targeted recruiting, student support through advising and mentoring, a transfer and career exploration opportunities, in-person and online cohort-building activities, and assessment of these initiatives. \r\n",
