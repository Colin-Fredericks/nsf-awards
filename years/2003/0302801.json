 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the issue of increasing the pool of qualified technicians, technologists, and scientists in the region by increasing the interest of secondary school students from historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. To reach out to students in public schools, technology clubs are established at public schools, summer technology camps are sponsored, and engineering and technology competitions are sponsored. Technology club coordinators selected from underrepresented groups serve as strong role models, and college and university student chapters of professional societies provide mentors for secondary school students.\r\n\r\nThis project includes an awareness program to effect a new appreciation in the community for the career and educational opportunities that exist in STEM. Secondary school mathematics and science teachers and counselors attend workshops that address issues related to encouraging underrepresented students interested in mathematics and science. Parents receive information about STEM careers and methods to encourage their children in mathematics and science and a project web site includes information for students, teachers, counselors and parents. At the collegiate level, project leaders collaborate to improve the alignment of technology curricula between the community colleges and UNC Charlotte to articulate the preparation of students for the B.S. degree. College students mentor and advise high school students; both groups are encouraged to consider careers in academic fields. Internships, technical classes, and shadowing experiences for high school teachers improve math, science, and technology content in the high school and college programs. The project assesses student participation in technology clubs and high school science and mathematics courses in the high schools as well as student performance in courses and on college entrance exams to assess knowledge of STEM fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its unique approach to increasing the pool of qualified technicians, technologists, and scientists in the region by recruiting secondary school students underrepresented in STEM fields, and by providing strong role models and effective mentoring programs. The broader impacts of this project are its innovative approaches to advance learning and awareness of STEM principles and career opportunities while promoting learning and teaching in secondary schools, community colleges, and the university. The concentration on creation and enhancement of technology clubs in inner city and rural areas and the careful selection of effective role models broaden participation of individuals from targeted groups in STEM. The collaborative efforts enhance the infrastructure of education and encourage further participation from the community. \r\n",
