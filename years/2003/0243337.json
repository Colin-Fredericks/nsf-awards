The project supports faculty actively involved with the education of women and minorities to attend the constituent conferences of FCRC 2003, the primary technical conference incorporating the interests of many of the ACM special interest groups.  The project incorporates a special panel and discussion session for the travel grant recipients on the issue of recruiting and retaining women and minorities in computer-related fields.  Targeted schools include primarily undergraduate institutions, including HBCUs, women's colleges, and other colleges with large minority enrollments.  An additional set of faculty is being similarly supported by the ACM SIG Project Fund as part of the overall effort.  \r\n",
