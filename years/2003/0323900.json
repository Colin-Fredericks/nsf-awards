 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the scholarship fund that will enabled an additional 29 talented, low-income\r\nundergraduates per year to pursue baccalaureate degrees at the University of Washington in the\r\nCollege of Engineering, departments of Computer Science and Mathematics, and the Applied and Computational Mathematical Science (ACMS) program. This scholarship fund significantly expands the amount of financial assistance available to these students, thereby increasing their retention, as well as their competitiveness for permanent job placement or enrollment in graduate degree programs. Scholarship recipients are linked with an existing integrated network of successful student support programs where they receive advising, mentoring, and professional development and leadership training. Another benefit, that cannot be underestimated, is that it maximizes the existing integration between the College of Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and ACMS, as well as the University of Washington's (UW) student support structure.\r\n",
