The conference has\r\nfocused on many areas of topology including hyperbolic geometry,\r\nlaminations, foliations, 4-manifolds, 3-manifold invariants,\r\nsymplectic topology and contact topology. The conference has\r\nalways featured emerging areas of research in topology.\r\n\r\nTopology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of\r\nthe space we live in. As such there are deep relationships\r\nbetween topology, geometry, and physics. It is this diversity of\r\napproaches to central problems that has always energized research\r\nin topology.  We encourage and fund participation by members of\r\nunderrepresented groups. Our participants and organizers have\r\nincluded many women.  Typically our conferences feature a few\r\nsenior researchers and a large group of young researchers, mostly\r\nrecent Ph.D.'s and some graduate students. This format, with its\r\nattention to emerging areas of research, helps this conference\r\nplay a significant role in both disseminating the newest research\r\nand preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful\r\nresearch career in mathematics.\r\n",
