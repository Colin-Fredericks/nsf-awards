The workshops are held in odd years at Carnegie Mellon University in early fall. The seventh workshop is planned for September 12-13, 2003. The goals of the workshop are to\r\n(i) emphasize the close interplay of statistical theory and applications in the context of substantive scientific research;\r\n(ii) promote the continued development of Bayesian statistics, by highlighting problems in the sciences that require non-standard approaches, thereby requiring theoretical and methodological developments for their solution;\r\n(iii) provide an opportunity for scientists and statisticians to present their work in depth, highlighting both the scientific background and the analytical approaches, for the benefit of the audience;\r\n(iv) encourage young researchers and graduate students to present their work, interact with senior colleagues, learn about the latest developments in Bayesian statistics, and participate in discussions, by providing a small-meeting atmosphere;\r\n(v) highlight the many research opportunities that exist for statisticians who engage in interdisciplinary work;\r\n(vi) include as participants women and under-represented minorities who might benefit from the small workshop environment and the opportunities for one-on-one discussions with colleagues at other institutions;\r\n(vii) disseminate the findings presented at the workshop by publishing a volume or special issue of a journal containing well-documented and peer-reviewed case studies and related workshop presentations, and by posting the same information on the workshop's web pages (www.stat.cmu.edu/bayesworkshop).\r\n\r\n",
