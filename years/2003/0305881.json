 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is on developing a new concept and  foundation for efficient one-step preimage computation for sets of  states in large sequential circuits based on novel automatic test  pattern generation (ATPG) techniques, where current \r\nbinary-decision-diagram (BDD)-based approaches fail.  This is by taking the advantage that ATPG engines are not vulnerable to the space explosion problem, and thus the ATPG-based techniques can be applicable to very large designs.  However, computation of preimages will stretch  ATPGs in a way that they were not required before - they must\r\nreturn all solutions instead of merely one solution. In other words,  even though the state-of-the-art ATPGs are efficient in finding one  solution, simply making them continue to search all other solutions  will result in temporal explosion, in which exponential time will be  required to compute the complete preimage.  To remedy this problem, a  new ATPG algorithm that intelligently prunes the redundant search spaces  due to overlapping solutions is needed.  In doing so, this new approach  can significantly accelerate the search for all solutions necessary for  preimage computation.  Once the building block for preimage computation  can be efficiently performed, it can naturally be plugged into formal  model checking and equivalence checking engines for large sequential  systems.  This research addresses the following relevant issues: (a) identification of previously explored spaces that contain solutions;  (b) pruning of the spaces that only contain conflicts; (c) combination of multiple solutions in a compact form; and (d) iteration of the \r\ncomputation process to obtain preimage for multiple cycles.  As this research brings about a new approach via which implicit state-space  traversal can be performed, it offers an entirely new and effective  dimension to the design verification arena for verifying large and  complex sequential systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
