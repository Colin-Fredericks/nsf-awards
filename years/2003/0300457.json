 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this research grant is to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanics of micro-cutting processes with a focus on the size-effect phenomenon.  A secondary objective of the grant is to develop an understanding of chip formation and surface integrity in micro-cutting of important engineering materials such as ferrous and titanium alloys.  The research approach for achieving these objectives involves the following tasks:  1) Development of analytical models based on strain gradient plasticity for the size-effect arising from the primary, secondary and tertiary deformation zones in orthogonal micro-cutting, 2) Verification of the size-effect models through orthogonal micro-cutting experiments on ferrous or titanium alloys, and 3) Experimental study of the effects of cutting conditions on chip formation and surface integrity in orthogonal micro-cutting process for ferrous or titanium alloys.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this project include advancement of fundamental understanding of chip formation, mechanics, and surface integrity in micro-cutting processes.  This understanding will in turn benefit micro-cutting tool design, micro-lathe/mill design, and micro-cutting process optimization.  Broader impact of the research will be realized through development of international partnerships with researchers at the National university of Singapore, international educational experience for the graduate students working on the project, and through the participation of middle/high school science and math teachers in some aspect of the project.",
