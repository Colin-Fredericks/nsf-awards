 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-ITR medium award provides support for the Center for Quantum Information Physics (CQuIP) at Yale University.  Researchers in CQuIP are attempting to capitalize on recent work that has shown that--by replacing normal bits with \"qubits\" that obey the laws of quantum mechanics--it is in theory it is possible to perform certain calculations or procedures that are impossible with a classical computer.  Potential applications include secure communication without cryptographic keys; exponential speedup of certain computations such as prime factorization; etc.  However, these advantages can only be fully realized with interconnected systems of qubits that are much larger than the current state of the art for the field.  The central aim of CQuIP is to demonstrate proof-of-principle relating to a diverse and novel set of approaches for scalable quantum computing and quantum communication.  The particular approaches studied in this project are based on superconducting microcircuits; spin states of semiconductors; and ultracold polar molecule arrays.  The research at CQuIP will also significantly advance our understanding of the basic physics underlying these systems.  The approaches under study span several sub fields of physics, and interaction between the subgroups of CQuIP encourages cross-fertilization of ideas across traditional intellectual boundaries.  A core function of the CQuIP is education of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates in the new field of quantum information science.  CQuIP also serves as a point of contact for researchers within the field, through a program for visitors; and as an educational outreach center, through a program of talks at nearby small colleges.\r\n\r\nThis NSF-ITR medium award provides support for the Center for Quantum Information Physics (CQuIP) at Yale University.  Researchers in CQuIP will build on recent work which has shown that--by replacing normal bits in a computer with bits that obey the laws of quantum mechanics--it is in theory possible to perform certain calculations (such as cryptographic code-breaking) qualitatively faster than on any normal computer.  However, such quantum computation would require a system with substantially more usable quantum bits than the handful of \"qubits\" that characterize the current state of the art for the field.  The CQuIP is devoted to development of such large-scale \"quantum information processors\".  The center will investigate, experimentally and theoretically, several different and promising qubit technologies: Superconducting circuits; nuclear spins in semiconductors; and laser-trapped arrays of polar molecules.
