 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n4th International meeting on the\r\nMechanics of Time -Dependent Materials\r\n\r\nThe role of time-dependent material behavior in engineering is important in the design and evaluation of structures intended for durable uses. A quarter of a century ago, the term \"time dependence of materials\" implied, essentially, the study and understanding of creep behavior of metals. Though durability questions have become a much more important part of cost-effective engineering designs, the attention paid to the contribution of intrinsic material behavior of such designs has not kept a commensurate pace with requirements. Though polymers are most prominent materials in this class many of the principles governing their performance apply to other solids. The conference is thus aimed at fostering awareness of time-dependent issues in engineering, and particular to attract a young and diverse audience/participation and to expose them to concerns of established researchers dealing with such issues from interdisciplinary points of view. \r\n",
