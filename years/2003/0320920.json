 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Delaware State University under the direction of Dr. Melissa A. Harrington to establish a combined electrophysiology and fluorescence imaging facility.  This equipment will be used measure electrical signals and calcium dynamics in invertebrate nervous systems, muscle cells and cell lines expressing ion channels and transporters.  The instrumentation includes a 64 electrode planar multi-electrode array for recording electrical activity combined with a fluorescence microscope to permit simultaneous functional imaging of calcium or voltage dynamics.  The instrumentation will support research and research training in the areas of cell biology and neurophysiology at an historically-black, undergraduate institution.  \r\n\r\nTwo neurophysiology projects will focus on a land snail as a model system for studying sensory processing and learning.  These projects will use the microelectrode array to study the timing and spatial pattern of neural activity that develops in the snails brain in response to sensory stimulation and learning. Experiments will be carried out on the isolated brain and neural connections to the sensing region of the tentacles.   The multi-electrode array and fluorescence imaging system will also be used with cultured cells over-expressing the human multi drug resistance gene in order to examine the regulation the cellular currents proposed to be linked to the expression of multi drug resistance. The multi drug resistance gene is often up-regulated in cancer cells, and this instrumentation will allow students to study relationships between an overexpressed transmembrane protein and ion cellular currents.   A fourth project involves investigating programmed cell death and regeneration in primary cultures of muscle cells.  Muscle cells are excitable cells that lend themselves easily to study with either Ca2+ imaging or multi-electrode physiology. This project will investigate the development of, and recovery from a partial cell death induced through UV illumination of a single nucleus in multinucleate myotubes. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will further the development of a novel and useful model system for studying: 1) the neurobiology of sensory processing and learning; 2) a novel approach to studying the function of the human multi-drug resistance gene; and 3) in vitro studies of muscle cell degeneration and recovery.  Moreover, since Delaware State University is a historically black, undergraduate institution with a 76% African-American enrollment, the proposed equipment will broaden opportunities for minority undergraduate and master's students to participate in state-of-the-art research.\r\n",
