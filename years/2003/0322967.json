 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Remarkable advances have been made in recent years in the development\r\nof small, agile, relatively inexpensive mobile autonomous vehicles, ultimately intended for a wide\r\nvariety of purposes such as search and rescue, exploration, environmental monitoring, distributed\r\nsensing, the cleaning and maintaining of structures, etc. The existence of such vehicles and the\r\nanticipated development of still more advanced versions raises compelling questions: Can large\r\nnumbers of small autonomous vehicles be successfully deployed in the form of a \"swarm\" or \"flock\"as a search team, an exploration group, or something similar, to cooperatively carry out a pre-scribed\r\ntask and to respond as a group to high-level management commands? Can such a group\r\nreliably function robustly, in a difficult or even uninhabitable environment such as outer space or\r\nunder sea, possibly without a designated leader, with limited communications between its mem-bers,\r\nand/or with the \"roles\"of its members not all the same and perhaps changing with time?\r\nWhat can we learn about how to organize these groupings from biological groupings such as insect\r\nswarms, bird ocks, and fish schools? Is there a hierarchy of \"compatible\" models appropriate to\r\nswarming/schooling/ ocking which is rich enough to explain these behaviors at various \"resolutions\"\r\nranging from aggregate characterizations of emergent behavior, to \"point models\" for each\r\nvehicle, to even more detailed descriptions which model individual vehicle dynamics? In broad\r\nterms, these are the issues we propose to address\r\nMore specifically, we propose to study distributed multi-vehicle motion control algorithms with\r\nthe aim of better understanding the concepts upon which large classes of such algorithms might\r\ndepend. For example, we would like to better understand the implications of changing nearest\r\nneighbor sets and how this intrinsic property can be modelled and analyzed within the context\r\nof switched dynamical systems. We would also like to understand how to analyze asynchronous\r\nsystems, which because of coarse modelling, exhibit non-deterministic state transitions. We also\r\npropose to explore, devise and evaluate alternative data structures/models at various degrees of\r\ngranularity for representing large homogeneous/hetrogeneous groups of mobile autonomous agents\r\nmoving in a densely populated environment. These representations are needed for a variety of\r\npurposes: for overall management of a large group, for simulating the effects of various protocols\r\non group behavior, etc. Example data structures could include \"rigid point formations\" and\r\n\"Euclidean Distance Matrices\" as well as other graph-theoretic concepts and vehicle models and\r\nvarious levels of abstraction.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,\r\ntraining and learning in at least two different ways. First, graduate students involved in\r\nthe project will be expected to attend and present there results at technical meetings. Second,\r\nproject graduate students will contribute to and participate in a short course on the topic which\r\nwe envision organizing and giving towards the end of the project. We cannot think of any especially\r\nunusual way in which this project might broaden participation of underrepresented groups,\r\nalthough we certainly would encourage such participation. This project will enhance infrastructure\r\nfor research and education in at least two ways. First we expect to continue our crossdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration with our environmental biologist colleagues with whom we've already been working\r\nfor several years. Second, we expect to continue to collaborate with our experimentalist colleagues\r\nwho have built an underwater multi-vehicle testbed { originally conceived by this PI } for trying\r\nout various control algorithms. We hope to continue to contribute to broadening dissemination to\r\nenhance scientific and technological understanding by organizing and running boni fide interdisciplinary\r\ntechnical gatherings like the forthcoming Block Island Workshop on Cooperative Control\r\nwhich we've co-organized and which will take place in June, 2003.",
