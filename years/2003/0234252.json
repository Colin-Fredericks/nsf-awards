 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on instrumentation of parallel and distributed systems, integrated tool environments, and performance modeling of application-specific systems from high-level specification.  The objects of the research include:  Develop an integrated environment based on an instrumentation system (IS), so that a user may navigate among multiple performance tools to support analysis and diagnosis strategies; apply a structured approach for IS design and evaluation (P'RISM: PaRallel Instrumentation System Management) to develop new ISs according to system requirements and to provide feedback to other IS developers;  select metrics for evaluating IS performance; develop a software architecture for scalable ISs and identify requisite technologies.  Three primary activities support these objectives: (1) apply service request outcome analysis to derive a set of metrics for evaluating IS performance and further qualify those metrics that may be used for comparing performance of different ISs: (2) in coordination with the Paradyn project and the Parallel Tools Team at the Cornell Theory Center, complete a full IS performance evaluation study using analytical modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques; and (3) using P'RISM, develop the software architecture of an IS and develop a prototype based on this specification.",
