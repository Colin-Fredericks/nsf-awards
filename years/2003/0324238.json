Recent observations are starting to yield insight into the characteristics of this class of variability.  It seems that the types of active galactic nuclei showing unambiguous microvariability are those dominated by emission from relativistic jets, and thus the observations should provide insight into physical processes in the inner regions of jets.  The supported research program expands the lead investigator's efforts in this field, to make new comprehensive observations of more examples, and to begin a systematic study of the theoretical implications.  The microvariations are diagnostics for discriminating between theoretical models.\r\n\r\nThis program incorporates amateur quasar monitoring networks, graduate, and undergraduate students, which not only benefits this research, but also exposes all participants to the scientific process by letting them contribute to cutting edge research.  Other professional observatories are also collaborating.  In addition the students will be responsible for the web site, which will be used to display continually updated results of the research throughout the award period.\r\n***",
