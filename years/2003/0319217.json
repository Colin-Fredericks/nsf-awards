 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop methods to prepare  xyloglucan conjugates for use as molecular anchors for the attachment of functional chemicals to cellulose and/or cellulose textiles. The functional chemicals that can be attached to cellulose by this method include dyes, fabric softeners, antimicrobial agents, and lubricants. The water-soluble xyloglucan conjugates will bind irreversibly to cellulose, providing an economical and efficient alternative to the currently available textile industrial technology. The objectives of this project are to develop and optimize chemo-enzymatic methods for the preparation of novel xyloglucan conjugates and the testing of the conjugates in various textile manufacturing processes. This Phase I project will result in the laboratory scale production of these xyloglucan conjugates and to the analysis of these molecules as industrial materials. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of consumer products. The development of environmentally benign methods for the production of finished textiles and the reduction of need for re-application of textile finishes (e.g. fabric softeners) will provide significant economic and health advantages over existing technologies.",
