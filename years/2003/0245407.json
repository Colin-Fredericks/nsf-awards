 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support the North Carolina A&T\r\nExperimental Nuclear Physics groups students and senior personnel to\r\nwork on the PrimEx experiment. Our group is currently playing a leading\r\nrole in the PrimEx collaboration to develop and construct a\r\nstate-of-the-art experimental setup, to perform a precise measurement of\r\nthe neutral pion lifetime at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab).  Because the\r\nneutral pions are the lightest two quark system in nature, the\r\nprediction of theory is the most accurate and direct for this process. \r\nThe present experimental knowledge of this decay rate is at the 10%\r\nlevel, which is about one order of magnitude poorer than the theoretical\r\nuncertainties. The PrimEx experiment at JLab, will significantly improve\r\nthe experimental uncertainties associated with all the past\r\nexperiments.  \r\n\r\nThis work will involve three undergraduate and three graduate students\r\nto work and to be trained on this project.  It will provide them with\r\nunique research opportunities in experimental nuclear physics, and\r\ntherefore will have a strong impact on their training and education. \r\nThe program is highly interdisciplinary and includes work with both\r\nhardware and software (i.e., electronics, nuclear detector systems,\r\ncomputer simulation, and data analysis).  It will allow them to work in\r\na state-of-the-art facility and interact with scientists from other\r\nnationally recognized universities. Thus, it can be very effective in\r\nattracting African Americans and other underrepresented groups to study\r\ntoward advanced degrees in physics. \r\n",
