 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael E. Fisher, of the University of Maryland, is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry and Materials Theory  Programs to perform research on statistical mechanics and phase transitions.   The project deals with developing and applying basic statistical mechanical techniques to problems relevant to biochemistry and biophysics. Specific biophysical behaviors are identified and general principles governing these behaviors are conjectured and tested.  The specific problem being investigated includes the theory of motor proteins such as myosin V and kinesin.  Although myosin V and kinesin are both processive motors, they exhibit qualitatively different load-versus-velocity characteristics and different stall forces.  A chemo-mechanical explanation of the differences observed in these two motor proteins is being sought in this work.  In addition, refinement of the understanding of critical properties of ionic fluids is in progress.  Graduate and postdoctoral students will receive traditional training in the field of statistical mechanics and learn how to apply these techniques to the nascent field of molecular motors.\r\n\r\nA chemo-mechanical understanding of motion of biologically important macromolecules is currently lacking and the field is nearly devoid of experimental data.  The preliminary models studied here will yield precise predictions, which will stimulate new experimental measurement and further enable refinement and redefinition of the models.  Such studies may form a framework for the understanding of muscle action, which could lead to successful strategies for modification of muscular processes in vivo.  These studies will also impact the design and application of nanomechanical devices.  The second area of interest is in the understanding of ionic fluids. Elucidation of the properties of ionic fluids will speed their adoption as a medium for chemical processing applications such as chemical reactions and chemical separations.\r\n\r\n",
