 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manning\r\n     The investigator and his students and colleagues study\r\nelastic rod models of biological molecules, including DNA and\r\ncoiled-coil proteins.  In the case of DNA, a classical rod model\r\nis enhanced by including intrinsic curvature, flexibility, and\r\ndeformations imposed by protein-binding.  Among other\r\napplications, this model is used to analyze cyclization\r\nexperiments, which can probe DNA and protein structure and\r\nflexibility under biologically realistic solvent conditions.  The\r\nlarge deformations imposed on DNA by cyclization and bound\r\nproteins require the consideration of DNA self-contact, a topic\r\nof contemporary interest in elasticity theory.  The stability of\r\nconfigurations in the presence of such self-contact is a major\r\nmathematical focus of the investigator's work.  On the protein\r\nside, the rod model is applied to alpha-helical protein regions\r\nthat are interwound into coiled coils.  The application of this\r\nmodel to classical polymer physics experiments, such as atomic\r\nforce microscopy and single-molecule pulling experiments, should\r\nshed light on the mechanical properties of these coiled coils, in\r\nmuch the same way as this combination has done for DNA.\r\n     The past several decades have seen the mathematical theory\r\nof elastic rods contribute considerably to the understanding of\r\nDNA.  Enhancements in both the model and DNA experiments have\r\nallowed researchers to address more and more biologically\r\ninteresting questions, such as the connection between base-pair\r\nsequence and DNA structure.  The investigator has contributed to\r\nthis research field, via several recent projects involving\r\nundergraduate research students on such questions as the\r\nflexibility of the TATA box sequence in DNA (which plays an\r\nimportant role in the transcribing of the genetic code to RNA)\r\nand the stability of rods in contact with obstacles (an important\r\nprecursor to understanding the stability of DNA supercoiled\r\naround itself).  In addition to further pursuing these studies,\r\nthe investigator extends these techniques to an area where they\r\nhave seen little application: proteins.  There has been a growth\r\nin recent interest in coiled coils, a subset of proteins with\r\nbasic structure plausibly like DNA.  The investigator is in an\r\nactive collaboration with a group of protein biologists,\r\nchemists, and physicists on a nanotechnology project to design\r\nprotein wires using coiled coils.  The expertise developed from\r\nthis collaboration, combined with the investigator's experience\r\nin modeling DNA, provides an excellent opportunity to make a\r\nfirst step at designing a rod theory for coiled coils, which will\r\nbe a useful theoretical tool in the engineering of protein wires,\r\nin much the same way that the rod model has proven useful for\r\nunderstanding DNA.\r\n\r\n",
