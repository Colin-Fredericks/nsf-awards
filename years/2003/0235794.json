 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Frank Anderson at Southern Illinois University to use information collected from several genes to study the evolutionary relationships among and within major groups of animals (also known as \"phyla\", e.g., mollusks, annelids and arthropods).  Despite more than a century of research, the pattern of evolutionary relationships among and within the animal phyla remains confused.  New molecular biological techniques allow evolutionary biologists to compare genes from organisms to help them determine patterns of relationship.  Unfortunately, very few genes have been used to study relationships among the animal phyla.  To remedy this situation, Dr. Anderson has proposed to evaluate thirteen previously unstudied genes that may be useful for investigations of animal relationships.  DNA sequences of each of these genes will be determined for fifty specimens representing all major animal phyla, and these sequences will be used to reconstruct relationships among and within these groups.\r\n\r\nThis research will increase the number of genes that can be used for studies of animal relationships.  It will also yield information on the positions of enigmatic groups in the animal family tree, and serve as the first step in large-scale collaborative studies of animal evolution using several genes.  The research will enhance the education of two graduate students and one or more undergraduates, who will receive training in invertebrate collection methods, specimen identification and molecular laboratory techniques.  The research will also form the basis for at least one master's thesis.  In addition to publications in scientific journals, a website will be developed to rapidly disseminate protocols and information, serving as a resource for both students and researchers.  Finally, findings from the research will be incorporated into courses in invertebrate zoology and evolutionary biology at Southern Illinois University.\r\n",
