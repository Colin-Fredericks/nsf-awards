 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a Workshop on Repeated Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Surveys, to be held in Arlington, VA on 28-29 March 2003.  Recurring surveys are a major data resource for the social sciences.  The workshop will include noted researchers from a variety of disciplines, including demography, economics, political science, psychology, sociology, and survey research.  Short-term goals of the workshop include the identification of the most important research questions and cutting-edge issues in this area and enhanced interdisciplinary collaborations among the participants at the workshop and their students and colleagues.  It also is expected that this workshop will provide useful information for NSF staff that are involved in planning new activities for the Human and Social Dynamics priority area in FY 2004 and beyond.  Long-term, research growing out of the workshop should have important spillover effects for many recurring surveys.  All products of the workshop, including the final report, will be in the public domain.",
