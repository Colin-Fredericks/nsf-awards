 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics reform efforts are changing classroom instruction, but administrative mechanics have had limited impact on homework. Web-based homework offers a partial solution, but is limited by types of responses available, and student drawings and graphs are especially problematic. This project is creating a set of flexible, modular Java applets for drawing simple graphs and diagrams. These self-grading applets can work with most web-based homework systems as well as standard HTML pages, enabling the use of new classes of exercises. The PI and undergraduate students are developing a complete set of exercises using these applets to accompany a standard introductory physics curriculum within a widely used web homework system and HTML pages.  The project is also investigating usage patterns, sources of difficulties, and effectiveness with assessment as an integral part of the project. Dissemination is via the Internet, web-homework systems, conference talks, and workshops.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: these applets simultaneously solve significant difficulties with both physics curricular reform efforts and web-based homework using widely available technology.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: these applets have clear applications beyond introductory physics to math, chemistry, engineering and any areas where graphs, vectors, tables and equations are used.  The availability of exercises can help to encourage and assist instructors who teach in a traditional style to incorporate more research-based methods and activities in their classroom.\r\n\r\nTeacher preparation: Undergraduate students who are future high school physics teachers are an integral part of this project.\r\n",
