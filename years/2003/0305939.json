 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symplectic geometry is an intriguing generalization of Kahler geometry to \r\na wide, and as yet not completely understood, class of smooth manifolds.   \r\nThough it retains echoes of many of the structural features of the \r\nKahler world (for example Lefschetz pencils, and complex curves),\r\nsymplectic geometry is much more flexible than Kahler geometry.\r\nIn particular, every finite dimensional symplectic manifold has an infinite \r\ndimensional group of structure-preserving transformations (called \r\nsymplectomorphisms), while the corresponding group in the Kahler case is \r\nnecessarily finite dimensional. McDuff proposes to study the topological \r\nproperties of the whole symplectomorphism group, and in particular its \r\nrelation to its finite dimensional subgroups.  One important question is \r\nto develop a criterion for detecting if a given circle in the symplectomorphism \r\ngroup is homotopially trivial.  McDuff has been working with Sue Tolman on \r\nthis question and proposes to continue this collaboration, making a special study \r\nof the case of symplectic toric manifolds.  In another separate project, she \r\nhopes to develop a fuller theory of symplectic characteristic classes to \r\nprovide homological tools for understanding these questions.   \r\n  \r\nBoth symplectic and Kahler geometry are very important in modern theoretical \r\nphysics; string theories often study fields defined over a special kind of six \r\ndimensional Kahler space called a Calabi--Yau manifold, while instanton \r\ncorrections to many equations and functions are often defined in purely \r\nsymplectic terms.  In order to understand a geometry it is essential to understand \r\nwhat kind of transformations preserve it; for example in the standard Euclidean \r\ngeometry studied in high school the structure (distances and angle measurements) \r\nis preserved by rotations and translations. This project studies the properties \r\nof high dimensional families of these transformations (for example, the set of \r\nall rotations of the plane) rather than of individual transformations.  There \r\nis a well understood theory (the theory of Lie groups) that works for rigid \r\ngeometries such as Euclidean or Kahler geometry. One main aim of this project \r\nis to see how much of the structure remains in the more flabby and flexible \r\nsymplectic world, where are infinitely many intrinsically different ways of \r\nperturbing space.\r\n",
