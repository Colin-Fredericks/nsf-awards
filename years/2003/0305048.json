 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents a broad array of projects within three distinct\r\nareas of geometric analysis.  The first area concerns the application of\r\nnonlinear gluing techniques to the Cauchy problem in General Relativity.\r\nNonlinear gluing techniques have played a central role in geometric\r\nanalysis over the last 20 years.  It is only recently that they have been\r\nintroduced as a useful tool in General Relativity.  Applications have\r\nincluded the existence of asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes with\r\narbitrary spacial topology and those with no maximal slices.  The PI will\r\nextend and apply these powerful tools in a number of important ways. The\r\nsecond set of projects studies the existence and behavior of smooth\r\nSchr\\\"odinger maps. From a geometric point of view the Schr\\\"odinger flow\r\nis the most natural dispersive equation as it arises as the Hamiltonian\r\nflow of the Dirichlet energy for maps between manifolds.  This work will\r\nestablish a bridge between the well-developed theory of dispersive\r\nequations and important techniques from geometric analysis. The third area\r\nis a continuation of the PI's work on surfaces of constant mean curvature\r\n(CMC) in Euclidean 3-space.  The local structure of the moduli space of\r\nall such surfaces with a fixed topology was previously worked out by the\r\nPI and his co-authors.  The development and application of new gluing\r\ntechniques for CMC surfaces has led to important advances in our ability\r\nto describe the global structure of these moduli spaces.  The PI will\r\ncarry this work significantly forward so that we may begin to obtain a\r\nmore thorough understanding of these basic geometric objects.\r\n \r\nGeneral Relativity is the physical theory which forms the cornerstone to\r\nour understanding of the large scale structure of the Universe, and has\r\nbeen intimately intertwined with differential geometry and partial\r\ndifferential equations since its inception at the beginning of the 20th\r\ncentury. As with any physical theory, its dynamical formulation (the\r\nCauchy problem) is of central concern. The PI's research on the Cauchy\r\nproblem will develop and apply new analytic techniques to General\r\nRelativity. The resolution of these problems will bring us further in the\r\nlong term goal of understanding how to model physical phenomena via the\r\nmathematics of the initial data sets. Analytically, the Schroedinger flow\r\nis a generalization of the classical nonlinear Schroedinger equation,\r\nwhich has been intensively studied. The proposed program concerning the\r\nSchroedinger flow will foster the development of a new area of geometric\r\ndispersive systems.  Surfaces of constant mean curvature arise naturally\r\nas the surfaces which locally minimize their surface area while\r\nmaintaining a fixed enclosed volume.  Soap bubbles form a familiar and\r\nimportant class of examples of surfaces of constant mean curvature.  The\r\nsignificance of these research projects lies both in the importance of the\r\nparticular results which the PI will obtain and also in the continual\r\ndevelopment of sophisticated techniques which enable one to approach and\r\nunderstand problems which exhibit increasingly complex phenomena. Much of\r\nthis research is interdisciplinary both between distinct areas within\r\nMathematics and between Mathematics and Physics.  While important results\r\nhave already been obtained, there is great potential for expansion in\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
