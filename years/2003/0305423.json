Thomas Farrell\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate certain problems in high \r\ndimensional manifold topology and connections with Riemannian \r\ngeometry and algebraic K- and L-theories. A basic problem posed\r\nby Borel is to determine whether closed aspherical manifolds with\r\nisomorphic fundamental groups are homeomorphic. This problem \r\nhas led to two families of conjectures of a functorial nature: the\r\nIsomorphism and the Fibered Isomorphism Conjectures. These\r\nconjectures are of central importance to much of this project. \r\nBesides Borel's other related geometric problems will be addressed.\r\nThese include: a generalized Nielsen Question; replacing a map to \r\nan aspherical manifold by an approximate fibration; determining\r\nwhether a smooth manifold homeomorphic to a closed negatively\r\ncurved manifold supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric;\r\nand seeing if complete compact affine flat manifolds with isomorphic\r\nfundamental groups are diffeomorphic.\r\n\r\nManifolds are geometric objects which locally resemble the space of\r\nEuclidean geometry; but could be quite different globally. Roughly\r\nspeaking a manifold M is (strongly) aspherical if this local resemblance\r\nis determined globally by a continuous correspondence p from the \r\npoints in Euclidean space E to the points in M. And M is closed if this\r\ncorrespondence maps some ball in E onto M. ( Caveat: The \r\ncorrespondence p is never one-to-one when M is closed.) The \r\nfundamental group of M consists of all the motions of E which preserve \r\nthe correspondence p. Some examples of closed aspherical manifolds are\r\nthe circle and the surface of the doughnut. In the case of the circle, the\r\ncorrespondence p sends the real number x to the point (cos(x), sin(x)) \r\nand the fundamental group of the circle consists of all translations by an\r\nintegral multiple of the circumference of the circle. The Moebius band is \r\nanother example of an aspherical manifold; but it is not closed. On the other \r\nhand, the sphere is a manifold which is not aspherical. A pair of closed \r\nmanifolds are homeomorphic if their points can be placed in a continuously \r\nvarying one-to-one correspondence. The answer to Borel's problem is well \r\nknown to be Yes for aspherical manifolds of dimensions 1 or 2; but is in \r\ngeneral unknown even for 3-dimensional manifolds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
