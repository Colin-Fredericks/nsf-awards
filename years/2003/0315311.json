 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the synthesis of new types of dendrimer architectures, the relationship between primary structural elements in the dendrimer and its conformation in solution will be assessed. The effects of these architectures on encapsulation as evidenced by changes in electron transfer rate and/or redox potential will be assayed. The advantages of film electrochemistry in studying dendrimer encapsulation will be defined. Finally, the ability of a dendrimer film to shield the core from solvent to differing degrees will be studied as a function of dendrimer generation, type of dendrimer film, counterion identity, and solvent nature. \r\n \r\nControl of electron transfer is a central theme in biology and is a rapidly emerging \r\nconcern in the new field of nanometer-scale electronics. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Christopher B. Gorman, of the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University, is exploring the design and synthesis of large, branched molecules (\"dendrimers\") which bear in their cores substructures which allow him to elucidate the molecular features that influence the relative rate and driving force for electron transfer reactions. While addressing fundamental questions about how a non-conducting molecular shell governs electron transfer rates, Professor Gorman is also gaining insight into the electron transfer processes central to both biochemical function and electronic devices. In addition to providing a broad, interdisciplinary research experience for all students involved in these studies, including collaborations with engineering groups, Professor Gorman participates in a number of programs encouraging the participation in research by members of historically under-represented groups.",
