Retrovirus-mediated gene therapy is one of the most commonly used methods to deliver and express the gene of interest in clinical and research area, because of its capability of stable gene integration to the chromosomes of target cells. In order to elevate the efficiency of retroviral transduction, several restrictions such as low virus-cell encounters and the necessity of cell division have to be overcome. The objective of this study is to harness ultrasonic standing waves generated by piezoelectric transducer and reflector to bring hematopoietic cells and retroviruses into close membrane contacts at the pressure nodal planes, and therefore enhance the gene delivery efficiency. The development of an acoustic chamber and innovative operation of the device will decrease the undesired acoustic streaming and thermal convection which may prevent the aggregation of particulates with diameter around 100 nanometer such as retroviruses. The success of this proposed study will provide an innovative method to the field of gene therapy. In addition to training graduate students, the undergraduate students will actively participate in the development of new technology.",
