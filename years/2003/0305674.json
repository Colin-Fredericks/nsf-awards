This meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products from combustion processes. Meeting every two years since 1990, this meeting attracts between 150 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students are selected based on the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation and need by the standing organizing committee for the conference. Up to $1000 can be received by each student to help defray travel costs for attending the conference. The availability of the travel cash awards is advertised on the conference website and in the call for papers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nResearch, and especially environmental research, is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. This meeting is especially designed to bring together engineers, scientists, and health effects researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion.  Our next generation of researchers must be familiar with these interdisciplinary issues to be successful.  Encouraging the participation of students with partial travel support develops and trains the next generation of researchers.\r\n",
