 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop innovative capacity planning models for health care delivery.  The research project will model a general health care system as a network of queuing stations and incorporate the queuing methodology into an optimization framework.  The queuing reflects the unpredictable or random elements of health care systems, whereas the optimization framework captures tradeoffs between costs and levels of service.  Capacity cost and performance functions are likely to be nonlinear, so the optimization will fall in the challenging category of nonlinear integer programming.\r\n\r\nCapacity management is increasingly recognized as one of the critical issues in making health care delivery more flexible and cost-efficient.  Resources must be allocated among levels of the delivery network (primary care clinics, acute care hospitals, rehab centers, nursing homes), as well as among units of these facilities.  Successful development of optimization tools adapted to this task could have a tremendously positive impact on decision-making and facilitate better understanding of tradeoffs and their consequences.  Furthermore, the project will foster development of interdisciplinary collaborations among engineering and hospital administration researchers and benefit from strong interactions with delivery facilities of three different types.  \r\n",
