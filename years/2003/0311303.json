 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  The Chemistry Department at the University of South Dakota is increasing the expertise of its students in NMR theory and application by increasing their exposure to the technique, and by integrating the subject into courses across the curriculum. To this end, use of a 200 MHz, multi-nuclear FT-NMR is being integrated into the curriculum. By improving student training and providing accessibility to the instrument, more students are able to include NMR among the repertory of techniques that they feel confident in applying in their undergraduate research projects.   A series of summer workshops for faculty training is being held in order to optimize integration of the subject across the sub-disciplines of chemistry and in order to facilitate dissemination of capabilities to regional universities. Adaptation and implementation of similar curricular improvements and specific experiments cited in the literature, primarily in the Journal of Chemical Education, within the framework of the objectives we have defined is allowing us to achieve our goal of improving undergraduate education in chemistry at the University of South Dakota. The broader impact of this project is greatest for the integration of education and research. Students are developing a new set of skills in their course work which they are applying to their research.",
