 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Duncan will investigate metal ion-ligand complexes synthesized in a molecular beam via a pulsed laser vaporization source.  The ligands are small molecules.  The spectroscopy and dynamics of these species are studied using mass-selected infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy. The experiments measure ligand-based vibrational frequencies as they are shifted by bonding interactions with the metal ion.  Cluster solvation shells and intracluster reactions are also identified via ligand vibrations. The experiments focus on magnesium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon ions complexed with one or more solvent or ligand molecules, e.g., carbon dioxide, water, acetylene, and others.  Additional experiments include organometallic complexes in which metals interact with benzene or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\nThe experimental studies on both small and large complexes will contribute to an improved understanding of metal bonding interactions important in inorganic and organometallic complexes, in metal containing atmospheres, in metal materials and at biological metal centers.  The research is carried out with graduate and undergraduate students as well as with postdoctoral research associates.  The project benefits from collaborations with outside researchers and internationally with a group in the Netherlands.  \r\n",
