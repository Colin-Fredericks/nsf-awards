The project will focus on determining the distribution of electric dipole strength close to the neutron threshold in nuclei.  This strength has important implications for various nucleosynthesis processes.  A combination of experiments using the intense white bremsstrahlung beam in Darmstadt and the completely linearly polarized monochromatic gamma-ray beam at Duke will allow for a systematic determination of the electric dipole strength distributions, provide complete decay schemes, and allow for unambiguous parity assignments.  The collaboration will provide for the transfer of experimental expertise and equipment from the Darmstadt facility, which will help make the Duke facility a world-class facility.\r\n\r\nThe project also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.\r\n",
