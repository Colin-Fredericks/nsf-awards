 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a sophomore-level lecture and laboratory course emphasizing processing-structure-property relationships, along with important concepts in surface science, scanning probe microscopy techniques, nanotechnology, and nanoscience. The lecture portion will be reinforced in the accompanying laboratory which will include a number of lab modules involving scanning force microscopy, materials synthesis, nanolithography, computational chemistry, self-assembly, microcontact printing and a final student-designed group project. It is anticipated that upon completion of the proposed course, students will understand and appreciate the importance and impact of nanotechnology in both science and society. Through the development and implementation of this course, Hamilton College will be one of a few liberal arts institutions nationwide to integrate nanoscience into its mainstream science curriculum. The course is being designed for ease in dissemination and accessibility so other institutions can adapt the outline for their own undergraduate programs.",
