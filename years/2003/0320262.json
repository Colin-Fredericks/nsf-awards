 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop proof of concept for the passive inventory control component of a Smart Anesthesia Workstation. The current standard is a non-automated lock-and-key Bluebell cart that requires frequent manual inventory counting and restocking. Newer solutions, with multiple log-in functions, restrict immediate access to critical supplies, a danger to patients during emergencies. This Phase I project will use RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology in the Smart Workstation to provide transparent inventory control, passively tracking and recording all supply transactions. The Smart Workstation will require no changes in current practice, yet could improve patient care through enhanced safety, reliable stocking, and robust inventory control. This research will chart current anesthesia processes, design a system capable of recognizing multiple RFID tags simultaneously, design the optimal workstation architecture, and determine tag specifications. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in human healthcare in a hospital setting. This Phase I project is expected to result in the development of a Smart Workstation proven to track transactions accurately and transparently. Ultimately, this system will identify and track the clinician, the supply or drug being administered and the patient. It will serve as a passive patient safety system, a billing system and a materials management system for hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
