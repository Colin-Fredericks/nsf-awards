This dissertation research project will assess how household characteristics and spatial factors affect the quality of water people consume, and how water quality differences affect illness patterns in a small city of southern Mexico.  The research, in collaboration with local specialists, will create an electronic map of the city; will test a sample of homes for water quality, will conduct in-depth interviews with a sample of urban residents on their use of water and understanding of water-borne illness, and will survey the incidence of illness as well as relevant household characteristics.  The study will provide an improved understanding the social and spatial causes of water problems and disease in developing world cities.\r\nThe broader impacts include training local students in public health and social science research, and the provision of an electronic map of water resources and problems for local planners and decision makers. Aside from contributing to the training of a young social scientist, this project will create knowledge that will be useful in a broad range of similar situations. This research is supported by the Cultural Anthropology Program and also by the Americas Program of NSF's Internaitonal Office. \r\n",
