 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bose, Booth\r\n     The primary goal of this project is to derive general\r\nprinciples that underlie how short-term synaptic plasticity\r\n(STSP) is utilized by neuronal networks in three different\r\ncomputational and architectural settings.  These settings are\r\nmotivated by concrete biological examples arising in crustacean\r\nstomatogastric ganglion (STG), rat hippocampus, and cortex.\r\nSpecific aims include determining the effect on phase maintenance\r\nof multiple depressing synapses and intrinsic cell properties in\r\npacemaker-driven networks, determining how multiple depressing\r\nsynapses can introduce multiple, co-existent stable firing\r\npatterns in reciprocally-connected networks, and determining how\r\ndepressing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in an\r\nafferent-driven network can generate frequency-selective, steady\r\nstate, and transient network responses.  The investigators\r\ndevelop and use techniques of geometric singular perturbation\r\ntheory to project and analyze the dynamics of these complicated,\r\nhigh-dimensional neuronal networks onto lower-dimensional slow\r\nmanifolds.  These techniques allow them to understand how\r\ndifferent synaptic and intrinsic parameters contribute to and\r\nmodulate network behavior.  They work closely with\r\nexperimentalists who, in a parallel research program, are\r\ninvestigating the effects of synaptic depression in the\r\ncrustacean STG.\r\n     Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of a synapse to\r\nchange its strength as a function of its usage.  It is widely\r\nfound in neuronal circuits across the brain.  While experimental\r\nstudies of short=term synaptic plasticity (STSP) are necessarily\r\nfocused on the particulars of the neural system under\r\ninvestigation, modeling of the type proposed here can provide\r\ninsights into the more general properties of STSP.  The\r\ninvestigators study the possibility that seemingly independent\r\nroles for STSP can be grouped together based on how the network\r\narchitecture constrains STSP to operate.  Elucidating the general\r\nprinciples behind these operations provides a framework for\r\nunderstanding how STSP participates in very diverse neuronal\r\ncomputations across brain regions.  Due to its interdisciplinary\r\nnature, this project is expected to be of interest to members of\r\nthe experimental, computational and analytic neuroscience\r\ncommunities.  Additionally, the investigators continue to teach\r\ncomputational neuroscience and mathematical biology courses that\r\nthey recently developed.  Graduate and undergraduate students\r\nhave the opportunity to work directly with their experimental\r\ncollaborators.  Thus students become well positioned to continue\r\npursuits in either experimental or theoretical fields, or in an\r\narea that combines the two.  This enhances the development of a\r\ntrained workforce at the critical intersection of mathematics and\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\n",
