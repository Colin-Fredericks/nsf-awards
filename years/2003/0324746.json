 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental policy decisions are often evaluated either on their impacts\r\non high-risk communities or on the magnitudes of their net societal\r\nbenefits, but both elements are rarely considered in the same analysis. This\r\nmakes it difficult to inform policy decisions when there may be tradeoffs\r\nbetween equity and efficiency. This project focuses on synthesizing concepts\r\nand methods across two disciplines often at odds with one another -\r\nenvironmental equity analysis and risk-based benefits assessment - to better\r\ninform choices among alternative environmental policies.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, this project will both develop quantitative\r\nmeasures of environmental equity suitable for air pollution benefits\r\nassessment and refine the benefits assessment methodology to better account\r\nfor heterogeneity in exposure patterns and susceptibility to disease. The\r\nappropriateness of these methods will be evaluated using specified criteria,\r\nthrough stakeholder feedback, and through two case studies. The first case\r\nstudy will examine alternative proposals to control emissions from power\r\nplants, a policy decision where much debate has centered on distributional\r\nissues and where impacts are found on a national scale. The second case\r\nstudy will consider control strategies for mobile source emissions, with\r\nboth national and local analyses to inform decision making at multiple\r\nlevels. Considering both ground-level emissions in urban settings and\r\nemissions from elevated point sources will allow for issues of geographic\r\nscope and resolution to be addressed in detail, a topic that has posed\r\ndifficulties in both environmental equity analysis and benefits assessment.\r\nMore generally, these case studies will advance the analytical techniques\r\nused in both environmental equity analysis and air pollution benefits\r\nassessment, while answering timely policy questions and providing\r\neducational materials for classroom and community settings.",
