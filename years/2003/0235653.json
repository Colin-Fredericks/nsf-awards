 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-dimensional structures of a number of important filamentous plant viruses will be determined in molecular detail, using fiber diffraction methods. These viruses are models for filamentous assemblies in virology and cell biology. They also have enormous potential in agricultural biotechnology; the potyviruses cause half the viral crop damage in the world. Knowledge of viral structures can lead to improved technologies for disease resistance. Structures to be determined will include the type member of the potexvirus genus, potato virus X (PVX), and two other potexviruses, papaya mosaic virus and narcissus mosaic virus. The crystal structure of PVX coat protein will serve as a starting point for determination of the structures of the intact viruses by fiber diffraction. Preliminary studies will be carried out on potyviruses including bean common mosaic necrosis virus, wheat streak mosaic virus, and potato virus Y. The structure of odontoglossum ringspot virus, a rigid rod-shaped tobamovirus important in studies of viral host specificity, will be determined. Plant viruses have been paradigms for developments in fiber diffraction, a powerful tool for structural analysis of naturally occurring filaments, and in this project they will continue to be so.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project will include integration of research and education, in particular, a strong program involving undergraduates and K-12 teachers in research, and potential applications to crop protection and plant biotechnology.",
