For the Einstein equation, we will focus mainly on \r\n(1) the existence of its solutions, particularly, K\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics \r\nin complex geometry and (2) behavior of its singular solutions. I will also \r\nstudy the associated K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow and its soliton-type solutions. \r\nThe Yang-Mills equation is a nonlinear equation and may have singular \r\nsolutions. We will study the basic problem how singular solutions behave \r\nalong their singularity, e.q., the size of singularity. It has been found \r\nin my previous works that there is a connection between singularity \r\nformation of Yang-Mills fields and classical minimal submanifolds. I intend \r\nto explore this more and its related compactness problem for Yang-Mills \r\nfields, particularly, the interaction between self-dual solutions the \r\nYang-Mills equation and calibrated geometry. I also intend to continue his \r\nstudy in symplectic geometry. The problems include symplectic isotopy \r\nproblem in a rational surface and its applications toward classifying \r\nsymplectic four dimensional spaces, computing well-defined symplectic \r\ninvariants, such as the Gromov-Witten invariants, constructing new \r\ndeformation invariants.\r\n\r\nProblems in this proposal arose naturally from our attempts to \r\nunderstanding nonlinear differential equations from geometry and physics. \r\nThese equations include static Einstein equation, Yang-Mills fields as well \r\nas holomorphic maps. They played a fundamental role in our understanding of \r\nnature through mathematical means. They also have found many deep \r\napplications in geometry and topology, such as Seiberg-Witten theory, \r\nMirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces. The resolution of these problems will \r\nprovide mathematical foundations for some physical theories and have \r\nprofound applications to long-standing mathematical problems. Most natural \r\nphenomena are nonlinear and possess singular behaviors. These are reflected \r\nin possible singular solutions to the differential equations which describe \r\nthose phenomena. It is still challenging to have a complete mathematical \r\nunderstanding of these singular solutions. This proposal will address some \r\nof these basic problems. I will also try to find more solutions of these \r\nnonlinear equations -and apply them to studying basic problems in geometry \r\nand topology.\r\n\r\n",
