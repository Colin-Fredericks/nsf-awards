 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to support travel of participants to a conference on Bio, Micro- and Nanosystems, to be held on July 7-10, 2003 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  The main objective of this conference is to bring together physical and life scientists working on science and engineering at the interface between synthetic and natural nanoscale systems. The topical areas of this conference reside at a set of intellectual interfaces between disciplines, and therefore will cover topics that are not the focus of conferences usually sponsored by existing professional societies. Thus, this meeting will foster interactions and exchange of ideas and information among groups of scientists who do not normally meet together.  The conference is a collaborative effort between the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) and the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The conference will feature approximately 30 oral and numerous poster presentations.  There are sixteen confirmed invited speakers (invited speaker support provided by ASM and IEEE-EMBS) that cover a broad range of scientific fields and ensures the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering. The remaining oral presentations and all poster presentations will be selected from submitted abstracts that were due April 4, 2003. The estimated participation is about 500 people from government agencies, academic institutions and industry representing a wide variety of engineering and scientific disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe conference web page may be found at: http://www.asmusa.org/mtgsrc/biomicronano.htm\r\n\r\n",
