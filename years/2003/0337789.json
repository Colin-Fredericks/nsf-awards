They generate\r\nthree research projects suitable for undergraduate participation:\r\nendophyte mediation of tri-trophic interactions in Gambel's Oak,\r\nevolution of virulence in environmentally transmitted parasites,\r\nand a chemostat model for metapopulation dynamics.\r\n     The project supports undergraduate training at New Mexico\r\nState University, an institution with large enrollments of Native\r\nAmerican and Hispanic students and that is officially recognized\r\nas a Minority Serving Institution.  In addition, the project\r\nintegrates research and education within the mathematical and\r\nbiological sciences and serves as a springboard for the\r\ndevelopment of an interdisciplinary program in mathematical\r\nbiology.  It contributes directly to the training of young\r\nscientists and mathematicians by supporting a graduate student\r\nand four undergraduate students over two years, and by\r\ninterjecting cross-disciplinary elements into the biology and\r\nmathematics curricula.  This project is jointly supported by the\r\nBiological Sciences directorate, the Education and Human\r\nResources directorate, and the Office of Multidisciplinary\r\nActivities and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the\r\nMathematical and Physical Sciences directorate.\r\n\r\n",
