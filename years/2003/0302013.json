 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIdentifying the mechanisms that structure local communities is a fundamental goal of community\r\necology. Historically, ecologists invoked local processes to explain community structure, but\r\nequivocal evidence has broadened debate to include the potential importance of regional\r\nprocesses in structuring communities. Though experimentation has proven critical in resolving\r\nissues in ecology, theoretical and observational studies have, thus far, been the primary tools used\r\nto examine the effects of regional processes. I propose a series of novel experiments to test\r\ntheories that span the range between local and regional control of diversity. Local process,\r\nmetapopulation competition, and neutral community theories make predictions about the effects\r\nof immigration that are qualitatively different, mutually exclusive, and testable in the same\r\nimmigration experiments. Using a laboratory system of Tribolium flour beetles and a field system\r\nof Cecropia petiole beetles, I will experimentally test these theories by simultaneously\r\nmanipulating immigration regime and interaction strength (lab), and exposure to immigration and\r\ndistance from colonization source (field). Though recently developed theory suggests regional\r\nprocesses can have a dominant effect on community structure, the theory must first be confirmed\r\nempirically if community ecology is to gain insight from the regional process perspective.",
