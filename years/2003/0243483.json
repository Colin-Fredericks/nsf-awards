 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nWhen an engineering structure is loaded by a vibratory source such as a\r\nmotor, resonances occur in the neighborhood of normal modal vibrations.  These resonances are\r\noften undesirable, resulting in large deformations and possible destructive effects.  If\r\nnonlinear effects are taken  into account in the engineering model, the normal mode vibrations are\r\nperiodic motions known  as nonlinear normal modes.\r\n\r\nThis work concerns nonlinear normal modes in two degree of freedom systems.\r\nSuch systems  are subject to a phenomenon known as autoparametric excitation.  This\r\ninvolves energy being transferred between nonlinear normal modes in a resonant fashion, with the\r\npossibility that a nonlinear normal mode may become unstable.  If a structure were to be designed to\r\noperate in a particular vibrational mode, and if that mode turned out to be unstable, the design\r\nwould be a failure.\r\n\r\nThe usual procedure for determining whether a nonlinear normal mode is\r\nstable or not involves  using a mathematical theory known as Floquet theory.  This offers\r\npredictions of instability based on for example numerical integration of the differential equations of\r\nmotion.  In the proposed research, we address a situation (called coexistence) in which Floquet theory predicts stability, but which involves instabilities which would result if the model was changed slightly.\r\nSince no engineering model perfectly represents a physical situation, such instabilities in models with\r\ncoexistence are inevitable.\r\n\r\nAlthough coexistence occurs in a variety of models of physical systems very\r\nlittle research has been aimed at understanding the associated instabilities. This project aims 1) to\r\ndetermine which systems exhibit coexistence (from a general class of systems), and 2) to examine the\r\nnature of the resulting instability.\r\n\r\nThis project will fund a graduate research student at the doctoral level and\r\nthus will integrate research and education.  The results of the research will be broadly disseminated by\r\nbeing presented at a scientific/engineering meeting and published in a scientific journal.  In\r\nthis way it is hoped that engineers will be made aware of possible design trouble that could be caused by the\r\nhidden instabilities which are the subject of this research.\r\n",
