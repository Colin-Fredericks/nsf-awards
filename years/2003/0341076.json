 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous results of the investigator and collaborators establish\r\na relation between coherent sheaves on a Steinberg variety of a complex\r\nsimple algebraic group, and perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety of\r\nthe Langlands dual group. Since the latter are known, by the work of Kazhdan\r\nand Lusztig, to be related to representations of quantum groups at a root\r\nof unity, and hence also to representations of algebraic groups in prime\r\ncharacteristic, our results have implications for that theories. \r\nThey also indicate that there should be a relation between the geometry\r\nof perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties, and non-restricted \r\nrepresentations of quantum groups or Lie algebras in prime characteristics.\r\nThe principal goal of the present project is to develop this kind of \r\nrelationship, thus providing a new tool for the theory of non-restricted \r\nrepresentations. It is expected, in particular, to yield a proof and a\r\nconceptual explanation for recent numerical conjectures by Lusztig. \r\nThe methods and ideology of the present work are partly based on the geometric\r\napproach to the Langlands program, due to Drinfeld. Another goal of the project\r\nis to investigate consequences of the above mentioned results to that theory.\r\n\r\n A key to new developments, and a source of inspiration in mathematics often \r\nlie in discovery of parallelism (equivalence) between\r\nseemingly unrelated objects or theories. Representation theory is a rich\r\nsource of examples of that kind: though formally being a branch of algebra,\r\nthe modern theory relies heavily on geometric disciplines, such as\r\n topology and algebraic geometry. The principle goal of the present project\r\nis to develop geometric language for a branch of representation theory\r\nwhere it has been lacking so far, namely the so called theory of non-restricted\r\nmodular representations. In the corresponding algebraic constructions \r\ndivisibility\r\nproperties of integral numbers by a particular prime number are relevant.\r\nThe geometry apparently related to this deals with particular infinite\r\ndimensional objects, encountered also in mathematical physics\r\n(conformal field theory), and in number theory (Langlands duality theory).\r\nThis construction is expected to provide new tools for the above mentioned\r\nbranch of representation theory; in particular, it is expected to yield a\r\nproof of certain conjectures  by  leading experts in the field.",
