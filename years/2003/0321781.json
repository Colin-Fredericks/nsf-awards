 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support a reconnaissance survey of the 22 January 2003 Mw 7.8 earthquake near the coast of central Mexico.  The earthquake was about 51 km south-southwest of Arequipa and approximately 500 km west of Mexico City, and caused extensive damage in the region surrounding the cities of Colima and Manzanillo.  Damage also occurred at the Port of Manzanillo, and along the highways that traverse the region.  An NSF-supported geotechnical reconnaissance team visited the area to document the geotechnical and engineering geology/seismology features of this earthquake.  Owing to the perishable nature of the geotechnical damage, it was imperative for the reconnaissance to begin as soon as was practically feasible.  The reconnaissance team was assisted by local researchers and practitioners with regard to local geology and local construction practices.\r\n\r\nThe reconnaissance of this important seismic event is expected to yield useful information and data to understand the effects of subduction zone earthquakes, and to apply those findings to the mitigation of earthquake hazards that may occur along the Aleutian-Alaskan subduction zone and in the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the reconnaissance will be made available in two phases.  In the first phase, the early reconnaissance reports will be posted on the Internet through the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER; http://peer.berkeley.edu).  In the second phase, a more comprehensive final report will be written and published.",
