 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a one-year Bridges for Engineering Education planning grant at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. This project aims to contribute to improved undergraduate engineering pedagogy by developing and testing innovative instructional approaches with non-engineering majors at the nations largest Catholic institution for women, the College of St. Catherine (CSC). In addition, it is anticipated that this project will set the stage for improved engineering content in K-12 education through close collaboration with education faculty in the design of non-engineering-major courses for pre-service and in-service teachers via partnership with innovative programs on both the CSC and University of St. Thomas campus that focus on science and math education. It is anticipated that his planning grant award will help to forge an accessible path for women students at CSC to pursue engineering careers through a dual degree in liberal arts and engineering and thereby serve as a nationwide model for addressing the need to increase the number of women in the engineering profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
