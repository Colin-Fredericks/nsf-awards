The organizers aim to gather researchers\r\nwho will review recent advances in mechanical properties of nanostructured materials\r\nand nanocomposites, assess the impact across materials science, and chart a course for\r\nfuture work in research, fabrication, design, and application. The Symposium covers\r\nnanoscience and nanoengineering of bulk and composite materials, thick coatings and\r\nthin films with enhanced mechanical properties for structural and functional applications.\r\nParticular emphasis is placed on bringing researchers working on theoretical and\r\nmodeling aspects closer to those working on developing processing, fabrication, and\r\ncharacterization techniques in this new and rapidly growing area.\r\nProject/Abstract Summary\r\nThis award will provide partial financial support of travel and registration fees for\r\ngraduate students, Post-doctoral researchers and invited speakers to attend the MRS\r\nSymposium Q: Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials and Nanocomposites,\r\nwhich will be held in Boston, MA, from December 1-5, 2003. MRS meetings promote a\r\nunique communication among materials researchers from academia, industry and\r\ngovernment for the advancement of interdisciplinary materials research. Symposium Q\r\ncreates a forum for researchers involved in nanoscience and nanoengineering of bulk and\r\ncomposite materials, thick coatings and thin films with enhanced mechanical properties\r\nfor structural and functional applications. Invited speakers for the symposium include\r\nwell-known researchers from academia, industry and national laboratories, providing a\r\ncritical, up-to-date review and discussion on science and technology of nanomaterials\r\nand nanocomposites, with focuses on a fundamental understanding of the relationships\r\namong fabrication, structure, strength and ductility, and performance.\r\nPrepared: 8/23/03",
