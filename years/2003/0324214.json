 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CSEMS scholarship program at the University of Arizona is a partnership between five colleges and is intended to increase student graduation rates while improving academic performance.  The PIs are working to enhance the academic environment for CSEMS scholars as they complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics.  The project provides approximately 44 scholarships that range from one to four years. Students are recruited through departmental listservs, graduate admissions committees, the financial aid office, and outreach programs.  Students are connected to the career/advising/mentoring services of the university and the support structures designed specifically for CSEMS scholars. Each PI works with a small group of recipients in their field to ensure students are making academic progress and to discuss career options.  Support structures include the Career Services Office, Financial Aid, the Graduate College, GRE workshops, centralized point of contact, and a Web site designed and maintained specifically for the needs of CSEMS scholars. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on participation of underrepresented groups in counseling and mentoring sessions as well as recruitment efforts such as a minority graduate student mailing list, and outreach programs into high schools and community colleges.  To advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning, all investigators encourage students to join the respective professional societies and to participate at professional meetings and if possible will fund students to attend. Students are notified of career fairs on campus, internship opportunities in their fields, and government-sponsored internships. CSEMS scholars may participate in teaching undergraduates in the Computer Science section leader program (several have in the past). CSEMS scholars are encouraged to consider graduate school and will be invited to participate in GRE workshops that are funded by this grant. \r\n",
