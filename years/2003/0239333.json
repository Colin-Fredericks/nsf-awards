 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER project is to establish a significant advancement in biomolecular nanoelectronics by theoretical modeling and interfacing liquid-state biopolymers to solid-state nanoelectronic devices. The scientific component of this project aimed on the theoretical modeling of dielectric behavior of biopolymers and elucidating experimentally interactions of DNA-counterion, RNA-DNA, protein-protein, and actin filament-counterion in the cavity between two nanogap electrodes. The technological components of this project focus on the precise control of sub10 nm nanogap electrode for biosensors, development of sensitive label free bioassays, and a robust batch fabrication method of integrated nanogap electrode arrays with nanofluidic networks. The educational goal of this project is to effectively integrate research into educational activities and the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary studies: Special educational outreach program will be accomplished through summer research training camp to educate women and under-represented students in junior and senior high school. Overall educational goal is to train students how to carry out their research with sound theory and hand on laboratory skill for their advanced careers in quantitative biological sciences or biophysical engineering.",
