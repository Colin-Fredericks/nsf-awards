 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stillman\r\n     This is a collaborative project carreied out by Daniel R.\r\nGrayson and Michael E.  Stillman.  Macaulay 2 is a free computer\r\nalgebra system dedicated to the qualitative investigation of\r\nsystems of polynomial equations in many variables.   The\r\ninvestigators continue development of Macaulay 2.  They upgrade\r\nexisting algorithms, install more algorithms, develop and publish\r\nnew algorithms, implement new algorithms as they are discovered,\r\nadd symbolic-numeric algorithm support, improve the\r\ndocumentation, and make systemic software changes that help\r\ncontributors to write, test, and document code.  Areas where new\r\nalgorithms can make an impact include the study of numerical\r\nsystems, fractions with specified types of denominators, ideal\r\nfactorization, systems where the multiplication of the variables\r\ndoesn't satisfy the commutative law, geometric optimization, the\r\nanalysis of observations of gene expression levels over time, and\r\nbioinformatics.\r\n     Macaulay 2 is part of the infrastructure that supports\r\nmathematical research involving systems of polynomial equations\r\nin many variables.  A measure of its impact is that at least 70\r\nresearch papers have cited Macaulay 2, at least seven\r\nmathematicians have contributed code, and books and course\r\nmaterials are now using it.  The experimental results found with\r\nMacaulay 2 are helping in the formulation and development of\r\ntractable conjectures.  Now that the software is approaching\r\nmaturity, the investigators place more emphasis on recruiting\r\ndevelopers from the research community and on collaborations with\r\nother scientists on both mathematical and interdisciplinary\r\nprojects that exploit Macaulay 2's capabilities.  They introduce\r\ngraduate students and postdocs to the use of computers in\r\nresearch mathematics through visits and a 5 day workshop in\r\nUrbana.  The study of systems of polynomial equations has a long\r\nand distinguished history in pure and applied mathematics, with\r\nrecent impact on such fields as cryptography and robotics.\r\nIncreasing computer power, combined with further development of\r\nMacaulay 2, enables scientists to expand dramatically its scope.\r\n",
