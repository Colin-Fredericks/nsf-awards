Invariant theory, with roots in the 17th century, has\r\nproven to be a robust area of mathematical endeavor.  Over the\r\ncourse of the last 50 years, it has found new applications in\r\nalgebraic topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, as\r\nwell as many traditional areas such as number theory and\r\ncommutative algebra.  Professor Lesh is on the scientific\r\norganizing committee for Ingo2003, which is an initiative of\r\nresearch groups in Aberdeen, Manchester, and Goettingen working\r\nin the areas of algebraic topology, representation theory, and\r\ncommutative algebra. These scientists have found that\r\ncommunication across narrow specialty boundaries can bring great\r\nscientific benefits. A central theme of the conference will be\r\nthe many connections of invariant theory to other fields. In the\r\npast, conferences organized around the topic of invariant theory\r\nhave tended to be rather specialized, for example, concentrating\r\non computational aspects, or emphasizing interaction with at most\r\none other subject area, such as algebraic topology. Ingo2003 is\r\nbeing organized with a much broader scientific base and will be\r\ninterdisciplinary in a global sense, as well as having a specific\r\nfocus on younger researchers. Some of the topics represented in\r\ndiscussions will be modular representation theory, coinvariants\r\nand the \"hit problem,\" algebraic topology, and Hasse-Schmidt\r\ndifferentials and differential Galois theory.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of invariant theory is studying the question of what\r\nelements of a changing situation must in fact remain fixed. For\r\nexample, the points along the axis of a spinning globe remain in\r\nthe same position as the globe turns. The point at the center of\r\nthe spindle of a tape player stays fixed while other points on\r\nthe spindle turn around it. More surprisingly, rotating a circle\r\naround its center and then flipping the circle over any line\r\nthrough its center must leave a different line in a fixed\r\nposition.  The search for such \"invariant\" or \"fixed\" elements of\r\na situation can be very subtle, and it arises in a wide variety\r\nof mathematical problems and physical applications. The goal of\r\nthe Ingo2003 conference is to allow mathematicians from differing\r\nmathematical disciplines to learn techniques from each other, and\r\nto disseminate sets of mathematical tools developed in one\r\ndiscipline to other disciplines that might find them useful.\r\n",
