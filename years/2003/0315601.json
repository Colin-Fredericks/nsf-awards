 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the mechanical properties of tubuliform silk and its evolutionary origin. Tubuliform silk, which is used to form the egg case of orb-weaving spider, is unique in several important ways.  First, its sequence must be very different from the other orb-weaving spider silks in that it contains a very different amino acid composition.  Second, it is produced only for a short period in the spider's life, just before the eggs are laid.  Finally, its mechanical properties show a high tensile strength but this is combined with a low ability to withstand bending without fracture. The work plan is:  1) Four species of spiders from a broad section of the orb-weaving, derived orb-weaving and cob weaving spiders will be used.  2) The tubuliform silk fibers will be collected for mechanical and biophysical testing.  3) Genomic DNA libraries and cDNA libraries will be constructed, these libraries screened, and positive clones sequenced.  4) Comparisons will be made between these silk proteins and other silk proteins to help determine the role the protein sequence plays in mechanical properties and the evolutionary path of this silk.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research involve both the general public and students.  Spider silks represent a unique answer to the production of biomaterials for applications ranging from protective clothing to medical products to composite materials. On average 3-4 undergraduates will work in the laboratory every semester and 2-3 high school minority students every summer. At least10 presentations are given each year on spiders and spider silk to elementary and high school groups and service clubs in the state. Information, pictures and video clips are provide each year for several publications and TV and radio stations including PBS, National Geographic, CBS, NBC, etc as well as a number from outside this country, BBC and CBC. \r\n",
