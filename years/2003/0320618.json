 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology to produce an advanced high efficiency multi-layer thermal and electrical insulation using fullerenes. The recently completed Phase I project has demonstrated absolute technical and economical feasibility of producing and utilizing such insulation systems resulting from the unique thermal properties of fullerenes.  Fabricated samples of fullerene-based insulation were shown to possess R-values of 36 to 40 per inch of thickness, which considerably exceeds those of commonly available insulation materials (for example, polyurethane (R6.7), expanded polystyrene (R3.8), and even vacuum insulated panels (R9~24)).  In addition, proposed fullerene-based insulation is very compact, lightweight and cost-effective.  During the course of this Phase \r\nII project, the team will optimize fabrication technology, structure and properties of the proposed fullerene-based insulation as well as perform an extended prototype study by producing and fully characterizing various insulation systems.  At the completion of this effort, an optimized fabrication technology for producing advanced thermal and electrical insulation systems will be demonstrated, commercial application identified and extensive testing at a potential customer site initiated in order to start the product certification process. \r\n \r\nCommercially, the proposed high efficiency thermal and electrical insulation system will have numerous applications, especially in the area of cryogenic temperatures. Based on high performance, ultimate compactness, flexibility and lightweight, the premier field of application will include miniature cryogenic storage and shipping containers utilized in pharmaceutical industry, neuro- and bio-storage, assisted reproduction, oncology research, immunology, gene therapy, tissue banking, food industry, micro-refrigerators and mechanical freezers, etc. \r\n",
