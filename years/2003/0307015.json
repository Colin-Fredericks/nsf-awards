 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial financial support in the amount of $10,000 for the symposium entitled \"South Dakota Plant Physiology/Plant Biochemistry Symposium: From Plants to Genes and Back Again\" to be held at South Dakota State University.  The symposium is organized by the committee for the South Dakota Robert H and Katherine Burris Distinguished Lecture Series in Plant Biochemistry.  The symposium will be held at South Dakota State University in Brookings SD from the 6th to the 8th of August 2003.  Topics for the presentations will include metabolism, abiotic/biotic stress, development, and signal transduction.  The intellectual merit of this symposium is significant.  At other meetings, data and discussions are presented in concurrent sessions.  This symposium has been designed to allow for integration of knowledge generated in all four areas.  There will be no concurrent sessions.  It is believed that the ability to view the whole picture will greatly improve our chances of understanding the biological issues involved in diseases, stress conditions and developmental problems.  In terms of a broader impact, we believe that a more integrated plant biology approach will facilitate solutions that diminish crop loss, enhance the quality of the food supply and create new markets.  Another intellectual merit to this symposium will be the analysis of the role of genomics in understanding plant biology.  Leaders in the various fields of plant biology have been invited to discuss to the extent to which whole plant biology questions have been resolved with the application of the various genomic and/or proteomic approaches.  It is our aim to determine the impact of results from the various genome sequencing projects on advancement of plant physiology and biochemistry.  We believe that the limited symposium size will allow for vigorous discussion among scientists in different fields of plant biology who are utilizing the various genomic technologies.  The interdisciplinary nature of the symposium will also allow us to discuss future directions for plant biology in the post-genomic era.  One of the broader impacts of this symposium will be the involvement of young scientists by providing them the opportunity to present their research and, most importantly, including them in the critical discussions that will determine the directions in which plant biology should proceed.",
