The program will have two main thrusts: (1) a theoretical and simulation effort to design and optimize the high-performance APDs and (2) an experimental program to fabricate, characterize, and distribute the APDs. Commercially-available APDs have been widely deployed in 2.5 GB/s optical receivers but have not achieved the anticipated performance advantage at 10 GB/s and it appears unequivocal that they will not be adequate for future 40 GB/s systems. The PIs propose to significantly improve APD performance by introducing new structures and materials based on APD technologies that have recently been developed by the PIs. These include (1) the development of evanescently coupled waveguide structures and (2) the incorporation of optimized impact-ionization engineered multiplication regions. The availability of high-performance APD receivers at 40GB/s as well as 3 to 5 dB improvements in the sensitivity of 10GB/s receivers will have a momentous impact on high-capacity optical transmission systems.\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the program is the development of human resources who will be trained to work in this critically important field. The students who work on this project will become experts in their particular area and will gain extensive understanding in the field of optoelectronics. Of particular note, one of the participating institutions, the University of New Mexico (UNM) is a minority-serving institution (40% of the undergraduate students belong to minority groups including members of several Indian tribes), which gives the PIs the opportunity to recruit undergraduate and graduate students from a pool of under-represented groups. The PIs continue to bring into the classroom relevant elements of their research experience. Both of the PIs' institutions have been actively involved in and advocating web-enhanced instruction.\r\n\r\n",
