 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of smart sensing and innovative health monitoring framework based on smart sensors will require a major paradigm shift involving advanced sensing, micro-processing, signal processing, wireless communication, and damage identification algorithms. The proposed research seeks to develop a multi-sensor data fusion information framework for aerospace structural health monitoring using smart sensors. The smart sensors are capable of exciting diagnostic signals, measuring physical parameters, interpreting and collaborating the data into information, and communicating with a monitoring station over a wireless link. The MICA platform developed at UC Berkeley will be used as a basis of this research. The work is targeted at developing an active distributed smart sensing system for quantifying and visualizing location and sizing of damage in aerospace structures in near real-time. The ultimate goal of this investigation is to provide flight crews or ground control center with a versatile and powerful tool to visualize the damage at high-stress or flight-critical areas.\r\nThis study will identify and address basic scientific and engineering challenges toward establishing SHMS in aerospace structures. Due to basic design constraints of miniature smart sensors, results from this research will advance such SHM systems by addressing fundamental limits along with conflicting constraints imposed by power sources, collaborative computing efficiency, signal processing technology, and wireless tradeoffs. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for a novel wireless smart sensor network technology for near real-time intelligent monitoring of complex aerospace systems and a broad set of physical phenomena. It is envisioned that the proposed work will significantly advance scientific and engineering knowledge in the areas of sensor technology, digital signal processing, innovative SHM algorithms, damage reconstruction and visualization, and laboratory methodologies with measurements. \r\nThis is an NSF 03-512 (Sensors Initiative) project.\r\n",
