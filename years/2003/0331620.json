 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  national glass fiber network to serve 100 million households with two-way\r\nsymmetric data communications service at 100 Mb/sec per household will\r\ninevitably be constructed during the next few years. The barriers to the\r\ncreation of such a network are not simply questions of deployment issues or\r\nthe cost of the network.  Rather, fundamental innovations will be required in\r\nthe way networks are organized and managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project uses a three pronged approach to investigate the possibilities and\r\ntechnical consequences of this once-in-a-century event.: (1) a holistic\r\nnetwork architecture designed from first principles, (2) interdisciplinary\r\nfundamental research that addresses the design of an economical, robust,\r\nsecure and scalable 100x100 network, and (3) proof-of-concept network\r\nimplementations to demonstrate how the network of the future can be built.\r\n\r\nThe results from the project will take several forms.  First, the blueprint\r\nfor the 100x100 network will offer a coherent intellectual framework on how\r\nthe next generation network could be built.  The resulting architecture and\r\ndesign can serve as a compass to guide investment in network development, and\r\nwill be disseminated to government and industry through presentations and\r\npartnerships.  Second, in preparing the 100x100 blueprint, fundamental\r\nresearch advances will be made in security, economics, protocol design, switch\r\narchitecture, and network management.  These will be disseminated through the\r\nresearch community.  Third, the physical testbeds created through the project\r\ncan be used as a platform for further studies, for example, the development of\r\napplications demanding high bandwidth or social science research on the impact\r\nof connectivity in the home.  Forth, the software and tools used to design and\r\nvalidate the 100x100 network, particularly the emulation systems, will be used\r\nto create new curricula for network education for two- and four-year colleges.\r\n\r\n",
