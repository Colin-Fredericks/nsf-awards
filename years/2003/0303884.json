 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exploration of Nanoscale Plasmonic Circuits\r\n\r\nFor future developments in nano-technology, it is essential to provide connecting mechanisms that allow controlled information and energy transport at the nanometer-level. Because of the higher operating frequency, optical interconnects provide a much higher information carrying capacity than electronic interconnects. Unfortunately, conventional dielectric optical interconnects cannot be scaled down to the nanometer regime due to the diffraction limit of light. We propose to take advantage of plasmon-polariton excitations in metallic nanostructures to route information at optical frequencies, at approximately the speed of light, and in the nanometer scale that have been not been accessible through optical means. In particular, we will design, fabricate, and characterize a set of basic building blocks, such as nanowires, ordered arrays of nanoparticles, etc., that can be utilized to build interconnecting structures of complex architecture and function.\r\n\r\nThe success of this exploratory program could provide a fundamental breakthrough in establishing the basic feasibility of a new optical information exchange mechanism at nano-scale. This program will provide a wonderful training opportunity for graduate students in an exciting emerging field of study. We will take advantage of the existing Research Experience for Undergraduate program at Stanford University, which provides support for undergraduate students participating in research in the summer. In addition, Fan and Brongersma are currently collaborating to develop a course in micro and nanoscale photonics to be taught regularly starting this upcoming winter quarter. The course promises to bring the excitement of nano-scale photonics, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, to students from a wide range of disciplines including Physics, Applied Physics, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering, and Material Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
