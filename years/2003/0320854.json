 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) under the direction of Dr. Marilyn Cruz-Alvarez and Dr. Takashi Ueda for the acquisition of equipment for an undergraduate research program in Biotechnology. The equipment includes environmental chambers for growth of plants and plant cultures under controlled conditions. Availability of this equipment is essential both for faculty research in Biotechnology as well as for training of undergraduate students in the program. By enhancing the infrastructure of the new Biotechnology program it will aid in the recruitment of high quality faculty and students at FGCU.\r\n\r\nPurchase of the equipment will facilitate current research on basic aspects of plant development. In particular the equipment will be immediately used for two federally funded projects involving the analyses of the structure and function of two plant genes. One is a novel cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) gene that may be involved in cauliflower curd formation. The other is a buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) gene encoding an antioxidant enzyme found in a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans. The equipment will be shared by current and future faculty in the program and therefore it will have an impact on additional research projects. The equipment will also be extensively used for educational purposes. The curriculum of the Biotechnology program at FGCU emphasizes hands-on training and extensive participation of undergraduates in faculty research. Students will benefit from the equipment by using it in the laboratory components of courses such as Molecular Genetics, Methods in Biotechnology, Cell Biology, Plant Physiology, Plant Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry and Developmental Genetics, as well as for independent research conducted under individual faculty supervision. \r\n\r\nAvailability of the equipment may have a broader significance considering the potential biotechnological applications of the research for which it will be used. Characterization of the plant genes mentioned above, for example, may lead to a better understanding of the development of edible parts in cultivated varieties of Brassica oleracea, such as cauliflower, broccoli or Brussels sprouts, or of the processes of plant seed desiccation and germination. Future applications of this research may include manipulation of the formation of the edible parts in vegetable crops and generation of drought-resistant crops. In addition, the availability of the equipment will enhance research opportunities for students at FGCU and it will aid in better preparing them for graduate studies or jobs in the biotechnology industry.  A strong research program and generation of a well-prepared workforce are expected to make the Biotechnology program a center for attracting biotechnology companies to Southwest Florida leading to economic growth and further development of the region.\r\n",
