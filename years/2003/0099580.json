 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will support efforts by the University of Utah Gamma Ray Astronomy Group in observational investigations of high energy astrophysical phenomena using the Whipple and VERITAS ground based telescopes.   Both of these instruments use the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov imaging Telescope (IACT) technique to record the faint flashes of optical light emitted by gamma rays as they interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The University of Utah will participate in the operation and analysis of data from the existing Whipple observatory, as well as participate in the design, construction, operation, and analysis of the new VERITAS observatory, supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Smithsonian Institution as well as by international agencies in England, Ireland, and Canada. \r\n\r\nThe success of the IACT technique has led to the founding of a new field of astrophysics: Very High Energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy, which has provided numerous contributions to many fields of astrophysics and fundamental physics. Discovery of gamma-ray emission from super massive black holes in nearby galaxies has led to new understanding of the energetic processes occurring in these objects, and have also allowed study of infra-red radiation fields generated by galaxy formation in the early universe. The unknown origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be directly probed to their source through gamma ray emission at their source objects such supernova remnants. The nature of our three-dimensional space and time and the possible presence of additional dimensions may also be studied using VHE gamma rays.  This research will support observational activities with VERITAS and Whipple, with an emphasis on these studying extragalactic infrared radiation fields, searching for the missing `dark matter' in our Galaxy, searching for evidence of extra dimensions associated with quantum gravity, and exploring new techniques for high-resolution observations of nuclear cosmic rays.\r\n\r\nThe University of Utah Gamma Ray Group will design and construct the calibration, Level 1 trigger, and Cables/Connectors systems for the VERITAS Observatory. The University of Utah plays a major role in the simulation and analysis efforts associated with the VERITAS and Whipple science goals.  Utah will develop detailed simulations of Whipple and VERITAS detector response, and use these simulations to optimize observing strategies, electronic triggering configurations, and analysis procedures. The Utah gamma ray Group will also provide these simulations to the Whipple/VERITAS collaboration for use in scientific analysis of the VHE gamma ray observations.     \r\n\r\nThe University of Utah Gamma Ray group will participate in Educational Outreach programs at the community, University, and State/National levels.  This support will continue these existing activities and enhance them through development of the University of Utah as an educational outreach node associated with an Education/Public Outreach Initiative under development for VERITAS.",
