 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shi\r\n     The investigator develops and studies some\r\nreaction-diffusion models of population ecology and of pattern\r\nformations of biochemical systems.  The spatial distribution of\r\npopulations can be affected by depressed growth rate at lower\r\ndensity, which is called the Allee effect.  For instance, it can\r\nbe caused by shortage of mates, lack of effective pollination,\r\nor harvesting.  The main goal is to gain insight into the ways\r\nthat Allee and harvesting effects and dispersal behavior\r\ninfluence the persistence and extinction of species and the\r\nsuccess or failure of biological invasions.  New mathematical\r\ntools in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential\r\nequations and nonlinear functional analysis are developed to\r\nstudy the complicated dynamics.  Emphasis is on the nonlinear\r\nphenomena that can not be obtained through linearization and on\r\npatterns in higher spatial domains that can not be observed in\r\nsimplified one-dimensional problems.  The project is guided by a\r\nseries of practical problems, from fishery management, animal\r\naggregation, and autocatalytic reactions.  A second line of the\r\nproject is focused on a pattern formation mechanism, generalizing\r\nthe pioneer work of Alan Turing.  A nonlinear and higher spatial\r\ndimensional mechanism is established to refine Turing pattern\r\ntheory, which has been successfully applied to phenomenological\r\nmodels, empirical substrate-inhibition systems, and autocatalytic\r\nreactions.\r\n     One part of the project studies the impact of human\r\ninterference on the natural evolution of marine species.  In the\r\nsecond part of the project, the investigator considers the origin\r\nof the generation of complex patterns found everywhere in the\r\nnature, like seashells and spotty patterns on a zebra or a\r\nleopard.  These studies aim to understand and control many\r\nimportant natural phenomena, such as the persistence and\r\nextinction of commercial marine species, and complex pattern\r\nformations in biochemical processes.  Results of the project can\r\nbe helpful for formulating policy on managing commercial\r\nfisheries and forests, and for developing new biotechnology\r\nsimulations of natural life forms.\r\n\r\n",
