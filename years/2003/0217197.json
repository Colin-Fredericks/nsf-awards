 "awd_abstract_narration": "OBJECTIVES: Virtual environments are increasingly being called upon to advance science learning.\r\nWith possibilities for interactive multimedia displays and learner customization, these environments hold\r\ngreat promise. But are these environments friendly to girls? Computer games, designed by young men for\r\nboys and young men, epitomize technology's exclusion of girls, their interests, and values. Less obvious\r\nbut more devastating, this technological estrangement exacerbates girls' lack of interest and self confidence\r\nnot just in computers but in science. Technology itself and even the design of technology-enhanced science\r\nexperiences may disadvantage girls, turning them away from SMET instead of engaging them. Experts\r\nurge more women and girls to become involved in software and hardware design, to begin to transform\r\ncomputer culture. The ihInvolving Girls as Designerslg (IGD) project will look at what can happen when\r\ngirls design their own technology-enhanced science learning experiences. Do girls and boys approach the\r\ndesign process differently? If so, what are the characteristics of a girl-friendly design process? Do all-girl\r\ndesign teams create products that are more appealing to other girls than products designed by all boy\r\nteams? Are gender differences more strongly polarized by the end of middle school, or are they equally\r\nevident even in fifth grade?\r\nMETHODS: IGD will invite small teams of girls to experience and critically assess a series of high quality\r\nscience-learning experiences diverse in their technology and extent and form of interactivity, ranging from\r\nplanetarium show to role play simulated mission to Mars, from CD-ROM games to exploring space science\r\non the web, television to immersive virtual reality. These young, newly expert technologists will then\r\ndesign their ideal science learning experience, with the goal of teaching science and inspiring kids to be\r\ninterested in SMET. IGD will profile girl reactions to the diverse forms of science learning. The design\r\nprocess and design outcomes of the all-girl design teams will be analyzed and compared to all-boy teams.\r\nIGD will compare fifth grade girls (whose enthusiasm for science parallels boys) with eighth grade girls\r\n(whose enthusiasm and self confidence in science has declined), looking for similarities and differences in\r\ntechnology attitudes, design process, and design outcomes. Professional software developers will create\r\nvisualizations of each team's prototype. With no indication of the gender of the designers, each set of\r\nvisualizations will be shown to same-age students to discover whether boys and girls prefer prototypes\r\ndeveloped by their own gender.\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: IGD will test the assertion that involving girls as designers can impact\r\ndesign process and product and describe gender and age differences. IGD will contribute concrete\r\nunderstanding of girls' attitudes toward diverse forms of technology-enhanced science learning.\r\nBROADER IMPACTS: IGD could provide compelling evidence to software developers about the critical\r\nimportance of involving girls as designers and ways of enabling girl-friendly design processes. IGC could\r\nprovide guidance to teachers and curriculum designers about choosing among technology-enhanced science\r\nlearning experiences. The PIs teach graduate design research classes (in education and digital media\r\ndesign). They will involve their students in the research and integrate findings into their courses. New\r\nunderstanding about girl-friendly science education designs will be incorporated into the Mars Pioneer\r\nLearning Adventures initiative and into the overall Comm Tech Lab software design process and College\r\nof Education and Digital Media Arts curricula.",
