 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team brings together expertise in state-of-the-art spin-tunneling science with proven success in fabrication and characterization of single-electron transistors.  The goal here is to understand science in spin-based nano-fabricated structures by probing the quantum states and dynamics of spins on nano-sized islands, laying the foundation for a new generation of ultra-fast and non-volatile electronics. This program begins with the fabrication of simple nanostructures based on proven single-electron transistor architecture and processing, with ferromagnetic electrode(s) to inject polarized spins.  These new nanoscale hybrid structures will be used to test various theoretically predicted phenomena such as enhanced magnetoresistance, single-electron charging effects, conductance oscillations, and spin diffusion. One of the novel features of this effort is to inject fully polarized spins into nonmagnetic materials such as carbon nanotubes, nonmagnetic metals, and superconductors, by spin filtering through the use of a magnetic semiconductor. Ultimately, the localization of a single-electron of controlled spin in a highly sensitive nanostructure will enable novel and more versatile spin-based devices, which so far is being pursued based on the behavior of large numbers of spin-polarized electrons. This program represents an excellent opportunity for the students (of all levels) involved being educated in the nanoscience; participate in a true team effort with complementary and collective goals. The students will work in multidisciplinary areas - physics, materials science, and nano-devices, getting trained and educated in the spin-based research laying the foundation for future technology, which is already in short supply in the U.S. \r\n%%%\r\nThe recognition of electron spin as a binary variable analogous to its charge as currently used in semiconductors, opened new fields of science and technology that have already led to commercial devices, called spin electronics. This interdisciplinary team will address the underlying fundamental science and engineering research issues that are critical to the emerging field of nanoscale spin electronics (also called as spintronics). In spite of the recent progress and potentially promising for applications, the field of spintronics just beginning to unravel, (remains largely unexplored) and requires extensive research efforts.  The proposed research (elucidating spin transport including spin tunneling and injection from a ferromagnet into a nonmagnetic metal, superconductor or a semiconductor) holds great promise for nanoscale science and future information technology. This aim is supported by the investigation of promising new materials combinations for spin transport and the development of powerful, innovative probes of spin dynamics in nanostructures. This team, with complementary knowledge and expertise - of physicists, material scientists and electrical engineers, will efficiently address all the issues from the conceptual level to the near-device stage.  The proposed program will ultimately lead to novel spin electronic devices that meet the criteria for low power, broadband, and ultra high density including extremely powerful computers. Many PhD students, and importantly undergraduates and high school students will take part in this program under the guidance of the PIs and postdoctoral fellows. The training will generate future scientists and engineers in high demands in the area of nano-science and spin-based information technology to maintain the future technological prowess of the country, critically necessary for the national security. \r\n***\r\n",
