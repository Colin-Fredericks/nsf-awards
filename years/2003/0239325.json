Efforts will focus on doped chalcogenide and oxide semiconductors recently shown to be suitable spin-injection materials in prototype spin-based light emitting diode devices and to support room-temperature ferromagnetism. The research will combine innovations in chemical preparative methodologies with physical investigations involving sophisticated spectroscopic and magnetic instrumentation, with emphasis on ligand-field electronic absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopies. These studies will allow correlations to be explored between synthesis, electronic structure, and magnetism. Fundamental research in these areas will yield new insights into the properties of nanoscale DMSs that may contribute significantly to the way such materials are made and applied technologically in the future. This multidisciplinary research will prepare participating students with advanced expertise in the areas of physical, inorganic, and materials chemistries. These research activities will be complemented by synergistic educational activities having the common theme of enhancing the opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Washington to study materials chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis PECASE award supports research into the synthesis and characterization of nanoscale diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) materials important to the field of spin-based electronics (\"spintronics\") technologies. The central objectives of the research project are (a) to synthesize high-quality nanoscale DMSs and (b) to study these materials by optical, magnetic, magnetooptical, and electrochemical methods. This research will emphasize the development of room-temperature solution methods for preparing, handling, and performing chemistry upon high-quality internally doped oxide and chalcogenide DMS nanocrystals. Exploratory research into the design and construction of prototype magnetic superstructures involving DMS nanocrystals as building blocks will also be initiated. This multidisciplinary research will prepare participating students with advanced expertise in the areas of physical, inorganic, and materials chemistries. These research activities will be complemented by synergistic educational activities having the common theme of enhancing the opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to study materials chemistry at the University of Washington. The educational activities will involve a balanced combination of new course development, departmental program development, and regional advocacy of materials chemistry studies among academic institutions in the Pacific Northwest. This project is supported jointly by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nThis project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.\r\n\r\n",
