His joint work with R. Roberts and M. Stein\r\ninvolves using the theory of group actions on tree-like objects\r\nto investigate foliations of 3-manifolds.  His joint work with\r\nR. Guralnick on actions of symmetric and alternating groups on\r\nk-sets is used to investigate monodromy groups of branched\r\ncoverings of the Riemann sphere.  His joint work with M. Wachs\r\nand others on graph and hypergraph complexes has applications\r\nin commutative algebra, finite group theory and knot theory.\r\nHis work on topology of order complexes of intervals in subgroup\r\nlattices is intended to provide a new approach to a longstanding\r\nproblem in universal algebra.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator works on various problems in\r\ncombinatorics.  Roughly, combinatorics is the study of discrete\r\n(often finite) mathematical objects which admit fairly elementary\r\ndescriptions but whose structure can be quite complicated.  It is\r\noften the case that problems in other disciplines (such as computer\r\nscience, electrical engineering and biology) and other more\r\ntechnical and abstract areas of mathematics can be reduced to\r\ncombinatorial problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
