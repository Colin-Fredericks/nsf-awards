 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) will provide undergraduate summer research opportunities through our \"Ecology in Context\" program through funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Each summer NSF provides support for 10 students who will carry out cutting-edge investigations of their own design, working closely with a mentor scientist.  The program emphasizes the community nature of the scientific enterprise.  As participants design and complete their independent research projects they consult with other scientists, present their plans for critique, and then speak in our annual Undergraduate Research Symposium and write a paper for a peer-reviewed IES Occasional Publication.  The program provides students many opportunities to reflect upon and think about the process of science and its place in the world.  Seminars and informal meetings provide for training in many facets of the research process.  Through a case study of a regional environmental issue, a career forum, and a day spent teaching high school students from a nearby city, students explore the social, political, intellectual and personal dimensions of being an ecologist.  The twelve-week program provides undergraduate students $3,600 stipend and free housing in an Institute dormitory.  Some assistance is also provided for travel to and from the program.\r\n\r\nFor more information and to apply (applications must be postmarked by 15 February 2003):\r\nLook at our website at:  www.ecostudies.org/education/reu/reu2.html\r\nOr contact Heather Dahl (Undergraduate Research Program) at (845) 677-9150 or dahlh@ecostudies.org. \r\n",
