 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department at the State University of New York at Binghamton seeks to enhance its undergraduate biology program in genomics and proteomics, which currently consists of a computer-based problem-solving course in Genomics and Proteomics. We are adapting the proteomics course from Vassar College. With acquisition of proteomics equipment including an Ettan MALDI-Pro mass spectrometer from Amersham, we are establishing a hands-on, interdisciplinary, inquiry-based Proteomics Laboratory course. Students are learning standard tools of proteomics: 2-D electrophoresis for protein separation and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MS) for protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing. Students are learning the techniques as they carry out incrementally more complex exercises. This is being followed by an investigative research project under the mentorship of faculty members from the biology, chemistry, psychology and bioengineering departments. These faculty mentors are enhancing the course instructors' efforts by providing research direction, tutelage in sample preparation, assigned readings, and financial support to cover supply costs. Students commit to an additional semester of independent research in the faculty mentors' laboratory to ensure that they complete a high-quality research project and develop proficiency with proteomics tools. Students belonging to groups underrepresented in science are being strongly encouraged to take the course. In addition, use of the mass spectrometer is being incorporated in summer workshops for faculty and students from nearby colleges as well as in 8 other biology, chemistry, and bioengineering courses, with annual enrollments of 771 students. We are disseminating results through a website, educational journals, and presentations at the ASM and ASPB professional society meetings.\r\n",
