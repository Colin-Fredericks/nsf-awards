 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mueller\r\nWhalley\r\nHealy \r\n\r\nEmbedded systems with temporal constraints rely on timely scheduling\r\nand a priori knowledge of worst-case execution times.  Static timing\r\nanalysis derives safe bounds of WCETs but its applicability has been\r\nlimited to hard real-time systems and small code snippets.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses these limitations of timing analysis for\r\nembedded systems. It contributes a novel approach to program analysis\r\nthrough parametric techniques of static timing analysis and provides\r\ninnovative methods for exploiting them.  The proposed techniques\r\nexpress worst-case execution time as a formula with the following\r\nbenefits. First, static timing analysis becomes applicable to a wide\r\nclass of embedded systems with variable loop bounds. Second, the\r\nbenefits of parametric timing analysis provide new opportunities for\r\ndynamic and flexible scheduling decisions. Third, timing abstractions\r\nthrough the parametric approach enable the analysis of much larger\r\nprograms than in the past.  Finally, the techniques of static timing\r\nanalysis, currently constrained to hard real-time system, become\r\napplicable to a much wider range of embedded systems with soft timing\r\nconstraints. The broader impact is to increasingly expose students to\r\nembedded systems and to provide essential temporal assurances, which\r\nare a prerequisite for applying the results of hard and soft real-time\r\nscheduling for reliable embedded systems of national and economic importance.",
