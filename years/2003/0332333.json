These investigations often involve some notion of\r\nconvexity, and include the following categories: (i) Shadows (or\r\nshades) on illuminated hypersurfaces, and their application to\r\ngeometric variational problems; (ii) Embeddings of manifolds in\r\nEuclidean space without creating parallel or intersecting tangent\r\nlines (totally skew embeddings), and their relation to quadric\r\nhypersurfaces and nonsingular bilinear maps; (iii) Global\r\nproperties of locally convex hypersurfaces with boundary,\r\nincluding connections with Monge-Ampere equations, and a new\r\nconvex hull property which is dual to that of negatively curved\r\nsurfaces; (iv) Certain deformations of space curves (unfoldings),\r\nand their application to study of extremals of knot energies and\r\ndistortion.\r\n\r\nCurves and surfaces are to geometry what numbers are to\r\nalgebra. They form the basic ingredients of our visual\r\nperception, and inspire the development of far reaching\r\nmathematical tools. For instance, those aspects of the PI's work\r\ndealing with shadows on illuminated surfaces are motivated in\r\npart by a study of soap films, and have connections to computer\r\nvision (the ``shape from shading\" problems).  Further, the\r\ninvestigations on knot energies may be of interest in studying\r\nDNA. Yet, despite an abundance of potential applications and\r\ncenturies of pure study, there are still numerous open problems\r\nin submanifold geometry and topology which are strikingly\r\nintuitive and elementary to state.  The PI believes that\r\nadvertising these problems at an early stage is an excellent tool\r\nfor sparking the interest of students in mathematical\r\nresearch. With the aid of computer workshops, courses, seminars,\r\nand the lecture series proposed in this project, the PI plans to\r\ncommunicate the beauty and excitement of geometric problems to as\r\nwide an audience as possible.",
