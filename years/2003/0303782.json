The research portion of  this proposal will use experiments to increase the basic  understanding of cellular control of proteolytic processes  during recombinant protein production.  Protease activity  levels will be monitored as well as the cleavage sensitive  peptide bonds determined.  A model will be developed and  refined to improve the control of recombinant fermentations.  This information will have the dual benefit of reducing both  fermentation and downstream purification costs.  The  education portion of the program is focused towards  educating chemical engineers in biotechnology principles to  meet the growing demand for this expertise.  The stress  response in recombinant E. coli will be model system for the  integration of research and education for undergraduate and  graduate students.  ***",
