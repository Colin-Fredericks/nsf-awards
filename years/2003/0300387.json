 "awd_abstract_narration": "0300387\r\nLipson\r\n\r\nSilicon-based optoelectronic switches and modulators at 1.3 and 1.55-um fiber-optic\r\ncommunications-wavelengths for fiber-to-home interconnects and local area\r\nnetworks (LAN) offer the possibility of integrating optical elements and advanced\r\nelectronics on a silicon substrate using bipolar or complementary metal-oxide\r\nsemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Most of the proposed Si electro-optic (E-O)\r\nswitches, however, require long interaction distance and high drive powers for obtaining\r\na significant modulation depth. Long interaction lengths are undesirable in order to\r\nachieve high levels of integration and miniaturization. High electrical powers may induce\r\ncompeting thermo-optic effects.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes a new class of micrometer-size planar Si electro-optic switches with\r\nlow power consumption and high modulation depth.\r\n\r\nThe device is based on a planar Fabry-Perot (F-P) microcavity. Free-carrier\r\nplasma dispersion effect [1,2] is used to modulate the refractive index of the cavity region\r\nby using a lateral p-i-n diode. Both optical field and injected carriers are strongly\r\nconfined in the microcavity using high-index-contrast Si/SiO2 distributed Bragg\r\nreflectors (DBR) and trench isolation. The optical confinement accounts for the small\r\nsize of the structure and its high modulation depth. The carrier confinement accounts for\r\nthe device low power consumption.\r\n\r\nThe PIs preliminary calculations show that a 20-micron long device can have 80%\r\nmodulation depth under 25 microwatt power drives. To the best of their knowledge this\r\ncorresponds to the first practical Si integrated photonic active device.\r\n\r\nThis new class of active devices will function as a building block for active on-chip\r\nSi devices. These devices include tunable filters, tunable grating, modulators,\r\nswitches, adaptive couplers among others. All-optical systems on a chip could become a\r\nreality where inexpensive, compact active and passive devices could be integrated and\r\nmonolithically grown on a chip.\r\n",
