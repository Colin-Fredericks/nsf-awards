 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jarrold is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform experiments that systematically probe the interactions between size-selected, catalytically relevant metal clusters and simple organic adsorbates using anion photoelectron spectroscopy.  The goals are to determine how metal cluster size, geometry, and electronic structure determine reactivity in these systems.  In the educational part of this CAREER award, local high school science teachers will engage in summer research at Jarrold's institution, to develop stronger relationships with university-level scientific material and to learn new teaching tools.  The continuity of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum will be examined as well, in order to devise and test concrete curricular guidelines for demographically diverse undergraduate student populations. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding chemical catalysis has important ramifications for strategic applications such as the petrochemical industry and environmental protection processes.  Outcomes from the supported reseach will impact the development of heterogeneous catalysis.  The educational projects will contribute to improving secondary science education in Chicago-area high schools, and contribute to a more coherent and effective undergraduate chemistry curriculum.\r\n",
