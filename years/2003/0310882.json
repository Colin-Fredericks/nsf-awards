 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual content of the project is concerned with the study of computational\r\ncomplexity, which aims at an understanding of which tasks can be effciently performed\r\nby computers, and which ultimately cannot. There is currently an enormous\r\ngap between the very restricted computations in which the ultimate limitations can\r\nbe analysed using existing mathematics, and the rich variety of tasks, such as the\r\nsearch problems that are NP-complete, where the limitations are currently only conjectured.\r\nThis project is concerned with a new approach to these problems based on implicitly\r\nexponential models. This approach is inspired by quantum mechanics, which\r\ndescribes the transitions in physical systems in terms of well understood mathematics,\r\nnamely linear algebra, but in order to do so works in high dimensions. In this\r\nproject the model of computation is also exponential dimensional, but it needs to be\r\nsimulatable by classical computers effciently in polynomial time. In analogy with\r\nquantum mechanics, complex computations are to be expressed in terms of well understood\r\nmathematics, namely linear and polynomial algebra, but at the cost of high dimensions.\r\nThe questions being investigated center on whether those high dimensional\r\nrepresentations that can express NP-complete and #NP-complete search problems\r\nare within the class that can be simulated in polynomial time. The approach \r\ncan be viewed as a new branch of algebraic complexity theory that is inspired \r\nby quantum mechanics and quantum computation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to broader impacts the societal impact of the research will depend on\r\nits outcome. Since the main thrust is a new view towards efficient algorithms\r\nfor search problems in general, a positive outcome may redefine what is computed\r\nin practice across a wide range of applications. Whatever the outcome the research \r\nwill be carried out in an educational environment that includes an expanding group \r\nof diverse students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows and visitors with interests in \r\nthe broad  research area of computational complexity.",
