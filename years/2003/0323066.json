In male and female rats, somatosensory and visceral sensory information derived from the reproductive organs during mating is particularly important for expression of sexual behavior as well as the consequences of behavior. However, little is known about the neural pathways processing sensory information related to mating. Using expression of immediate early genes, such as Fos, several studies have demonstrated neural activation in the thalamus, amygdala, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis that is specifically related to vaginocervical stimulation in females and copulation in males. Thus, these areas appear to receive sensory inputs related to these events. However, it is yet unknown what spinal pathways relay these inputs to the brain. Recently, Coolen and coworkers have identified a candidate pathway for relay of sensory information related to copulation in male rats. This pathway consists of a population of neurons in the lumbar spinal cord with projections to the posterior thalamus. In the current proposal, the functional involvement of this candidate pathway for processing of sensory stimuli associated with vaginocervical stimulation will be investigated using behavioral and endocrine analysis following lesions and pharmacological manipulations. Together, these studies will fill an important gap in our understanding of neural pathways that process sensory information related to reproductive function in female rats. Sensory inputs during mating are required for neuroendocrine and behavioral changes essential for pregnancy success. Thus, these studies will shed light on the neurobiological basis of these changes and will further advance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of female reproduction. These studies will greatly benefit the research field of behavioral neuroendocrinology and may lead to future development of additional treatments for assisted reproductive technology and female sexual dysfunction. This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, and will promote research opportunities for underrepresented minorities pursuing research careers.\r\n\r\n",
