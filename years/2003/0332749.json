Innovative ideas are solicited from the Keck Graduate Institute, other local universities, and entrepreneurs from the business community. Business/management expertise is provided by Keck's school of management. The venture capitalists collaborate with entrepreneurs to validate their ideas and provide funds and expertise to grow the businesses. Thee local and regional government agencies help disseminate the ideas/technologies to the biomedical and pharmaceutical business communities. In addition, workforce education and training programs at the lead institution will provide the workforce to support the new and emerging companies. Long-term sustainability is a key component of the program.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe long-term goal is to enable these new companies grow over a long period by providing financial, technical and managerial support to create economic well being and new jobs in the region.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in providing a source of new knowledge in the biotechnology area and partner it with managerial/business knowledge and venture funding to create new biotechnology, biomedicine, and pharmaceutical companies. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on creating a new student generation from the underrepresented population with Masters in Bioscience degree and stimulating new economic growth by transforming bioscience ideas into products and services that are beneficial for the economy and the public.\r\n",
