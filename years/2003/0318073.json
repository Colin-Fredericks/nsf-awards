Johnston\r\n\r\n\tAlthough much is known about communication by visual and acoustic signals, little is known about communication by odors, yet this form of communication is of primary importance for the social behavior many animal species.  The time is ripe for increased investigation of olfactory communication.\r\n\tScent marking is one of the primary means by which animals communicate by odors.  This research investigates  the hypothesis that some forms of scent marking a form of competition through which individuals advertise their relative vigor and genetic quality by scent over-marking.  Evidence suggests that other individuals evaluate these  over-marks and use this information for mate choice decisions or during aggressive encounters.  Studies to test these hypotheses will be carried out in the laboratory and in nature. Other laboratory experiments will be carried out on the perceptual mechanisms involved in interpreting scent marks and in the areas of the brain responsible for marking behavior and for evaluating scent marks.  \r\nIn summary, a multi-faceted approach will be taken to understand communication by scent marking and odor signals.  This work will increase our understanding of the sense of smell, communication by odors, social behavior in animals, and the neural mechanisms underlying social and emotional behavior.   \r\n",
