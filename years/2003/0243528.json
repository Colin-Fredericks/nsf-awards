The object is to share information between academic researchers and industrialists, thus leading to timely feedback between the participants that will lead to increased industrially related fundamental research.  This integrated approach  will ensure seamless exchange  and optimal fulfillment of the needs of both industry  and academia.  \r\n \r\nNSF, DARPA, and OIDA will jointly sponsor the OIDA annual forum for the purpose of discussing industrial trends and needs, new technology breakthroughs and public policies with an audience consisting of industrialists, government policymakers  and academia. This extensive exchange of information will promote a smooth transition of technologies, adaptation of policies to meet the real needs of both industries and academia.  In addition, students in training will be given an early vision of their possible careers. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
