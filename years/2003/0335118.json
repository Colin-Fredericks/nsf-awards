The workshop will focus on developing a program between North Carolina State and Vanderbilt Universities on the US side and the Technical University of Berlin, the Max Planck Institute for Colloid and Interface Science, and the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin.  The fields of study for the international graduate program will be self-assembled nanostructures, including surfactant self-assembled structures on solids and in pores, thin films on metals and semiconductors, and biological membranes.  As part of the program, US graduate students will spend part of their PhD tenure in one or more of the Berlin institutions (typically for a period of 6 months or more).  Workshop participants will be drawn from the fields of chemistry, physics, biochemistry, materials science, and chemical engineering.\r\n",
