The primary objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers. In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted to 90 participants. Sessions will be followed by discussions and breaks to facilitate interactions. \r\n\r\nThe proposed conference will take place July 29-August 1, 2003, on the University of California campus at Davis, CA. Housing, meals, and conference facilities will be provided on campus. The Joint Statistical Meetings will be held in San Francisco providing an easy opportunity for conference participants to attend both events. Participants will be statisticians and probabilists whom have received their PhD since 1998 or are expecting to receive their PhD degree by 2004. Each participant will present a talk or poster. Topics will include the gamut of statistical research from theory and methods to applications. There will be four senior speaker sessions in which topics of particular interest to new researchers will be presented. Professor Charles McCulloch from the University of California at San Francisco, Professor Xiao-Li Meng from Harvard University, Professor Jessica Utts from the University of California, Davis, and IMS president Raghu Varadhan from the Courant Institute, have all accepted invitations to speak. Three panel discussions during the conference will cover the topics of journal publications, opportunities in statistics laboratories, and funding.\r\n",
