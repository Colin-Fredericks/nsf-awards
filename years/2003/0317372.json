 "awd_abstract_narration": "Othmer and Stolarska\r\n     The investigators formulate and analyze mathematical models\r\nfor signal transduction, direction sensing, and movement in\r\nindividual, non-interacting amoeboid cells and incorporate the\r\nindividual-based model in models for the collective motion of\r\ntissue-like cellular aggregates in which the cells interact\r\nstrongly.  The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is\r\nused as the model system because it exemplifies both the\r\nfree-ranging movement of individual cells and the collective\r\nmotion of aggregates, and because it is widely used as a model\r\nexperimental system for the study of cell movement.  Current\r\ninformation on movement of Dictyostelium is used in the\r\nformulation of the mathematical models, and interaction with\r\ndifferent experimental groups provides feedback on the validity\r\nof the models.  Suitable computational techniques to simulate the\r\nresulting partial differential equations are developed.  What is\r\nlearned about cell and tissue movement is applicable to\r\nDictyostelium; it can be used in several other contexts,\r\nincluding embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, and\r\nthe immune system.  Macroscopic descriptions based on microscopic\r\nmodels of cell behavior will significantly improve large-scale\r\ntissue simulations and expand the scope of feasible,\r\nmicroscopically-accurate simulations.\r\n     In this project the investigators develop mathematical\r\nmodels to help understand how signal transduction, direction\r\nsensing, and movement in individual, non-interacting cells of\r\nDictyostelium discoideum, a cellular slime mold, contribute to\r\nthe collective behavior of large aggregates of cells.  Directed\r\ncell migration plays an essential role in the early development\r\nand ongoing maintenance of most organisms.  Single-cell organisms\r\nsuch as bacteria find food and avoid repellents by chemotaxis,\r\nleukocytes must detect sites of infection and move toward them in\r\norder to ingest bacteria and cellular debris, and directed cell\r\nmigration is essential for embryonic development and wound\r\nhealing.  Cell migration also occurs in many diseases; in cancer,\r\nfor instance, it leads to invasion and metastasis, and cell\r\nadhesion and motility also have important roles there.  Metastasis\r\nis probably the major cause of death in cancer patients.  The\r\npotential impact of a better understanding of cell motion is\r\nenormous.  Not only is control of motility an important\r\ntherapeutic target for cancer treatment, but cell and tissue\r\nengineering holds the promise to provide new tissues and organs\r\nby in vivo tissue regeneration.  The success of this hinges on\r\nunderstanding the ways that cells attach to natural and\r\nartificial extracellular matrix, as well as the characteristics\r\nof the cell-cell interactions that eventually dictate how cells\r\nmove, proliferate and remodel into new capillaries or other types\r\nof functional tissues.\r\n\r\n",
