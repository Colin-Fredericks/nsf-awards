 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I will explore new structure designs for low light level far infrared detection.  The aim is to develop multi-quantum wells made of III-V nitride semiconductors to achieve operational and cost advantages over existing technologies.  During Phase I, the proposed sensor will be designed and fabricated. Far infrared absorption will be demonstrated at low temperatures. In Phase II, sensor design and fabrication conditions will be optimized. The responsivity, uniformity, and dynamic range of detectors will be measured, and prototype far infrared sensors and focal plane arrays will be produced for governmental and commercial evaluations.  Successful completion of the project will provide lower-cost sensitive detectors for the far infrared operating at higher temperatures than prior art. \r\n \r\nFar infrared sensing and imaging market is over $1 Billion in size, and current technologies rely on cooling and are expensive.  The applications of the technology include but are not limited to infrared imaging space surveillance, public safety and security, and search and rescue operations. Multiquantum-well and superlattice infrared detectors are very promising for space surveillance and imaging applications because of their adjustable band gaps and device structures. They have the potential to detect targets at long ranges in cluttered environments.\r\n\r\n",
