Using mass-selected and non-mass selected ion sources, the growth of thiophenic thin films is examined.  The effects of ion energy, ion fluence, ion-neutral ratio in the source beam, and ion structure are correlated with properties of the grown thin film.  Fundamental information about how organic films can be grown from characterized ion sources is useful for the development of organic electronic devices, flexible solar energy cells, and the understanding of related plasma processing methods.  Professor Hanley and his colleagues at the University of Illinois-Chicago have developed a unique capability to carry out these studies.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Hanley and his coworkers at the University of Illinois-Chicago are examining the growth of organic films using polyatomic ion sources.  Unique polythiophenic films that may have application in flexible solar cell devices have been constructed, and the fundamental understanding of the growth of these films is being pursued.  Ion beam characteristics are compared with the morphology and properties of the grown films in this work. \r\n\r\n",
