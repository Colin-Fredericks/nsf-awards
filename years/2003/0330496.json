 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFiber-optic sensors have become one of the most important sensors for structural monitoring. In\r\nparticular, Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) based sensors used in conjunction with a wavelength\r\ndivision multiplexing (WDM) scheme, where each FBG sensor is dedicated to a sensor channel\r\nwhile sharing a common fiber link and interrogation module, have emerged as the most attractive\r\napproach for implementing large-scale civil engineering monitoring systems. The strength of the\r\nFBG sensor lies in its all-fiber nature. It can be easily connected to the interrogation module by a\r\nfiber link thus bypassing the labor-intensive packaging bottleneck. However, a major obstacle\r\nfacing FBG-based sensor technology in field deployment is the lack of a cost-effective\r\ninterrogation module capable of handling multiple FBG sensors.\r\nHere we propose a novel all-fiber spectrometer as the building block for a low-cost interrogation\r\nmodule. The proposed all-fiber spectrometer consists of an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF)\r\nimplemented directly on a 10-30 cm long single-mode fiber and an on-fiber semiconductor\r\nphotodetector. The spectrometer is built on our prior research experience in tunable all-fiber\r\ndevices for dense WDM fiber-optic communication applications. It combines the merits of an all-fiber\r\ndevice and the wide tunability of an AOTF. The all-fiber spectrometer is compact, light\r\nweight, fast, low cost and has a performance comparable to existing grating-based and Fabry-Perot\r\nspectrometers. In addition, its non-blocking characteristics enables a distributed\r\ninterrogation architecture that offers scalability, interchangeability, and enhanced system\r\nredundancy. Although the primary application of this proposal is on structural sensing, the all-fiber\r\nspectrometer can be developed as a hand held portable sensor system for chemical and\r\nbiochemical applications.\r\nThe basic operating principle of our approach has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Using a\r\nfrequency-shift key (FSK) modulation scheme, we have demonstrated wavelength accuracy of\r\n0.02 nm (this corresponds to a strain of 20 ustrain) for a sensor channel spacing of 1.2 nm with\r\nroom for additional performance improvement. With further reduction of the filter bandwidth,\r\nimprovement of the packaging design, particularly thermally stability, we aim at developing a\r\nprototype multi-section AOTF spectrometer to be field tested in actual civil engineering\r\nstructures to demonstrate the practicality of this new approach.\r\nThe project team reflects a multi-disciplinary effort. Dr. H. P. Lee, the PI, is leading a group with\r\na proven research record in tunable all-fiber devices. Dr. M. Feng has a distinguished research\r\nrecord in exploring various sensors for health monitoring of civil engineering structures. Dr. F.G.\r\nShi brings in much needed expertise in packaging design, simulation, and reliability modeling.\r\nThe research infrastructure is already in place at the PI's home institution, and the California\r\nDepartment of Transportation will provide in-kind support for field trials on its highways and\r\nbridges.\r\nThe proposed projects are expected to have strong impact on research, education, and potential\r\ntechnology transfer. As reflected from the budget, the project is leaning heavily on supporting\r\ngraduate students. Based on our experience at UC Irvine, we also expect active participation of\r\nundergraduate students through the campus-sponsored UROP (undergraduate research\r\nopportunity program) to work with the graduate students and faculty.",
