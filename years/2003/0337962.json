 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has come to play an increasingly important role in an increasingly globalized world economy, especially in developing countries, where FDI has now become the main source of development capital.  While most countries have been offering assorted incentives to attract FDI, many countries continue to impose restrictions on FDI.  It is therefore important to understand the factors that determine FDI policies.  While there are many studies on the determinants of FDI flows, there are virtually no studies on the determinants of FDI policies.  Yet it is important to understand why nations pursue different FDI policies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies.\r\n\r\nThe lack of research on FDI the determinants of FDI policies may be partly explained by lack of appropriate data. There is virtually no cross-country time-series data on FDI policies that is currently available to researchers.  While there are a few sources of information about FDI policies of specific countries, the information is mostly in descriptive form and there is no comparability across countries. More important, one does not have consistent data categorized by country, industry and year cells to allow for proper identification of FDI polices on FDI flows and economic growth.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory research will construct a panel data FDI policies for about 60 countries disaggregated by industry. The methodology used to construct the data is innovative and research project is risky. The project advances research on FDI by constructing a unique database of quantifiable measures of FDI policies disaggregated by type of policy and by industry.  Such a database is not currently available.  The comprehensive dataset on FDI policies will be posted on the World Wide Web and made readily available to other researchers.  In addition, graduate students will benefit from the research project through the use of the data and research experience.\r\n",
