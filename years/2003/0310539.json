 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wahlbin\r\n     Lars Wahlbin and Alfred Schatz first continue their study of\r\nasymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators for the\r\npointwise error in approximating the gradient on each simplex by\r\nthe finite element method.  The problems they consider involve\r\nsolutions with singularities that pose new difficulties.  What\r\nmakes these problems difficult is that one wants totally local\r\ninformation about errors when, in fact, the solution and its\r\napproximation are globally influenced in particular by the\r\nsingularities.  The investigators also look into a priori error\r\nestimates for second order elliptic partial differential\r\nequations with discontinuous coefficients on nonconvex polygonal\r\ndomains, allowing meshes that are highly refined.  The estimates\r\nunder consideration justify the use of refined grids in a variety\r\nof highly singular problems.  Because most refined grids are\r\nconstructed using self-adaptive codes that may have different\r\nmethods of choosing a grid, no a priori assumption is made about\r\nthe distribution of the mesh.  The work described above is carried\r\nout under the assumption that meshes are shape-regular, but\r\nbasically nothing else is assumed concerning the meshes.  If some\r\nfurther local structure is placed on the mesh (so-called one plus\r\nalpha regular meshes), then a limited amount of superconvergence\r\nmay occur (as shown by Xu and Zhang in a particular situation).\r\nThe investigators, together with Zhang, apply this idea in\r\ngreater generality, namely to meshes that are perturbations of\r\nthose symmetric with respect to a point.  The symmetry theory\r\npredicts superconvergent points in many practical situations and\r\nit is important to determine how this stands up under\r\nperturbations.  If even more structure is given to the mesh,\r\nnamely, that it is translation invariant, difference quotients\r\nmay be used for approximating derivatives.  The investigators\r\nconstruct new compact forms of such difference quotients.\r\nFinally, the investigators consider finite element methods for\r\nvisco-elastic problems.\r\n     The investigators look into basic properties of the finite\r\nelement approximation method, widely used in engineering and\r\nscience practice, in industry, in research laboratories as well\r\nas in academia.  The finite element method builds an approximation\r\nto the solution of a differential equation on a region by\r\nbreaking the region into smaller pieces and approximating the\r\nsolution on each separate piece, say as a combination of\r\nfunctions that is easy to compute.  Pasting together the separate\r\napproximations gives a global approximation to the solution.  The\r\nmethod has its roots in the airplane industry and started to be\r\nused in all branches of science and engineering in tne 1960's.\r\nWell over a hundred thousand articles have been written on this\r\nmethod.  The investigators' aim in pursuing the fundamental\r\nbehavior of this method is two-fold: to get a deeper\r\nunderstanding for what the method does, as currently practiced,\r\nand to use this understanding to develop new and better methods.\r\nA particular aspect that the investigators consider is that of\r\nreliably gauging how well the computer method approximates the\r\nunderlying engineering or scientific model, whose exact solution\r\nis of course unknown.\r\n\r\n",
