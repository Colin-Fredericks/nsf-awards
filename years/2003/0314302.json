It consists of a main conference on Statistical Decision Theory and related topics (June 21, 22), a workshop on Bioinformatics (June 19, 20), a workshop on Statistical Consultancy (June 23, 24) and a workshop on Multiple Comparisons and Mixture Models for Large Data Sets (June 23, 24). This series of unique international meetings has long been a major event for presentation and dissemination of Statistical Theory and Methods. In this meeting, as in the previous one, special effort has been made to stress applications to interdisciplinary research and large data sets. In recent years there has been an explosion of new theory and methods that specifically target high dimensional data analysis in interdisciplinary problems of science and industry. These new methods help mine, explore and analyze large data sets. The conference and the workshop will focus on some of these problems and methods. The funding provided by the National Science Foundation will be used to support the main conference and the workshop on Multiple comparisons and Mixture Models for Large Data sets by providing partial or full support of travel with preference for young researchers with no alternative funding and underrepresented groups.    \r\n",
