 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Joseph Spatafora and Mr. Kentaro \r\nHosaka at Oregon State University to conduct the study \"Systematics \r\nand biogeography of the genus Hysterangium\".   Hysterangium is a \r\ngenus of mushroom-forming fungi that produces fruiting bodies below \r\nground. Unlike many of the above ground mushrooms, which can disperse \r\ntheir spores by wind, Hysterangium's spores are only dispersed when \r\nconsumed by animals and deposited with their feces. This fact implies \r\nthat long distance (e.g., intercontinental) dispersal of Hysterangium \r\nis improbable. The distribution of Hysterangium, however, is \r\nworldwide. This can be explained by the hypothesis that Hysterangium \r\nis a rather ancient organism and its present distribution was caused \r\nby the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. Importantly, \r\nHysterangium forms mycorrhizae (beneficial relationships with the \r\nroots) with many different tree species. Because these relationships \r\nare specific, Hysterangium and host trees may have cospeciated. The \r\noverall goal of this study is to develop robust hypotheses for \r\nbiogeography and cospeciation of Hysterangium by collecting and \r\nanalyzing DNA sequences. To achieve this goal, field expeditions to \r\npreviously underrepresented areas, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, \r\nand New Zealand, will be conducted with a special emphasis on the \r\nNothofagus (southern beech) forests.\r\n\r\nHysterangium is an important component of forest ecosystems. It \r\nproduces abundant fruiting bodies, and many animals are heavily \r\ndependent on such below ground mushrooms in their diet. Also, \r\nmycorrhizal relationships of Hysterangium and host trees are \r\nmutualistic. Surveying the Hysterangium flora of Nothofagus forests \r\nprovides a more clear understanding of these ecosystems, which in \r\nturn facilitates more proper forest management. Despite the fact that \r\nfungi are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth, \r\nbiogeography of fungi is poorly understood. This study will provide \r\nmore accurate understanding of biogeographic and cospeciation \r\npatterns of mycorrhizal fungi with Hysterangium as a model organism.\r\n",
