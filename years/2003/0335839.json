 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the serious shortage of qualified mathematics and science teachers in the State of Louisiana.  In response to this problem LSU is piloting a new teacher certification program that relocates the preparation of secondary school teachers from the College of Education to the arts and sciences departments. The centerpiece of the new program is a series of four professional practice seminars comprised of disciplinary and education courses scheduled in adjacent time slots and co-taught by arts and sciences and education faculty.  The Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics each offer 6 credit hours of course work in the discipline designed to be especially relevant to future secondary school teachers, and to be taught in conjunction with College of Education course work.\r\n\r\nStudents in STEM subject areas can obtain a major in their mathematics or science discipline and meet all state requirements for secondary school teacher certification within four years.  Alternatively, students completing their undergraduate STEM major without choosing the teacher education concentration can enroll in the LSU Holmes style graduate level teacher certification program.  The objective of the new program is to nearly triple production of STEM secondary school teachers from about 30 per year to about 80 per year. \r\n\r\nThe Robert Noyce Scholarships raise the profile of these programs and provide incentives for the most talented STEM undergraduates to opt for teacher certification.  The intellectual merit of the project is the powerful re-conceptualization of STEM teacher preparation founded on current research findings on what can be done to cultivate a competent, stable teaching force.  The broader impact of the program lies in its potential to serve as an exemplary model for secondary teacher programs at other state institutions. \r\n\r\n",
