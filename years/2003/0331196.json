 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualization in Earth and Ocean Sciences:\r\nExploring the use of Immersive Visualization Technology in Informal Science Education\r\n\r\nThis project is exploring ways to combine cutting edge visualization technology, large-scale databases, and current scientific research to create public and school programs for interactive science centers. The prototype collaboration between a leading research institution and a public outreach organization is being carried out at the University of California San Diego's Scripps Insitution of Oceanography and the Birch Aquarium.\r\n\r\nImages, movies, and activities developed by this project are available through the Digital Library for Earth System Education (<a href=\"http://www.dlese.org/' target=\"_blank\">DLESE</a>).  Teaching modules, designed to support teacher and student efforts to achieve mastery of the content and practice articulated in the National and California science standards, are based on topics such as:\r\n* The structure and dynamics of tectonic plate boundaries: deformation as seen from space;\r\n* Global seismicity: why, where and how;\r\n* The structure of the Earth;\r\n* The Earth's oceans: bathymetry, hydrography, and the ocean-climate connection;\r\n* Data manipulation and presentation: distinguishing between evidence and explanation; and\r\n* Interplanetary studies: a comparison of Earth, the Moon, and Mars.\r\n\r\nFor the installation at the Scripps and Birch locations, pre- and post-visit understanding of the concepts and content are  carried out in order to support formative and summative evaluation of the project. Evaluations are also being carried out in student pilot program classrooms and with teachers involved in the Teacher Institutes.",
