The institution will expand the Ph.D. program to graduate significant numbers of minority students with advanced degrees in the materials science area. A diverse team of researchers has been assembled to study the entire spectrum of technology related to synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of structural nanocomposites. The three research subprojects of the CREST center are: (i) Synthesis and Analysis of Structural Nanocomposites, (ii) Modeling and Manufacturing of Structural Nanocomposites, and (iii) Performance Evaluation of Structural Nanocomposites. These research activities constitute a systematic and logical expansion of studies of the synthesis, modeling, and manufacturing of advanced composites (including nanocomposites) performed by the research team under the current CREST Center.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the fact that the benefits of nanoparticle infusion into a polymer are being harnessed for the manufacture of nanophased structural composites using a comprehensive approach. These structural composites will consequently have significantly superior mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Fulfillment of the stated objectives will expand knowledge of the science of nanoparticle-polymer interactions as well as provide, in the short term, comprehensive technical information on a new generation of structural materials.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activities include the fact that a large number of African American graduates, including many at the Ph.D. level, will be produced in an emerging area of materials science and engineering. Such graduates should become role models for many young minority science and engineering students in years to come. Moreover, these graduates will help bring much-needed diversity to the nation's advanced technological workforce.\r\n",
