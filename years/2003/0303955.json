Developing a multiscale constitutive model for nanocomposites is essential to obtain a fundamental understanding of their nanostructure - macro-property relationships.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to explore the overall constitutive relationship of a-Al-reinforced amorphous nanocomposites in terms of a multiscale approach starting from the microstructure at nanoscale. The overall strengthening and deforming behavior of the nanocomposites will be investigated from nanomechanics framework and homogenization procedures. Specifically, the dependence of overall mechanical properties on nanoparticle sizes will be particularly emphasized. Further effects of the nanoparticle concentration, local particle interaction, and interfacial debonding will be formulated. The proposed multiscale model is valid for general three-dimensional loading conditions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research effort would provide direct determination of the intrinsic mechanisms of material structure-property relationship at the nanoscale. Furthermore, it would provide an opportunity for performing interdisciplinary research and cross-disciplinary education in the emerging field of nanostructured materials. This multidisciplinary nature of the project requires fundamental changes in how students are educated and trained for careers in these fields.\r\n",
