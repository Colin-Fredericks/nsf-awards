 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of the proposed research project is the development of a new class of self-sensing materials, which have the ability to mange data flow from the sizable number of embedded sensors by use of local processing techniques. To be addressed first will be the fabrication issues to include the electronic, sensing and connection elements within a fiber-reinforced composite. Initially the work will be directed to demonstrating a proof-of-concept self-sensing material, capable of monitoring temperature flow patterns with the composite. Miniaturized MEMS based sensors capable of measuring such quantities such as acceleration, rotation and acoustic emission will be developed Hierarchical algorithms will be developed to manage the data expected from the sensor network. \r\n\r\nThe 5-year research will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team made of Principal Investigator who is a civil/materials engineer and three Co-Principal Investigators who span mechanical, physics and applied mathematics. On-going research by the PIs in the area of fabrication of composites with tailored electromagnetic properties will provide a foundation for the proposed research. The proposed research includes collaboration with Lucent Technologies, which would provide substantial expertise and capability in MEMS fabrication and facilitate the technical transfer of the research outcome. \r\n\r\nThe project includes three specific outreach programs to engage high school and undergraduate students, and a plan to establish a Summer Research Program and summer internship for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThis is an NSF 03-512 project.\r\n___________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
