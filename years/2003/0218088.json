 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmon\r\n0218088\r\nThe Andrews LTER program seeks to understand the long-term dynamics of forest and river\r\necosystems of the Pacific Northwest. The Central Question guiding Andrews LTER research is:\r\nHow do land use, natural disturbances, and climate change affect three key sets of\r\necosystem services: carbon and nutrient dynamics, biodiversity, and hydrology? These\r\necosystem services represent scientifically and socially important, tractable variables, and their\r\nresponses are posited to represent different classes of ecosystem behavior at the landscape scale.\r\nClimate, land use, and natural disturbances are the major drivers of change in the Pacific\r\nNorthwest region. The approach used to address this question will be multi-faceted involving\r\nretrospective analysis, time series observations, experiments, and use of simulation models for\r\nsynthesis, extrapolation in time, and interpolation in space. The principal spatial scale of\r\ninference for LTER studies is the Andrews Forest and adjacent upper Blue River watershed, an\r\narea of 16,000 ha. Work associated with the LTER will be coordinated with studies aimed at\r\nregional questions. The principal temporal extent of proposed LTER studies spans the past 500\r\nyr and to several centuries projected into the future. This proposal represents the strategic plan of\r\nactivities designed to advance science for individual disciplines, integration, and cross-site\r\ncomparisons. Thus, the Andrews LTER is used as the core of a larger set of integrated studies.\r\nEssential long-term studies will be continued and others added to increase spatial and\r\ntemporal overlap of scales. The standard 5 LTER core activities will be addressed by work in\r\nseven component areas: (1) climate, (2) hydrology, (3) disturbance, (4) ecophysiology,\r\n(5) carbon and nutrient dynamics, (6) biodiversity, and (7) stream-forest interactions. In this\r\ngrant cycle, studies continue to examine the interaction of the drivers of change and responding\r\nprocesses and taxa, but the conceptual emphasis will be on temporal behavior, its causes, and\r\nits consequences for ecosystem change. We will examine temporal behavior over time scales of\r\ndays to hundreds of years focusing on: (1) modulation, (2) temporal lags, (3) spatial coherence,\r\n(4) path dependence, (5) hysteresis, and (6) alternative stable states. Exploring these aspects of\r\ntemporal behavior help to address the Central Question by quantifying natural temporal\r\nvariability and providing insights into mechanisms that control processes. A major goal will be\r\nto test predictive rules (i.e., hypotheses) regulating temporal behaviors. Another focus of\r\nsynthesis will be small watersheds, an important landscape unit providing opportunity for\r\nintegration of climatic, ecosystem, and hydrological processes as well as knowledge of temporal\r\nand spatial scaling. The ultimate goal in this integration is to create a spatially 3-dimensional\r\n(including subsurface and air flow) understanding of the temporal dynamics of the 3 states of\r\nmatter involved in biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles within a watershed. Past experiments,\r\nlong term records of climate, stream flow, nutrient exports, and vegetation change, as well as\r\nmodeling will enhance this integration effort. By understanding this key landscape unit, future\r\nbroader-scale efforts will be strengthened.\r\nAndrews science and scientists continue to advance understanding and management of\r\nforests and streams of the Pacific Northwest through communication with students, teachers,\r\npolicy makers, land managers, and the general public. Information management, an essential\r\nactivity for both research and education, emphasizes ease of use, increased accessibility, and\r\nportability of many forms of information.",
