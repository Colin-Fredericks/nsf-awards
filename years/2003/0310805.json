 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sizes of problems that need to be solved in modern applications\r\nhave grown enormously.  Sampling to draw a (small) subset of the data\r\nto store in main memory and process in detail is thus a natural\r\nalternative to computing on the entire data.\r\nThe project addresses the questions of how well the answers from a\r\nsample approximates answers to the full problem for many optimization\r\nproblems that go under the name of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. \r\nThe project also considers problems where the input data consists of\r\nmatrices or higher dimensional arrays. Here adaptive sampling (where\r\nthe probability of sampling a piece of the data depends on its\r\nrelative importance) has been successfully used by the PI and others\r\nrecently. The existing results are to be improved.  Adaptive sampling\r\ncalls for making more than one pass through the data. The project will\r\nstudy models of computation, where the number of passes is measured as\r\nan important resource.  This is expected to contribute to the\r\ndiscussion of models to handle large data.\r\n\r\nA third part of the proposal is to continue the \r\nPI's study of rapidly mixing Markov Chains, both\r\nby developing new general techniques and applying to\r\nspecific problems like the computation of volumes of\r\nconvex sets.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The research is expected to have broad\r\nimpact since the processing of massive data via sampling is of\r\nenormous importance in modern computing. The\r\nPI teaches specialized courses at Yale and \r\nhopes to disseminate the results of\r\nthe research to students through the courses.\r\n",
