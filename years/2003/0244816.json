 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on two areas of nuclear physics\r\nresearch. The first area is the realization of the basic\r\nsymmetries of the strong interaction in the low energy\r\ninteractions of the nucleon. The second topic is the\r\ndetermination of the Fermi coupling, a fundamental\r\nconstant in electroweak theory.\r\n\r\nEncoded in quantum chromodynamics are various symmetries.\r\nIn general these internal symmetries yield conserved currents\r\nthat constrain the interactions of pions and nucleons.\r\nOur experiments address the signatures of chiral\r\nsymmetry and isospin symmetry in low energy\r\nprocesses. The manifestation of chiral symmetry and\r\nisospin symmetry is rich and complex, and involves\r\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and explicit symmetry\r\nbreaking. Further their realization is deeply connected with\r\nthe origins of hadron masses, the effects of quark masses,\r\nand the special nature of the pion. Our proposed experiments\r\non muon--nucleon interactions and pion-nucleon interactions\r\nwill address two puzzles in our current understanding\r\nof how both chiral symmetry and isospin symmetry are realized\r\nin low-energy interactions of pions and nucleons.\r\n\r\nElectroweak theory is the fundamental theory\r\nof electromagnetic interactions and weak interactions.\r\nThe theory is based on two local symmetries which\r\ngenerate two gauge forces. Through the interaction\r\nbetween these gauge fields and the Higg's field the\r\nbosons mix and acquire mass, thus yielding the massive\r\nW, Z bosons that mediate weak interactions, and the\r\nmassless photon the mediates electromagnetic interactions.\r\nThe interactions are determined by three parameters,\r\nwhich themselves are fixed by measurements of the fine\r\nstructure constant, the Z boson mass, and the Fermi coupling\r\nconstant. We are undertaking a new measurement of the\r\npositive muon lifetime to obtain an improved determination\r\nof the Fermi coupling constant. The Fermi coupling constant\r\nis an input parameter in all electroweak calculations,\r\nand combined with other quantities it permits\r\nboth important tests of the standard model and key constraints\r\non the physics beyond.\r\n\r\nThis experimental research is conducted with beams\r\nof pions and muons at the TRIUMF Laboratory in Vancouver,\r\nCanada, and the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich, Switzerland.\r\nThe relatively small-scale of our experiments offers both broad\r\nopportunities and excellent training for undergraduate students,\r\ngraduate students and post-doctoral researchers.\r\n\r\n",
