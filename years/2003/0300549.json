 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project is to develop a more fundamental understanding of drill performance, behavior of cutting tools and materials on burr and chip formation, and hole surface finish quality and diameter. This understanding will be used to develop manufacturing engineering tools for designing and implementing efficient drilling processes in precision components, such as aerospace and automotive parts. The approach used will rely on joint collaboration between the University of California at Berkeley and Boeing. A detailed study of the process variables will be made and analytical tools (finite element, primarily) developed to aid engineers in designing optimal drill methods for application in the precision manufacturing. Specific elements of this study are: 1) develop a finite element model of single layer drilling, 2) evaluate and model drill bit-geometry and materials, 3) develop a finite element model and simulation analysis of multi-layered drilling, and 4) development of an experimental database on burrs/chips formation in drilling.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will result in a methodology for process modeling and optimization of hole quality and an associated database of verification that will be the basis for engineers from design to process planning to factory floor trouble-shooting for effective drilling method optimization. The benefits will include: 1) streamline and standardize drilling methods for similar application, 2) standardize drill hardware and significant inventory reduction, 3) reduce cycle time (60 - 80%) from process design to production transition, and 4) create opportunity for existing and new process improvement. This will result in better yield, higher quality and reduced costs. Student participation at Berkeley will result in an excellent training experience and preparation for industry careers or additional study.",
