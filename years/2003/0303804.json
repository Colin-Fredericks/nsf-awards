 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will demonstrate molecular scale computation, initially with a molecular switch and then via the construction and operation of molecular scale logic gates. In accord with the high risk nature of the NER program the approach is based on an entirely new concept -reduction/ oxidation switchable magnetic ordering. The idea is to use an electroactive bridge between metal ions to gate magnetic communication between two or more metal ions ON or OFF.\r\n\r\nKey challenges and (proposed solutions) are:\r\n(i) Measuring the strength of metal-radical-metal magnetic communication in switch ON and OFF states. (ii) Maximizing the strength of magnetic coupling and ease of switching through metal ion and ligand modification. (iii) Utilizing molecular magnetic switches to construct molecular scale logic gates.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Single electron and single molecule processes play a fundamental role in all branches of chemistry. Therefore, the creation, study and dissemination of results in this area has a strong educational component for students directly or indirectly involved in the research, for other researchers in the field, and for anyone whose imagination is captured by the possibility of performing computation at the single molecule level. \r\n\r\nResearch and Education Themes: The project is focused at the intersection of (a) Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and Quantum Control (b) Nanoscale Devices and System Architecture (c) Manufacturing Processes at the Nanoscal\r\n",
