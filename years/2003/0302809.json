 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration brings together two research laboratories from the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNYSB) in the U.S. and the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi in Mexico to study several fundamental issues of polymer and clay nanocomposites that can have potential applications of benefits to both countries.    These issues include  (1) the development of new pathways to prepare thermoplastic polymer-clay nanocomposites with direct commercialization importance, (2) the applications of advanced in-situ characterization methods (X-ray, Raman and rheology) to understand the structure and property relationship during processing, and  (3) the modeling of clay morphology in nanocomposites based on in-situ X-ray, Raman and rheological studies. The two teams have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. scientists (Hsiao and Hsu) have considerable experience in synchrotron X-ray scattering, rheological characterizations and structural modeling of complex nanostructured materials and the Mexican scientist  (Medellin) is an expert in polymer nanocomposite technology.\r\n\r\nAn immediate benefit of the project is that the proposed activities will produce tight links between two scientific institutions in the US and in Mexico.  The project takes particular advantage in exploring the variations of clay materials between Mexico and the United States.  The fundamental approach may overcome several pressing problems encountered in the commercialization of polymer/clay nanocomposites today. Furthermore, based on a better understanding of clay exfoliation, clay morphology and orientation during processing, and unique blends of U.S. and Mexican clays, the potential exists to develop highly attractive new commercial products for tomorrow.  The project includes the training and the exchange of students and scientists between the two countries. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
