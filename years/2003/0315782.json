 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mogilner\r\n     The investigator develops deterministic and stochastic\r\ntwo-dimensional computational models of the lamellipodia of fish\r\nkeratocyte, fibroblast and nematode sperm cells.  He derives and\r\nanalyzes model equations for (i) protrusion of the leading edge,\r\n(ii) contraction of the lamellipodial cytoskeleton, and (iii)\r\nturnover and regulation of the lamellipodial cytoskeleton.  The\r\nequations are integrated into the realistic two-dimensional model\r\nof the lamellipod.  Simulations of the model equations on a free\r\nboundary domain produce maps of movements, forces and shapes that\r\nare compared with available experimental data to validate the\r\nmodels.\r\n     The investigator uses a novel combination of mathematical\r\nanalysis and computer simulations to develop explanatory and\r\npredictive models of migrating cells.  Cell migration is\r\nfundamentally important in morphogenesis, wound healing, and\r\ncancer.  It is based on a complex self-organized mechanochemical\r\nmachine.  Some relevant velocities, forces, rates and\r\nconcentrations have been measured, but minute details of\r\nintegration of forces, movements and chemical reactions into the\r\ncell migration are unclear.  The investigator's goal is to\r\nunderstand quantitatively the molecular basis of cell movements.\r\nThe models allow testing plausible scenarios of cell movements.\r\nThey provide a new interdisciplinary level of understanding cell\r\nmovements and new methods of predicting cell behavior in\r\nimportant medical and technological situations such as cell\r\ndivision, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and wound healing.  Students\r\nand postdoctoral researchers are involved in the project,\r\nenhancing the development of a trained workforce at the critical\r\nintersection of mathematics and biology.\r\n",
