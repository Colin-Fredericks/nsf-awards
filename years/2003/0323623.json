 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental program centered on the implementation and investigation of continuous-variable (CV) quantum information. This program is based on the use of ultra-stable optical parametric oscillators (OPO) above threshold, emitting bright entangled fields. Significant experimental challenges associated with these systems, such as the need for exquisite frequency- and intensity-stability of the OPO, have been overcome recently by our group by use of brute force approaches involving sophisticated optical design and electronic servo-stabilization. The objectives are the generation of CV GHZ states, the realization of a quantum optical teleportation network (including CV entanglement swapping), and the implementation of quantum error correction. These studies fit in the broader scope of applying quantum optical CV to quantum computing.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed activity comprise graduate education in Physics and the development of interdisciplinary collaborations with other Departments and Schools at the University of Virginia, in particular in the context of the University of Virginia 2020 Initiative for the Sciences. In addition, the PI is active in the teaching and dissemination of quantum physics and quantum information in Virginia high schools.\r\n\r\n",
