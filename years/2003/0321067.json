 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Alaska Anchorage under the direction of Dr. David  Pfeiffer for the acquisition of research-grade light microscopic instrumentation. This grant will improve basic but essential research instrumentation in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA). This department conducts a diverse range of research activities, spanning molecular levels through ecological levels of study. Two particularly strong research focus groups have emerged in this department: Systematics & Ecology and Cell Biology & Physiology. A critical need for research-grade light microscopic instrumentation now exists in each of these core groups. The current need for this instrumentation has been fueled by recent departmental growth but extends beyond the level of individual researchers to the  inter-departmental and institutional levels as well. UAA is striving to integrate research and educational activities from different fields of science. Central to this mission is having appropriate instrumentation in place that will permit collaborative efforts between faculty working in different disciplines and enhance opportunities for student involvement in research activities.  \r\n\r\nIndependent research by faculty is one of the primary drivers for engaging the interest of students in science classes. A suite of research-grade light microscopic instrumentation will not only strengthen independent research by faculty in this department, it will provide a set of tools for directly involving undergraduate students in faculty supervised research. This use falls in line with UAA's mission to achieve excellence in scientific education through developing new ways to engage students in the process of learning. The geographical position of UAA places it in a prime location to broaden the participation of underrepresented students, such Alaskan Natives, in these processes. Graduate student training will also directly benefit from this instrumentation.",
