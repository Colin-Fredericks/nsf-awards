Lucas and Adam Robert Boyko\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\tMany toxic animals advertise their distastefulness with bright warning \r\npatterns.  These patterns help predators learn to avoid them, but how the \r\npatterns evolve is poorly understood.  When a warning pattern first \r\narises, predators are unfamiliar with it and attack the pattern \r\ndisproportionately.  Only after many individuals share the new pattern do \r\npredators learn to avoid them.  It is difficult to explain how new warning \r\npatterns overcome their initial disadvantage, yet warning patterns have \r\nnot only evolved in numerous species, but they have diversified \r\nextensively in many of them.\r\n\tIn the Heliconius genus of tropical butterflies, new warning \r\npatterns have evolved dozens of times in some species but only once in \r\nothers.  Evolutionary theory predicts that differences in population \r\nstructure between these species are responsible for their different \r\ndiversification rates, but this theory is unproven.  In this study, the \r\nstructure of natural populations of Heliconius inhabiting isolated \r\ntreefall gaps will be measured.  This research will be combined with \r\ncomputational simulations of warning pattern evolution in Heliconius to \r\nsee if evolutionary theory correctly predicts the observed rates of \r\nwarning pattern diversification in this genus.  Alternatively, differences \r\nin sexual selection between Heliconius species may account for the \r\ndifferent diversification rates by promoting or constraining color pattern \r\nevolution.  To examine this possibility, mate choice and mate competition \r\nwill be studied in greenhouse colonies of these species.",
