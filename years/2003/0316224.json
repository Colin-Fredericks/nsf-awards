 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II, an enzyme that carries out the first decoding step from the DNA into RNA for eventual production of proteins in the cell.  The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's or budding yeast) will be utilized for all the research.  The primary questions will be tackled using biochemical and genetic tools--these questions focus on a particular protein, TFIIS, that regulates the progress of RNA polymerase II as it moves along DNA carrying out the decoding reaction referred to as transcription.  Multiple proteins are involved in regulating the transcription process, and the project will identify which of those proteins functions in partnership with TFIIS.  The identification of the proteins is only the first level.  The more interesting questions then move toward understanding how these proteins work in concert with TFIIS to increase the activity of RNA polymerase II in transcription of the correct genes at the correct times in the cells.  In addition to looking at those proteins that partner with TFIIS, this research will identify the full spectrum of genes in this model organism that are responsive to the effects of TFIIS.  This work will have implications well beyond this model organism, as TFIIS is a highly conserved protein that also has relatives that function similarly in many other types of organisms.  Indeed, RNA polymerase II is itself a highly conserved protein, and what this project learns about its regulation will be transferable almost directly to knowledge about the regulatory action in other organisms.  Much of this research will include the direct laboratory participation of high school and community college faculty in order to draw them into the larger scientific research community; their experiences are expected to enrich their teaching and thus the success of students in their classrooms.",
