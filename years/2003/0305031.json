 "awd_abstract_narration": "AGI will provide cataloging of resources for the DLESE Broad Collection.  Cataloging is performed by GeoRef staff who have degrees in geoscience-related fields, experience in the classroom and training in cataloging, abstracting and/or indexing.  The DLESE Board Collection should grow between 1500-2000 items per year through this direct cataloging effort.  Resources for cataloging will come from the following DLESE-based sources:  resources identified through the efforts of the Evaluation Core Services; Community Core Services Exemplars; and the resources identified through the DWEL project, but not included in DWEL's reviewed collection.  The metadata framework has undergone changes during the initial development of DLESE.  Some fields have been added to the current DLESE cataloging system and other fields have been changed both in content and application.  Consideration is being given to expanding the application of the national education standards to resources.  Audience fields have been adjusted during the development of the file.  Geospatial parameters will undergo change with the implementation of the new framework.  The Earth System Science (ESS) vocabulary is currently being reviewed and is expected to be ready for implementation to begin within the next year.  A separate Metadata Workshop will consider the metadata structure and the backfilling needs across DLESE.  Priorities for backfilling will be identified as a result of that workshop.  Given that the final decision on priorities will not be made until the Metadata Workshop is complete, reasonable assumptions for backfilling priorities are that backfilling would be seen as essential for, at least, the Earth System Science (ESS) vocabulary and the national science standards.  By the time the ESS vocabulary is complete, approximately 4000 catalog records would require backfilling for the ESS vocabulary.",
