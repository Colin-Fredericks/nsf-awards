 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, mobile computing has enjoyed a tremendous rise\r\nin popularity and has been used in various sectors of the society. \r\nSensor networks, Ad hoc wireless networks, and Peer-to-peer networks \r\n(simply called SAP networks) play a central role in the development of \r\nemerging network paradigms. These three networks are characterized by \r\ntheir ad hoc nature without infrastructure or centralized administration.\r\nUnlike infrastructured networks, including cellular networks, where nodes \r\ninteract through a centralized base station, nodes in an SAP network\r\ninteract in a peer-to-peer fashion. As a result of the mobility (including \r\njoin/leave the network) of their nodes, SAP networks are characterized by \r\ndynamically changing topologies. The applications of SAP networks range \r\nfrom civilian (file-sharing) to disaster recovery (search-and-rescue),\r\nand military (battlefield).\r\n\r\nThe International Workshop on Theoretical and Algorithmic Aspects of Sensor, \r\nAd hoc wireless, and Peer-to-peer Networks brings an international forum on \r\nthe recent development on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of three related \r\nfields.  The workshop seeks to bring together different research disciplines\r\nto initiate a comprehensive technical discussion on theoretical and \r\nalgorithmic approaches to three related fields.  The objective of the \r\nworkshop is to identify several common theoretical and algorithmic approaches \r\nthat can address issues related to SAP networks. The central topic of the \r\nworkshop revolves around the following two questions: What are the central \r\ntechnical issues in SAP networks? What are the possible solutions/tools\r\navailable to address these issues? After identifying areas for research, \r\nthe next focus of this workshop is on future research challenges.  This \r\nworkshop seeks a broad impact through a mix of theoretical researchers and \r\npractitioners (from local industry) and by helping to stimulate collaborations. We believe that theoretical progress on the research topic in the workshop will\r\nhave a long-term impact on SAP networks.  A major theme of the workshop\r\nis the integration of research and education. It is addressed through \r\nparticipation of graduate students, especially from regional universities\r\nin South Florida, which have a high percentage of Hispanic and Black students.\r\n\r\n",
