 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to date a series of samples that were collected during some reconnaissance fieldwork in the Marble Hills, at the southern end of the Ellsworth Mountains, where the WAIS flows into the head of the Ronne- Filchner Ice Shelf.  These glacial erratic samples cover a range of altitudes up to 500 m above the present ice surface and are mostly faceted till stones that were stranded as overriding, glacial-maximum ice retreated from the highest point in the Marble Hills to its present level. The samples will be dated with cosmogenic 10 Be, allowing us to obtain a preliminary thinning history for this largely unconstrained sector of the ice sheet. The results will provide the first numerical dating control on the history of the WAIS in the Weddell Sea region since the last glacial maximum. This new data will constrain ice sheet reconstructions, which up to now have been based heavily on geomorphological observations lacking age control, in the Ellsworth Mountains.  The results will complement marine geophysical constraints on the expansion of grounded ice into the Weddell Sea during the glacial maximum, and mapping and dating of ice limits along the northern coasts of the Weddell Sea. The exposure ages from the Marble Hills will provide an interesting comparison with reconstructions of the time-course of Holocene deglaciation in the Ross Sea and in Marie Byrd Land. Because of differences in climate, bathymetry, and bed characteristics between these regions, comparison of their deglaciation histories will provide insight into the dynamics of the ice sheet, and perhaps help to explain the prolonged WAIS retreat in and around the Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea is also an important site of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation, and it may act as an important link between the WAIS and the global climate system. Because an expanded ice sheet in the Weddell Sea would have altered the distribution of AABW production, knowing the timing of deglaciation is important for understanding the establishment of present-day patterns of ocean circulation.  \r\n\r\n",
