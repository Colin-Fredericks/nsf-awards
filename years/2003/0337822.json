 "awd_abstract_narration": "The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) initiated by\r\nthe US National Science Foundation (NSF) in late 1999 is intended to transform the nation's ability to carry out earthquake engineering research, With over $80 million in new cutting-edge tools for experimentation, networking, data curation and communication, the best minds in the earthquake engineering field will be able to challenge and solve the most difficult impediments to reducing the nation's vulnerability to earthquakes. NEES will fundamentally change the processes by which earthquake engineering research is\r\ninitiated and performed, accelerate the generation and dissemination of basic knowledge, facilitate the development of effective educational programs, minimize the lag between knowledge development and its application, and hasten the attainment of the nation's goals for earthquake loss reduction.\r\n\r\nTo accelerate attainment of NEES' goals, and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, US investigators need to have access to data and facilities available internationally, and to be able to collaborate and share data with experts in their or related fields around the world. The US earthquake engineering community has already achieved a distinguished record of international collaboration, which will be heightened through NEES. To promote international collaborations, a World Forum on Collaborative Research in\r\nEarthquake Engineering is being convened by the NEES Consortium, Inc. The NEES Consortium is expected by NSF to be a central focal point for international contacts regarding NEES, and has been encouraged to establish linkages and agreements necessary to facilitate international collaboration. The purposes of the World Forum are to convene in the US a representative international group of researchers and research administrators to discuss opportunities for collaboration with the NEES program as well as necessary linkages necessary to facilitate this collaboration. The World Forum will focus identifying (1)\r\nmajor international research programs and facilities; (2) policies or agreements needed to facilitate international collaborative research; and (3) infrastructure resources and standards needed to facilitate international collaboration.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The diversity of talents, backgrounds, experience and disciplinary concerns represented within NEES provides an unparalleled stimulus to intellectual inquiry and education. International collaboration is a key aspect of realizing this vision. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts resulting from proposed activity: The NEES program will provide heightened opportunities for international cooperation. These are associated with various activities, including conduct of international cooperative and collaborative research programs, sharing of unique research facilities and resources, development of international standards and capabilities for documenting, archiving and sharing\r\ninformation, and exchange of personnel. The pool of U.S. participants will include junior researchers, women and members of underrepresented groups, and/or graduate or undergraduate students.\r\n",
