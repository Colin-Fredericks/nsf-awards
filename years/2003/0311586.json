The objective of the project is to provide advanced instruction and laboratory practices in the areas of CAD/CAM through challenging laboratory assignments and industrial projects that are integrated into the curriculum. This project adapts and implements rapid prototyping experiences and educational practices following successful similar models at various engineering schools to enhance pedagogy in Manufacturing and Industrial Technology core design and manufacturing curriculum. Enhanced rapid prototyping capabilities enable the students to build physical models directly from CAD data, where the prototype communicates important information about parts, including engineering data such as fit and limited functional testing, labeling, highlighting, and appearance simulation. The rapid prototyping equipment is used in junior and senior level courses in manufacturing engineering technology, including the senior capstone course, and complements the existing CNC and CAD equipment and software.\r\n",
