 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the foundations of the existing NMI-EDIT work, this proposal intends to set new directions in a number of specific thematic areas within Security, Directories, Virtual Organization (VO) Management, and Middleware End-to-End Diagnostics, while continuing its efforts in Outreach and Evaluation services. Specifically, the proposed work will:\r\n   respond to unmet needs by expanding core enterprise architecture to include important new tools in       enterprise and federated security and in authorization\r\n   complete basic directory service developments, with particular focus on support of inter-realm directory    operations\r\n   establish a framework and associated tools to support critical needs for middleware diagnostics \r\n   provide evaluation and outreach to ensure continuing successful impact of NMI funding.\r\n\r\nAccomplishment of these objectives will have broad impact by:\r\nstrengthening the ability of campus core middleware infrastructure to support research, education, and      administration, and the breadth of campus deployments\r\nfacilitating multidisciplinary, multi-institutional collaboration in many scientific areas through shared      data, digital libraries, web-based services, computing, code, facilities, and applications\r\ncontinuing to leverage user-managed security and privacy in a growing number of applications and provide    the scalable and sustainable architecture that success in middleware requires\r\npromoting and supporting the development of open standards and open source approaches, and encouraging      collaboration with government and international partners.\r\n\r\nThe project's outcomes also are likely to have additional benefits, including seamless and timely integration of research materials into academic courseware; engagement and retention of the best and brightest IT architects from leading campuses and discovery of gems of expertise in unlikely institutions; creation of a community of practitioners, who are developing and refining best practices that have, in turn, accelerated deployments and convergence; and influence on the corporate sector, shaping a federated marketplace that serves higher education requirements for privacy and security.\r\n",
