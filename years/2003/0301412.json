 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this investigation is to formulate and develop \r\nmethods to analyze the complex interactions between noise, symmetries, \r\nand nonlinearities inherent in rotating and gyroscopic systems, \r\nparticularly the dynamics of spinning flexible discs and rotating shafts.\r\n\r\nThe approach consists of a rational construction of low-dimensional \r\nstochastic models that systematically capture essential features of \r\nnoisy mechanical systems. The basis of the proposed work is a \r\ncollection of limit theories for stochastic processes which model a \r\nclass of engineering problems with dominant Hamiltonian dynamics. \r\nFor the reduced model, one seeks standard statistical measures of \r\nresponse and stability; e.g., mean exit times, Lyapunov exponents and \r\nstationary measures, so that it may be possible to design reliable \r\nengineering systems. The proposed work will be a cross-disciplinary \r\none, spanning the spectrum from modeling and novel analytical \r\ntechniques to experimental verification.\r\n\r\nWe plan to transfer to industry innovative theory and simulations \r\ndeveloped in the proposed program which will allow improved design \r\nand greater performance of various rotating systems.\r\nAn integral part of the final outcome of the proposed work will be  \r\nweb-based simulators to be used in senior undergraduate and graduate \r\ncourses and to provide industrial designers with a predictive tool \r\nto avoid unwanted behavior. This will enhance visual understanding of \r\nthe effect of noise on real engineering problems.\r\n",
