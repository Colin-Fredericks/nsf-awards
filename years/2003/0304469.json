 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Lab-on-a-chip Nanomanufacturing in Freshman Engineering,\" at Ohio State University (OSU), under the direction of Dr. David L. Tomasko, is funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).  \r\n\r\nThis project is a novel hands-on design and build experience for freshman engineers led by faculty and graduate fellows from the Integrative Graduate Education, Research, and Traineeship (IGERT) program at OSU in Molecular Engineering of Microdevices.  Freshman students will design, build, and test their own model \"lab-on-a-chip\" using skills from a variety of disciplines.  These devices demonstrate a manufacturing approach to interface nanotechnology to the microscale environment thus emphasizing the challenges and potential of nanomanufacturing.  At every stage of the project IGERT fellows and faculty will lead study modules and lab tours showing the science and technology in the nanoscale domain.  Hence, the students will be engaged in both active learning through hands on micromanufacturing and state-of-the-art nanotechnology research.",
