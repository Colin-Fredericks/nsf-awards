 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2004 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in Hong Kong from March 7 to March 11, 2004.  This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field.  \r\n\r\nAttending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty members.  Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field.   \r\n \r\nThe travel awards will target graduate students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.  The proposal requests funding to aid approximately twelve graduate students to attend this conference. \r\n",
