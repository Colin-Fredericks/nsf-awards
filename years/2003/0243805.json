 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for research on a novel fabrication method for structures with nanoscale features which extend in three spatial dimensions. The bioinspired nanofabrication technique funded under this grant is comprised of two steps.  First, features are defined on a large membrane-like surface using state-of-the-art nanolithography. Then the nanostructured membrane is folded in a prescribed way to yield the three-dimensional functional system. The research will address fundamental questions relating to the design of the foldable nanostructures, including material selection, alignment, interconnection and packaging schemes.  Theoretical modeling will be complemented by development and characterization of experimental prototypes. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will deliver low cost, high yield and high throughput fabrication methods for miniature devices and systems serving numerous applications. The third dimension promises to extend the pace of ever faster processors and higher-capacity memories long after the feature\r\nsizes of planar electronics reach their minimum practical limit.  Beyond electronics, the need to expand to the third dimension is even more urgent.  Examples are drug delivery by miniaturized microfluidic implants, nanocomposite materials, nanomechanical energy storage elements, miniature chemical and\r\nbiochemical reactors and diffractive optics for advanced imaging. Hybrid systems containing several of these components will be useful in homeland security, environmental monitoring, and industrial quality control. Moreover, this research will contribute to the education of nanoscale Engineers who can think in three dimensions and accelerate the development of products and businesses based on nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
