The work will focus on understanding the growth of AMH-3 to guide the synthesis of other three-dimensional microporous layers and to modify AMH-3 to make it compatible with nanocomposite processing techniques and to tailor the gas adsorption properties of the silicate layers.  Characterization techniques will include SEM, TEM, NMR, IR, Raman, gas adsorption as well as synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction at Brookhaven National Laboratory and NIST.  When these inorganic materials are incorporated in polymeric materials, they should retain polymer processability while improving permselective properties due to the superior ability for molecular recognition of the microporous component.  In terms of the broader impacts, this work should have an impact on membrane technology with wider implications in the generation of nanostructured functional materials such as catalysts, sensors and adsorbents.  The work will contribute to the education of graduate and undergraduate students in an emerging area of fundamental interest and of technological and environmental significance. \r\n",
