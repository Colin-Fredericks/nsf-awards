 "awd_abstract_narration": "The VLSI design productivity crisis, that is, the fact that the number of\r\navailable transistors grows much faster than the ability to design them\r\nmeaningfully, has become the greatest threat to the growth of semiconductor\r\nindustry. Silicon complexity, which refers to the impact of previously \r\nignorable physical phenomena, is at the center of this crisis. Based on our beliefs that\r\nthe only effective way to improve productivity is to maintain design complexity\r\nat a manageable level, and that formal methods are the right techniques for\r\ncomplexity control, the objective of this research is to improve design\r\nproductivity by applying formal methods to silicon complexity problems such as\r\ninductive/capacitive couplings and process variabilities.\r\n\r\nThe research develops methodology, models, and algorithms to handle silicon\r\ncomplexity through the application of formal methods. By treating timing \r\nanalysis as extracting semantics of a circuit, a timing analysis system is developed \r\nthat handles both inductive and capacitive coupling delay variations. The system\r\ndevelops and uses a range of inductive coupling models with different accuracy\r\nand complexity. Based on that, timing macromodels for coupling delays are \r\ncreated for library characterization and IP specification. Clock scheduling and \r\nretiming algorithms are developed to separate signal switching times for coupling delay\r\noptimization. Signal switching time information is also explored in routing and\r\nplacement to minimize coupling between sensitive wires. For process \r\nvariability, statistical models are developed and combined into the timing analysis \r\nsystem to compute the statistical performance of a circuit, and stochastic \r\noptimization is used to optimize the statistical performance. The integrated education \r\nactivities aim at two aspects of computer engineering education: 1) educating students in\r\nformal methods, especially their applications to nanometer VLSI design, thus\r\nbringing needed mathematical rigor into the discipline; 2) introducing students\r\nto silicon complexity and its impacts on VLSI design so that they are equipped\r\nwith necessary background for modern high performance VLSI design.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
