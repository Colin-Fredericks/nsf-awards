 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental understanding of the kinetics of phase boundaries, and \r\nmore broadly hysteresis, remains an open challenge in the study of \r\nactive materials.  The lack of kinetic information is a consistent \r\ndifficulty in various problems including dislocation mechanics and \r\ngrowth of thin films. The research in the current award, though \r\nfocussed on active materials, will impact these areas.  There is now \r\nan accepted framework to model this based on the notion of kinetic \r\nrelations, but it is phenomenological in that it does not address why \r\nsome phase boundaries are more mobile than others and how one can \r\nchange the mobility. This project examines through computation and \r\nrigorous mathematics whether one can derive a kinetic relation \r\nstarting from a more fundamental or smaller scale description of \r\nmaterials in the context of displacive phase transformations. Two \r\nscales are of particular interest, atoms and defects.  First, the \r\nproject seeks to understand the atomic-continuum linkage by starting \r\nfrom an atomistic (discrete) model capable of phase transformations \r\nand passing to the continuum in such a manner that captures the \r\nessential dynamics of the phase transformation process.  Second, the \r\nproject seeks to understand the role of defects such as vacancies, \r\nimpurities and second phase precipitates in determining the overall \r\npropagation of a phase boundary.  This leads to the mathematical problem of \r\nhomogenization of a non-local free boundary problem.\r\n\r\nActive materials like shape-memory materials and ferroelectric \r\nmaterials possess unusual but useful properties that make them vital \r\nfor a variety of applications like dental braces, cardiac stents, \r\nspace antennas, ultrasonic devices, pressure sensors and \r\nmicroactuators.  The unusual properties arise from very \r\ncharacteristic and intricate patterns that these materials can form \r\nat a microscopic scale.  Over the last \r\ndecade, much advance has been made in understanding the nature of the \r\nmicrostructure, its relation to basic crystallography and its \r\nconsequences for material properties.  In particular, a sophisticated \r\nmathematical theory for static microstructures has emerged, and this theory has had \r\r\nimportant practical impact by predicting and explaining new phenomena and applications. \r\nHowever, much remains unknown regarding how the microstructure \r\nchanges as we apply stress to these materials.  This is important \r\nsince it determines an important property of these materials known as \r\nhysteresis or shape memory.  Work supported by this award will \r\nbuild a mathematical theory of the evolution of microstructure.  \r\nIt will also train graduate and undergraduate students in research in \r\nthe emerging and important area of multiscale modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
