 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis symposium on contemporary approaches to endocrine signaling is part of the annual meeting for the Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology (SICB).  It addresses technical innovations that are now being applied to unconventional model organisms.  Participants in this program possess expertise in neuroendocrinolgy, endocrinology, animal behavior, and developmental biology. The symposium will engage both senior and junior ranked scientists and students in discussions of the application of these new techniques that have been derived from more traditional model organisms, such as laboratory rodents. Introduction of new people to the society is enhanced by the international nature of this meeting being held in Toronto, Canada. Travel funds will allow participants to attend the meeting.\r\n\tThe impact of this will extend to numerous fields of study, as mentioned above. In addition, the meeting will foster scientific education by training graduate and undergraduate students to participate in comparative biological research armed with a clear understanding of this sophisticated technology. A further impact will be made when these discussions are published in the journals:  Integrative & Comparative Biology and General & Comparative Endocrinology.\r\n",
