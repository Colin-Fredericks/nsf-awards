 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)  This project involves systematically exploring the use of individualized questions and exercises in the context of programming-related courses. This approach is adapted from the Michigan State CAPA system that has been used in teaching physics. That system demonstrated its potential to help a larger percentage of the students to complete the course successfully as well as to help female students to bridge a traditional gap with their male classmates. A proof-of-concept system, QuizPACK, has already been developed. In the course of this project, the prototype system is being expanded in several aspects, and a series of studies will be run to find the most effective way of using this technology in programming-related courses.\r\n\r\nIn terms of intellectual merit, the project will extend the understanding of the role and place of individualized questions and exercises as an educational tool in programming courses as well as provide guidelines to researchers and practitioners. \r\n\r\nUnder broader impact, this project may provide an improvement in teaching programming-related courses (similar to the one achieved by CAPA in physics courses). These courses serve as the basis in computer science, information science, and information technology programs that have a critical value for the economy and security of our country. The PI hopes to influence the teaching of programming-related courses through dissemination of the research results and availability of the QuizPACK system to the community.\r\n",
