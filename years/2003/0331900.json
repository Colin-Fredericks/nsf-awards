CMS proposal 0331900\r\n\r\nPI: Robert Reitherman, CUREE\r\nThe NEES Consortium is holding its first Annual Meeting May 21 and 22, 2003 in Park City, Utah. The meeting will bring together a core group of future participants in NSF's NEES (George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) initiative. The program for the event features presentations by NSF program managers to explain timely opportunities for NEES research funding, demonstrations of Equipment Site and System Integration capabilities, and discussions of if grand challenges research possibilities. Information on the Annual Meeting is posted at http://www.nees.org. \r\nThis proposal requests Participant Support to encourage attendance at the meeting, targeting such support for members of underrepresented groups and junior faculty. The Organizing Committee for the event consists of a subset of the in progress NEES Consortium Development Project funded by NSF through an award to the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE). This Organizing Committee will review applications and allocate stipends. \r\n",
