 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to study a variety of free boundary problems.  The first one deals\r\nwith growing polymeric crystallines.  The unknowns are temperature in the\r\nmelt and the growing surface.  The speed of the free boundary is a given\r\nfunction of the temperature, and free boundary points move in such a\r\ndirection so as to minimize the travel time.  We wish to establish the\r\nexistence of the solution and to determine the shape of the free boundary.\r\nThe second problem deals with non-Newtonian jets.  We want to approach it\r\nvia nonlinear perturbation of the linearized case, a case we have recently\r\nstudied.  The next problem is to develop a general bifurcation theory for\r\nfree boundary problems.  Here we expect to be guided by recent work that\r\nwe have done dealing with special models that arise in mathematical\r\nbiology.  In order to determine the stability of the bifurcation, we shall\r\nfirst study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of free boundary\r\nproblems, including the Hele-Shaw problem and the evolution of viscous\r\ndrops.  Subsequently we shall consider the more complicated problems that\r\narise in mathematical biology, such as the evolution of tumors and of\r\nprotocells.  Finally, we shall study the evolution of cracks in elastic\r\nmedia.  We expect to utilize formulas that we have derived for the\r\nevolution of the stress intensity factors.\r\n\r\nFree boundary problems deal with solving partial differential equations in\r\na domain, a part of whose boundary is unknown in advance; that portion of\r\nthe boundary is called a free boundary.  In addition to the usually\r\nprescribed initial and boundary conditions, an additional condition is\r\nimposed at the free boundary, and one seeks to determine both the free\r\nboundary and the solution to the differential equations.  A seemingly\r\nsmall change in the conditions imposed at the free boundary often result\r\nin, technically, an entirely different problem.  Special examples have\r\nhistorically guided research in this field; some of the most commonly\r\nknown examples are flow of liquid in contact with air, air streams behind\r\nan aircraft, solidification of steel, and melting of solid.  Special\r\nexamples motivated by physical models continue to be a driving force in\r\nthe development of the field.  The present proposal focuses on several\r\ndifferent problems dealing with questions such as crystallization of\r\npolymers, jet flows for non-Newtonian fluid (e.g. inkjets), bifurcation of\r\nfree boundary problems arising in biology, nonlinear stability, and\r\npropagation of cracks in elastic media.  In all these problems, the goal\r\nis to prove that there is a mathematical solution to the scientific\r\nproblem and to determine properties of the free boundary.\r\n\r\n",
