 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe investigator studies conditions under which systems of \r\nhomogeneous polynomials in many variables have nontrivial zeros in p-adic \r\ncompletions of the rational numbers.  A conjecture usually attributed to \r\nArtin states that if the coefficients of the polynomials are all integers, \r\nthen such zeros exist in all p-adic completions provided that the number \r\nof variables is large enough when compared to the degrees of the \r\npolynomials, and gives a bound on the required number of variables.  While \r\nthe first part of this conjecture has been shown to be correct, the \r\nconjectured bound is false in general.  However, the bound is correct if \r\nthe prime p is sufficiently large.  This leads to the questions of what \r\nthe correct general bound should be and also how large the prime p needs \r\nto be for Artin's bound to hold.  The investigator studies these questions \r\nin general, and also when the polynomials are restricted to being additive \r\n(i.e. having no cross-terms).  These questions are studied both when the \r\ndegrees of the polynomials are all equal and when they may vary, and are \r\nalso studied in the more general setting where the p-adic completions of \r\nthe rational numbers are replaced by extensions of these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Since the time of the ancient Greeks, a fundamental question in \r\nnumber theory has been to find solutions of (systems of) equations in \r\nwhich all of the variables are integers.  When attempting to show that \r\nsuch solutions exist, it is often first necessary to obtain information \r\nabout the so-called \"local\" solutions.  These are solutions in the number \r\nsystems of \"p-adic integers,\" where p may be any prime number.  In fact, \r\nit turns out that if there is even one prime p for which the system does \r\nnot have a solution in p-adic integers, then it has no solutions in \r\nordinary integers either.  There are also some special situations in which \r\nthe converse holds: if the system has solutions in p-adic integers for \r\nevery prime p, then it automatically has a solution in regular integers.  \r\nHence it is an interesting problem to attempt to determine when equations \r\nhave p-adic solutions.  Such questions are also interesting apart from \r\ntheir connection to integral solutions of equations, since they provide \r\ninsight into the nature of p-adic numbers, and how they differ from \r\nordinary real numbers.\r\n",
