The collaboration will develop a first-principles model for Taylor cone droplet formation through a combination of experimental activities and steady state code development at the Austrian lab, which is a world leader in the development of field emission electric propulsion systems.  FEEP is a technology suitable for spacecraft missions (such as the laser interferometer space antenna) requiring thrusts in the sub-milliNewton level and needing precise control abilities.  The US and Austrian teams will investigate the effects of viscosity, time of formation of Rayleigh instabilities, and convection of vaporizing ions.  A model of those effects will lead to optimized current levels in future FEEP thrusters, thereby achieving maximum mass efficiency for a given thrust.\r\n\r\nThe project also fulfills a training objective.  The project will allow the graduate student involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.\r\n",
