 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biochemical Engineering has evolved dramatically over the last 50 years from a supporting role to a leading role in the applications of biological systems to human health, production of chemicals, food and biologicals, and solving environmental problems. This continuing series of conferences has also seen a large evolution of focus, but has remained central to the vital community of Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology. Biochemical Engineers have always embraced new challenges and modern biology with high energy and enthusiasm. This is no exception for the now emerging era of Genomics (and Post Genomics), Systems Biology, Genetic Medicine, and Bio-Nanotechnologies. We expect that Biochemical Engineering XIII will provide comprehensive coverage of the state of the art and future directions in biochemical engineering. Indeed, this Biochemical Engineering Conference is the premier forum for scientists and engineers who are at the cutting edge of all research directions within Biochemical Engineering. The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas enriches and strengthens the discipline as a whole.",
