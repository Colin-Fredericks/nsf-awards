 "awd_abstract_narration": "Venayamagoorthy\r\n0322894\r\nAround the world the demand for electric power is dramatically outpacing available generation and transmission resources. Furthermore, an increasing number of digital users require a higher quality of electricity. Although a number of power system devices are now used to minimize system losses and to improve voltage profiles of the power grid, the response of these power system devices with the existing control is slower than the rate at which changes in the system occur. In this joint project a U.S. scientist from the University of Missouri-Rolla and two Nigerian scientists from Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University will apply computational intelligent techniques to improve the control response of these power system devices, thus decreasing system losses and improving system voltage profiles at all times. This project's research collaboration and educational cooperation will be achieved via faculty and student exchanges between the U.S. and Nigeria.\r\n \r\nIntelligent coordination of power system devices can improve the quality of service, increase efficiency of the power transmission system, and ultimately decrease the overall production cost. The research findings will have broad application and will contribute to enhancing the operation of electric utilities of both developing and developed countries. \r\n",
