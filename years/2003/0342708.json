We are requesting $15,000 in \r\naddition to the $7,500 being provided by Yale University.  The work of Walter Feit has \r\nprofoundly influenced the development of finite group theory, representation theory, \r\nfinite geometry, coding theory and Galois theory.  This conference will bring together \r\nresearchers in all of these areas, pure and applied, ranging from Feit's great \r\ncontemporaries, such as Serre and Thompson, to the budding young researchers of today. \r\n\r\n   There is no doubt that the mutual interaction of these researchers from different \r\ngenerations, different fields and different countries will be inspirational and fruitful of \r\nnew research breakthroughs and create new networks of research interaction, both in pure mathematics and in applications to the crucial areas of coding theory, cryptography  and computer recognition of groups and combinatorial structures.  The additional funds \r\nrequested here will help to guarantee the international nature of this conference, bringing in leading researchers and students from England, France and elsewhere.  It will also ensure the participation of U.S. graduate students and recent PhD recipients, many of whom are women.  (Six young women participants are specifically mentioned at the end of the project description.)  We also intend to publish and disseminate broadly a set of proceedings of this conference, which will delineate the advances in the field over the past 50 years and point the way for the research and applications of the future.\r\n\r\n",
