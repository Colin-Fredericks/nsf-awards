This has given rise to a demand for efficient designs for these experiments. Development of these designs will require new approaches and new techniques. At the same time, a new generation of enthusiastic and talented researchers in design of experiments will be needed in the years to come to carry out original theoretical and applied research in the emerging areas. The junior researchers of today need to be nurtured and encouraged to assume this role.  In order to address these needs it is intended to bring together senior and junior researchers and practicing statisticians from universities and the industry for a three-day conference in Chicago. The emphasis will be on design of experiments for biomedical and pharmaceutical studies. In particular, there will be featured sessions on: Designs for HIV Studies; Bayesian Methods for Designing Clinical Trials; Chemical Compound Selection from Huge Databases; Crossover Designs; Designs for Random Effects, Variance Components and Hierarchical Models.  The conference will also give prominence to recent innovations in the more traditional areas of experimental design that, besides solving existing problems, enrich the researcher's toolkit.\r\n\r\nThe principal objectives of the conference are threefold: (i) to focus on future new directions of research on design of experiments in the biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences; (ii) to support, encourage and provide stimulus to junior researchers, that is, recent Ph.D.'s and current Ph.D. students, who are working on, or have a strong interest in, design of experiments; (iii) to create an atmosphere for the exchange of ideas and information, between statisticians and researchers in universities and the pharmaceutical industry.  It is estimated that at least half of the participants will be junior researchers, who will be encouraged to give talks and present posters. Other participants will include leading authorities from universities and the pharmaceutical industry. Junior researchers will be provided the opportunity to be matched with a senior mentor. Ample opportunities will be provided for formal and informal discussions.\r\n",
