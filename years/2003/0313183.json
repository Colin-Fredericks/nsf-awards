 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nVarious types of ad hoc wireless networks have been the subject of\r\nmuch recent interest. For our purposes, these networks can be\r\ncharacterized as a set of nodes that\r\ncommunicate with each other over wireless channels using little or no\r\nfixed\r\ninfrastructure. In such a network, to reach its\r\ndestination, a message may need to be forwarded over several\r\nintermediate links. Examples of this type network include mobile\r\nad hoc networks (MANET's), sensor\r\nnetworks, and various hybrid ad hoc/cellular architectures. Such\r\nnetworks\r\nhave the advantages of being rapidly deployable and requiring little or\r\nno\r\nfixed infrastructure. However, efficiently utilizing this type of\r\nnetwork is\r\na challenging task due, in part, to the interference between nodes, the\r\ntime-varying nature of the communication channels, the energy\r\nlimitations of untethered nodes, and the\r\nlack of centralized control via, for example, base stations.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of ongoing research with the goal of\r\nfurthering understanding of basic performance trade-offs for ad\r\nhoc networks. This work takes a  cross layer view and\r\nconsiders both physical layer limitations as well as higher layer\r\nperformance metrics such as packet throughput. Techniques from\r\nqueueing theory, optimization, and information theory will be\r\nutilized in this work. In contrast with our previous work on problems of this type in\r\nsingle-hop wireless settings, or, that is, models more appropriate\r\nfor cases such as cellular networks, where all communication is to\r\nor from a single point, in this project, we are focusing on multi-hop\r\nad hoc networks, with multiple transmitters and multiple\r\nreceivers. In this environment, several new issues complicate the\r\nanalysis. These include the routing and forwarding of traffic\r\nwithin the network and the scheduling of transmission and\r\nreception by each node. Specific problems that are being addressed\r\ninclude\r\ncharacterizing network stability and identifying adaptive resource\r\nallocation policies which maximize packet throughput.\r\n",
