 "awd_abstract_narration": "When humans instruct each other h w to carry out particular tasks,nly a limited number of\r\ntokenized (linguistic)instructions are used.In contrast to this,classic control theory speci .es\r\na control action to be carried out at each time instant.But,in a number f applications,such\r\nas semi-autonomous service robots for industrial and domestic use,intelligent appliances,and\r\ncommunication constrained embedded and/or teleoperated devices,the control procedures have\r\na natural,linguistic .avor.The interpretation here is that linguistic control instructions specify\r\nparticular modes f peration rather than explicit control values.\r\nThe verall objective f this CAREER-prop sal is t develop and disseminate rational meth-\r\nds for understanding how continuous devices,such as mobile rob ts,should be controlled using\r\ncomputer generated,linguistic inputs.In particular,it will be studied how these instructions\r\nshould be de .ned,selected,and coded in rder to minimize the number of bits transmitted from\r\nthe computer t the rob t,while guaranteeing that the system meets its speci .cations.F r this,\r\nan information theoretic approach t control theory will be developed,serving as a useful tool\r\nnot nly for source coding of control signals,but also for describing how symb lic instructions\r\nshould be interpreted and perated n by the continuous systems.Questions concerning what\r\nsensors and actuators to use in a given rob tic application can be addressed quite elegantly\r\nwithin this framew rk as well.\r\nThe development of this program will serve as a foundation for a teaching and research career\r\nin electrical and computer engineering,with particular emphasis n control theory and rob tics.\r\nIn particular,the e .ort will be focused n the following key areas:\r\nHybrid Models: Control theoretic models will be developed for bridging the gap between the\r\ncontinuous (the device dynamics)and the discrete (the linguistic control inputs).The proposed\r\nmodels will give the symbolic inputs a clear,control theoretic interpretation,at the same time\r\nas the expressive p wers of di .erent sets f control inputs can be made explicit.\r\nComplexity Measures and Coding Theory: A complexity measure,corresp nding to the\r\nnumber of bits needed for c ding a particular control procedure,will be proposed.Furthermore,\r\nby establishing probability distributions ver the set f control modes,optimal c ding algorithms\r\ncan be derived.\r\nMulti-Modal and Multi-Agent Control Design: Strings of appropriate control modes will\r\nbe constructed that make the systems meet given speci .cations while keeping the descriptions\r\nshort.F r this we will design control laws that use the available sensory data in an e .cient\r\nway.These results will be extended t multi-agent control where formation maintenance and\r\nobstacle avoidance should be achieved while minimizing the inter-agent communications.\r\nEducational Plan: Due t the multidisciplinary nature f the proposed w rk,the under-\r\ngraduate control curriculum will be modi .ed and tw senior level undergraduate courses will\r\nbe included in the curriculum at the Georgia Institute of Technology.A multi-agent rob tic\r\ntestbed where b th human and computer generated inputs can be used as a basis for the motion\r\ncontrol will furthermore be developed.\r\n1",
