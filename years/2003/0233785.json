 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plan of action:  We will work with a collection of affiliated colleges and universities to create a well-supported pathway to bring students from underrepresented groups to careers in the mathematical sciences.  These affiliates include ones from which we have recruited students in the past and who share our philosophy of strong and complete academic and professional training.   Currently Morehouse College, Bowie State Univ., Florida A&M, North Carolina A&T, Spelman College, Trinity College of DC, and Xavier Univ. are Affiliates.  We are actively recruiting new Affiliates.  An annual Affiliates Workshop will strengthen ties among our institutions and guide and maintain the effectiveness of this program.  Sophomores and juniors will be recruited to participate in a Summer Institute at the University of Maryland.  This Institute will provide both upper level undergraduate academic classes and research experiences to reinforce the students' training and maturity for graduate study.  A Graduate Fellowship Program will offer competitive fellowships to graduates from the Affiliates.  As Fellows in this program, students will be provided complete career training as mentors, educators and scientists.  The Summer Institute will extend to the graduate level, offering academic training in preparation for qualifying and candidacy exams and integration with the department's Research Interaction Team (RIT) program.  Graduate Assistantships will be offered to students to support the program.  These Graduate Assistants will provide classroom support, tutoring, mentoring and advising for the Summer Institute.  A supported Peer Mentoring Program will provide peer mentors to students in the mathematical sciences and will provide supported students with training for mentorship.  \r\n\r\nFunding is for: fifteen undergraduate participants in the Summer Institute, three to four 4-year graduate fellowships per year, TA support both preceding and during the Summer Institute, peer mentoring support, and both recruiting and workshop travel support.      \r\n",
