 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do social movement organizations adapt to openings and constraints in their environment? Do these adaptations increase chances for success?  Much research looks at conditions that allow movements to flourish; but far less attention has focused on how their own work can enhance impact. This research will investigate factors movement actors consider in planning, and the connection between participant actions and results. The researcher will examine social movement influence in a changing global environment through comparative case study of three US anti-nuclear groups that make credible claims to having had measurable impacts on legislation. These groups, the Shundahai Network in Nevada, the Piedmont Peace Project in North Carolina, and the New Jersey Coalition for Peace Action, have been selected for diverse ethnic and socio-economic composition, in order to reflect the concerns of people with varied degrees of access to decision-making and resources.  This qualitative study uses interviews to illuminate individuals' understanding of their issue and how they think through their strategies; participant observation to reveal how they act on these ideas, and give evidence of adaptations they do not verbalize; and focus groups to uncover controversies and shared history. Analysis of current and past internal documents, archival material and media coverage will clarify the groups' messages, actions, and outcomes, and provide a check on the memories of the participants. This project links theory of social movement outcomes with that of political opportunity, while developing methodology to investigate cause and effect relationships in complex social situations. It will have broad impact in exploring social movements as voices of underrepresented peoples and as institutions of popular education important to the functioning of a democracy. Observations provided by this project will benefit society by providing knowledge for organizational self-evaluation; for educating the American public about resolving conflict and influencing government policy; and for working towards a more equitable society. Results will have implications for a wide range of social movement and community organizations beyond those studied.",
