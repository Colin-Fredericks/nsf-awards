 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, which combines research in physical chemistry, molecular physics, and learning algorithm development, focuses on the exploration of coherent control of small polyatomic molecular systems.  The specific aims of the project are to understand the relationship between coherent vibrational motion and neutral molecular dissociation, and to explore mechanisms for controlling fragmentation channels in laser assisted neutral dissociation using shaped ultrafast optical pulses.  One of the key elements of the project is understanding the results of control experiments that make use of feedback and learning algorithms to discover optimal laser pulses shapes for steering a molecule toward a desired reaction pathway.   \r\n\r\nIn a broader sense, the research has significant implications for chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as the research to be carried out will provide new techniques with potential as a new source in CVD, together with basic information about chemical processes essential to CVD.  The work lies at the boundary between chemistry and physics and furthers understanding in terms of both quantum and classical physics as well as frequency and time domains.  Students working on the projects will learn to work in an interdisciplinary environment and understand their observations from a variety of perspectives.  \r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n",
