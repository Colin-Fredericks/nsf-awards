 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project focuses on the computational design of a new class of shape  memory  alloys  (SMAs ). In this project advanced computational design methodology will be used to incorporate precipitation strengthening and demonstrate the feasibility of computationally designing a nanostructured high performance nickel titanium (NiTi) SMA. The computational tools, based on thermodynamic and mechanistic modeling, will  be extended  to  predict  the  nanoscale  Heusler  precipitation  microstructure  and strengthening within a NiTi matrix. Reversible thermoelastic transformation of the matrix will be modeled  with  multicomponent  thermodynamic  modeling  and  martensitic  interfacial  mobility theory.  Integrating the extended models, the predictive design of novel high strength SMAs will be undertaken by  assessing various design strategies and trade-offs. \r\n     Commercially, the most common SMAs are monolithic NiTi, having a wide range of use in markets representing billions of  dollars.  However, along with copper-based SMAs, they have been empirically  optimized  to  their  limits  and  the true  economic  potential  has  yet  to  be  realized.   This  approach promises to lead to the production of robust SMAs, with fundamentally designed characteristics, possessing longer cyclic lifetime and superior performance for both thin film and bulk applications. \r\n\r\n",
