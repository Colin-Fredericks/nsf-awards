The participating countries are Turkey, Greece, Israel and the U.S.   Academic chemical engineers from other Eastern Mediterranean countries will also be invited. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nAn important objective of the PI's visit will be to establish new collaborations with Greece and Turkey to complement current interactions (with Technion University, Israel) in the area of understanding crystallization mechanisms across semicrystalline polymer interfaces with a view to improve processing and to strengthen the interface. The collaborations will bring new insights to some of the research that the PI has performed with NSF support and will enable submission of a new collaborative proposal to the CTS Division of NSF.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe insights developed in the research will be critical in the design of semicrystalline polymer interfaces in applications such as microelectronics packaging, composite materials, and artificial organs. The interactions between Israel, Greece and Turkey will also enable graduate students to be exposed to a multi-cultural environment, which is very important in today's increasingly global perspective.\r\n",
