 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes to provide funding for the development of rigorous quantitative \r\nmethods for the design of lean buffering in large volume production systems and for the experimental verification of the techniques to be developed on the factory floor. The theoretical part of the project will \r\nbe carried out at the University of Michigan; the experimental part will take place at the DaimlerChrysler Detroit Axle Plant.  In this project, the lean buffering is understood as the smallest buffer capacity, which is necessary and sufficient to achieve the desired throughput of a production system. At present, no analytic methods for selecting lean buffering are available and, therefore, production line designers and production managers use simulation and experience-based techniques, which often lead to suboptimal results. The approach of this project is based on analytical investigations of the production lines at hand and subsequent minimization of buffer capacity as a function of machine efficiency, production line efficiency, and the number of machines in the system. This approach will be carried out for production lines with machines having exponentially distributed up- and downtime. For non-exponential machines, the project will develop and verify an empirical law, according to which lean buffering is a piecewise linear function of the downtime coefficient of variation with the slopes defined by the level of lean buffering in the exponential case. These results will be verified experimentally and implemented within the 8.25\" rear axle production system at the DaimlerChrysler Detroit Axle Plant. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this project will provide a theoretical foundation of lean manufacturing. In addition, production line designers and production system managers will receive a simple quantitative tool for designing lean systems. Practical implementations of this tool will contribute to increased competitiveness of the US industry. \r\n\r\n",
