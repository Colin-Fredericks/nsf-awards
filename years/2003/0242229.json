 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Bush and colleagues will conduct a three-year project aimed at combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial recordings (ICR) with validated tasks to provide vital new data about (1) The neural mechanisms and interactions of cognition, emotion and vigilance, (2) the relationships between both increases and decreases in neuronal activity and the fMRI response, and (3) local and distant cortical responses to acute brain lesions. While the studies will involve patients having brain surgery for intractable illnesses  (obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or seizures), the investigations are not focused on pathophysiology  or  treatment.  Instead, we seek to take advantage of these rare opportunities to obtain both fMRI measures and neuronal recordings in essentially cognitively intact humans in order to address a number of unresolved neuroscientific and neuroimaging questions. Three groups of experiments are proposed.  First, we will study the neural substrate of cognitive-emotional-vigilance interactions and fMRI signal decreases.  Meta-analyses and pilot dataindicate that cognitive challenges decrease fMRI signal in brain regions that monitor/regulate the internal state (emotions, motivation) like perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC)/ventromedial prefrontal cortex  (vmPFC), and  in those  that  monitor  the external  environment  (vigilance)  like  amygdala,  posterior  cingulate  cortex  (PCC),  and  portions  of  posterior parietal  cortex.  Few studies have focused on fMRI signal decreases, and neuronal contributions to this effect  are unknown. We will combine fMRI and ICR to demonstrate double dissociations. We predict: (1) cognitive challenge will activate task-specific cognitive brain areas (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  [DLPFC]), emotional stimuli will activate pACC, and fearful faces will activate amygdala,  (2) cognitive challenge will conversely decrease fMRI signal and neuronal activity in emotion-vigilance regions (pACC/vmPFC, amygdala, and PCC). The second group of experiments will combine fMRI and ICR to extend prior work on local cortical heterogeneity.a concept important for cognitive neuroscience and for understanding the neuron-fMRI relationship. Monkey single unit studies indicate many cortical areas are heterogeneous  (i.e., contain different functional cell types, such as anticipation/timing, target detection, response selection, and feedback cells), and that the proportions of these cells vary regionally. Our study (Bush et al, 20021) showed regional cellular proportion data from monkeys could be used to predict parametric fMRI responses in human dACC, but direct quantification of cortical composition of humans is needed.  We will combine fMRI and ICR to: (1) confirm local heterogeneity in human dACC, pACC, and DLPFC and parietal cortex, and (2) quantify and compare regional proportions of each cell type.  The third group of experiments will use longitudinal fMRI and behavioral measures to assess local and distributed cortical plasticity and recovery processes that occur in response to a focal cerebral lesion (cingulotomy).\r\n    This proposal is ideally suited for this funding mechanism, as it: (1) represents innovative research that  will advance our understanding  of  the  neural  bases  of  cognition,  emotion  and  vigilance,  (2)  will provide  a  more  sophisticated  understanding  of  how  cognitive,  emotional  and  vigilance  processes  interact  and influence  one  another,  (3) will  provide  important  new  data  on  the  relationship  between  parametric  increases  and decreases  in  neuronal  activity  and  the  measured  fMRI  response, knowledge  that  is  crucial  to  the  proper interpretation  of  virtually  all  types  of  functional  neuroimaging  studies  (fMRI,  PET  and  SPECT),  (4)  will  help delineate separate roles for pACC and amygdala, (5) uses a rarely available approach (combined  fMRI and ICR), (6)  leverages  studies  of  clinical  populations with  adventitious  lesions  to  elucidate  normal  brain mechanisms,  (7) studies  a  new  concept  (local  intracortical  heterogeneity),  (8)  will  establish  and  quantify  local  intracortical heterogeneity of different regions, a concept essential  to  the  development  of  neurobiologically  accurate computational models of cognitive, emotional and perceptual processes, (9) will help link comparative human and monkey studies, (10) will provide new data on cortical plasticity and recovery of function following focal cerebral lesions, and (11) can improve future studies of local and distributed (interregional) network interactions.\r\n    This proposal outlines specific plans for education and training at multiple levels  (from independent investigators and postdoctoral students down to middle school levels).  In addition to disseminating findings through publications, scientific meetings, and invited lectures, we are already planning two separate workshops and a freely available database. It will broaden participation of underrepresented groups (the PI, being one of few minority fMRI researchers, actively supports diversity efforts).  It will provide infrastructure support for future combined fMRI-ICR studies and strengthen nascent collaborative relationships. Finally, there are many potential benefits to society. (1) Improved understanding of cognitive, emotional and vigilance processes can help those with cognitive or mood disorders (ADHD, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder).  (2) It can have a direct benefit for those who will be surgically treated for intractable OCD, depression, epilepsy, and pain. (3) Better understanding of cerebral recovery can help those with neurological insults like strokes or traumatic brain injuries.  (4) Better understanding of reward circuitry and impulse inhibition may help those with impulse control and substance abuse disorders.\r\n",
