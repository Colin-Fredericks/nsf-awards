Milgram\r\n\r\nThis project consists of research programs in a broad range of\r\ntopics in Algebraic and Geometric Topology.  The principal\r\ninvestigators, Professors R.L. Cohen, S.P. Kerckhoff, and\r\nR.J. Milgram are senior topologists whose research interests\r\ncover a large number of areas of topology and related fields.\r\nIncluded in these projects are the study of core topological\r\nquestions such as the study of 3 - dimensional geometry, the\r\nstudy of the topology of complex and related structures on\r\nmanifolds, and topological invariants of finite groups.  In\r\naddition it includes applications of topological methods to\r\nengineering questions in the field of Robotics.\r\n\r\nThe topology of 3-dimensional manifolds is intimately connected\r\nto differential geometry, particularly to homogeneous structures\r\nlike Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry.  Of these,\r\nhyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent.  On a closed\r\n3-manifold a hyperbolic structure, if it exists, is unique by the\r\nMostow Rigidity Theorem.  Thus, any geometric invariant is a\r\ntopological invariant and can be used to distinguish different\r\n3-manifolds.  When the 3-manifold has boundary, it can have a\r\nlarge parameter space of hyperbolic structures; in this case, the\r\nqualitativeq properties of the structures as one varies over the\r\nparameter space are of particular interest.  Kerckhoff studies\r\nhyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, trying to describe the\r\nbehavior of these geometric structures under a topological\r\nprocedure, called Dehn surgery, and in the presence of\r\nsingularities modeled on a cone.  R.L. Cohen is pursuing several\r\nprojects that involve studying algebraic topological aspects of\r\nquestons stemming from geometry.  These projects lie under the\r\nfollowing general headings.  1. The topology of moduli spaces of\r\nholomorphic curves in complex and symplectic manifolds.  2. The\r\nhomotopy type of the stable mapping class group and the Mumford\r\nConjecture.  3. Properties and applications of holomorphic\r\nK-theory.  R.J. Milgram will pursue questions involving the\r\ncohomology of finite simple groups, as well as applications of\r\nthe topology of configuration spaces to questions in the design\r\nand behavior of robotic arms.\r\n",
