 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) This project addresses the need for improved mathematics courses for future elementary teachers. The project creates four instructional units on CDs each with detailed lesson guides and an assessment package constituting the core of an exemplary, replicable model for teacher education. The project adapts the problem- and reasoning-based curricula: the Connected Mathematics Project and Investigations in Number, Data, and Space. \r\n\r\nThe project identifies worthwhile mathematical tasks with the greatest potential for development, makes connections among key mathematical ideas, and raises the level of mathematical challenge. Lessons are developed around problems drawn from established research. The project also informs practice in other courses. Developed courses are more problem-based, and mathematical questioning and other instructional strategies are enhanced throughout the development. \r\n\r\nThe units being developed form the first two of three courses required of all elementary educators at University of Michigan-Dearborn and are used by instructors at public, private, and community colleges. The initial users provide feedback on the development of the materials. The project has the potential to create a 9-credit sequence that is widely usable.\r\n",
