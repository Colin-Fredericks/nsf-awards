 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER award will allow the Investigator and students to participate in a cruise of the RV Keldysh and the two Mir submersibles to the hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise off Mexico.  This cruise will depart Acapulco on about Sept 23, 2003 and end at Cabo San Lucas on about Oct.  20, 2003. This cruise will be filming an IMAX film about the hydrothermal vents and about research on those vents, directed by James Cameron. The PI's group will both conduct research and participate in the film. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research is a continuation of the PIs investigations on the physiology of vent organisms.   The investigators will be measuring the metabolic fluxes of major vent species as part of their overall program to estimate the production of the East Pacific Rise vent communities. This will involve bringing the animals to the surface alive and then placing them in high-pressure respirometer systems that simulate conditions at depth. Using this system the researchers will measure the fluxes of oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfide, protons, and nitrate as a function of these variables as well as temperature. Their work, to date has shown very high rates of primary production by these communities, rivaling the most productive terrestrial systems. They will also maintain animals alive in a pressure aquarium system with the goal of bringing them back to Santa Barbara alive at the end of the cruise.  In addition the researchers will be collecting samples for analysis of heat-shock proteins to gain insight into the thermal limits of these species. They will also collaborate with the other Russian and US scientists who are participating in the cruise.\r\n\r\nBroader Aspects of proposed work: In addition to the exciting research that will be\r\nconducted, this is an exceptional opportunity for outreach and education due to the\r\nproduction of the 3-D IMAX film and the eminence of James Cameron. The potential outreach impact of this film on the general public is enormous. The PI's experimental set-up is a complex, highly instrumented high-pressure system that is far different from the usual view of marine biology that is shown in the media. This is also a particularly exciting outreach and education opportunity because of Dr. Childress' experience as someone who was on the first hydrothermal vent expedition in 1979 and has continued to be active in this field up to the present. The PI will provide the depth and breadth of his knowledge and experience to the production. This SGER award will also support the thesis research of two graduate students on the cruise. One of these students is woman of color who will also participate in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge cruise with Earthship productions and is likely to feature prominently in the film.  \r\n",
