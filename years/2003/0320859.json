 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the Syracuse University group requests funds to develop instrumentation focusing on large area, high granularity, single photon detectors, active in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and their associated electronics and data acquisition system. Two solutions will be implemented based on two competing photon detectors. The primary application envisaged for this system is the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH), a crucial component of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory BTeV experiment enabling the extensive study of charm and beauty quarks, with particular emphasis on CP violation and rare decays. The BTeV RICH will be constructed mainly at Syracuse University. This far-reaching physics program is likely to provide crucial signatures for new physics, that is, physics beyond our current understanding, called the Standard Model. The rich phenomenology to be explored with BTeV makes it a unique educational environment for our graduate and undergraduate students. The combination of excellent physics analysis opportunities with novel detector development will empower Syracuse University to be one of the leading university in training the next generations of high-energy physicists. \r\n \r\nInterest in these instruments is growing in a variety of fields of experimental physics and medicine. Thus, a synergistic development of two educational modules to be included in several experimental physics course offerings and hands-on outreach activities periodically scheduled in the department is planned.  \r\n\r\n",
