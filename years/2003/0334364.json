 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Sherif El-Tawil, University of Michigan\r\n\r\nThe events of Sept. 11th and the ongoing terror threats highlight the vulnerability of our infrastructure to new and unfamiliar risks. Unprotected bridge piers, in particular, are vulnerable to accidental or malicious collision by heavy vehicles. Many bridges in the national inventory are supported on single column  piers  or  two-column  bents  (Fig.  1a)  and  can  be  rendered  useless  by  an  attack  on  a  single column.  Local  communities  and  economies  dependent  on  such  vulnerable  bridges  face  significant exposure. \r\n\r\nThe intent of this project is to investigate the use of high fidelity numerical modeling for simulating  the response  of  bridge  piers  subjected to  collision  by  vehicles.  Detailed  vehicle models will  be  crashed  into  bridge  pier models  with  the  objective  of  studying  the  parameters  influencing vehicle  versus  structure  collision.  \r\n\r\nThe  proposed  simulations  are  expected  to  lead  to  a  better understanding of the collision process and will lead to quantification of structural demands created by such extreme events. This research addresses a critical topic or immediate national importance: the security of our bridges and their vulnerability to impact by heavy vehicles. The products of this research will promote the development of performance-based design philosophies which incorporate security  concerns  in  the  design  process.  This  will  ultimately  enable  civil  engineers  to  rehabilitate existing structures and design new bridges that are more resistant to accidents and terror attacks.  \r\n",
