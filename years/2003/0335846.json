 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MASTEP (Mathematics And Science Teacher Education Program) Collaborative in the San  Francisco Bay Area is attracting high quality STEM majors and practicing professionals into K-12 science and math teaching using the incentives of Noyce scholarships and stipends. Academically outstanding teacher candidates are awarded up to two years of financial support to help defray educational expenses at either San Jose State University or San Francisco State Universities, two large and prominent urban campuses within the California State University System. Potential scholarship or stipend awardees are recruited from multiple sources, including the pool of undergraduate STEM students at the two universities and from approximately 20 feeder community colleges, as well as from the large local pool of STEM professionals who work in the technologically intensive region.  In addition to enrolling in teacher preparation courses at the two universities, the Noyce Scholarship and stipend recipients participate in MASTEP Future Teacher Clubs and a New Teacher Support Network consisting of workshops and an electronic network to support the new teachers as they assume teaching positions in high need urban school districts.  \r\n \r\n",
