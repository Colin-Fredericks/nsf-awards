 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is about pseudorandomness and its relationship with coding \r\ntheory and cryptography.  A fundamental object in the study of \r\npseudorandomness is the extractor, introduced by Nisan and the PI.  An \r\nextractor is an algorithm which extracts high-quality randomness from a \r\nlow-quality random source, using a few auxiliary high-quality random \r\nbits.  Recently, the PI and co-authors have discovered interesting \r\nconnections between extractors and coding theory.  Specifically, they \r\nshowed how to use Reed-Muller codes to build good extractors, and how \r\nextractors yield good list decodable codes.  While there have been \r\nimprovements in these methods, optimal extractors have not been \r\nachieved, and the PI proposes to work towards that goal.  The PI also \r\nplans to work on related issues in coding theory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PI plans to work on using low-quality randomness in \r\ncryptography, where less work has been done.  Cryptography also \r\nmotivates the notion of deterministic extractors, which extract \r\nrandomness from low-quality sources without any auxiliary random bits.  \r\nWhile this is impossible for general low-quality sources, it is possible \r\nwith more specialized ones.  For example, the PI and a student \r\nconstructed deterministic extractors for so-called oblivious bit-fixing \r\nsources. This has applications to exposure-resilient cryptography, where \r\ncryptographic primitives are made to work even if large portions of keys \r\nare exposed.  The PI proposes to improve previous results and work on \r\nrelated issues.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nMany scientists use pseudorandom generators in Monte Carlo \r\nsimulations,and may get wrong answers without knowing it.  Advances in \r\npseudorandom generators can therefore mean advances in other areas of \r\nscience.  Advances in cryptography are also important to society, as \r\ncomputer security becomes more relevant for national security.  The \r\nproject also has educational benefits:  the PI's research is integrated \r\nwith his teaching, especially in his mentoring of graduate students and \r\npostdocs.\r\n",
