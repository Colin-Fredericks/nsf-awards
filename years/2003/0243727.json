 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) provides a systematic and thorough exposure to research in psychology with a focus on professional development as a researcher in psychology.  PREP students become members of the mentor's laboratory, taking part in all aspects of research from reading the appropriate literature and discussing research ideas with the mentor, to gathering and analyzing data, to organizing and interpreting the results.  PREP students interact closely with other undergraduate and graduate students in the mentor's lab.  The end of the PREP program is marked by a symposium in the last week where each PREP student makes a 15-minute oral presentation of the work they did during the summer. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, weekly group meetings are held with all PREP students.  At these meetings, each mentor presents his or her research to the PREP students.  In this way, each PREP student is exposed to a broad range of psychological research.  Also, films are shown each week to spark student discussion of ethical issues in science.  PREP students are housed with other young scientists in similar programs in other scientific disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
