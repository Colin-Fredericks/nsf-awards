 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Science and Industry in Tampa, Florida, will develop a permanent exhibition and associated educational programs on natural hazards, phenomena that become \"natural disasters\" when they interact with the human community and its built environment.  The exhibition, 9000 square feet in size, will address the science of these phenomena, the science and technology of forecasting and mitigation strategies and techniques.  The exhibition features floods, hurricanes, wildfires, lightning, hail, tornadoes, earthquakes and volcanoes.  The exhibition begins with an overview and a focus on the dynamic earth.  It then presents a streetscape of buildings devastated by the phenomena and eight interactive areas dealing with each of the hazards.  The concluding sections include a demonstration stage and a series of elements that focus on communications, community preparedness and response and forecasting.  Ancillary materials include:  a family exhibition guide, teacher preparation materials, classroom materials on forecasting, a distance learning program and a brochure for the public (to be developed by IBHS).  Central to the project is MOSI's partnership and campus neighbor, Institute for Business and Home Safety, a nonprofit arm of the insurance industry with a mandate to educating Americans about natural disasters and ways to mitigate loss and suffering.  Other partners include FEMA, USGS, Red Cross, NFPA, local schools and community based organizations.  The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the evaluation, supplemented by action research investigations by the University of South Florida.  A local high school emphasizing design and art will participate in the exhibition development process.",
