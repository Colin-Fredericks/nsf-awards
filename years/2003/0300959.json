This interdisciplinary conference includes talks by over thirty leading researchers in control engineering and mathematical control theory.  Topics include nonsmooth analysis, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, computational methods in control, stabilization, and industrial applications.  The conference promotes interdisciplinary contact between engineering and mathematical control researchers, and provides opportunities for young researchers and graduate students interested in applied controls and optimization to meet and interact with the established control community.  This award supports attendance at the conference by young researchers and participants without other means of travel support.\r\n\r\nThis conference fosters advances in mathematical control theory and increased interaction between the engineering and applied mathematics communities.  The meeting includes five plenary talks, shorter lectures by over thirty prominent researchers, and sessions on open problems in control engineering.  The conference includes speakers from at least eight countries, including students and young faculty, furthering collaboration among different parts of the world.  Broad dissemination of the conference papers will be achieved through the publication of conference proceedings. \r\n",
