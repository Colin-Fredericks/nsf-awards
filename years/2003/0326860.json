 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will apply a new framework to describe advective-diffusive transport in geophysical reservoirs to Labrador Sea Water (LSW) transport in the subpolar gyre. It will synthesize data from transient tracers, hydrography and subsurface ?oats to estimate: (i) the time-averaged transport timescales and pathways for LSW in the subpolar North Atlantic with a focus on the roles of advection by the geostrophic flow, mixing, and recirculation, (ii) the processes controlling propagation of LSW anomalies, and, (iii) the uptake of anthropogenic carbon in the subpolar North Atlantic, and the importance of advection by the geostrophic flow, mixing, and recirculation in controlling carbon sequestration. A range of numerical models that simulate 1950-2000 North Atlantic circulation at non-eddy-resolving and eddy-resolving resolutions will be used to test the methods and estimate confidence levels for the data analyses. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts will be better understanding of ocean circulation and carbon uptake, a critical part of Earth's climate system with great societal importance. The results will be disseminated to a wide audience and feature the project in all levels of the PI's teaching. Two graduate students and a post doc will assist the project and receive advanced training in physical oceanography and climate dynamics.\r\n",
