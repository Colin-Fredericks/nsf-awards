First it introduces new classes of special functions and \r\ncatalogue their properties. Second, it studies new properties of \r\nknown special functions. In particular, this project comprises ten \r\nsubprojects. These include discovering and classifying algebraic \r\nrelationships between special values of multidimensional polylogarithms,\r\nstudying the combinatorics of shuffles and their q-analogues, analyzing \r\nthe almost everywhere behavior of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued\r\nfraction on the unit circle, and studying continued fractions with multiple\r\nlimit values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial functions are those mathematical functions which have recurred \r\noften enough that they have been distinguished with their own name and \r\nhave had their properties catalogued.  Indeed, the famous mathematician \r\nPaul Turan once said that special functions would be better named\r\n\"useful functions\".  The most famous examples are perhaps the trigonometric \r\nfunctions, which are of critical use in all areas of technology.  As time \r\nprogresses and physical, technological, and mathematical knowledge grow,\r\nthe set of functions dignified with the term \"special\" also gets larger.\r\nAdditionally, new properties of functions already in the pantheon of\r\nspecial functions are discovered and these properties are added to the \r\nbanks of human knowledge. This project investigates certain natural new \r\nspecial functions as well as explores novel properties of known special\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n",
