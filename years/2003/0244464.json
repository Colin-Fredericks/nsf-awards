 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-0244464 \r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Cumrun Vafa and Shing-Tung Yau\r\n\r\nString theory has had a spectacular impact on many areas of\r\nmodern mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential\r\ngeometry, topology, representation theory, analysis and\r\ncombinatorial geometry.  In particular, string dualities suggest\r\nunexpected relations between these diverse areas, many of which\r\nhave been proven mathematically.  Recent advances in matrix model\r\ntechniques suggest further relations in mathematics.  It can now\r\nbe expected that number theory will become related as well.  It\r\nis proposed to investigate unifying themes in duality symmetries\r\nin search of a deeper understanding of these symmetries.  It is\r\nalso proposed to work on a range of mathematical problems which\r\nthese dualities inspire.  Particular dualities include mirror\r\nsymmetry, originally elucidated in the context of Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory, and S-dualities, which are duality symmetries of\r\nsupersymmetric gauge theories and string theories.  More recently\r\nboth have been related to Matrix integrals.  In the case of\r\nsupersymmetric gauge theories this gives a relation between\r\nperturbative Feynman diagrams on the one hand and certain\r\ncomputations on moduli spaces of instantons on the other, which\r\nthe PIs propose to elucidate further.  In the particular case of\r\nGromov-Witten theory, connections have been found with knot\r\ntheory.  This leads to a complete computation of the\r\ncorresponding invariants for non-compact toric Calabi-Yau\r\nthreefolds. The PIs propose to extend these ideas to the compact\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will be exploiting existing connections and forging new\r\nones between physics and mathematics to address a wide range of\r\ncutting-edge open problems in both fields.  These ideas are\r\nexpected to create new links between diverse areas of\r\nmathematics, as certain ideas in physics are equivalent to\r\nimportant unsolved problems in mathematics.  The techniques\r\nintroduced into mathematics are expected to have a revolutionary\r\ninfluence on core areas of mathematics as related techniques have\r\nin the past.  This project occurs at the same time as an ongoing\r\neffort by the string theory community and will help set future\r\ndirections in that field.  String theory seeks to unify the force\r\nof gravity with the electromagnetic and nuclear forces; this is\r\nthe problem that eluded Einstein.  It is anticipated that\r\nnumerous diverse areas of mathematics will become related to each\r\nother in unexpected ways and that this will have profound\r\nconsequences for mathematics and physics.  Due to the broad scope\r\nof the project, a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional\r\napproach is indicated.  The PIs will be bringing together their\r\nnetworks of collaborators, postdocs, and graduate students and\r\ndirecting an intense collaborative effort in these areas.  An\r\ninterdisciplinary math/physics curriculum will be created to\r\ntrain future leaders in areas at the interface of mathematics and\r\nphysics.  The PIs will expand their use of existing internet\r\nvideoconferencing technologies for collaborative purposes, and\r\nwill organize workshops on the topics of this project. This is a\r\njoint award of the Division of Mathematical Sciences programs in\r\nGeometric Analysis and Algebra, Number Theory, & Combinatorics.\r\n",
