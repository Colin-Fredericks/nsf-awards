 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conjecture of Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod p\r\nrepresentations of Galois groups over Q arise from modular forms,\r\nand it further predicts the level and weight of the form.\r\nThe principal investigator and his collaborators are investigating\r\na possible generalization of Serre's conjecture to the context\r\nof Hilbert modular forms and Galois groups over totally real fields. \r\nThe prediction of the weights suggests interesting new phenomena, and\r\nthe immediate aims of the research are to investigate these phenomena\r\nand provide numerical evidence for the generalization.\r\n\r\nSerre's conjecture and its generalizations can be viewed as part of\r\nLanglands' program, which predicts a deep correspondence between objects from\r\nalgebraic geometry (solution sets of polynomial equations, such as elliptic\r\ncurves) and objects from representation theory (functions with symmetry\r\nproperties, such as modular forms).  While there has been significant\r\nrecent progress (for example, the investigator and collaborators,\r\nbuilding on Wiles' work on Fermat's Last Theorem, proved that all\r\nrational elliptic curves arise from modular forms), Langlands'\r\nprogram remains largely conjectural.  The links it provides between\r\ntwo seemingly different branches of mathematics reveal properties \r\nof the integers, which can, in turn, have applications to cryptography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
