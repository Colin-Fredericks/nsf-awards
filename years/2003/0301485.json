 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nAlkali-silica reaction (ASR) is a major cause of concrete deterioration.  The overall goal of this research project is to combine chemical and mechanical approaches to\r\nsubstantially advance fundamental understanding of ASR and to provide a basis for development of more effective\r\naccelerated tests and for prevention of damage. The objectives are: 1) to understand the molecular and nanometer-\r\nscale structure of ASR gels and how the structure is affected by conditions of formation, 2) to understand the\r\nmolecular and nanostructural processes that produce the gel, the chemical and structural controls on gel\r\ncomposition, and the kinetics of gel formation and subsequent transformations, 3) to understand the effects of\r\naggregate type on the composition and structure of ASR gel and on the kinetics of gel formation, 4) to understand\r\nthe chemical and structural aspects of gel that control swelling behavior, and 5) to understand the relationships\r\nbetween the macroscopic structural expansion of concrete undergoing ASR and the details of gel formation and\r\nswelling by developing a finite element model of concrete expansion that can be used to more effectively predict\r\nand evaluate the engineering effects of ASR.\r\nThe proposed research will have intellectual impact in civil engineering, geological science, and\r\nmaterials science. It will provide a detailed understanding of the chemistry of an important concrete deterioration\r\nmechanism, knowledge of the molecular structure of a class of hydrous silicates, ASR gel and\r\nestablish a link between molecular structure and swelling behavior. It will establish a microstructural-based model\r\nthat links ASR chemistry and concrete expansion. Knowledge gained through this research will be\r\nincorporated into education in both civil engineering and geology. The project will enhance interactions between\r\nengineering and geology. And the proposed research will enhance minority education through participation Jackson State University, a historically black institution.\r\n",
