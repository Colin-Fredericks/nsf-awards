 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to Tulane University.  With this Career award, Professor Sankaran Thayumanavan will study molecular interactions in macromolecules, and will design parameters for functional and dynamic dendrimers.  Dendrimers with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups will be designed, synthesized and functionalized to provide hydrophilic outer surfaces in polar solvents and hydrophilic outer surfaces in apolar solvents. The studies will provide key concepts for the development of designed second order structure in macromolecules with functional utility.  With these dendrimers, it would be possible to sequester apolar organic substrates into these dendrimeric interiors in polar media for applications in catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug delivery systems and sensors.  The proposed educational outreach program 'Tulane Science Scholars Program is a strong educational program, and this program will expose local high school students to science and engineering programs.  The PI, the Co-director of the program with the help of other faculty members, will be provide courses to high school juniors and seniors in Chemistry, Physics, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Environmental Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering during Fall and Spring semesters. \r\n\r\nNew dendrimeric polymers with functional groups may be used in polar and apolar solvents with applications in catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug delivery systems and sensors.  The proposed Tulane Science Scholars Program will expose high school students in different aspects of science and engineering subjects, and will prepare them for advanced studies in science and engineering programs at college level.\r\n",
