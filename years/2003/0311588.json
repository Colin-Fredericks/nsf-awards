 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical Electrical (55)-This project is adapting and enhancing the course contents and accompanying laboratories of successful micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) curricula developed at UM Ann Arbor and UC Berkeley. MEMS fundamentals and applications are being covered in a new introductory multidisciplinary \"MEMS Design\" course (with accompanying MEMS CAD Module Laboratories). This course is preparing students for a sequence of two courses - \"MEMS Fabrication\" and \"MEMS System Evaluation\"-with MEMS CAD and Fabrication Module Laboratories. These MEMS laboratories are being performed in the existing Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Microsystems Fabrication Facilities. The \"MEMS Fabrication\" and \"MEMS System Evaluation\" courses are adapted and enhanced versions of UM Ann Arbor \"Introduction to MEMS\" and \"Integrated Microsystems Laboratory\" courses. The resources to be adapted include class notes, various laboratory experiments, CAD tools, manuals, projects as well as other course materials and teaching tools to attain our educational objectives. A set of stylistically coherent and pedagogically consistent courses is being developed for undergraduate Electrical, Mechanical and Microelectronics (MicroE) engineering students in a well-defined material, topics and courses sequence. Specifically, the courses and modular MEMS curriculum structure integrate MEMS into the teaching of the basic concepts of MEMS, starting from an introductory level and progressing to advanced topics in concurrent design and fabrication of complex MEMS. The course lectures and laboratories are being developed for use in an interactive classroom environment, implementing interactive learning strategies and classroom practices. \r\n\r\nA series of evaluative techniques are being designed to assess pedagogical objectives compared with the traditional lecture-based courses. Class testing and evaluation of materials are being conducted over six quarters. In addition to the mastery of MEMS, the laboratory and project assignments are improving student competencies in communication, teamwork and project management, thereby developing skills for lifelong learning. The effectiveness of student-centered and guided exploration methods is being assessed through advanced topics (abstract MEMS synthesis, CAD, etc.) and through comprehensive laboratory experiments (fabrication, integration, packaging and testing). As a part of our dissemination efforts, an interactive web site summarizing the MEMS curriculum and allowing free downloading of all course materials is be developed and effectively maintained. Purdue University, Notre Dame and other universities have expressed interest in implementing the RIT MEMS curriculum. The developed curriculum is being evaluated by UM Ann Arbor, Purdue University and Notre Dame faculty. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the project are demonstrated in the advance MEMS theory and engineering practice that are promoted in education emphasizing teaching, training, learning and scholarship. Also, there is broad participation of women and minorities in the new MEMS curriculum through multidisciplinary undergraduate research and education. Finally, the maintaining and enhancement of the shared user Microsystems Facilities at RIT provide an impact on the MEMS community.\r\n",
