 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico AMP, established in 1993, is a partnership representing the state.s public two-and four-year \r\npostsecondary institutions.  The program concentrates its efforts in three strategic areas:  Outreach and Recruitment, Undergraduate Education, and Undergraduate Research and Graduate School Preparation.  Core components include a multi-institutional freshman learning seminar, undergraduate research, and an annual student conference.  New Mexico AMP also manages several leveraged student support and curriculum/faculty development programs.  Collectively, these programs represent a comprehensive portfolio to develop multiple lines of inquiry into the issues of effective STEM education.  Since inception of the New Mexico AMP, the number of B.S. degrees awarded in STEM fields to underrepresented minorities rose from 253 in 1992/93 to 455 in 2001/02 . an 80 percent increase.  The percentage of B.S. STEM degrees awarded to minority students increased from 23.1 percent in 1992/93 to 37.1 percent in 2001/01 . a 61 percent increase.   Demonstration of the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the program are exemplified by the SMET 101 Project and the Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program.  SMET 101 is an innovative freshman-learning seminar for pre-transfer and first-year university students that has resulted in significant changes to teaching and learning processes at ten participating institutions. Through the Undergraduate Research Program, faculty from across the state are now actively engaging undergraduate students in research and using the program as a way to identify potential graduate students. Through these and other projects, we will continue to ask meaningful and, oftentimes, cross-disciplinary questions concerning student achievement and to develop increasingly effective approaches for enhancing student and faculty performance.   In Phase III, continued focus on the primary program objectives will allow this success to continue.  Phase III objectives are to: Establish meaningful partnerships with colleges and universities, school systems, government agencies, national laboratories and centers, industry, private foundations, and STEM professional organizations to support student development and success and to achieve proposed New Mexico AMP objectives. Incorporate academic, curricular, and co-curricular enrichment activities designed to improve instructional performance as well as increase the motivation, performance, and progression of talented students within undergraduate degree programs. Provide direct student support as necessary to enable students to attend academic year and summer enrichment activities without unnecessary loss if income. Demonstrate an increase in movement of undergraduate students to graduate school degree programs. \r\nMaintain program visibility and student access at New Mexico 2-year colleges to 4-year degree programs. \r\nEstablish sustainability of the SMET 101 project at 50% of New Mexico community colleges. \r\nThese objectives will contribute significantly to meeting the goals of the New Mexico AMP program, fostering the continued integration of research and education, expanding access and participation, and broadening the base of opportunity and support available to STEM students. Management of the New Mexico AMP program will continue under the guidance of a multi-sector Advisory Board representing Grade 6-12 education, community colleges, universities, state government and educational agencies, and industry.  Additionally, partnership with the University of Arizona Graduate School to provide summer research \r\nexperiences, and collaborations with the New Mexico AGEP, the NMSU Center for Learning Assistance, libraries and reference staff, and other organizations will provide information and workshops on available opportunities and resources to encourage and prepare students for graduate study. \r\nProgram evaluation activities are comprised of both formative and summative components driven by a \r\ncomprehensive set of key evaluation questions.  Adherence to the evaluation plan has led to formative improvements in program activities that are increasingly responsive to stakeholder needs as well as to evolving program goals and objectives.  Successful program practices and results are disseminated statewide and nationally through a monthly one-page electronic bulletin (200 recipients), a bi-annual newsletter (nearly 1200 recipients), a program website (www.nmsu.edu/~nmamp) and conferen  presentations and publications.",
