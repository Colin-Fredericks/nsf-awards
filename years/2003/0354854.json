 "awd_abstract_narration": "This amends an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by making an award to the Pacific Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command (PACDIV) for engineering services to the United States Antarctic Program's (USAP) IceCube project.\r\n\r\nThe following tasks are included: \r\n\r\n1.\tEngineering Review of IceCube Drill and Related Travel.\r\n\r\nSimilar services have been provided by PACDIV and their contractors since 1983.  The services have always been timely, cost effective, and professional.  It is expected that this work will be accomplished in a similar manner.  PACDIV is a government agency, not associated with the NSF or the support contractor.  PACDIV has no interest in the support contract that could constitute a conflict of interest.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons stated above it is in the best interest of the NSF for PACDIV to continue with the ongoing tasking.  This award is recommended for the amount of $29,159 as estimated by PACDIV to be funded from the IceCube MREFC project budget.\r\n\r\n",
