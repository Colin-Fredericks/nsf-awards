 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work would generalize the Rice Field Model to include the effects of  polar-cap potential saturation and asymmetric ring currents, both of which are especially  important during magnetic storm intervals when the magnetosphere is driven hard by the  solar wind.  Both of these generalizations require the incorporation of Birkeland  (magnetic-field-aligned) currents and their magnetic effects.   The Rice Field Model is a modular model of the global magnetic- and electric-field  configuration of the Earth's magnetosphere that presently includes the geodipole, the  confining effect of magnetopause (Chapman-Ferraro) currents, cross-tail currents, a  symmetric ring current, and an \"interconnection\" field that links the interplanetary  magnetic field to the geodipole.  The new features to be added include the three global  Birkeland-current systems, Region 1 (R1), Region 2 (R2), and Cusp Region (CR), along  with their closure currents on the magnetopause (R1 and CR) and in the inner  magnetosphere (R2).  The R1 and CR currents will be specified from the divergence of  the ionospheric Pedersen current that is driven by the electric field mapped inward from  the solar wind.  The R2 current will be specified from the divergence of an asymmetric  inner-magnetospheric ring current.  Calculating the magnetic effects of these Birkeland  current systems will be done with a novel approach to approximating the Biot-Savart  integral.  The calculation will be done in iterative steps such that the Birkeland currents  remain parallel to the resultant magnetic field.  These improvements will make the model applicable to  large magnetic storms  The improved model will contribute to our  understanding of the structure and dynamics of the storm-time magnetosphere.  The proposed model will be applicable to a Geospace General Circulation Model (GGCM), which will be useful for space weather nowcasting and forecasting.  The project provides educational impacts by supporting a graduate student and a postdoctoral student.",
