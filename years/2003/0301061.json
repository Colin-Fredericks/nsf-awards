 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University hosts a 10-week summer research program for undergraduates (REU) from early June to mid-August for 11 undergraduate students who are interested in working on physics and astronomy research projects with professors in the department.  These students will join a large number of BYU students for a summer of research coupled with social and outdoor activities in the Rocky Mountains of Utah.  Research areas include computational and experimental plasma physics, high-power laser physics, x-ray and extreme ultraviolet sources and optics, observational astronomy, acoustics, nanotechnology, experimental and computational condensed matter physics, the manipulation of atoms with lasers, and solar energy.  Women students, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.  \r\n\r\nThe participants will receive a stipend, living expenses, and paid travel to and from Provo, Utah.  Students will experience the excitement of research in physics as they work closely with faculty mentors. Participants will also receive training in computation, vacuum techniques, electronics, laser diagnostics, etc., and will also have an opportunity to develop their presentation skills as they report on their work to other students involved in summer research at BYU.  Funds are also available to pay for selected students present their work at national and regional conferences in the following year.",
