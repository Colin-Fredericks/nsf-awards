The \r\nemphasis will be on algorithmic questions concerning permutation \r\ngroups and matrix groups, and to more general questions concerning \r\n\"black box groups\". The main focus is the design and analysis of \r\nefficient algorithms to determine the normal structure of a \r\nlarge-dimensional matrix group given by a small set of generators, \r\nwhere the algorithms have both fast asymptotic running time and good \r\npractical performance. This should produce a polynomial-time \r\nalgorithm for the basic manipulation of arbitrary matrix groups, \r\nassuming that discrete logarithms in suitable fields can be computed \r\nquickly. Recent algorithms devised or proposed for the constructive \r\nrecognition of most classes of finite simple groups are a major \r\ningredient in this plan. The study of polynomial-time, nearly linear \r\ntime and parallel (complexity class NC) permutation group algorithms \r\nalso will be continued. Additional new practical algorithms will be \r\nobtained based on methods developed in these theoretical situations. \r\nAll of this work will make detailed use of the classification and \r\nproperties of the finite simple groups. \tSome of these \r\nalgorithms depend on geometric methods. Other geometric projects will \r\nbe continued, including asymptotic investigations into planes, \r\ndesigns and codes. There will be special emphases on nonassociative \r\ndivision algebras and their planes (and in some cases, associated \r\ncodes), as well as on automorphism groups of symmetric designs.\r\n\r\nThe field of group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry and \r\ninteracts with many other disciplines, for example computer science, \r\nphysics and chemistry outside  of mathematics, number theory, \r\ntopology and geometry inside mathematics.  The fundamental building \r\nblocks of finite groups are the finite simple groups. One of the \r\noutstanding mathematical results in recent decades is the \r\nclassification of the finite simple groups.  A major portion of this \r\nresearch proposal is aimed at using properties of these simple groups \r\nin the computer-assisted study of arbitrary finite groups. \r\nGroup-theoretic algorithms are fundamental to the computer group \r\ntheory packages GAP and Magma, which are widely used in group theory \r\nand combinatorics.  Many aspects of the PI's research program have \r\nled or will lead to significant improvements in this widely-available \r\nsoftware.   Another portion of this proposal concerns the generation \r\nof a finite group from a probabilistic standpoint, which also has \r\napplications in computer science. A third portion of the proposal \r\nconcerns finite geometries, especially designs and codes. Designs \r\nfirst arose in the design of statistical experiments, and have many \r\napplications in other disciplines, including optics, coding theory \r\nand computer algorithms.  Error-correcting codes are a fundamental \r\nengineering application of \"pure\" mathematics. This proposal will \r\nfund graduate students who will study and work in these  areas on the \r\nborder between mathematics and its applications.\r\n\r\n",
