Led by Irena Lasiecka in the US and Michel Bernadou in France, the researchers propose to study problems in the general area of control theory models described by partial differential equations.  The topics are related to stabilization and optimal control of dynamical shell models where control actions and sensing are implemented via smart materials technology.  These include piezoceramic or peizoelectric elements, magnetostrictive devices and rheological fluids. The theoretical analysis, with a focus on inverse type of estimates, will culminate with numerical algorithms and convergence analysis.  Two approaches to control modeling will be pursued.  The first, piezoelectric shell modeling, will be investigated by the French team.  This is complemented by US expertise in an approach based on piezoelectric patches attached to a curved wall.  These complementary approaches will lead to two different control models.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and INRIA.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for annual visits to France by the US investigator and graduate student. INRIA will support visits by French researchers to the United States. The project will advance understanding of control models and their applications to smart materials technology and materials engineering.\r\n",
