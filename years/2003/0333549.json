 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New World Symphony (NWS) vision is to install the bandwidth and network equipment needed to launch a kind of global musical community that interacts on a daily basis without geographical limitations. Such a network would be capable of transmitting multiple interactive master classes simultaneously from a number of remote locations, and of fostering musical collaborations and experiments between conservatories, orchestras, and ensembles. Initial experiments conducted over the Abilene/Internet2 network have demonstrated that musicians, coaches, and lecturers can effectively teach, learn, and perform together in a virtual environment. \r\n\r\nThere is also a potential to bring together students and artists who otherwise might be unable to travel to a particular performance venue.  NWS also seeks to expand the availability of high-quality interactive music education to secondary schools, particularly those in rural and underprivileged areas, using the resources developed through its work with higher education. \r\n\r\n",
