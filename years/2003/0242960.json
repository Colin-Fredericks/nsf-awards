 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) hosts 10 students each summer to participate in our Research Experience for Undergraduate Program.  The program is open to all undergraduate students, and stipends, room, board and travel are provided.  Students conduct field research in ecology and evolutionary biology under the supervision of a senior scientist.  The focus of the program is to help students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, consider and pursue a career in field biology.  The primary emphasis of the program is an independent research project that students design and conduct under the guidance of a scientist at the RMBL.  To assist both mentors and students, the RMBL conducts workshops in experimental design and statistical analysis.  Upon completion of projects, all students in the REU program communicate their results orally at a summer-end symposium.  Students are also required to place a paper written in the scientific format on file with the RMBL.  We strongly encourage students to submit their papers to our online, peer-reviewed journal Undergraduate Research in Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution.  Students interested in the RMBL's REU program should contact Dr. Ian Billick (director@rmbl.org, (970) 349-7231).  Information is also available online at www.rmbl.org",
