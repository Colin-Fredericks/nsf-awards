The\r\nunderlying mathematical observation is that symbolic map layers are\r\nisotopy invariants.  Transcribing the topological information that resides\r\nin a map amounts, in practice, to specifying an isotopy class of nested,\r\nlabelled planar graphs.  The deliverable of this project is a portable\r\nspecification language for doing that.  While the case of two-dimensional\r\nplanar configurations is essentially solved, its extension to surfaces of\r\nhigher genus is of interest even as fundamental research.  Its importance\r\nis also highlighted by its connection to the description of solid bodies,\r\nsuch as those encountered in computer-aided design.\r\n\r\nPresent-day Geographic Information Systems tend to treat maps as\r\nsuperimposed layers of graphic images.  But a map also contains\r\ninformation that is topological, meaning, metric-independent.  Examples of\r\nthis are road or other infrastructure networks, where one is only\r\ninterested in the connectivity between certain nodes, and rough\r\nqualitative features of the lines connecting them.  The storage, indexing\r\nand transmission of this symbolic topological information may be both more\r\nimportant and easier than that of the entire graphical image.  The authors\r\noutline an algorithm for schematic rendering, and a method of attacking\r\nthe map isomorphism problem, where by map one may mean both actual images\r\nand maps encoded by their proposed scheme.  Both of those ideas, however,\r\nare in need of experimental verification.\r\n",
