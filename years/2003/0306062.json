The classical \r\nstabilization result is \"Markov's Theorem\" which says that any two closed \r\nbraid representatives of the same oriented link type in the 3-sphere are \r\nrelated to each other through a sequence of moves (isotopies): conjugation, \r\nstabilization and destabilization. Unforunately, the Markov Theorem only says\r\na sequence exists, but understanding exactly what this stabilization sequence\r\naccomplishes has largely remained a big black box until recently.\r\nThe first peek inside the stabilization black box is the \"Markov Theorem \r\nWithout Stabilization\" (MTWS), a product of a long collaborative effort with \r\nJoan Birman.  The MTWS can tell one exactly what stabilization achieves in \r\nan isotopy between braids and one of the main goals of the project is to \r\nexploit this understanding in the areas of  link classification, link \r\ninvariants and contact geometry. An essential surface inside a 3-manifold \r\ntells one about the geometry of the space.  Not all 3-manifolds contain essential\r\nsurfaces, but it is possible that for a given 3-manifold M that is     \r\nlacking any essential surface there is another 3-manifold M' which has\r\nessential surfaces and M' \"covers\" M.  Understanding when a 3-manifold M\r\nhas a such a corresponding cover M' is the focus of the \"Virtual Haken  \r\nConjecture\".  The investigator in collaboration with Joseph Masters &   \r\nXingru Zhang is pursuing a new strategy for attacking this conjecture in \r\na general setting.\r\n\r\nThe 3-dimensional space in which we live is unique in its ability to retain\r\ninformation about the \"knottest\" of a collection of closed loops (think of\r\na collection of tangled strands of pearls inside a jewelry box).  This phemomenon\r\nof knottest does not occur in any lower or higher dimensional space---the\r\nadvantage of a 5-dimensional jewelry box is that a collection of\r\nstrands of pearls can never be tangled.  Thus, as any micro-biologist working with\r\nDNA strands will tell you, knottest is an important feature\r\nof our 3-dimensional existence that needs to be understood.  Basic questions \r\narise. When are different two knots (single strands) or links (multiple strands)\r\nillustrating the same type of knottest---that is, when is there a  sequence of\r\nmotions of one link that move it around in 3-space so that it appears \r\nlike that other link?  When is When is a knot which appears to be tangle in fact \r\nequivalent through motions a simple circle that can be laid flat in a plane?\r\nMotions can be very complex (think of trying to untangle\r\na mass of fishing line).  The investigator's research has focussed on understanding\r\nand codifying these motions (in collaboration with Joan Birman, \"The Markov Theorem\r\nWithout Stabilization\").  Also in trying to understand 3-dimensional spaces we\r\ncan study \"essential\" surfaces that occur in them, i.e. surfaces that in the space\r\ncan not be crashed down to a point.  Such surfaces can give us a type of  coordinate system\r\nfor navigating in the space---astronomers are very interested in  determining if our\r\nuniverse has any essential surfaces.  If a 3-dimensional space has an essential surface\r\nthen it is called \"Haken\".  Not all spaces are Haken, but some that are  not can be\r\n'painted over' or \"covered\" by ones that are, i.e. they may be \"Virtually Haken\".\r\nThe investigator in collaboration with Joseph  Masters &   \r\nXingru Zhang is pursuing a new strategy determining when a 3-dimensional \r\nspace is Virtually Haken.",
