 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the income tax and the estate tax have deductions for charitable donations.  The theoretical literature that examines how progressive taxes should be to accomplish different societal goals does not consider the role of donations.  The project will develop the theory of how progressive taxes should be designed to take into account their effect on gifts and donations.  In addition to considering incentives for both work and donations, the analysis will consider the foundations of normative criteria for evaluating outcomes when there are voluntary gifts and donations.  The analysis will relate optimal taxation to different definitions of societal goals.  The end product should be increased understanding of the treatment of charitable deductions in the income tax and the estate tax.  Also considered will be transfer programs, such as unemployment insurance, which affect gifts from others.\r\n\r\nSocial Security affects both income distribution and retirement decisions.  An important aspect of both effects is the diversity in life expectancy in the American public.  This diversity also affects the demand by retirees for annuities.  Also varying in the public is the approach to savings, with some people showing consistency over time in their planning, while others do not.  This project will examine the role of Social Security with different formulations of individual savings and annuitization behavior and different insurance market structures.  Analysis of the impact of Social Security on behavior will be an input into normative analysis of the design of Social Security program parameters.\r\n\r\n",
