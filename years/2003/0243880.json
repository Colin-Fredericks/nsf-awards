The University of Missouri (MU) provides a research experience at a major comprehensive research university, while faculty at the partner institutions are responsible for the selection of the interns.  The partners also help prepare the interns for their summer research experience at MU and continue their training when they return to their home campus.  \r\n\r\nOur partnerships are designed to provide a summer research experience for undergraduates, especially members of minority groups underrepresented in the sciences, who would not otherwise have an opportunity to conduct research in a state-of-the-art environment.  This Program is specifically designed to stimulate interest in graduate study.\r\n\r\nThe research programs of the MU faculty mentors center on \"Cellular, Molecular, and Genetic Approaches to Biological Problems.\"  These research programs use methodology ranging from recombinant DNA technology to molecular cytology to sophisticated population genetics. The research experience is the heart of the summer program.  Interns also develop communication skills through brown-bag lunches, lab group meetings, and an end-of-program Summer Undergraduate Research Science Symposium and poster session.  They are strongly encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific meetings, with the Program providing financial support.  Enrichment activities include seminars by research faculty, panel discussions on preparation for graduate school and career options, and a science ethics workshop.\r\n",
