The co-organizers are Professor Kenneth Wynne at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and Professor Norio Tsubokawa at Niigata University in Japan.  The meeting will bring together research scientists and engineers from the U.S. and Japan, two countries where important and exciting progress in hybrid materials has been made in the last decade.  The main objective of the seminar is to address current critical issues and future opportunities for hybrid materials, focusing on the unique synergism that results from combinations of organic and inorganic phases.  Presentations will focus on how to design such nanostructures in a controlled manner and to organize the nonoparticles on larger length scales.  A further objective of the proposed seminar is to bring together researchers in the areas of polymer synthesis, polymer physics, instrumental methods of polymer characterization, solid-state polymer properties, and various polymer applications, who have common and complimentary interests.  The goal is to identify common research priorities and to explore areas of joint research cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best organic and inorganic chemists, materials scientists and engineers to participate.  The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve minorities, postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.  The proceedings will include the program schedule and abstracts of talks including key references to the literature.       \r\n\r\n\r\n",
