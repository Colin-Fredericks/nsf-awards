High\r\nInstitution: Oklahoma State University\r\nProposal Number: 0302195\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled \"Advancement and Retention of Female Chemical Engineers: Issues and Strategies\" will be held at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It will be a full morning session from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. with speakers including women from industry, academia government.   Some of the presentations include:\r\n\tKeynote presentation by Karen Gleason discussing \"Status of Women Faculty at MIT.\"\r\n\tFrankie Wood-Black from Phillips Petroleum Company detailing \"Removing Barriers - PROGRESSing toward the Future.\"\r\n\tKathleen Bartom from Pharmacia describing \"Devine Secrets of the ChE Sisterhood: My 20 Years in Chemical Engineering.\"\r\n\tDiane Wolf from Kraft Foods will talk about \"Networking Strategies.\"\r\n\tCatherine Didion will describe \"AWIS: Institution Assessment Tools and Model Academic Policies.\"\r\n\tRegina Murphy from the University of Wisconsin will outline information about \"A National Women in Science and Engineering Leadership Institute (WISELI).\"\r\nThe presentations will be followed by a luncheon sponsored by corporate sponsor Kraft, hopefully to attract 50 to 75 chemical engineering professionals, faculty members and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe session is a part of a more comprehensive program to help women at all stages of their careers - from graduate student to tenured faculty as well as women in various industrial positions in the chemical process industries - to advance in their careers.  NSF funds will be used for airfare, registration, hotel, and meal per diem for some of the speakers.\r\n",
