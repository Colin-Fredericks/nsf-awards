 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on the Asian monsoon entitled US-India Cooperative Research: International Wavelet Analysis of Frequency Spectra for Monsoon Rainfall.\r\nUS PI T.N. Krishnamurti, Florida State University (FSU) and Indian meteorologist C.K. Rajan, Cochin University of Science and Technology will study the intraseasonal variability of the Asian monsoon rainfall using a novel observational analysis approach (wavelet analysis) and modeling.  Understanding the mechanisms that regulate monsoon life cycles formed by active and break periods in the Asian summer monsoon is a major research challenge and one with broad impacts.  Improved predictions of monsoon precipitation for the South Asian regions are critical to issues of water resources, agriculture, health, and economic well being for the billions living in these regions. \r\nThis research will extend previous work completed by the PI for one region of India to the entire area affected by the Asian Monsoon.  The award supports exchange visits to the collaborating institution by a postdoc and graduate student from FSU.  Cofunding for the collaboration is provided by the Indian Department of Science & Technology under the NSF/DST joint program.",
