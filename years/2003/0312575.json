 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the nature of theorems and proofs has been a \r\ncentral quest in the foundations of computer science.  The \r\ndesign of the modern computer owes its origins to this quest,\r\nand this quest has continued to play a pivotal role in \r\ndeveloping a theory of computing.  This research project \r\ninvestigates new questions in the context of verifying proofs. \r\nIt investigates the capacity of proofs to be verified \r\nprobabilistically, trading off a small possibility of incorrect \r\nverification for a huge advantage in the time taken to verify \r\nproofs.  Research in the recent past (last ten years or so) \r\nhas shown that probabilistic verification of proofs is a \r\nfeasible goal and can lead to surprisingly efficient verifiability. \r\nHowever the results have not been of practical use so far. The \r\nmain obstacle to practical utility is that the probabilistically \r\nverifiable proofs are much longer than classical proofs. This \r\nproject investigates the tradeoff between the size of a \r\nprobabilistically checkable proof and the complexity of verifying \r\nit.  It will also investigate new applications of such proof \r\nsystems, and in particular, to the task of automatic verification \r\nof correct execution of computer programs.  For broader impact, \r\nthe project will also foster understanding and interest into \r\nthe foundations of information and computation to a wide audience \r\nvia educational and outreach activities.\r\n",
