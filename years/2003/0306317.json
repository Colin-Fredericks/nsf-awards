 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support of the ACS Polymer Division symposium \"The Polymer Science of Everyday Things\" Symposium and K-12 Long Distance Workshop.  This symposium will be held at the National ACS Meeting, New Orleans, LA, March 22-24, 2003.  The goal of the symposium and workshop is to explain how things that people encounter and use everyday depend on polymer science for their ubiquity.  \"The Polymer Science of Everyday Things\" information to K-12 science teachers will be presented during a half-day symposium (Saturday afternoon) which will be followed by a corresponding two-day symposium (Sunday and Monday) designed for scientists.  Teachers teaching teachers about the use of polymers is a primary goal of this workshop.  This workshop is an extension of POLY K-12 educational activities that have provided in-service workshops to K-12 science teachers since 1990.  We anticipate that this will be a model for future activities that bring active research scientists and research managers into a setting that will impact K-12 education.  NS funds will be used primarily to facilitate attendance of then K-12 teachers and \"Polymer Ambassadors\" who are specially chosen and trained high school teachers.  In addition, a small portion of the funds will be used to defray the cost of \"We Broadcasting\" to the University of Akron and the University of Arizona.  At these remote sites, regional K-12 teachers will participate in the live broadcast.",
