 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funds in this grant will be used to support U.S. \r\nresearchers, postdocs and graduate students to attend and \r\npresent lectures and posters in a Workshop on Group \r\nTheory and Numerical Analysis at the Centre de \r\nRecherches Mathematiques, Universite de Montreal, during \r\nthe week May 26-31, 2003.  The workshop features one \r\naspect of the emerging theory of \"geometric integration,\" \r\nthat advocates incorporating known qualitative features of \r\nsystems of differential equations, such as invariants, \r\nsymmetries, conservation laws, phase-space dynamics, and \r\nsymplectic structure, in their numerical solution \r\nalgorithms.  In particular, the symmetry properties of a \r\nsystem of differential equations have proven to be a very \r\npowerful means of understanding the qualitative properties \r\nof its solutions as well as facilitating the determination of \r\nexact analytical solutions.  Such special solutions often \r\nserve as prototypes and govern the asymptotics for more \r\ncomplicated situations, and also as useful testing grounds \r\nfor developing numerical integration schemes.  The \r\nmethods of symmetry analysis and integrability for \r\ndifferential equations have, more recently, been adapted \r\nwith considerable success to analyze discrete equations.  \r\nOn the other hand, the incorporation of symmetry in the \r\ndesign of invariant geometric numerical schemes for a \r\nvariety of differential equations arising in applications has \r\nrecently been the subject of increasing research activity and \r\nadvances.  The key objective of the workshop is to bring \r\nexperts on applications of group theory to discrete \r\nequations together with practitioners of geometric \r\nnumerical methods, thereby stimulating a mutually \r\nbeneficial exchange of ideas and recent developments and \r\nfostering a cross-fertilization between such closely related \r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nGroup theory is the mathematical formalization of the \r\nconcept of symmetry.  Most interesting systems that arise \r\nin applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, \r\ncomputer vision, biology, etc., possess a rich variety of \r\nsymmetries.  While exploiting the symmetries of \r\ncontinuous systems has a long and distinguished record of \r\nachievement, only recently have significant developments \r\noccurred within the discrete regime.  Indeed, standard \r\nnumerical solution methods used by computers typically \r\nfail to properly respect the underlying symmetry properties. \r\nThis workshop will build on recent developments in \r\nsymmetry analysis of discrete systems and the development \r\nof symmetry-preserving numerical solution techniques. The \r\nparticipants are experts in symmetry methods and in \r\ngeometric numerical integration. The workshop will \r\npromote interactions and significant progress in both \r\nsubjects, as well as their applications in mathematics and \r\nthe sciences.   The results of the workshop, as presented in \r\nthe talks and discussions, will be summed up in a book to \r\nbe so focused as to be of permanent value.  In addition, an \r\nassessment of the current state of the art in the subjects and \r\nnew scientific opportunities stemming from this workshop \r\nwill be the focus of a panel discussion and white paper to \r\nbe distributed and posted on the web.",
