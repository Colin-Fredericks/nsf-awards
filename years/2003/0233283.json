Shefford P. Baker in the US and Olivier Thomas in France lead this collaboration. They will investigate stress distribution in nanofabricated metal structures.  They will also determine the effects on mechanical behavior and reliability. This work will be accomplished by a combination of high-resolution x-ray diffraction experiments at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source.  Samples will include model single and bi-crystal thin film systems, polycrystalline films, and nanofabricated line arrays. The French investigators will focus on x-ray data analysis and modeling of x-ray spectra and the US investigators will contribute sample preparation and mechanical modeling.  Both groups will participate in the design and execution of x-ray measurements at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Research on metal films and nanostructures at the 10-1000 nanometers play critical roles in virtually all nanofabricated devices. The result of this collaboration will advance understanding of the mechanical behavior of thin metal films and nanopatterned structures, which will be of value in industries that rely on nanofabrication.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United States. \r\n",
