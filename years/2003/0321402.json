The instrumentation will be housed in the facilities of the Frontier Research Program for Global Change at the International Arctic Research Center, University of Alaska.  It will be applied to a variety of projects, with existing support in place to focus on the investigation of iron-binding organic ligands, the use of Pb isotopes to trace Arctic water masses, and use of Ir in ice cores to study variations in cosmic material influx.  The mass spectrometer supported here provides a unique capability in the Fairbanks region, and it is expected to catalyze interdisciplinary and extramural collaborations.  It is anticipated that training and use of the new instrumentation will be incorporated into courses and research projects involving both undergraduate and graduate students at University of Alaska.  University of Alaska and the Frontier Program of IARC are providing 30% of the cost of the project from non-federal funds.  It is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.\r\n***\r\n",
