 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Zhiping Zheng at the University of Arizona to design and synthesize a novel class of polynuclear lanthanide complexes, to study the properties of these substances, and to explore their biomedical and advanced technological applications.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to develop a fundamental understanding of lanthanide coordination chemistry under physiological or higher pH conditions with a variety of ligands, including those that are biologically relevant.  These efforts are aimed at producing a variety of unprecedented lanthanide clusters featuring highly bridging oxo and hydroxo groups and at elucidating the factors governing the formation of these novel substances.  The potential applications to be explored include contrast agents for biomedical imaging, luminescent materials for liquid crystal displays, and magnetooptical data storage.  The broad scope and modular nature of the work involves cross-disciplinary collaborations and provides diverse opportunities for training of students at all levels.  \r\n\r\nIn line with the proposed research, educational activities are proposed aimed at establishing a well-defined program in Materials Chemistry integrated into the undergraduate or graduate curricula at the University of Arizona.  The ultimate goal is to produce scientists who are capable of designing, synthesizing, characterizing, and testing new materials to meet the challenging demand for advanced-performance materials in the next century.  This educational program will also serve as a vehicle to disseminate chemical science to the general public. \r\n",
