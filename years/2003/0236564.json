Traditional methods of phase equilibria research developed by igneous and metamorphic petrologists will be enhanced and adapted using technical advances such as rapid quenching and automated control of pressure to solve volcanological problems.  Experimental studies will explore eruption parameters and test hypotheses about volcanic plumbing systems and magmatic processes on Earth and other planets.  Dynamic experiments, particularly those in which pressure is varied, are vital to understanding how magmas respond chemically to changes in intensive parameters and volatile concentrations prior to and during volcanic eruptions.   The long-term objective is to contribute to the growing database of all the relevant parameters necessary to quantitatively model the timing, style, and intensity of volcanic eruptions. One broader impact of the scientific results will be an improved understanding of hazards associated with volcanic eruptions.  The laboratory is expected to serve a regional community of volcanologists in Hawaii and Pacific region, through collaborations with USGS scientists and university researchers.  The University of Hawaii is a magnet for graduate students in volcanology, many of whom will be exposed to laboratory research through courses and work toward advanced degrees in the MS/PhD program.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
