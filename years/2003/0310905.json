 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeology (81)  This project outfits archeological laboratories at Sweet Briar College to enhance an interdisciplinary archaeology program and improve existing archaeology course offerings.  Based on successful models from past CCLI- A&I (DUE 0088017) and EMD (DUE 0088692) projects, a total station is acquired to support field archaeology, and computers and software to support archaeological applications of GIS.  The project implements new instructional modules in six different archaeology courses at Sweet Briar College, and provides students at this small women's college with training in the skills, techniques, and scientific approaches of modern archaeology, as well as opportunities at faculty-mentored research experiences, both locally and internationally.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in expanding instruction in archaeology at Sweet Briar College, in particular in using the institution's historical site as an instructional resource.  The broader impacts of the work come primarily through the educational opportunities this project affords to Sweet Briar College students.",
