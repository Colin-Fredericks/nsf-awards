 "awd_abstract_narration": "While related literature highlights several issues pertaining to university-industry partnerships, the possible consequences of bringing together individuals from academic and corporate cultures to implement long-term research programs are poorly understood.  Moreover, it is unclear how academic and corporate partnerships ultimately affect the process of scientific research.  Accordingly, the objective of this dissertation improvement grant will be to examine how collaboration between individuals within the California Institutes for Science and Innovation shapes organizational culture and scientific research.  The study will employ a multi-site case study approach, which will include in-depth interviews, participant observation, and open-ended surveys with both faculty members and corporate professionals at three of the institutes.  An initial pilot study at the fourth institute will provide guidelines for developing the research protocol and interpreting the findings.  Finally, document analysis of printed and audio-visual materials from each of the four the institutes will be conducted to highlight the history, structure, and development of the institutes.  Given that little is known about these partnerships, this study will provide a better understanding of how such collaborations work, how organizational culture develops within the institutes, and how these partnerships affect scientific innovation.  Understanding how academic and corporate cultures collaborate in joint ventures has the potential to impact practice, policy, and theory.  On a practical level, this study can inform the institutes and others who are interested in forming similar partnerships as they set priorities and make organizational decisions.  In addition, since the investment in these institutes is substantial and designed to be a long-term commitment to these partnerships, the findings from this study can lay the groundwork for future research on the California Institutes for Science and Innovation in later stages of development.  On a policy level, this study will hopefully contribute to an understanding of how these institutes are working to fulfill the needs of the state.  From a theoretical perspective, this study will contribute to the understanding of scientific cultures and the blending of cultures in the implementation of a joint venture.",
