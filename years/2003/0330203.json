With significant advancements in device\r\ntechnologies, small, low-powered, low-cost sensors have become feasible today. These\r\ndevices can be deployed in large numbers to form a dense networked environment, with the\r\nobjective of gathering data for various purposes. Therefore, even though an individual\r\nsensor device is expected to be cheap, the sheer number of the sensors would make the\r\nmonetary cost of deployment significant. Hence the question of cost-optimal deployment is\r\nof prime importance. In the proposed project, we plan to investigate some fundamental\r\ntheoretical questions regarding optimal deployment of large-scale sensor networks, and\r\nexplore how our theoretical results can be applied to develop effective deployment\r\nstrategies in complex practical scenarios.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the primary goal of this project is to develop sensor deployment\r\nstrategies that minimize the deployment cost while meeting desired objectives on\r\nconnectivity, coverage and network lifetime. This involves minimizing the number of\r\nsensors used to monitor a given region while satisfying some specified deployment\r\ncriteria. We plan to consider different energy usage scenarios, and various practical\r\nconstraints on the placement of the sensor nodes. The questions that we propose to\r\ninvestigate are important and timely, and must be addressed before networks of sensors\r\nstart getting deployed at large scales. Since connectivity, coverage and deployment\r\nproblems arise in a very wide variety of real-life scenarios, we believe that the\r\nfundamental questions that we explore in this project could be relevant in areas other\r\nthan sensor networks as well.\r\n\r\nWe are also fully committed towards establishing links between research and education.\r\nApart from supervising graduate students, we plan to involve junior and senior level\r\nundergraduates in developing a simulator, and carrying out large scale experiments. We\r\nwould also engage them in developing a software (to be made available publicly) that\r\nincorporates our research ideas, and can be used for solving sensor deployment problems\r\nin regions of arbitrary shapes and sizes, through the use of a graphical user interface.\r\nWe plan to introduce a new course on optimization in networking at the graduate level,\r\nand introduce several topics and class projects related to ad-hoc and sensor networks in\r\nthe senior level introductory course on networking. We would make a special effort to\r\nengage women and other under-represented groups in our research and educational programs.\r\n\r\n",
