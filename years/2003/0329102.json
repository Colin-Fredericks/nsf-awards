Also known as slime molds, the eumycetozoans all have an amoeba-like stage that feeds on the bacteria and fungi that decompose dead vegetation.  When finished feeding, the amoebal stage develops into a spore-dispersing fruiting body that is fungus-like in appearance.  Eumycetozoans are important in many areas of biology.  Some eumycetozoans are widely used in biology as model organisms.  Within the group, a number of different kinds of amoebae are found.  In terrestrial ecosystems, eumycetozoans are important predators of bacteria and fungi.  Biologists who are interested in the model eumycetozoans, those interested in how different kinds of cells develop in closely related organisms, and those interested in the ecology of plant decomposition all have a need to know about the relationships among eumycetozoans and how to identify them accurately.  In the last two decades, major advances have been made in the methods used to develop modern classifications; however, during that time no major classifications of eumycetozoans have been produced, and the number of experts in the group has declined seriously.  This project will help to relieve this situation by having a team of experts in modern classification methods and experts in mycetozoan biology: (1) help to train several PhD students to be well rounded systematists, (2) produce a comprehensive, revised classification of the eumycetozoans, and (3) disseminate this information to biologists and the interested public on a Web Site devoted to eumycetozoans classification and biology.\r\n",
