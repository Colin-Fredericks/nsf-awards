Kahn\r\n\r\nThe topology/geometry group in the Department of Mathematics at\r\nCornell University requests funding to continue support for three\r\nyears for the Cornell Topology Festival, which this group has\r\nhosted each year since 1963. The Festival provides a significant\r\narena for the dissemination and development of important, new\r\nresults from a wide array of areas within the realms of\r\nalgebraic, differential, and geometric topology, and allied\r\nsubjects.  While it is planned to continue the broad,\r\ninterdisciplinary flavor and collaboration-friendly format that\r\nhave characterized the Festival over the years, it is also\r\nproposed to extend the Festival by a day to accommodate specific\r\nannual areas of emphasis. In this way the Festival can be\r\nresponsive to the dominant trends of this era: namely, the\r\nsimultaneous flourishing of both subspecializations and\r\ncross-disciplinary activity. An active outreach program, which\r\nincludes some travel support, will be initiated to broaden\r\nparticipation in the Festival. For our initial conference under\r\nthis grant (May 1-4, 2003), we will have as area of emphasis the\r\nvery active field of geometric group theory.\r\n\r\nThe Topology Festival was conceived and initiated in the 1960's\r\nboth as an annual celebration of the burgeoning field of topology\r\nand as an annual conference/workshop for topologists in the\r\nnortheastern United States.  While topology has deep roots in\r\nearly European mathematical investigations of space and geometry,\r\nit is in the mid-twentieth century that topology came of age,\r\nwith American mathematicians providing a large array of seminal\r\ndiscoveries. American topology has been a key element in\r\nAmerica's world leadership in mathematics.  Topology is a broad\r\nsubject, which overlaps with areas of `discrete' mathematics\r\n(e.g., algebra, combinatorics), as well as with `continuous' or\r\n`smooth' mathematics (e.g., differential geometry, dynamical\r\nsystems, mathematical physics).  Indeed, a large part of\r\ncontemporary mathematics has been profoundly affected by\r\ntopological results and methods. As a foundational subject, the\r\napplications of topology are very widespread. A few examples are:\r\ngenetics (the study of knotting of DNA molecules), neuroscience\r\nand robotics (dynamical systems modeling), computer science ( in\r\ngeometric modeling and simulation), mathematical economics (in\r\nsmooth equilibrium theory), physics (the theory of gauge fields),\r\nand neighboring fields in mathematics (e.g., geometric group\r\ntheory).  Although many of the basic questions that powered early\r\nefforts in topology have been answered, new problems are\r\nconstantly being generated as science moves forward, and\r\nimportant classical problems remain.  An example of the latter is\r\nthe Poincare Conjecture, which has been the subject of several\r\nnotable talks at past Topology Festivals and remains one of the\r\npremier unsolved problems of mathematics today---one of the Clay\r\nInstitute's seven `millenium problems'--- and the focus of\r\nintense research. The topologists and geometers at Cornell are\r\nproud of the useful role that the Topology Festival has played\r\nand will continue to play in the contemporary development of this\r\ndynamic area of mathematics.\r\n",
