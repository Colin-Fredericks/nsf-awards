 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saffer EAR-0229585\r\n\r\nDefining physical and mechanical properties of fault gouge and their \r\nrelationship to fault behavior remains a fundamental step toward \r\nunderstanding earthquakes and faulting. Frictional velocity \r\ndependence is considered the most likely mechanism to explain \r\ndifferences between stable sliding (aseismic) and unstable stick-slip \r\n(seismogenic) behavior. Materials that exhibit velocity-strengthening \r\nbehavior produce only inherently stable frictional slip, whereas \r\nthose that exhibit velocity-weakening are capable of hosting unstable \r\nrupture. This work will define the frictional properties of a suite \r\nof natural and synthetic mixed-mineralogy gouges, as a function of \r\ncomposition. The experimental plan will focus on testing (1) natural \r\nsamples of subduction zone materials that have undergone progressive \r\nalteration at temperatures up to ~250 degrees C, and (2) a suite of \r\nsynthetic mixtures of montmorillonite, illite, and quartz, and \r\ndeveloping the appropriate constitutive equations to describe their \r\nbehavior. This work will include: (1) quantitative x-ray diffraction \r\n(XRD) to determine the composition of natural gouges, (2) a series of \r\nshearing experiments for each material, over a wide range of \r\nexperimental conditions, and (3) petrographic and SEM \r\ncharacterization of microstructures in experimentally deformed gouges \r\nand comparison with natural microstructures observed in the sample \r\nlocalities.  The work will provide high-quality measurements of \r\nfrictional constitutive properties for realistic natural fault gouge \r\nmaterials relevant to seismic faulting, and define variations in \r\nthese properties with gouge composition. This work will constitute an \r\nimportant step toward a better understanding of fault behavior and \r\nits potential variability with depth and along-strike. In addition, \r\ndetailed characterization of fabric development in experimentally \r\ndeformed gouges will provide important insights into application of \r\nlaboratory measurements to natural faults.\r\n",
