 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research explores the development of a novel, low cost composite material aimed at\r\nthe strengthening and upgrading of reinforced and prestressed concrete members. The proposed\r\ncomposite material intends to maintain and improve on the performance and installation advantages of\r\nFRP systems, while significantly reducing their cost. This new composite material is composed of a\r\nknitted high-strength steel cord impregnated in a polymeric resin matrix and is called SRP, for steel\r\nreinforced polymer. The steel cord, a commodity product used in the radial tire manufacturing industry,\r\nhas the strength and stiffness of carbon fiber at a fraction of its cost. To support the development of this\r\nnovel, low cost composite material, the research program consists of the following two tasks; (1) Develop\r\nthe material constitutive relations, and (2) Conduct experimental and analytical studies that can\r\nsubstantiate the feasibility of SRP for implementation into the strengthening of RC and PC\r\nstructural members. At the conclusion of this research, the SRP composite could be ready for\r\ndemonstration in the field. Some of the fundamental issues such as long-term durability would\r\nneed further study, but field demonstration will still be warranted at this phase.\r\nThis project will also be integrated within a strong education and technology transfer\r\nprogram, and will involve undergraduate and graduate students in every phase of the project. In\r\naddition, UMR is home to an NSF industry cooperation research center that deals with the\r\nretrofit and repair of bridges and buildings with composites, and potential manufacturers of the\r\nproduct and a leading concrete repair contractor will be directly involved in this research project\r\nso that all aspects of technology transfer are addressed in a systematic manner.\r\n\r\n",
