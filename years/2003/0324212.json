 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides support to 29 community college transfer students in the departments of Bioengineering, Chemical and Materials Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Unique features of the project include leveraging and building on a cooperative effort between the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD). This project builds on a number of existing programs such as Academic Enrichment to teach study skills, a Bridge Program for assisting the transition of students, Inclusive Learning Communities to provide continuous academic mentoring and career mentoring, and Research Orientation Workshops (ROW) concentrating on research and graduate school, as well as an optional research experience. The project aims at recruiting and retaining high quality students with financial need who, without this support, might not be able to continue their education on a full time basis. The program serves transfer students with at least 30 hours, but also includes some sophomore transfers with special needs. Women and underrepresented minority students, including Native American students, are targeted by this project.",
