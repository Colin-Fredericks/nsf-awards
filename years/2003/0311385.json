 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This collaborative project between the University of Houston at Clear Lake and the University of Houston Downtown establishes a curriculum model for the flexible adoption of computer security courseware by nationwide computing programs. The curriculum model especially benefits computing programs in smaller colleges/universities, where resources tend to be limited. Intellectual merit is present in the model which consists of an array of security modules, a majority of which are developed by this project and the Distributed Computer Security Laboratory (DCSL), which consists of two remotely connected labs. The labs are insulated from their respective campus backbone and equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentations, including wireless and mobile networks. The DCSL provides a shared platform where distributed security can be rigorously studied. This model is an adaptation from the Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab at Polytechnic University of New York. The ISIS Lab supports two courses: Computer Security and Network Security. Extensions to the ISIS model include a module-based approach and new subject areas, such as Wireless Security and Database Security. The broader impacts of the project include: creation of the module-based model, enabling universities to select modules and supporting courseware to create customized curriculum; and the distributed lab model, enabling universities to build a distributed security lab without interfering with their campus network.",
