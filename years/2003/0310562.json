A physical knot is modeled as a smooth closed curve with certain thickness. \r\nThe thickness of a smooth knot can be thought of, intuitively, as the radius of the rope \r\nwith which the knot is tied as tight as possible. In mathematical terms it is the largest \r\nembedded normal tube around a smooth knot that does not intersect itself. The ropelength \r\nof a (thick) knot is the quotient of its arc length over its thickness. The focus of this \r\nproposed work is the challenging problem of finding good estimates of the minimum \r\nropelengths of various knots. For knots with small crossing numbers, computational \r\nmethods exist which estimate their ropelengths. The techniques used to obtain these \r\nestimates cannot be extended to very large knots. Thus very few computational results \r\nare available for knots with large crossing numbers. It is known that for any \r\nnontrivial knot, its minimum ropelength is bounded above by a constant times its \r\ncrossing number squared. The PIs have recently improved this bound to a constant times \r\nthe crossing number (of the knot) raised to the three half power. However, \r\nthe PIs suspect that for most knots, their ropelengths are bounded by their \r\ncrossing numbers (times a constant) or less. So there seems to be a gap between \r\nthe proven bound and the actual minimal ropelengths of various knots. In this work, \r\nthe PIs will develop a computer program that is capable of computing a close estimate \r\nof the minimum ropelengths of knots with large crossing numbers. This computer program \r\nwill make use of the algorithm used in establishing the upper bound of the three \r\nhalf power mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome research in biophysics, chemistry and physics deals with long strings of molecules \r\nthat are knotted, for example, circular DNA or polymer chains. The type of knotting \r\noften influences the properties and behavior of the molecules. To better understand the \r\nproperties of such molecules, this project proposes to examine the relationship between \r\nthe complexity of a knot and its physical length. This relationship can be formulated \r\ninto the following question: If one is given a rope of certain radius and wants to tie \r\na certain knot, how long does the rope have to be? For small knots, one can get a rough \r\nidea by simply tying the knot and measuring how much rope it took. However for very \r\nlarge knots that is not practical since it is not clear how to tie a knot with rope \r\nin an optimal way. The proposed project involves the creation of a computer program \r\nthat - for many knots -checks lots of different ways how the same knot can be tied, \r\nin order to find a close estimate to the minimum length of rope. The results of the \r\ncomputer program will be used to hypothesize a general relationship between the \r\ncomplexities and the lengths of knots. \r\n",
