 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration brings together three groups led by David Smith at Arizona State University (ASU), Humberto Terrones at the Instituto Potosino de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (IPICyT), San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and Guillermo Solorzano at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica-Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil. The overall focus of the highly complementary research efforts is the synthesis, processing and atomic-scale characterization of nanostructured materials. These activities include the synthesis of nanoscale nitride particles based on Al, Ga, B and Si, as well as metal-matrix ceramic-reinforced nanocomposites  (PUC-Rio), the growth of carbon nanotubes filled with magnetic metallic alloys  (IPICyT-Mexico) and the study of magnetotactic bacteria containing chains of magnetite crystals known as magnetosomes (Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro). These various nanostructured materials are characterized using the advanced transmission electron microscope (TEM) facilities available at ASU. High-resolution electron microscopy and small-probe microanalysis are used to determine microstructure and elemental composition at the atomic scale, and electron holography is used to study the magnetic response and microstructure of the magnetic nanostructures.\r\n\r\nExchange students and postdoctoral workers from Brazil and Mexico spend extended periods of time at ASU participating in the TEM experiments and gaining invaluable experience in advanced characterization methods. The ASU participants travel to the partner institutions in Brazil and Mexico to observe and participate in the materials synthesis and processing efforts, and also to conduct workshops on TEM characterization. All participants cooperate in organizing a symposium on the topic of  \"Atomic-Scale Control and Characterization of Nanostructured Systems\" as part of the Brazilian Materials Research Society meeting to be held in Rio de Janeiro during 2005. Overall, this collaborative project serves to promote international exchange and cooperation and enable enhanced education and training opportunities. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
