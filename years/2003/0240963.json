 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the present time, population biology exists as two, largely independent, lines of investigation: understanding why species have particular traits (life histories and behaviors), given current conditions; and predicting changes in population size over time (population dynamics), based on a few simple features shared by many populations, rather than the diversity of known behaviors and life histories.  This research tests the role of different aspects of life history and behavior for patterns of plant population dynamics, with particular emphasis on problems relating to applied questions in conservation biology and ecological restoration.  This grant will provide support for ongoing projects testing ecological mechanisms of synchronous reproduction in an herbaceous perennial plant (Astragalus scaphoides), and the importance of active foraging for a hemiparasitic annual plant (Rhinanthus minor).  In addition, funds will be used to collect preliminary data investigating which traits best predict the ability of different plant populations and species to respond to environmental contamination.  \r\nEcologists are increasingly called upon to predict responses to perturbations at large spatial and temporal scales, that are not amenable to direct experimentation.  Separation of life history and population dynamic research means, for example, that when predictive models are used to make decisions about the consequences of management options, they do not typically take into account most of what is known about a particular species.  In many cases, this simplification may be appropriate; the goal of a model is to capture key features of populations that are needed to predict dynamics in space and time, not to accurately reproduce every detail about behavior and life history, even it could be done.  The question is  which \"details\" must be considered, because they lead to population responses that systematically deviate from those predicted by simpler models.  Thus, the primary application of my research is in developing methods to choose appropriate levels of detail.  In addition, I am studying population biology of an endemic plant, listed as a species of concern in Montana and Idaho.  Finally, my research will contribute to knowledge of responses of plants to zinc pollution in particular, and mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental contamination in general.\r\n\r\n",
