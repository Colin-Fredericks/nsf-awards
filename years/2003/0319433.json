 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of integrating two established particle separation technologies with a continuous particle transfer mechanism to produce a bioaerosol concentrator/sampler that offers significant improvements over conventional sampling devices.  Rapid biosensing/detection requires a concentrator/sampler that can (a) efficiently collect and concentrate respirable particles (1-10 mm) from large air volumes, (b) efficiently transfer collected particles (dry or wet) for sampling, (c) maintain high viability of sampled bioagents, and (d) be scaled up/down for various applications.  The research plan consists of designing, fabricating and testing a novel prototype concentrator/sampler, evaluating particle collection/concentration performance, and evaluating sampling efficiency and microorganism efficacy using inert particles and biological simulates (e.g. spores).  The prototype will integrate a dry cyclone prefilter, a proprietary concentrator/sampler module, a novel containment housing and particle extraction/sampling mechanisms.  Target performance for the prototype includes: collection/concentration efficiency of >85%, dry/wet sampling efficiencies of >80%, and microorganism viability of >75%. \r\n\r\nThe primary commercial application of this product will be for military use and homeland defense.  This novel aerosol particle collector/sampler would also have commercial uses in the monitoring of hazardous bioaerosols in a variety of civilian/industrial environments.  Some application areas include monitoring: (1) hazardous particulate emissions near EPA Super Fund sites, (2) airborne asbestos or lead paint particles during and after removal and remediation operations, (3) PM-2.5 particles (i.e., replacing older PM-10 samplers) when collecting EPA compliance data on outdoor air quality, (4) the spread of herbicides and pesticides during agricultural spraying operations, and (5) the spread of infectious diseases in hospitals, nursing homes, etc.",
