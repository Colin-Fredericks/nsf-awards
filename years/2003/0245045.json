 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to integrate important contributions to research \r\nwith an educational experience for promising undergraduate students. The \r\nJames Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics Group, consisting of \r\nDr. Giovanetti, Dr. Niculescu, and a group of undergraduate students, is \r\nconducting research in the area of Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics at \r\nThomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, TJNAF, and at the Paul \r\nScherrer Institute, PSI. The members of the group are actively involved in \r\nthe ongoing research at TJNAF and are contributing by designing and testing \r\nequipment, participating in data taking and performing data analysis. This \r\ngroup is also a key collaborator in an experiment underway at PSI (Muon \r\nLifetime Experiment).\r\n\r\nThe project will explore the rich structure of particles like the proton \r\nand the neutron, which are the basic building blocks of the atomic nucleus. \r\nIt is widely held that protons and neutrons are built out of three quarks. \r\nThese quarks are viewed as fundamental particles that have simple \r\nproperties.  Gluonic forces hold the quarks together. The basic nature of \r\nthe forces are believed to be understood. However there is not yet a \r\ncomplete picture of the three-quark system. Studies that probe the nature \r\nof the proton, and the neutron will clarify the important ingredients, test \r\nthe validity of models and approximations, and perhaps discover new \r\nfeatures that require a closer look at the underlying theory.\r\n\r\nImprovements in technology and progress in theoretical physics have created \r\nthe opportunity to improve our knowledge of the strength of another basic \r\ninteraction, the weak force. By measuring the lifetime of the muon the \r\nFermi coupling constant can be extracted. This constant determines the \r\nstrength of the weak force in the same manner as electric charge determines \r\nthe strength of the electromagnetic force.  The goal is to improve this \r\nmeasured value to one part per million.\r\n\r\n\r\n***************************************************\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGiovanetti, Kevin L\r\ngiovankl@jmu.edu\r\n\r\n",
