AAAS will work with NSF's Division of Graduate Education, which houses GK-12, to organize a two-day meeting annually for years 2004 to 2006.  Participants will include principal investigators and other members of the GK-12 funded programs, including K-12 teachers and graduate teaching fellows.  AAAS-EHR will arrange pre-conference activities, develop the agenda in cooperation with NSF staff, host the meeting, oversee all meeting logistics, summarize and analyze findings from discussions and presentations, prepare electronic and print documents, and help disseminate information about the GK-12 program through presentations at the AAAS Annual Meetings.",
