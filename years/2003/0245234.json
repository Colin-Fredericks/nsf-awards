 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to operate the full Milagro air shower telescope,the Milagro pond and\r\nthe surrounding array of outrigger water tanks,for the next three years and analyze the\r\ndata to study the generation of TeV gamma rays from extremely energetic cosmic objects,\r\nsuch as nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (Blazars),Gamma Ray Bursts(GRB)and steady\r\nemitters in our own Galaxy.Study of TeV gamma rays from sources provides a sensitive\r\ntool for understanding the mechanisms for particle acceleration and subsequent gamma ray\r\ngeneration.TeV gamma rays from GRBs of short duration may allow s to test for possible\r\nenergy dependence of the speed of light as predicted by theories of quantum gravity.The\r\nupper end of the gamma ray spectrum is particularly sensitive to the bulk Lorentz factor\r\nand magnetic .elds of the source shock.The shape at TeV energies can provide a probe of\r\nthe extra-galactic IR absorption.\r\nMilagro is a water Cherenkov air shower telescope.It consists of a 5000 m 2 central pond\r\nand an array of 175 water tanks distributed out to 120 meters from the center of the pond.\r\nIts point spread function for gamma rays has a width of 0.8 deg.Its strengths are:all-sky\r\nsensitivity,continuous 24 hour operation and ability to study transients on many di .erent\r\ntime scales.Milagro will be the only contin ously operating TeV gamma ray telescope\r\nbefore GLAST will operate.Milagro is a collaboration of Irvine(UCI),Santa Cruz(UCSC)\r\nand Riverside(UCR),LANL,Maryland,New Hampshire,NYU and GMU groups.\r\nIn the last three year grant,we have operated full Milagro pond detector at a data rate of\r\n1700 Hz.We have developed a new trigger to be able to study GRBs down to a few hundred\r\nGeV so that we can be sensitive to GRBs out to a red shift of 0.4.We have completed the\r\narray of 175 outrigger tanks to be able to locate shower cores out to about 100 meters which\r\nwill improve our pointing and angular resolution substantially.We have working algorithms\r\nto reject more than 90 percent of cosmic ray triggers while keeping more than 50 percent of\r\ngamma ray triggers.We have implemented on-line capability of detecting bursts or transients\r\nin real-time,within 5 minutes and sending out alerts for m ltifrequency searches.We have\r\nobserved the steady Crab at greater than 5 sigma.We have observed Mrk421 during its\r\nactive phase in 2001.We have observed a 30 sigma de .cit for the shadow of the moon in a\r\nyear of operation which provides direct energy calibration of Milagro and enables search of\r\nanti-proton component of cosmic rays in the TeV energy range.We have begun the study\r\nof gamma rays expected from cosmic ray interactions in the galaxy in TeV energy range.\r\nMilagro not only makes a signi .cant contribution to high energy astrophysics but also\r\nprovides an excellent tool for teaching,training and learning for graduate students,under-\r\ngraduate students and science teachers from K-12.With its location in New Mexico,it\r\nprovides research and learning experience to Native Americans.At UCI,we have developed\r\neducational outreach activities for research experience to undergraduates as a part of on-\r\ngoing UCI REU program,to train high school science teachers through the COSMOS and\r\nQuarknet programs of UCI.The UCI Milagro group will continue to provide training to\r\nundergraduate and graduate students to work on di .erent aspects of the research and on\r\nsite work at the Milagro site for gaining real research experience.",
