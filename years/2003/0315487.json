 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action supports the purchase of a BioScope Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) from Veeco Instruments. With a specially designed stage that allows for AFM imaging alone, optical characterization alone, or combined AFM and optical characterization, this instrument will be used to study the nanoscale structural properties of ultrathin interfacial layers of soft materials in air and liquid media and determine how they respond to environmental stimuli. This instrument will also be used in combination with optical spectroscopy techniques to study dynamic adsorption events at materials surfaces. A set of projects that will benefit from the capabilities of this instrument include efforts on bioactive nanoparticle-surface interactions; environmentally responsive, surface confined polymer layers; hybrid polymer layers; biomimetic polymer matrices for guided tissue regeneration; and bacterial cell adhesion to antimicrobial polymer films and luminescent, antibody-linked nanoparticles. These projects impact important scientific areas such as the development of new biomaterials; nano-devices such as molecular valves and switches; effective therapies for treating chronic, non-healing wounds and impaired wound healing; antimicrobial food packaging; and sensors for bacterial pathogens. \r\n\r\nThe AFM instrument will be housed in the Surface Characterization Laboratory, located in the Department of Chemical Engineering. This facility is used by post-doctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students from Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering, Chemistry, Environmental Engineering and Materials Science & Engineering. A new group from Food Science will add to the list of researchers who benefit from the interdisciplinary training environment that this facility provides. The AFM instrument and facility will be available to faculty and students from nearby non-PhD granting colleges that have an association with Clemson's Department of Chemical Engineering through Research Exploration programs. The AFM will also help to grow the Surface Characterization Laboratory into a state-of-the-art facility in the area of advanced materials research, which is a core research theme of Clemson University.      \r\n\r\n",
