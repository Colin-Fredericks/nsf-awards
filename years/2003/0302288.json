 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Benjamin Banneker Association, Inc. (BBA) and the National Association of Mathematicians (NAM) with the support of the other fourteen member societies of CBMS is conducting a Second National Summit -MET Summit II -  on the Mathematical Education of Teachers with emphasis on participation by HBCU's and other institutions that produce minority teachers or teachers that work in areas with high concentrations of minority students. The Mathematical Education of Teachers (MET), is the mathematics community's agenda for improving the mathematical preparation of future teachers. The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), launched MET with a breakfast Policy Briefing, and a National Summit on the Mathematical Education of Teachers. This Second National Summit engages college and university mathematics faculty in the hard work of implementing the vision of the mathematical education of teachers presented in MET. Since HBCU's train a significant number of teachers of mathematics, MET Summit II uses the format of the first national summit  (MET I) which was a working conference to introduce mathematics faculty and department chairs to the report, to give them vivid and concrete examples of successful implementations of the recommendations in the report, and to engage them in beginning widespread local efforts to implement and spread the vision of the report. Invited teams include a faculty member from the mathematics department, a faculty member from mathematics education, a college or university administrator with responsibility for teacher preparation programs, a teacher from a K-12 school system involved in teacher preparation and/or in-service activities associated with the college or university and a community college mathematics faculty member. The working sessions engage the participants in thinking about how to address the challenges in carrying out the recommendations of the report at their institution and surrounding community. Discussions in the working sessions aid the participants in analyzing the implications for designing courses in their own institutions and cooperative programs with other institutions and state agencies. In addition to these sessions focus on what must be done to change the content of teacher education.",
