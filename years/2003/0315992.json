 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key regulators of many physiological processes, including plant growth, fruit ripening, defense against pathogens, and aging. This research is directed at understanding the mechanisms of action of ethylene and its interactions with auxin. Such knowledge is crucial to the ability to manipulate plant responses to the environment  for the purpose of improving agricultural production, forestry and horticulture.  In this project, genetic and molecular tools will be employed to clone three novel mutants that possess reduced sensitivity to ethylene, as well as to dissect the role of the corresponding genes in the interaction between ethylene and auxin.  Preliminary data imply the involvement of the new ethylene genes in the regulation of the biosynthesis of auxin precursors.  These studies are expected to shed light on the cross-talk between the two hormones.\r\nThe education and training components will be an integral part of this project.  Graduate, undergraduate and high-school students will have the opportunity to directly participate in this scientific effort and get \"hands-on\" research experience in the exciting field of molecular genetics in the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. This project will allow Dr. Alonso to continue with his ongoing  participation in several graduate and undergraduate training programs. The programs will serve to attract and encourage students from ethnic minorities, especially Hispanics, to become interested in science and to further pursue their aspirations for higher education and experimental research. \r\n",
