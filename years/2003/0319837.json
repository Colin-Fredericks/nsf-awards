 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request funds to acquire a Quantum Design Superconducting Quantum Interference Device\r\n(SQUID) magnetometer to measure the magnetic properties of Mn and Cr-doped Group III-\r\nnitride films grown on both doped and undoped AlGaN/GaN heterostructures and single\r\ncrystalline Mn-based perovskites. Our laboratories are equipped with all the growth, fabrication,\r\ntesting for electrical and structural capabilities, but this critical piece of equipment is missing. The\r\nequipment will be installed in the state of the art Virginia Microelectronic Center research\r\nlaboratories at VCU. Spurred by room temperature ferromagnetism in GaN:Mn and potential\r\napplications combining spin and charge transport for devices under the umbrella of spintronics,\r\nwe will investigate the fundamental issues in nanoscale semiconducting ferromagnets, such as\r\nthermal stability of magnetism, Curie temperature, magnetic viscosity, coercivity, and inter-dot\r\nmagnetic interactions in GaN quantum dots interfaced with GaMnN/GaCrN films, as well as\r\nGaMnN or GaCrN dots interfaced with GaN films. Additionally, we will also investigate\r\nmagnetism in single crystalline oxides, which are produced in our laboratory using MBE systems\r\nand a sputtering system. Specifically, the temperature dependence of magnetization in both field-\r\ncooled and zero-field-cooled conditions, magnetization hysteresis and magnetic relaxation related\r\nbehavior will be measured. These are critical to understand the magnetic behavior of these\r\nferromagnetic semiconductors and magnetic perovskites.\r\nFurthermore, magnetic anisotropy and easy axis reorientations related to hole density or epitaxial\r\ngrowth lattice-matching strains will be investigated. The behavior of thin film systems containing\r\na few layers of diluted magnetic materials is complicated by the fact that the absolute magnitude\r\nof the magnetic moment is very small, especially at higher temperatures. In order to measure\r\nthese effects with high precision and obtain the relevant information for fabricating high-quality\r\nsamples, we need a SQUID magnetometer equipped with sample space oven and sample rotator.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal is to provide basic and technological understanding of\r\nphysics of behavior of magnetic spins on spin-based devices from the precise measurement of\r\nmagnetization properties on dilute magnetic semiconductors and magnetic oxides fabricated using\r\nthe state-of-the-art techniques. The broader impacts of this proposal are to provide necessary\r\ninformation and feedback on the fabrication of spinotronic devices, search for new magnetic\r\nmaterials for better spin-injection, and understanding of spin degrees of freedom in this new class\r\nof ferromagnetic semiconductors.",
