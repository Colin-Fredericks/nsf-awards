 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal of Chuu-Lian Terng contains three\r\nprojects.   The first project is  joint with Karen\r\nUhlenbeck (University of Texas at Austin). Terng and\r\nUhlenbeck have collaborated for the past several years\r\nto give geometric interpretations and applications  of\r\nanalytic and algebraic constructions in integrable\r\nsystems. They propose to continue their investigation\r\nof geometric aspects of integrable systems, Virasoro\r\nactions and topological conformal field theory. The\r\nsecond project is on submanifolds in symmetric spaces\r\nwhose Gauss-Codazzi equations are integrable systems.\r\nTerng has made several contributions to this area when\r\nsubmanifolds lie in a space form, and she plans to\r\ncontinue the research for the symmetric  space case. \r\nThe third project is joint with Gudlaugur Thorbergsson\r\n(University of Koln).  Terng and Thorbergsson have\r\nmade contributions to the theory of isoparametric \r\nsubmanifolds in space forms and equifocal submanifolds\r\nin symmetric spaces.   In this project, they propose\r\nto study the geometry of submanifolds in complex and\r\nquaternionic n-space whose U(n) and Sp(n)-invariants\r\nare constant in various senses.  The success of this\r\nproject should give better understanding of\r\nsubmanifold geometry in Hermitian and quaternionic\r\nKahler symmetric spaces. \r\n\r\n\tThe theory of integrable systems has deep relations\r\nwith mechanics and dynamics, applied mathematics,\r\nalgebra, theoretical physics, partial differential\r\nequations, algebraic geometry,  and differential\r\ngeometry.  It has also been used in other sciences. \r\nFor example, (1) the sine-Gordon equation, which is\r\nthe Gauss-Codazzi equation for constant negative\r\nGaussian curvature surfaces in 3-space, also arises in\r\nplasma physics; (2) the non-linear Schrodinger\r\nequation models the propergation of wave envelope in\r\noptic fiber.  Success of the proposed projects will\r\ngive better understanding of the structure of\r\nintegrable systems and their geometrizations. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
