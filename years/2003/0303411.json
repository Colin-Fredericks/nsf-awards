 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Inter-American Materials Collaboration project in materials chemistry is carried out by groups led by Gerald Meyer at Johns Hopkins University, Barbara Loeb at Pontificia Universidad Catolica in Santiago, Chile, and Sergio Moya, University of Santiago, Chile.  The collaboration aims to improve the efficiency and fundamental understanding of molecular level events occurring in dye-sensitized solar cells based on inorganic coordination compounds covalently bound to mesoporous nanocrystalline semiconductors thin films. This collaborative project takes advantage of complimentary expertise in the synthesis and design of molecular components (Chile) and in quantifying the photoelectrochemical and optical properties of functionalized semiconductor materials (USA). The project proposes novel studies that probe critical aspects of molecular semiconductor interfacial energetics and electron transfer with new molecular components that promote vectorial energy and/or charge transfer on nanocrystalline and 'quantum dot' semiconductor particles.\r\n\r\nThis research is directly aimed at improving energy conversion efficiencies of solar cells and can thus have an enormous economic and environmental impact. The focus of the research is on interfacial materials chemistry and the importance of the results gained extend beyond solar energy conversion to other applications that utilize molecular-semiconductor interfaces such as sensors, displays, and light emitting diodes. Mechanistic and materials insights gained from the research proposed herein will be critically important for the next generation of devices that operate on a molecular level. The international and collaborative nature of this project will also increase the breadth of knowledge and enhance education opportunities of the junior and senior scientists involved. More specifically, this project will bring a new materials aspect to the Chilean research and a toolkit of new molecular components to the US research. Scientists will work in each other's laboratories to share and teach experimental techniques.  This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
