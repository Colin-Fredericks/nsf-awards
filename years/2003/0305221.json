 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the simultaneous presence of electronic and spin degrees of freedom in the tetradymite-type A2V B3VI (A=Bi, Sb; B=Te, Se) family of semiconductors. The incorporation of relatively high concentrations of magnetic impurities in tetradymite-type semiconductors, and thus higher Curie temperatures, is sought through thin films of these materials. The project focuses on several objectives: 1) to demonstrate the growth of thin films of Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3, and Bi2Se3 -as well as alloys and superlattices of these binary compounds-doped with transition metals; 2) to explore the upper limits of incorporation of the magnetic impurities (phase diagram) in these hosts; and 3) pursue a comprehensive program of characterization of the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of the obtained DMS (dilute magnetic semiconductor) films. The role of the magnetic impurities in the tetradymite semiconductors and their impact on properties will be studied employing electrical conductivity, magnetoresistance, thermopower, thermal conductivity, specific heat, Hall effect, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility measurements from temperatures of 2K to 300K and in magnetic fields of 0 to 9 T. The project is expected to advance basic knowledge of diluted magnetic semiconductors and thereby help lay groundwork for future spintronics applications. Since the crystal structure and the magnetic ions utilized in the proposed materials are distinctly different from traditional diluted magnetic semiconductors such as Mn-doped III-V or II-VI compounds, the project may shed new light on fundamental issues of magnetism in semiconductors, and possibly of magnetism generally. The highly anisotropic environment of the tetradymite-type crystal structure with its pronounced octahedral coordination of atoms may play a key role in the development of magnetic order; this is in contrast to the cubic environment of Mn-doped zinc-blende or wurtzite structures with their distinct tetrahedral bonding.\r\n%%% \r\nThis project addresses basic materials and condensed matter physics research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance, and places emphasis on the integration of research and education. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the synthesis, processing, and characterization of electronic/magnetic materials. Training of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of MBE growth, semiconductor physics, and magnetism provides special opportunities for them in research and education, and a sound investment in the future workforce. The project is jointly supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and Condensed Matter Physics programs.\r\n***        \r\n",
