This effort, (i) develops a basic research tool in solar radio astrophysics for use by the wider community, (ii) remedies the lack of an important component of the United States National Space Weather Program: the need for readily available low-frequency, broadband, radio dynamic spectra in western longitudes, and (iii) provides a platform for research and development work on broadband antennas, feeds, and receivers operating from decimeter to decameter wavelengths.  This program has important applications for instrument upgrades as well as future generations of instruments such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR).",
