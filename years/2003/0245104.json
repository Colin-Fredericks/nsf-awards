 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continued development of a system to study how the primate retina processes and encodes visual images. This Retinal Readout System will allow the simultaneous detection of signals from hundreds to thousands of retinal output neurons while the retina is stimulated by dynamic visual images focused on the input neurons. The signals from the output neurons will be detected in real-time, from a single living retinal preparation, with all spatial and temporal correlations among the signals recorded. Although the emphasis of the proposed work is on the study of the retina, the instrumentation and software tools under development are extremely versatile, with the potential for wide application in other areas of neuroscience. \r\n\r\nThe Retinal Readout System is based in part on the silicon microstrip detector technological concepts and expertise developed to study short-lived particles in high energy physics experiments. The specific items under development include arrays of 512 microelectrodes for recording the signals generated by retinal neurons, a custom-designed analog VLSI chip (the Neurochip) for amplifying, filtering, and multiplexing these signals, a fast data acquisition system, and analysis software to efficiently process the data sample. \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project in neurophysics has provided, and will continue to provide, research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, in both physics and biology. These opportunities range from independent study courses to senior thesis to Ph. D. thesis work. \r\n",
