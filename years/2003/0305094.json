Cohen\r\n\r\nThe PI intends to study problems with origins in classical\r\nhomotopy theory as well as their overlap with function spaces,\r\ncohomology of groups, and properties of classical configuration \r\nspaces. The specific problems are as follows:\r\n(1) Extend the P.I.'s recent solution of a 25 year old\r\nconjecture of M.G. Barratt on the growth of torsion in\r\nthe homotopy groups of certain finite complexes.\r\n(2) Analyze these structures for other finite complexes\r\nthrough simplicial models for iterated loop spaces as\r\ndeveloped by the P.I., and R. Levi.\r\n(3) In joint work of the P.I., J. Berrick, Y. Wong, and J. Wu,\r\ncontinue to analyze the interplay between braid groups, and\r\nthe homotopy groups of the 2-sphere. These connections extend\r\nin joint work with D. Cohen to analogues of classical modular\r\nforms obtained from the cohomology of the braid groups with\r\ncoefficients in a symplectic representation.\r\n(4) In joint work with A. Adem, and D. Cohen, continue to\r\nanalyze the structure of spaces of representations of\r\nfundamental groups of complements of complex hyperplane\r\narrangements, and their associated vector bundles.\r\n\r\nOne of the main directions here is a connection between\r\nArtin's braid groups, and the classical problem of enumerating\r\nways of continuously wrapping spheres of any dimension around\r\nother geometric objects. The methods can be thought of as\r\nenumerating topological properties of many particles, not\r\nallowed to collide, moving through time. The methods\r\noverlap with several mathematical structures given\r\ncombinatorially as well as number theoretically. These\r\nmethods involve the \"geometry of braids\", and how this\r\nstructure encodes counting problems through connections to\r\nother mathematical objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
