 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the function of a class of genes called the nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptor genes are found in virtually all animal species. They are responsible for controlling the expression of other genes; they switch \"on\" or \"off\" other genes as part of an animal's developmental program. A particular subgroup of nuclear receptors, called the NR2E genes, specializes in functioning in the embryonic development of the nervous system. For example, mutations in NR2E genes of humans and mice result in developmental defects in the specification of certain types of neurons. This project studies the function of the NR2E genes in the nematode worm C. elegans, an excellent genetic system for studying the mechanism of nervous system development. The Wightman lab is determining the function of two NR2E genes, nhr-67 and nhr-111, and comparing these results to their previous work on another NR2E gene, fax-1. The results obtained from this study will describe the role of NR2E genes in nervous system development, as well as test specific hypotheses about the nature of nuclear receptor gene evolution. Undergraduate students are carrying out most of the experimental work, since Muhlenberg College has no graduate students or postdocs. Therefore, this project serves the broader goals of the National Science Foundation by supporting an important educational mission of training future science and healthcare professionals. The project also has a significant impact on the local scholarly environment, by fostering a \"culture of science\" that encourages student inquiry and passion for science.\r\n",
