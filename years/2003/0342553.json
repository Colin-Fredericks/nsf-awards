 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant supports an international workshop planned to provide a forum for materials scientists and engineers from various countries to participate in an in-depth discussion of recent advances and critical issues for the structural use of ordered intermetallic alloys and advanced metallic materials. The objective of the workshop is to provide a forum for experts from various countries to discuss (1) fundamental variables controlling deformation and fracture of ordered intermetallics at ambient and elevated temperatures, (2) the design of ductile intermetallic alloys for structural uses, (3) further improvements in low-temperature toughness and high-temperature strength by a composite approach, and (4) the processing of intermetallic alloys and composites by both conventional and innovative methods.  In addition, experts in emerging areas of advanced metallic materials, such as nanophase and nanostructured materials, are invited to give talks. The Proceedings of the workshop will be published in Intermetallics.\r\n\r\nThis international workshop is co-organized by Prof. Guoliang Chen from the State Key Laboratory for Advanced Metals and Materials, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Prof. Yafang Han from Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials, Dr. C. T. Liu from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Prof. Stephen L. Sass from Cornell University. It will be held in Chendu, P.R.China from October 5 - 8, 2003. Participation in this workshop will be by invitation only. It is expected to have 20 - 25 scientists from outside China and 25 - 30 scientists from China. Sources for funding of the workshop are from the National Advanced Material Committee of China, Chinese NSF, and DOE while the NSF funds are requested to support young scientists who are within 5 years of their doctoral degree.",
