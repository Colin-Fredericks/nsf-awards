 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control of plasmas and liquid metals (in applications including hypersonic aerodynamics, fusion, and lasers) is an emerging research area of great promise. A small amount of control can qualitatively change the intensity of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, and in this way influence the heat transfer characteristics of a system or the external power needed to sustain its operation stably. This project intends to identify the sensing mechanisms that can be effective for feedback control. At present, two candidate approaches exist: (1) arrays of electrodes for measuring the current density at the wall of the flow domain, and (2) arrays of solenoids for measuring the induced magnetic field at the wall. The objective of this theoretical/numerical research project is to determine which of the two sensing approaches is right for controlling plasmas and liquid metals, before the community ventures into the expensive technological effort of developing both types of sensor arrays.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on prototypical magetohydrodynamic and magnetogasdynamic flows (channels, pipes, bluff bodies, cavities, jets, in the presence of magnetic field, pressure, and thermal driving), going from incompressible to compressible flows, and from lower to higher Reynolds numbers. The project will determinine not only whether electrical or magnetic sensing is more promising but also the specifications needed from the sensors: the magnitude of of the fluctuation variables (current, magnetic induction) that need to be sensed,  the power and bandwidth rating, the density of sensors on an array, and the optimal location of sensors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Lay the foundations for the field of control of magnetohydrodynamic flows. Impact Statement. Answering key sensor technology questions in fusion, lasers, and hypersonics. Educating new interdisciplinary experts in plasmas, sensors, and controls.\r\n\r\n",
