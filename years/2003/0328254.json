It was established in 1971 as a coordinating, scheduling and planning mechanism for oceanographic facilities operated by member institutions.  The majority of the facilities are academic research vessels (UNOLS fleet), but also includes submersibles, remote operated vehicles (ROV), aircraft and US Coast Guard Icebreakers.  The UNOLS goal is to assist in the coordination and scheduling of facilities and shared-use equipment and provide efficient use of finite resources.  This Office is the focal point for planning, coordinating and reporting of UNOLS activities.  The UNOLS Office and Organization also promote public awareness and support for these facilities and the discoveries they make possible.\r\n\r\n The UNOLS Office is supported by six funding agencies; Navy, NOAA, USGS, MMS and DOE to provides a forum for facility users, operators and supporting Federal Agencies to co-operate in achieving common goals for major research vessels and facilities, coordinating efficient facilities scheduling and improving the safety and quality of  such facilities.   \r\nBroader Impact:  The proposed activities address the broader community needs related to providing and enhancing major shared use facilities for marine science and education.  The Office promotes collaboration and cooperation while addressing the research and education from more than sixty institutions. The various UNOLS committees and the UNOLS office engage in public outreach through websites, professional journal articles, speaking engagements and educational outreach by oceanographic researchers using UNOLS research vessels.\r\n\r\n",
