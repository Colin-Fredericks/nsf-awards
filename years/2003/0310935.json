 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geography (88) In this project, modules using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are being integrated into introductory courses across the Arts and Sciences curriculum. The AEGIS project is teaching 14 participating faculty how to use GIS and assisting them in the development of discipline-specific GIS modules for introductory level courses. The goals of the project are to increase awareness of GIS, generate growing undergraduate interest in GIS, and provide ongoing support for multidisciplinary GIS activities at Samford University.  The outcomes are increased numbers of majors in Biology and Geography developing GIS skills and a growth in the number of students pursuing the GIS Certificate program.  This project is adapting elements from similar programs at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, the University of Georgia, and the Florida State University.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the improved preparation of undergraduates in multiple disciplines in geo-spatial methods, which are being applied increasingly across a growing spectrum of professional and academic fields.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are far-reaching. The integration of introductory GIS into a diverse array of Arts and Sciences courses is leading to further development of GIS modules for advanced courses. It is also enhancing student research skills by providing students with multiple opportunities to engage in data acquisition and analysis. The impact on undergraduate research skills is strengthened by virtue of the fact that our university has already made a commitment to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in many departments.  \r\n\r\nParticipating faculty enrolled in a GIS short course at the start of their participation in the project.  Following this they began working with experts to create GIS modules and introduce them into freshman and sophomore level courses. These faculty also plan to participate in a tune-up workshop during Samford's short January session in order to adjust and enhance their GIS modules.  Following two years of faculty education in GIS methods and subsequent efforts to develop and implement GIS course modules, the third year is focused on a comprehensive project evaluation, using data from both student and faculty experiences.   \r\n",
