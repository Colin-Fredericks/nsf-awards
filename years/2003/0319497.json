 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase-I project is aimed at increasing the data rate for modems that uses ultrasonic acoustic energy through metal structures as the means of communication. Wireless networking based on Radio Frequencies (RF) is not very effective within enclosed metal structures such as the hulls of ships. This technique can be used to overcome such limitations and can establish a local wireless network for data transfer among sensors located in various parts of the vessels. The through the hull communications technology is at a nascent but proven state. A better understanding of the medium and the associated issues is needed before extending such technology to a broader context such as ballast water monitoring. The goal of this research is to establish the target data rate, determine the best modulation scheme to achieve it and then verify it on a real shipboard environment\r\nThis technology will be best used in the area of compliance and verification of ballast water exchange or treatments in a cost effective way. Laws dictating such treatments are already in effect in some parts of the US and other foreign countries to prevent invasion by the various micro-organisms into the native coastal eco-systems. An automated system of compliance that will collect information from various ballast tanks on a ship and create a report will reduce the burden on ship operators and law enforcement agencies. Developing an effective technology for monitoring the ballast water has a broader impact on the society. It has the potential to save economies depending on coastal resources and ensure the preservation of the local eco-systems for the future generations.\r\n\r\n",
