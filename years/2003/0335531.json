 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce Scholars at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell (UML) are teacher candidates in Project EXCEL (EXchanging Careers - Enhancing Learning), a graduate program that addresses the need to attract well-qualified science, mathematics, and engineering career-change individuals into the teaching profession. Thirty science, mathematics, and engineering career-changers (ten each year) are being recruited into the program. They receive full scholarships to complete a Master of Education degree and Initial Licensure in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  While completing their graduate degree and licensure, Project EXCEL scholarship recipients work full-time for two years in partner, urban school districts under the guidance of a Triad of advisors that includes a College of Arts and Sciences faculty member, a College of Education faculty member, and a school-based mentor. The three cohorts of scholarship recipients meet periodically to offer support and guidance to one another. \r\n \r\nProject EXCEL is carrying out research into the content and pedagogical needs of new science and mathematics teachers.  They are examining the impact of the work of these new teachers on the science and mathematics knowledge, disposition and skills of the middle and high school students they serve.  They are also conducting a longitudinal study of the work of the scholarship recipients. \r\n",
