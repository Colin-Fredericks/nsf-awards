This body is the locus of chemistry and chemical engineering expertise within the National Research Council, an institution that provides independent, technical advice to federal agencies.  BCST has broad representation from industry, academe and non-profit organizations.  It will identify topical studies and bring these to the attention of decision-makers. It will work with them to obtain funding and technical advice to address these issues.  It responds via peer reviewed consensus reports, workshops, symposia and broad outreach to the chemical and larger community.  This proposal describes a number of activities to be pursued: 1) Thrice yearly meetings to plan and oversee studies.  2) Outreach to government agencies and other organizations.  3) Oversee studies carried out under its authority.  4) Disseminate results of studies.\r\n\r\n",
