 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will develop and analyze fast and accurate spectral methods\r\nfor solving a large class of partial differential equations and apply\r\nthem to investigate several important problems of current interest,\r\nincluding in particular the inter-facial dynamics of multiphase complex\r\nflows, stability and dynamics of stratified shear flows and\r\nmicro-structural evolutions in advanced materials processing.  The\r\nproposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical\r\nalgorithms which will allow simulations of three-dimensional\r\ntime-dependent problems within a reasonable turn-over time, and\r\nprovide capabilities to numerically attack challenging problems\r\narising from emerging engineering and scientific applications.\r\n\r\nAs computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many\r\nbranches of science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of\r\nthe expensive prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in\r\nscience explorations, fast and robust numerical methods are becoming\r\nan indispensable tool for many scientists and engineers, especially\r\nfor computational scientists in fluid dynamics and materials science.\r\nIt is expected that our numerical simulations will contribute towards\r\nbetter understandings of the complex physical and mathematical\r\nproblems, and provide valuable information for the designs of advanced\r\nmaterials and of a space experiment on stratified shear flows.\r\n",
