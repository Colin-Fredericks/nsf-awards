 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR-0311671\r\n\r\nBalancing Privacy and Analysis in Data Sanitization\r\n\r\nMatt Bishop\r\n\r\nWhen handling an intrusion, one organization may need to share\r\nlogs and network traces with other organizations. However, the\r\ndata to be shared may contain sensitive information that the\r\nfirst organization does not wish to disclose to the other parties.\r\nThe solution is to sanitize the data by removing information from\r\nthe data. This protects the privacy of the organization. However,\r\nthe data removed may be essential for the analysis of the data that\r\nthe other organizations must perform. This research explores the\r\ntension between privacy and security analysis. The goals of this\r\nresearch are to: (1) develop a sanitizing language to describe\r\nthe requirements for privacy and security analysis in such a way\r\nthat the requirements can be automatically checked for inconsistencies;\r\n(2) determine the conditions under which \"perfect sanitization\"\r\ncan occur, if any; and (3) examine the problem of sanitizing\r\na dynamic data set that changes as the sanitization proceeds.\r\nThis will involve developing and testing the sanitization\r\nlanguage on both data extracted from a network, and on files\r\ncontaining student grades. The former will provide examples of both\r\nstatic and dynamic data. Perfect sanitization will be studied by\r\ntranslating the sanitization process into functions and analyzing\r\ntheir ranges and domains.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this work is in the balance of privacy and security.\r\nPrevious work focuses on sanitizing data in an ad hoc manner, rather\r\nthan analyzing the balance between privacy and security and allowing\r\nthe sanitizers to choose among particular requirements when the needs\r\nof privacy and security analysis conflict. Its impact is that if\r\nsuccessful, the results can be used in a wide variety of fields in\r\nwhich privacy and analysis (not just security analysis) must\r\nbe balanced.\r\n",
