 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently Meshless Methods, and the closely related Generalized\r\nFinite Element Methods, for the numerical solution of partial\r\ndifferential equations came into the forefront of interest,\r\nespecially in the engineering community. For example, in the last\r\ntwo years several engineering books on the subject\r\nappeared, an international conference was organized, and many\r\nengineering papers were published. These methods generalize the\r\nclassical Finite Element Method in that they are neither based on a \r\nmesh nor on classical polynomial approximation. The theoretical underpinning\r\nand general state of the art for these methods is similar to that\r\nof the Finite Element Method in the 1960s, when already\r\nengineering computations based on heuristic principles were done,\r\nbut the theory had not been developed. This research  will address\r\nthe theoretical and implementational basis of these methods in\r\nconjunction with applications. The most important feature of Meshless \r\nMethods is their flexibility and potential. It is a challenge to \r\nemploy this flexibility to achieve their potential: the solution of\r\ntoday's complex problems, with the consideration of the rapidly\r\ndecreasing ratio of cost of computer arithmetical operations to\r\nthe human effort. These issues will be investigated in this research \r\nproject.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposal lies in the mathematical and\r\ncomputational science aspects of Meshless Methods. The broader\r\nmathematical impact includes the understanding of these methods\r\nand their potential, which will be directly reflected in the\r\nperformance of the methods on complex problems of solid and\r\nfluid mechanics, for example, multiscale problems. It is likely\r\nthat the development of the mathematical foundation of Meshless\r\nMethods will have similar or larger impact than the mathematical\r\ndevelopment of the 1970s and 1980s had on the Finite Element Method.\r\nThe broader impact of this  proposal is in its simultaneous\r\nconsideration of mathematical theory, modeling of engineering and\r\nscientific problems, computational issues, and engineering\r\ncomputational experience.\r\n",
