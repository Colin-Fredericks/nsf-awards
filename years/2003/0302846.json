 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vermont Information Technology Project-Foundations for the Future, (VTF3), is a comprehensive information technology education and training improvement project. It is increasing the pool and expertise of Vermont's IT technicians by changing information technology education and training network into a new model to meet future economic growth and development needs. Guided by a structured partnership of employers, secondary and postsecondary educators, and government agencies, the VTF3 project is developing a more flexible, responsive IT curriculum lattice model of self-contained education, training and work experience modules, recognized by both academic credit and industry skill standards certifications, that allows student flexibility to move across area specialties as well as to increase expertise in a given specialty.\r\n   VTF3 engages faculty and teachers in a faculty development effort to research and develop a new pedagogy to increase the motivation and retention of potential students. By focused attention to the recruitment and retention of women, minorities and students with disabilities, the VTF3 Project is broadening the base of the potential IT workforce.\r\n",
