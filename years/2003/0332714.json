The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Bradley University (Lead Institution), \r\n\r\nThis project stresses leveraging the intellectual capital of the region to create and nurture interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research and development leading to commercialization, education and training for the underemployed and under-trained workforce in the region, and development of models to manage intellectual property.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\n\r\nHistorically the economy of the region has been based on agriculture and manufacturing of heavy equipment, which are waning. The growth of the economy has lagged the rest of the state of Illinois and the nation. The region possesses potential to exploit the research at the regional academic institutions and to create a well-educated, technologically-literate workforce. These activities will transform the economy, create new jobs and provide people to fill the job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in development of a multi-county R&D partnership for a knowledge-based economy to provide greater innovation and commercialization development projects in central Illinois. This effort strengthens the focus on knowledge-based employment and moves away from the region's traditional employment sectors of agriculture and mechanical based economies. The activity includes development of complex models for intellectual property management.\r\n \r\nThe effort will lead to a knowledge-based economy in support of innovation, science and engineering-based commercialization and development of small businesses. Inclusion of a large urban school district and regional government agencies will involve groups traditionally underrepresented in science and technology.\r\n",
