 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential role of well-defined polymeric materials in a range or advanced technologies is becoming increasing apparent.  From microelectronics, sensors, drug delivery systems, catalysts, agents for chemical warfare detection and destruction, smart surfaces, to biodegradable tissue replacements, polymeric materials are the critical component or enabling technology for the successful implementation of these applications.   This conference will focus upon recent developments in the design and applications.  This conference will focus upon recent developments in the design and synthesis of polymeric materials, biodegradability, supramolecular chemistry and polymer physics.  Such an exchange of knowledge in these critical areas by world experts will provide a springboard for future developments as well as encouraging young scientists to join this growing field.\r\n\r\nTo encourage younger scientists to contribute to this blossoming field and its future directions specials emphasis will also be placed on their involvement.  We are requesting funds to supplement the travel costs for 10 postdoctoral fellows / students at $300 per person to attend the 2003 Gordon Research Conference (Polymers East) to be held at Mount Holyoke College, June 15-20, 2003.  This amounts to a total request for $3000.00 in financial support.\r\n",
