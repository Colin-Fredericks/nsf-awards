 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the design and construction of the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR).  Originally conceived to be a large steerable, dish-type radar, the project now features a powerful, modular, solid-state, electronically steerable phased-array design capable of observing many properties of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  The modular design will enable the radar to observe properties of Earth's atmosphere from the equator to the pole.  Pulse-to-pulse beam swinging will be used for observing rapidly evolving ionospheric structure.  The AMISR design includes unique features that allow cost-effective dismantling, shipping, and re-assembly in about six months.  The antenna consists of three faces that can be deployed independently.  As an initial deployment strategy, the first face will be constructed at the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska, while the second two faces will be assembled at Resolute Bay in the Canadian Arctic.  AMISR will provide the means for practically unlimited new scientific observations via two significant features that have not been technically feasible in the past, and that will greatly enhance the way observations and campaigns are conducted.  First, an incoherent scatter radar with a solid-state transmitter and no moving parts will increase immunity to single point radar failures and allow extended operating periods with remote internet access and minimal on-site personnel.  Second, the phased-array concept will allow pulse-to-pulse beam steering, thus enabling three-dimensional imaging of electron density features in high signal-to-noise environments such as discrete auroral structures.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Scientific studies enabled by the radar include those related to space weather, global change, atmospheric physics, and plasma science.  The data will be widely disseminated to researchers world-wide, and will be an excellent teaching tool for the next generation of atmospheric and radio scientists\r\n",
