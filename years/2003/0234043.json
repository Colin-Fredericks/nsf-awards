 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA grant has been awarded to Dr. Kathleen Kron at Wake Forest University to study the evolutionary relationships of azaleas and rhododendrons. Azaleas and rhododendrons belong to the genus Rhododendron which contains more than 900 spp. These plants are among the showiest shrubs in the world, are of enormous importance horticulturally and form the dominant vegetation in many habitats throughout the temperate zone and in the Asian tropics.  Despite their high visibility, azaleas and rhododendrons have been difficult to study because of their tremendous morphological diversity and variability.   This study investigates the geneological relationships of major groups within Rhododendron using DNA sequence data from six genes and morphological characteristics to establish the evolutionary history of major lineages of azaleas and rhododendrons.  Morphological data will be recorded using digital image capture and storage on a public accessible website.\r\nThe broader impacts of this study include the development of a framework for future studies in a group of plants that are ecologically, economically, and evolutionarily important.  Because these plants have a nearly worldwide distribution, this study will also significantly contribute to a better understanding of the history of the earth.  At least one female graduate student will be trained as a result of this project.  The information gained will be disseminated in electronic and print form, in both scholarly and lay texts.  The newly obtained results will be incorporated into Dr. Kron's teaching and curriculum development at the undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\n",
