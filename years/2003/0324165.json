 "awd_abstract_narration": "Union College has established a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship program for students with demonstrated need in these disciplines over a four-year period. A total of 29 students over two years are selected be selected from a freshman pool meeting the financial criteria, with further selection based on interest in the major and academic promise. Financially disadvantaged, but academically talented students, from under-represented groups and women (CS and Engineering) are given special consideration. The underlying goal enhances students training in these fields so that more students graduate with a background in one of these disciplines. \r\n\r\n In achieving these goals, a combination of efforts that extend and build upon existing programs and services (Academic Opportunity Program, Career Development Center, Writing Center); as well as incorporate initiatives to enhance student support through our NSF-STEP grant (enhanced communication and study skills development, career exploration, internship opportunities, alumni mentoring, earlier summer research experiences) providing a strong foundation of education and support.\r\nIn addition, the CSEMS students are among the first students to use electronic portfolios, and have specific opportunities to participate in off-site visits to regional technology companies, interact with alumni and professionals, and attend topical seminars. By using scholarship funds to relieve the burden of work-study as part of their financial aid package, students are also offered the opportunity to become part of an \"ambassador\" team, visiting local middle schools, where they talk with students and give short presentations and/or demonstrations about their college experiences, or help mentor students as part of an organized program.\r\n",
