 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research uses newly available \"indoor GPS\" (iGPS) technology to\r\ngenerate an accurate robotic reference model from a parametric\r\ndescription (dimensions, compliance, etc.) of its \"as-built\" components\r\n(actuators, links, etc.).  The new metrology system uses infrared\r\ntransmitters and has sufficient accuracy to parametrically describe even\r\nhigh precision systems. Completing the initial model requires the\r\nconstruction of a 2 meter cube high-precision sensor network.  Once the\r\nparameters are known, they can be used to populate a developed model\r\nallowing manipulator accuracy resolution previously attainable only at\r\nlaboriously taught locations.  This development then allows for the\r\nconstruction of open architecture manufacturing cells (1, 3, and 10\r\nmeter cubes).  The iGPS and reference model will be used to \"calibrate\r\nas assembled\" (i.e. on demand) and maintain the cell preventing accuracy\r\ndrift due to repair, upgrade, aging, temperature, etc. \r\n\r\nThe benefits of modular robots are clear.  Such systems allow flexible\r\nmanufacturing, rapid repair, and upgrade, but these benefits have yet to\r\nbe realized.  A significant barrier is the presence of error between the\r\ntool (actual) frame and goal (ideal) frame. While the repeatability\r\n(returning to a taught point) of a typical robot can be 0.005\", its\r\naccuracy (commanded to a new point) may not be better than 0.1\" due to\r\nconfiguration, load, model error, etc.  Currently, teaching a robotic\r\ndevice is a time-consuming process required after repair, upgrade, and\r\nprocess change.  But the accuracy is not sufficient to perform the\r\nrequired high-precision operations without teaching. This fact trumps\r\nother modular technology benefits.  But the use of iGPS technology in\r\ntandem with actuator metrology could lead to accuracy levels close to\r\nrepeatability and remove this technological barrier.\r\n",
