 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Stone Child College (SCC) has done significant planning to enhance the computer science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) infrastructure of the college. One of the major needs identified was student support. The Computer and Science Professionals in Native Society (CSPINS) project offers scholarships and other services to CSEM majors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: SCC is introducing numerous elements that makes this a model project, including: student support structures, student tracking, evaluation, dissemination, cohorts, research and internship opportunities, strong faculty support, and commitment to infrastructure improvements. Results of the project are being broadly disseminated and serve as a model project for all Tribal Colleges and Universities. In addition, research opportunities are available in subjects which address the needs of the reservation. As SCC develops as an institution and moves into a new campus, they can offer a stronger curriculum in the CSEM fields.\r\n",
