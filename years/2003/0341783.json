The Small Grants Program - 2 (SGP-II) is the foundation of a second phase of IAI programmatic development, leading to the establishment of new long term research networks that will succeed the current Collaborative Research Network, supported in part by a separate NSF grant. High priority is given in selection to high-quality science addressing the Institute's current Scientific Agenda and the participation of new scientists and institutions from IAI member countries.\r\n\r\nRequiring the involvement of scientists representing institutions from at least three IAI member countries, the SGP-II program facilitates and enhances regional and international cooperation. It strongly encourages the participation of early career scientists, promotes linkages and interactions with other regional or international projects or programs like Diversitas, IGBP, IHDP, WCRP and START, as well as increasing the involvement of policy- and decision-makers in the design of scientifically rigorous proposals. The SGP-II program provides support for research and capacity building efforts including mainly graduate/post doctoral support, travel and meeting costs, communications, publications and disseminations costs, computers and software, and only very modest support for salaries of investigators.\r\n\r\nSGP-II encourages research beyond the scope of national programs by advancing comparative and focused studies based on scientific issues important to the American region as a whole. In this way each member country that participates benefits from the enhancement of regional relationships, the establishment of new institutional arrangements, open exchange of scientific data, and information generated by the Institute's research programs. All SGP-II results will be available on the IAI website and through the IAI Data and Information System.\r\n \r\nSGP II is encouraging research beyond the scope of national programs by advancing comparative and focused studies based on scientific issues important to the American region as a whole.
