 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposed workshop is to develop potential approaches for the introduction\r\nof nanoscale engineering into the undergraduate and graduate engineering education process.\r\nRecognizing that nanoscale engineering is a very interdisciplinary activity, the correct approach\r\nto accomplish the education of future nanoelectronic engineers is not clear. The primary goal of\r\nthis effort is to hold a workshop with a collection of individuals well versed in the various\r\ntechnologies that are necessary to accomplish advances in nanotechnology as well as individuals\r\nthat have been instrumental in developing roadmaps for new curricula. The attendees will be\r\nprimarily invited from the membership of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department\r\nHeads Association (ECEDHA). The co-located workshop will be held during the first two days\r\nof the highly successful IEC DesignCon conference, taking place January 27-30, 2003.\r\nDesignCon attracts more than 6,000 design engineers and managers and is also a draw for the\r\nacademic community. The proposed program plan is to hold a one-day tutorial on the general\r\ntopic of nanoscience and engineering that both the educators and the industrial participants of\r\nIEC DesignCon can attend. The second day will be focused on the development of an\r\neducational plan. The outcome of the workshop will be a report that outlines the possible\r\napproaches that should be attempted to support the development of the undergraduate and\r\ngraduate nanoengineer. The workshop will be organized by ECEDHA, with board members\r\nserving as the organizers and workshop hosts.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: This workshop will bring together for the first time\r\neducators in the general areas of Electrical and Computer Engineering with researchers in the\r\nareas of Nanoscience and Engineering to address the critical issues of education and workforce\r\ndevelopment relative to the emerging field of nanotechnology. This workshop will provide a\r\nunique intellectual forum to identify problems and bottlenecks in educating engineering students\r\nin this multidisciplinary arena.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: The proposed activity represents only the\r\nfirst step in a broader program seeking to impact the engineering educational system in terms of\r\nnew and emerging areas of science and technology. Since nanoscience and engineering are\r\nbroadly interdisciplinary, the ideas relative to curriculum and education emerging from this\r\nworkshop are expected have much broader impact in approaches to multidisciplinary education\r\nin other fields, such as information technology.",
