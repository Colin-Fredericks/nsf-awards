Bell\r\n\r\nProf. Bell has shown that the most widely used kernel\r\nfunctions and metrics of complex analysis associated to\r\ncertain finite Riemann surface are elementary combinations\r\nof only three, and sometimes even two, analytic functions of\r\none complex variable related to special conformal mappings\r\nof the domain.  Bell will study deeper questions about\r\ncomplexity in complex analysis and potential theory posed by\r\nhis recent findings and he will extend his results in the\r\nplane to quadrature domains and general finite Riemann\r\nsurfaces.  Bell has formulated a unique continuation\r\nprinciple for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations\r\nthat he has shown yields information about the behavior of\r\nholomorphic mappings between domains in complex space.  He\r\nwill apply this principle to some of the questions mentioned\r\nabove and he will also use the property to try to gain a\r\nmore geometric understanding of the Bergman projection in\r\nseveral complex variables.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal\r\nmapping are ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and\r\nEngineering.  They carry encoded within them a vast amount\r\nof information about geometric properties of regions in the\r\nplane.  Although these objects are familiar and well\r\nstudied, they continue to be a source of interesting and\r\napplicable new mathematics.  Professor Bell will express the\r\nclassical objects of potential theory associated to a two\r\ndimensional surface with holes in terms of much simpler\r\nanalytic objects.  These results will give rise to new and\r\npractical methods for understanding and zipping the solutions\r\nto many problems in differential equations, conformal mapping,\r\nand potential theory that should be of interest, not only to\r\nmathematicians, but to scientists and engineers as well.\r\nBecause humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by\r\ntaking a series of two dimensional slices, the tools\r\ndeveloped could find many applications.\r\n\r\n",
