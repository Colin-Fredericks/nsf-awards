The development of a unitary body of\r\nknowledge about biodiversity is made difficult by the fragmentation and lack of\r\ninteroperability between the diverse - and often informal and simplistic - semantics\r\nadopted for data and models. Different representational paradigms require conceptual, as\r\nwell as technical, integration to enable reorganizing the body of knowledge and enable\r\nnew ideas, theories, and higher-level paradigms to surface and be tested.\r\nBuilding on software and conceptual frameworks being developed at IEE/UMD, we\r\npropose to develop and deploy a web-accessible database where temporally- and\r\nspatially- explicit biodiversity data will coexist with dynamic modular models,\r\npotentially integrating multiple modeling paradigms and automatically enforcing their\r\ncompatibility. The XML-based infrastructure used by the underlying software engine will\r\nenable us to store data and models (modules) adopting an extensible array of\r\nrepresentations, and to link them together transparently and automatically. The\r\nintegration will happen through explicit cross-cutting abstractions called domains, which\r\nrepresent various aspects of the world (such as time or space) as seen by each module,\r\nand are processed by the simulation engine to resolve conflicts related to different scales\r\nor representational paradigms.\r\n",
