 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe project will facilitate the development and effective use educational materials that make use of Earth system science datasets and tools that for the most part have been developed for and by scientists.  This project will organize workshops that bring together a wide range of Earth science data providers, developers of data access and analysis/exploration tools, and developers of educational resources to guide the development of data access and analysis tools to ensure they are effective and usable by the educational community, and to begin to develop educational modules using available Earth science datasets and data access and analysis tools.  The outcomes of these workshops will be in the form of two reports, developed from online report systems used during the workshop.  One of these reports will be aimed at the data providers and tools developers to guide further data access and analysis tools development.  The other report will be aimed at the education community, and will include information about available datasets and tools presented at the workshop and the ideas discussed for using those datasets and tools in educational modules.  DLESE Data Services will also conduct synergistic activities aimed at identifying 1) dataset and data access and analysis tool needs of the educational community at all levels and 2) existing educational modules utilizing Earth science datasets and data analysis tools that are used by the educational community.  These existing modules and those developed as a result of support activities will be brought into the DLESE collection.  In order to extend the impact of our efforts, DLESE Data Services will interact with the other DLESE core services.  Educational modules identified by this project will be brought to the DLESE Collections Services to be cataloged into DLESE.  DLESE Data Services will interact with DLESE Community Services by providing material for their \"exemplars\" in using Earth science data in an educational context, and using DLESE Community Services to support the continued interaction of the community.  DLESE Data Services will work with DLESE Evaluation Services in the development of the comprehensive needs assessment for the use of data in educational modules and the survey for the identification of existing educational modules that use Earth science data.  DLESE Data Services will also work with the DLESE Program Center to bring the functionality that would bring access to real-time and archived Earth science datasets and the ability to explore that data in meaningful ways to DLESE.\r\n",
