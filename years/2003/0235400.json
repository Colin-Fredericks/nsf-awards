 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most night-flying moth locate mates through female production of, and male response to very precise blends of three or more species specific airborne chemicals. Within a species, females that produce atypical blends are not as attractive as other females. Similarly, rare males that have genes for response to an altered blend are expected to be less reproductively fit than normal males. Based on our current understanding of the genetics and mechanics of sexual communication in moths, evolution is expected to select against the proliferation of new sexual communication systems. However, there are currently thousands of moth species, each with a unique system of communication. Our goal is to hybridize two closely related moth species that differ in their pheromones and male responses. We will map sexual communication genes and develop strains with single genetic differences in pheromone production or response to determine if and to what extent their fitness is decreased in a number of environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are many complex traits for which diversification is expected to be hindered in early evolutionary stages. We expect the information from our work on moths to provide general insight into how traits that are expected to be conserved, can diversify.\r\n",
