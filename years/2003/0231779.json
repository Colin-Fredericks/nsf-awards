The PI we use a multi-level random effects model to evaluate differences in state mathematics instructional policy, including content standards, curriculum frameworks, and teacher professional learning, with particular emphasis on the implications for low income children. Examine how differences in state mathematics instructional policy are associated with school learning environment, especially in high poverty schools. The PI will also examine how school learning environment is associated with classroom instructional practices. And finally, the PI will identify the relationships between family income, parental investment, school learning environment, and classroom instructional practices on growth in mathematical proficiencies through the third grade.\r\n",
