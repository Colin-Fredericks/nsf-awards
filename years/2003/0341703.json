 "awd_abstract_narration": "----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nScalable Dependability in Componentized Software via Self-Stabilization\r\nPI: Anish Arora, Professor, CIS, The Ohio State University\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the problem of unanticipated software faults, \r\nwhich inevitably occur in large-scale software systems, including \r\nthose used by the United States space program for missions such as \r\nthe International Space Station, by developing tools and frameworks\r\nfor self-stabilization, i.e., for restoring system behavior if it \r\ndeviates from its intended one by detecting and correcting state predicates.\r\n\r\nExtant techniques for designing/composing stabilizing systems do not\r\nscale well. The proposed research addresses complexity as follows.\r\n\r\n- A component is typically simpler than the system as a whole. Hence\r\nstabilization will be added per component and then they will be composed \r\ninto a stabilizing system, taking into account issues of dependency and \r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n- A component's specification is usually simpler than the component itself.\r\nhence stabilization will be added per component with respect to only the \r\ncomponent specification, \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will demonstrate that the software tools and frameworks \r\nresulting from these ideas measurably and predictably improve dependability \r\nin a NASA system. The techniques and tools will provide for the first time \r\nthe ability to make large systems tolerant to unanticipated faults. Besides \r\nspace craft, they can also be used with critical systems such as aircraft control,\r\nmedical instruments, the telephone network, etc.",
