 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fully digitized multimedia enriched world will be a reality when security and quality of the multimedia content can be guaranteed. Information hiding (watermarking, digital fingerprinting, etc.) has been gaining popularity in this quest for security. Investigation of information hiding based security techniques that suit multimedia data and networks is the goal of this project. Primarily, this project considers problems in providing multimedia security from the following different perspectives: (a) Encoder/Content originator perspective, (b) Decoder/Content recipient perspective, (c) Attacker's perspective, and (d) Networking perspective. Studying the multimedia data security problem from these perspectives could lead to a better understanding of security issues from an end-to-end system view point. Connections between perceptually based and information theory based information hiding, and content based watermarking will be investigated with robustness and embedding capacity being the main focus. Detector dependent embedding and game theoretic formulation to study the dynamics between the decoder and a malicious attacker are proposed. A new attack dependent definition of security and methods to compute the information hiding capacity based on this definition are also proposed in this project. Finally, joint source-channel coding and multiple description coding approaches for robust watermark systems that can handle network losses are also of interest.\r\n\r\n",
