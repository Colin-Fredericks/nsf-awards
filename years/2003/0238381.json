 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project exploits the CORBA middleware standard as a vehicle for\r\nexploring the composition of real-time and fault tolerance for\r\ndistributed middleware applications.  Although the initial approach\r\nwill apply to CORBA, the results will be applicable to other\r\nmiddleware, such as Java.  The primary scientific contributions of\r\nthis project are the description of the precise trade-offs that occur\r\nwhen both real-time and fault tolerance support are required for a\r\nmiddleware application, along with an architecture and strategies that\r\ncan be used to resolve these trade-offs. The primary technical\r\ncontributions of the project are a new set of practices and algorithms\r\nfor building real-time fault-tolerant systems, and tools for\r\nsanitizing non-determinism in middleware applications, with the aim of\r\nmeeting both real-time predictability and fault-tolerant consistency\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThis project furthers our technical understanding of the precise\r\ntrade-offs and complex interactions between ``-ilities'' such as\r\nreal-time and fault tolerance, thereby helping to reduce the number of\r\nproprietary brittle systems that continue to be built.  The project\r\nhas the potential to influence the state of the art and the\r\nstate of the practice, enabling future COTS-based mission-critical\r\napplications to be developed with simultaneous real-time and\r\nfault-tolerant support.  Recognizing that applications vary in their\r\ndependability needs, this project is unique in that it provides\r\nmechanisms to mix-and-match the different fault tolerance mechanisms\r\nin a manner that allows for the customization of the system's\r\nperceived dependability.\r\n\r\nThrough participation in organizations such as the Object Management\r\nGroup, the results of this project will be made available to harden\r\nongoing and future standards on fault tolerance and real-time for\r\nmiddleware. Elements of this project will be incorporated into\r\ncurricula in order to expose students to the cross-cutting concerns of\r\nboth reliability and real-time.  Students who are exposed to not just\r\none ``-ility'', but to the conflicts and trade-offs between multiple\r\n``-ilities'', will make better and more discriminating software/system\r\narchitects who can be entrusted to build the mission-critical systems\r\nof the future.",
