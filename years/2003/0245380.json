 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to study convex bodies using the methods of probability.\r\nFor many problems of convex geometry, such as finding sections of a convex\r\nbody with certain nice properties or approximating a convex body by another\r\nbody having a better structure, explicit constructions are unknown.\r\nIn these cases random constructions turn out to be very effective.\r\nIt is often possible to define a random section or approximation and\r\nto show that it has the desired property with high probability.\r\nThis approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools, such as  measure\r\nconcentration, have led to major discoveries in convex geometry and functional\r\nanalysis.\r\nThe PI also plans to study the combinatorial dimension\r\nof a set of functions. This is a new notion\r\nwhich arises from questions in probability and computer science.\r\nThe PI plans to investigate the connection between the entropy and the\r\ncombinatorial dimension and apply the results to study properties of\r\nconvex bodies.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide new connections between\r\nfunctional  analysis, convex geometry and probability.\r\nThe study of combinatorial dimension is likely to have concrete\r\npractical applications in machine learning.\r\n The non-symmetric convex sets, which are one of the main objects\r\nof the proposed research, arise naturally in a broad class\r\nof optimization problems. So, better understanding of the structure\r\nof such bodies will result in constructing more effective optimization\r\nalgorithms.",
