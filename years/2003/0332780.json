 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xavier University of Louisiana proposes to: (1) Scientifically investigate by gender, ethnicity, and culture the under-representation of women in Computer Science (CS), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Computer Engineering (CE) -- collectively referred to as the computing sciences, (2) Increase the knowledge-base of gender, ethnic, and cultural models, creating newer models that lead to a more equitable and inviting CS, CIS, or CE education, and (3) Increase national capacity in the field of gender diversity and education in the computing sciences by encouraging new researchers and research-oriented education practitioners. \r\n\r\nThe research proposed in this project is an investigation with a mixed design.  It is primarily a three-year longitudinal study.  The primary theoretical and empirical approach will be the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) model. There has been limited exploration of SCCT's utility in explaining choice actions or goal implementation relative to STEM majors.\r\n\r\nSubjects are 210 first year, male and female undergraduates in computing sciences (over three successive years) at each of 50 institutions of higher education from across the nation:  25 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 25 non-HBCUs.  As a control/baseline for the study each year at each institution, Xavier will also survey 30 first-year undergraduates who are from a non-computing sciences group.\r\n\r\nBy participating in this research effort, several of the faculty members from the 50 institutions of higher education should become more interested in gender diversity and education.  Microsoft Research and Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. (Louisiana's largest information technology company) will be corporate partners.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Based upon a large, nationwide sample, the team expects to be able to scientifically support from survey evidence some of the anecdotal or small sample findings previously put forth by other researchers.  They expect to greatly improve the granularity of the current knowledge regarding gender, ethnicity, and culture in the computing sciences and to better support understanding of the computing sciences across the fields of psychology, sociology, and education.  The comprehensive study features a multidisciplinary, culturally diverse, collaborative team capable of conducting the research. \r\n\r\n Broader Impact: The results of the study could have a profound impact on teaching and learning in the computing sciences. It will inform new approaches to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, creating new networks and partnerships crossing disciplinary and geographical lines. Finally, it will give a scientifically sound basis from which others in society might work to increase the numbers of women obtaining bachelor's degrees in CS, CIS, or CE. \r\n",
