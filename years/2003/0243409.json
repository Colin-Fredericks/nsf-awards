 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) pilot study are: 1) to identify the failure modes and the failure mechanisms of newly designed and fabricated high k dielectric nano devices, and 2) to analyze and characterize the early failure pattern that can be used in a Bayesian analysis.  The goal of the study is to use failure mode identification to set the foundation for reliability analysis and validation in newly designed nano products (being fabricated by the Co-PI). Failure mechanisms and other physical properties have a significant bearing on high infant mortality and low yield. Because the sample quantity available for reliability testing is small and the products are expensive, it is inevitable that Bayesian analysis will have to be used. This study intends to determine exactly what information to extract for such an analysis. The end result of the work will lead to a full-scale project for developing a theoretical model to bridge the reliability and yield relationship for nano products.\r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary project will rigorously explore reliability applications in a newly invented nano product. The project will bring to the academic community a theoretical foundation for modeling nano reliability. This project will have major impact on society because it is the first exploratory study to address the reliability issue at the design stage in newly fabricated nano devices.",
