 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technology Opportunity Project (TOP) provides an innovative pathway for economically disadvantaged, academically talented students to successfully complete an associate degree in engineering technology or computer science. The program is\r\nintegrated into the network built upon the Tech Prep School-to-Career program at the college, a well established partnership of 20 high schools and the college. The promotion of the program is accomplished by a project team of college faculty, counselors and administrators assisted by a network of high school teachers and counselors, local industry and community groups. Throughout their college program of study, TOP Scholars are mentored by a faculty member to ensure they make full use of available support services, including a range of workshops , short courses, and peer tutoring offered by the Tutoring and Academic Success Center. The cohort of TOP scholarship students forms a clearly identifiable learning community, with program specific enrichment opportunities such as group meetings and industry tours and speakers. Upon graduation, students are assisted by the Career Placement Office and full time Transfer Counselor to secure placement in the workforce or in a four -year engineering, physics or computer science program.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are\r\n1.  to increase the number of academically- talented and low-income students who complete associate degree programs in computer science and technology; \r\n2.  to increase the number of women and minority students in these programs;\r\n3.  to create a partnership of educators and industry to enhance the experience and participation of scholarship students; and \r\n4.  to establish a system to document the impact of the TOP Scholars program on participants in order to affect continuous program improvements.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this program is that a pathway is being created to enable economically disadvantaged, mostly first generation college students to successfully earn\r\na college degree and transition to employment in computer science or technology or to a four year institution. The broader impact is that a community of scholars is being formed, mentored by faculty and community members, which enhances the vitality of the Technology Department. Support services created for TOP scholars serve as a model for student retention in all college programs.\r\n",
