 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate the predictive capability industry needs to dramatically improve machined workpiece quality by controlling machining induced stresses while simultaneously reducing distortion in aerospace and automotive parts. The objective for Phase II will be to continue the development and verification of analysis tools for predicting residual stress and part distortion. The goal is to supply industry with a validated analytical tool to easily and economically predict and prevent part distortion-reducing costs due to testing trials, part scrap, and time-to-market, increasing product quality and competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe commercial and broader impacts of this technology will be provide industry with the ability to predict and prevent part distortion due to machining induced residual stress. Current techniques, which rely upon testing, and experience are not sufficient technically nor are they cost effective. Aerospace parts (large, monolithic, thin-walled, and expensive) and critical automotive powertrain applications, which demand flat surfaces to maintain fuel efficiency, component life, and lower emissions, are typical examples. A significant impact will be to manufacturing costs, lower scrap material, higher productivity, lower time-to-market, and increased product quality and performance.",
