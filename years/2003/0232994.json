 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on improving the material properties \r\nof spray formed titanium shapes using the Cold Spray process.  Development of new, low-cost methods \r\nfor direct fabrication of spray formed titanium shapes is critical for many industries and in particular, for \r\nmanufacturing parts of expensive metals and alloys such as titanium.  Direct fabrication technologies \r\nwould have tremendous commercial potential for many industries such as the aerospace and automotive \r\nbecause these technologies hold out the potential to quickly manufacture, and provide fast prototyping of \r\ncomplicated parts and to fabricate them with minimal material waste.   Current methods of spray forming typically involve melting and solidification, which can cause high residual stresses, undesirable phases, poor microstructures, rough surface finishes, warpage, and other problems.  This proposal presents a new technology that is under development that appears promising for directly fabricating solid, near-full-density, free-form shapes of many metals, at or near room temperature \r\nwithout melting and solidification.   \r\n      The objective of this Phase I study is to develop a low cost technology for spray forming titanium and Ti-\r\n6Al-4V alloy and to perform post-test processing on thick-sprayed billets to improve the bulk material \r\nproperties to near that of the wrought material.  \r\n",
