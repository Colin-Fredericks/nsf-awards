 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical Advanced Summer Institute provides a series of lectures and seminars aimed at advanced graduate students on topics of current research in theoretical elementary particle physics and related experimental subjects.  It introduces students to the latest research techniques and results from the leaders in elementary particle theory research. Students interact strongly with one another and with the speakers and the lectures are published both on the web as well as in hard cover. Each year about 55 graduate students mostly from U.S. universities attend with financial aid given to students from U.S. universities. The proceedings have been published by World Scientific and are very valuable to both students and researchers in the field. The School is held at the University of Colorado Boulder and the school is organized by the PI along with one or two outside researchers who are experts on the subject of each school.",
