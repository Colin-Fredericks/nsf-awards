 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides some funding to support a group of junior and senior undergraduate students during an inter-session course in Oceanography aboard a UNOLS research vessel making a deadhead transit. This is an experimental program that will test the feasibility of using UNOLS vessels for such a course. The PI plans to bring five to ten students aboard the ship during a deadhead transit from Woods Hole, MA to Fortaleza, Brazil. The students will conduct a sampling program under the direction of the PI and take intensive coursework in oceanography. If they are able to successfully complete a course of this type, the PI anticipates teaching such classes on a regular basis by attempting to identify appropriate deadhead cruises or working with chief scientists who would be willing to accommodate a small number of students from other institutions.\r\n\r\n",
