 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of adequately high spatial resolution data sets from field testing of full-scale structures under\r\ndynamic loading conditions significantly limits the ability of earthquake engineers to improve their\r\nunderstanding of the seismic performance of structural and geotechnical systems. For example, field\r\nobservations of highly nonlinear structural response following major seismic events have been largely\r\nsupported with qualitative observations. Instrument recordings from buildings have been an invaluable\r\nresource over the past few decades; however, the density of instruments (with ~12 per structure being a\r\ncommon allocation) is too low to enable detailed evaluations of system or component responses.\r\nTo address this shortcoming, the Civil Engineering Department at UCLA is in the process of developing\r\nequipment to substantially enhance field testing capabilities for forced-vibration testing as part of the NSF\r\nNetwork for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. The project, entitled Field Testing\r\nand Monitoring of Structural Performancece, was initiated in January 2000 and continues through\r\nSeptember 2004. Field testing equipment being purchased consists of state-of-the-art vibration sources\r\n(linear inertial and eccentric mass shakers), sensors and a wireless data acquisition system\r\n(accelerometers, LVDTs, fiber optic gage readout unit, digitizers, routers, workstations), a CPT truck and\r\nin situ soil vibration sensors, and networking equipment (data concentrator, satellite uplink station) to\r\nallow for real-time data acquisition, processing, and world wide web broadcasting of experimental results.\r\nThe project involves only purchase and integration of the equipment; no specific research activities are\r\nbeing conducted with the project funds.\r\nThrough collaboration with a practitioner-based Implementation Advisory Board (IAB) for the\r\nUCLA/NEES project, a four-story office building in Los Angeles has been identified as a candidate for\r\nforced vibration testing. The building is of general interest because (1) it has a very common structural\r\nsystem consisting of a perimeter moment frame and an interior post-tensioned slab-column frame, and (2)\r\nit was significantly damaged during the Northridge earthquake, causing it to be abandoned. Previous\r\nanalysis-based post-earthquake studies of the building have generally been unable to explain the observed\r\ndamage. The owners plan to demolish the structure; however, for a variety of reasons, will not do so for\r\napproximately two years and have granted the PIs permission to conduct testing.\r\nThe proposed research involves forced vibration testing of the building using the NEES equipment as\r\nwell as detailed system identification and numerical modeling studies. Both earthquake-type and\r\nharmonic force histories will be applied to the building at the roof level, and waveforms will be recorded\r\nto enable evaluations of the complete structural system response, structural component behavior (e.g.,\r\nslab-column connections and pile caps), and the response of non-structural components (e.g., partitions,\r\npiping systems) as well as the influence of these components on the system response. A dense\r\ninstrumentation array will be utilized that will include accelerometers, displacement transducers, and\r\nstrain gauges. A wireless local area network will be installed to acquire and record waveform data,. The\r\ndetailed data set generated from the tests will provide valuable insight into the performance of this\r\ncommon type of structural system and the reasons for the poor performance of the subject building during\r\nthe Northridge earthquake. The testing will also provide invaluable experience to the NEES program with\r\nrespect to equipment use protocols and data archiving models. Gaining experience on these issues within\r\nthe present funding period is particularly useful as the NEES equipment development work is ongoing,\r\nand lessons learned can be implemented prior to the NEES system going online in 2004. Also relevant to\r\nthe timeliness of this proposal is the fact that this important building will be razed in two years.\r\n",
