IT develops and evaluates a multi-user virtual domain built on the model of a virtual exploratorium of computing. The structure of the virtual world conforms to the pedagogical hyper-structure of a computing curriculum. However, the material is be organized in an organic fashion, held together by a role-based theory of education. Hence, the normal course boundaries and sequences are abandoned in favor of a goal-oriented structure. The target audience is freshman/sophomore level students with special emphasis on workforce training and outreach to under-represented groups. These materials are to be suitable for use as a distance-education mechanism or as a supplement to a traditional classroom course. The project includes a rigorous series of evaluation studies exploring an innovative approach to the assessment of student learning. It implements an interactive module for automatically evaluating student programming assignments, and develops a graphical user interface for algorithmic visualizations.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is derived from its focus on research and education. The project has a good conceptual framework on which to build. It extends a text-based prototype and provides rigorous, well-designed evaluation to assess the impact of the model. It is a collaborative effort from a team with the special expertise needed in both development, implementation in the classroom, and assessment. It includes development of innovative assessment methodologies that have promise.\r\n\r\nThis project includes several broader impacts. It develops materials and methodologies that are suitable for delivery through both distance and traditional methods. It tests these materials at a diverse set of institutions and populations, including one with a significant Native American population. Thus the project is both adaptable and transferable to other institutions and settings. \r\n\r\nThis project investigates learning in a virtual context. It includes a formal comparison of approaches, contrasting classroom instruction with an anywhere/self-paced model, and a software tutored paradigm. It is a high-risk project, but with a high potential pay-off in terms of changing the way computer science is taught. \r\n\r\n",
