These data are already in hand in a U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) archive, or will be added to that archive during 2003.  As the most energetic objects in the universe, the kinetic energies of quasar jets are of fundamental importance to astrophysics.  \r\n\r\nAnalysis of several thousand VLBA snapshot images at 8 and 2 GHz will produce statistical information on apparent jet speeds, bending, and opening angles, and on spectral indices.  This will be of particular use when combined with the 15GHz (2cm) survey results.  Analysis of more detailed VLBA observations of several sources known to exhibit extreme properties will help to pin down the fastest apparent jet speeds, thus setting a lower limit to the intrinsic jet speed, of crucial importance for studies of the jet acceleration mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis work is part of the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  Whittier College is a predominantly female, Hispanic Serving Institution, and undergraduate students will be heavily involved in the research.  Integrating research into the undergraduate culture will promote teaching and learning, and broader participation, amongst two groups traditionally underrepresented in astronomy.\r\n",
