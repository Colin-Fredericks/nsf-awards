The technology convergence of electronic quantum dots (QDs) and photonic crystals (PhCs) will enable a revolution for the next generation of nano-photonic sources for high bandwidth optical communication. However, to achieve this requires that both systems, electronic and photonic, must be intimately engineered to enable spatial and spectral overlap between their respective wavefunctions and density of states. This proposal seeks to combine aggressive advances in 3-dimensional electronic confinement obtained from quantum dots with the unprecedented optical confinement achieved from photonic crystals to develop the next generation of highly efficient microcavity optical sources. There are three technical objectives of this proposal: (1) demonstrate photonic sources incorporating engineered quantum dots through control of growth synthesis; (2) demonstrate engineered and electrically injected optical nano-cavities within a 2-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal; and (3) integrate a single or few coupled quantum dot(s) within an engineered optical nano-cavity in a 2D photonic crystal.\r\n\r\nThe development of high efficiency optical sources with high modulation bandwidth and controllable wavelength will be a revolutionary advance for optical communications, by virtue of ultra-high operation performance and/or by enabling all optical signal processing and advanced computer processing. In addition, the proposed research will provide a new context to extend the understanding of nanofabrication techniques for novel optical materials. Therefore the proposed research will impact nanotechnology, microcavity physics, and the next generation of photonic applications. In addition, a guiding philosophy of the work is substantial involvement of undergraduates, targeted toward the participation of underrepresented groups. The PI plans to continue the incorporation of middle and high school teachers into the research programs to train and inspire them in new areas of science, to enable them to pass this on to their pupils. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
