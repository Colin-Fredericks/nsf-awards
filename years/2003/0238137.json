 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Prof. Craig A. Grapperhaus at the University of Louisville to evaluate the potential roles of sulfur site oxygenation in the enzyme nitrile hydratase.  This enzyme catalyzes the hydration of nitriles to amides by using iron in a non-redox role.  A series of complexes that: (1) serve as an effective structural and electronic mimic of the active site, (2) contain two thiolate sulfurs cis to the substrate binding site that are reactive with oxygen, and (3) are easily modified with respect to the exogenous, sixth ligand and incorporation of second-coordination sphere functionalities on the ligand framework will be developed.  If successful, this study will not only further the understanding of nitrile hydratase leading to the design of functional mimics, but will also serve the fundamental goal of developing and understanding sulfur-site reactivity and its ramifications on the properties and reactivity of a coordinated metal.  \r\n\r\nThe educational goals are focused on increasing undergraduate research participation as a means to increase student retention, graduation rates, and interest in graduate school in this traditionally under-performing region.  This approach focuses on four key components:  a formal Undergraduate Research Mentor Program to address local concerns, a regional, annual undergraduate research  symposium, the involvement of undergraduate students in the proposed research and outreach to regional undergraduate institutions through site visits each semester. \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the design of metal complexes to understand sulfur-site reactivity in an important enzyme.  This will aid the development of functional models for the industrially and environmentally important conversion of nitriles to amides.  The project will also increase the participation of undergraduates in research as a way to increase student interest in science.\r\n",
