 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stankovic - abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nWireless sensor networks, composed of 1000s of inexpensive devices, have the\r\npotential to significantly improve emergency response systems for\r\nearthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, as well as for\r\nchemical and biological attacks. While each node must be very cheap and,\r\ntherefore, is likely to have limited capacity, the aggregate behavior of \r\nthe nodes should collectively determine the situation,\r\ndetect possible survivors, send necessary information to the nearest \r\nrescue teams, identify a safe exit path for them, and monitor any \r\nsubsequent events of interests in the area. Since such emergencies \r\nmay last a long time and are highly dynamic;  the system needs to adapt to \r\nthe changing  environment, be robust, utilize \r\nthe limited resources efficiently, and meet any timing requirements. \r\nThis research is developing robust and real-time middleware services\r\nfor events and message delivery. In wireless sensor\r\nnetworks events are not binary, but are based on sensor fusion\r\nfrom many noisy sensors in complicated environments. Sensor data\r\nmay be missing, wrong, or out of date. Consequently, the event service\r\nmust support real-time, data fusion, confidence calculations, and\r\nconserve power. Events can occur in a very local region, be global or occur\r\nsimultaneously in many parts of the system. The event service must be\r\nhighly decentralized in order to work on the limited capacity\r\ndevices. The service must also minimize false alarms. \r\nAll of these features makes an event service for wireless\r\nsensor networks very challenging. The ultimate vision of\r\nthis work is to provide a facility that allows the application to specify \r\nthe desirable data and events, and deliver them in a timely manner. \r\nIf this research is successful, emergency response can occur\r\nmore quickly, and be more accurate; lives can be saved and damage\r\nreduced.\r\n",
