 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish the\r\ntechnical and economic feasibility of a novel technology to utilize reactive distillation to\r\nproduce vinyl ethers, the production of which is otherwise plagued by equilibrium\r\nlimitations and side reactions. The program will combine the catalysis expertise of KSE,\r\nInc. with the reactive distillation strengths of the Department of Chemical Engineering of\r\nthe University of Massachusetts, to develop the new technology. The resulting work\r\nproduct will not only advance the practice of the field of organic synthesis, but also will\r\nprovide useful case study examples for academic teaching and research.\r\nThe Phase I program requires completion of three tasks. First, research is needed\r\nto improve the catalyst compositions to promote vinyl ether synthesis, to match distillation\r\nrequirements. Second, laboratory reactor tests, including reactive distillation, must be\r\nperformed to guide catalyst improvement and to demonstrate success of the technology.\r\nThird, design and competitive economic analyses are required to complete the feasibility\r\nassessment. The proposed research will solve a major problem in vinyl ether synthesis,\r\nreducing byproducts and eliminating solvents. It will also provide valuable teaching and\r\nresearch tools for the practice of reactive distillation.\r\nCommercial applications of the reactive distillation technology will allow\r\nproduction of vinyl ethers as an important building block in organic synthesis,\r\neliminating the energy intensive acetylene route based on World War II technology. It\r\nallows new synthesis methods to be used, by eliminating critical equilibrium and\r\nbyproduct constraints.",
