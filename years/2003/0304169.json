 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT. This project aims at exploiting the synergy of expertise of the proposer team in nanostructured materials fabrication, design, characterization, and testing with that in biochemical engineering in order to produce the next generation of molecular chemical and biological sensors (Nanostructured E-noses). Transition metal oxide nanowires and nano-bio-composites will be the sensing elements of advanced detection devices used to rapidly diagnose diseases and bio-warfare activities through the detection of trace amounts of toxic chemicals. This is an interdisciplinary effort to manufacture electronic \"noses\" from arrays of nanostructured metal oxide sensors, each of which is specific to a given gas. Specificity in nanostructured oxides is achieved by exploiting their structure sensitivity. The proposed research focuses on the study of formation mechanisms of the nanostructured sensing probes, on testing their structural and mechanical stability, and on assessing their bio-detection capabilities. New tools for measuring the properties of nanostructured materials will also be developed.\r\n\r\nThe development of novel nanomaterials and processes for use in fast, reliable gas detectors for the monitoring of the human health and of the environment is the aim of this project. The proposed research will be performed by a team of investigators from various disciplines, having complimentary expertise in the processing, characterization and testing of nanomaterials and in bioengineering. The integration of the research activities with the proposed educational components (including offering new courses on sensors and research experience for science and engineering undergraduate students in a medical setting, etc.) will prepare students and young professional for future challenges, ultimately improving the national security.\r\n\r\nThe award is jointly supported through two directorates at NSF: (i) Mathematical and Physical Sciences (Division of Materials Research in the Ceramics program) and (ii) Engineering (Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial Innovation in the Nanomanufacturing program and the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Sciences).",
