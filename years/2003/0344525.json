 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear phenomena and the formation of spatio-temporal patterns play an increasingly important role in current research on partial differential equations and are at the center of many engineering disciplines. Their analysis have made tremendous progress over the last decade with the development of new tools in nonlinear dynamics. In turn, problems in nonlinear mechanics have stimulated important research in dynamical systems theory. Practical applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear across the entire spectrum of science. Research in this area is characterized by international and interdisciplinary cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe field of bifurcation theory and pattern formation is very active area of both pure and applied research, throughout the world today. The aim of this International Workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of developments in Non-linear Dynamics and Bifurcation Theory. We will make special efforts to promote communications between the two communities dealing with nonlinear phenomena, from theoretical and applied points of view, by promoting themes of common interest in emerging areas of Spatio-Temporal Pattern Formation. The Workshop will review both fundamental theory and its applications in mechanical systems, fluid-structure interactions, and other areas of mechanics, science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis Workshop intended for present and future researchers in the area of bifurcation theory and pattern formation. An important by-product of this activity will be the education of a new generation of truly multidisciplinary graduate students in nonlinear dynamics and related fields. We anticipate significant numbers of participants from Canada and the US. It will provide an opportunity for graduate students for the framework and for direction in their research plans, and to establish new research links.\r\n",
