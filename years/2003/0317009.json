 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Norbert Scherer of the University of Chicago will pursue a research program consisting of two parts: 1) investigation of solvent dynamics coupled to photo-driven and reactive chromophores by means of the newly developed polarizability response spectroscopy (PORS) technique, and 2) conduct experiments that combine full-field simulations and time-resolved mid-infrared (mid-IR) pulse propagation and pump-probe studies to fully characterize the interaction between the solute and the solvent.  Both parts rely on nonlinear spectroscopic techniques and their goal is to examine fundamental issues that affect the interaction between a solute and its surrounding liquid medium.  These issues are of fundamental importance and the results of the investigations provide new practical insights into chemical reactivity as well as into the methodology of measurement. \r\n\r\nThis research will be conducted with the assistance of students and postdoctoral research associates.  They will thereby obtain skills and training in one of the forefront areas of physical chemistry in preparation for either advanced studies or employment in the scientific/technological workforce.",
