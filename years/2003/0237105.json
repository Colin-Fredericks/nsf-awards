 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anatoly Kolomeisky of Rice University is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue research and disseminate knowledge in the area of non-equilibrium processes relevant to a microscopic chemistry-based understanding of biology.   He will study the dynamics of polymer translocation across nanopores, extend models to explain why the ligand-receptor bond rupture as a function of loading rate deviates from Hooke's law, investigate molecular motors, and determine the mechanisms for polymerization in biologically interesting filaments.   This field lies at the interface of chemistry, physics and biology and the research will be closely coupled to the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.\r\n\r\nThe underlying role of physical chemistry in biology remains an intellectually challenging problem area of great relevance to future biochemical technologies.  Problems addressed in this proposal will allow for a better understanding of targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals and subsequent dispersal.   A related area in need of a microscopic understanding is how conversion of energy into motion proceeds in biological systems. Examples of such processes, all of which are facilitated by molecular motors, include cell division and transport, molecular contraction and genetic transcription.  Kolomeisky plans to extend his research on molecular motors.   Imparting the knowledge and requisite skills to a multidisciplinary array of chemical, biological and physical scientists will be accomplished by introducing a course on biophysical chemistry that is aimed at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level student.  Early interest in this new area will be raised by outreach to high school students and teachers.\r\n",
