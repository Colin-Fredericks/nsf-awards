 "awd_abstract_narration": "Key experiments to characterize and reveal unconventional phases occurring in strongly correlated electron metals in the neighborhood of a quantum critical point are proposed.  The goal is the direct observation of the critical magnetic fluctuation spectrum by inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization measurements on single crystalline Ce heavy fermion compounds and transition metal oxides.  Different tuning parameters such as pressure and magnetic field are applied to characterize non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity close to an antiferromagnetic instability as well as to probe the physics close to a metamagnetic transition.\r\nRevealing the underlying physics of magnetic quantum critical points advances our knowledge on the nature of new electronic phases in theses complex materials, which is of  basic interest and also relevant for advanced technologies.  Graduate and undergraduate students are dealing with a variety of critical techniques and cutting edge topics, crucial for their careers.  The proposed activities will in particular educate the next generation neutron scatterers needed to harvest the full potential of  the future world leading Spallation Neutron Source in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the behavior of exotic electronic materials, the nature of instabilities towards magnetic ordered phases applying pressure or magnetic field will be investigated.  The special technique neutron scattering is well suited to observe the critical quantities in the neighborhood.  The goal is to characterize and reveal fundamental concepts and phases in physics such as the nature of quantum critical points, non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity.
