Taha, Yale University, P.I.\r\n\r\nThis document requests funding in the amount of $9K for a pilot joint event of two previously independent workshops called GCSE and SAIG. Both GCSE and SAIG are forums for publishing research generative techniques. GCSE focuses on generative techniques from the software engineering point of view, and SAIG from the formal and programming languages point of view. The pilot joint event, called the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Generators and Components (GC'02) will be held in October 2002, in Pittsburgh, PA. The event will replace GCSE and SAIG this year. If this experiment is successful, the result will be a regular, three-day joint conference bringing the two communities in one consolidated forum.",
