 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rathinam\r\n     The investigator develops efficient numerical schemes,\r\nsoftware, and theoretical analysis of these schemes for the\r\nsimulation of continuous-time discrete-state stochastic dynamic\r\nsystems that exhibit \"multiscale behaviour.\"  Examples of such\r\nsystems include chemically reacting molecular systems, traffic\r\nmodels, and markets.  In principle such systems can be simulated\r\nexactly one \"event\" at a time.  But the computational costs are\r\noften prohibitive for large systems.  Continuous macroscopic\r\nmodels -- either stochastic or deterministic differential\r\nequaitons -- often prove to be valid approximations to such\r\nmodels and in that case several numerical methods exist for their\r\nefficient simulation.  However, some systems exhibit \"multiscale\r\nbehaviour\" in the sense that only parts of the system may be\r\napproximated by such macroscopic models while the remaining\r\ncomponents need to be represented by a discrete and stochastic\r\nmodel.  Motivating examples are found in intra-cellular gene\r\ntranscription mechanisms, where the fluctuations of certain key\r\nmolecular species present in very small numbers have a critical\r\neffect on the final state of the system.  The investigator aims to\r\ndevelop numerical schemes and theory that target such multiscale\r\nsystems.  These schemes allow simulations to leap over several\r\nevents while maintaining required level of accuracy.\r\n     Computer simulation methods and their theory are well\r\ndeveloped for systems, such as a space craft in motion, that\r\nfollow a deterministic and continuous motion.  However, in some\r\ncomplex dynamic systems, such as chemical reactions inside a\r\ncell, the behaviour of traders in a large market, and the\r\ninternet traffic of data, the entities change in small jumps that\r\noccur randomly in time.  The investigator develops important new\r\ntools for the efficient computer simulation of such dynamic\r\nphenomena.  The impact of these tools is in the scientific\r\ncomputation of biological, social, and economic systems.  This\r\nproject also provides opportunities for graduate and\r\nundergraduate students to develop their skills in modeling and\r\nsimulation of such phenomena, which are useful in financial,\r\npharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries.\r\n\r\n",
