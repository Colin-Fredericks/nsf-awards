 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for fundamental research in mathematical physics and applied mathematics fo-\r\ncused on the challenges presented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes and related equations of\r\nuid mechanics. The Navier-Stokes equations constitute the basic mathematical model of uid\r\now, and are believed to contain turbulent dynamics among their solutions. Turbulence in uid\r\nmechanics remains one of the outstanding challenges for theoretical physics and applied mathe-\r\nmatics with important applications in, and implications for, many areas in the physical sciences\r\nand engineering. The work in this project will be carried out via modern applied analysis and\r\nnumerical computation and simulation by the principal investigator (PI), Prof. Charles R. Doering\r\nof the University of Michigan, and graduate students performing doctoral dissertation work. This\r\nproject has three specific objectives:\r\nFor one, a mathematical technique for deriving rigorous bounds on turbulent dissipation and\r\ndrag, which has come to be known as the \\background method,\" will be developed and expanded\r\nto new areas including magnetohydrodynamics, drag-reducing polymer ows, and ows over rough\r\nboundaries. The background method was introduced by the PI and his collaborator a decade ago\r\nfor the Navier-Stokes equations, and since then it has been developed and applied by the PI, his\r\nstudents, and many other researchers to a number of fundamental shear ow and thermal convection\r\nproblems. One particular goal of this project will be to explore applications to a wider variety of\r\nproblems of scientific interest.\r\nAnother focus of this project is to continue the ongoing investigation of theoretical and mathe-\r\nmatical issues in the analysis of thermal convection models where the background method is capable\r\nof putting limits on the heat transfer rate. Problems of concern here include laminar and turbulent\r\nconvection with free-slip boundaries, xed-ux convection, ows driven by internal heating, and\r\ninfinite Prandtl number models inspired by applications in geophysics.\r\nIn a third direction of research, power consumption and enstrophy generation will be studied\r\nfor forced ows and free ows in the absence of rigid boundaries. The PI and collaborators have\r\nrecently developed a new approach for the analysis of turbulence driven by time-independent body-\r\nforces, and it is proposed to extend the results to time-dependent forces. A distinct problem for\r\nunforced ows is to solve a variational problem for the maximum enstrophy-generating configuration\r\nand study how it relates to structures observed in fully developed turbulence or the potential\r\ndevelopment of singularities.\r\nWith regard to the intellectual merit of this activity, knowledge gained from this project will\r\nfurther our understanding of some basic mathematical models in uid dynamics of direct relevance\r\nto many branches of engineering and applied science. In the long term, this kind of mathematical\r\nresearch could help the development of practical techniques for the prediction and/or control of\r\nphysical processes ranging from meteorology to materials manufacturing.\r\nAnd with regard to this activity's broader impacts, there are several significant advanced train-\r\ning aspects to the project. For one, it provides research support and opportunities for graduate\r\nstudents within the University of Michigan's new Ph.D. program in Applied & Interdisciplinary\r\nMathematics. Moreover, this project also involves other investigators|including graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral researchers from the University of Michigan as well as other institutions|who\r\nwill collaborate in the research.",
