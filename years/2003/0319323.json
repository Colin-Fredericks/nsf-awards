 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to establish the feasibility of merging a novel radiometrically-accurate nonuniformity correction (NUC) algorithm with the wireless infrared-sensor technology. As the low cost of uncooled amorphous-Si technology is accompanied with substantiated fixed-pattern noise (FPN), the proposed NUC capability is an enabling technology sought to elevate the performance of the affordable uncooled sensors to a level competitive with that of the costly cooled sensors. In addition to its impressive computational efficiency, the proposed NUC algorithm has the unique feature that it maintains radiometric accuracy without compromising the continuous operation capability of the sensor. In this project, a comprehensive study will be launched to optimize the proposed NUC algorithm for both on-sensor and near-sensor modes of operation in microbolometer sensors described above. Prototype digital and hardware will be developed to implement the algorithm. \r\n\r\nWith the ability to remove the calibration dead time and the FPN, the system reliability will be increased dramatically. The diversification of the market for the detectors is currently limited because of the FPN in the detector. If, by some means, the FPN can be eliminated, the uncooled cost-effective microbolometer detector can be applied to markets where cooled high performance detectors dominate, such as predictive and preventative maintenance and surveillance applications. In addition, the existence of a cost-effective uncooled detector can be integrated into smaller packages such as flashlights and can be provided to mobile security forces, government special agents and law enforcement officials.\r\n",
