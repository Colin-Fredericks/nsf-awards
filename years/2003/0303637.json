 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to fund the early planning, design and development of the KOPIO detector in FY 2003.  The KOPIO experiment is a part of the Rare Symmetry Violating Processes (RSVP) program approved by the National Science Board in February 2001.  However, for a variety of reasons MREFC funding for construction of the experiments has not yet begun.  In order to proceed in an orderly manner with the RSVP experiments, the Physics Division has provided modest R&D funds to develop the experimental detectors required.  This proposal is part of that activity.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, this proposal seeks R&D funds for:\r\nEngineering of KOPIO's most critical elements, which include micro-bunching of the AGS beam at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, design and prototyping of the neutral beam, and the decay vacuum tank,\r\nDetector sub-system development,\r\nDesign and integration of the experimental area with the detector, and\r\nEstablishment of a Project Office.\r\n \r\nApart from the education and training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs, and the general impact of frontier scientific discovery on society, the broader impacts of this proposed research are not discussed specifically in this proposal.  However, reference is made to the RSVP construction proposal (MREFC) in which activities to reach a much broader audience for science are discussed.  \r\n",
