Schwartz\r\n\r\nA first-order characterization of the seismogenic zone, including its geometry \r\nand up and down-dip limits is nearly established in northern and central Costa \r\nRica. This was accomplished through the deployment of two onshore/offshore \r\nseismic networks directly above the seismogenic zone that were part of a \r\nMARGIN's funded multidisciplinary seismogenic zone experiment (CRSEIZE). This \r\nproposal seeks to: 1) use data collected during this experiment in conjunction \r\nwith local network data to establish a similar first-order characterization of \r\nthe seismogenic zone in Nicaragua; 2) perform a detailed investigation of the \r\nvariations in the transition from inter to intra plate seismicity in northern \r\nCosta Rica and Nicaragua; and 3) evaluate thermal and mechanical models that \r\nhave been proposed to control this transition.  These golas will be accomplished \r\nby simultaneously inverting local travel time data in northern Costa Rica and \r\nNicaragua to obtain an high resolution, three-dimensional, P and S wave velocity \r\nstructure and accurate hypocentral locations. Earthquake locations coupled with \r\nfocal mechanism determinations will allow the active seimogenic zone to be \r\nidentified in southern Nicaragua, where the addition of stations from the \r\nnorthern Costa Rica (Nicoya) network greatly improves station coverage and \r\nhypocentral accuracy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
