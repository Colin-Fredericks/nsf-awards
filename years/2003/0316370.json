 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juvenile hormone (JH) is critical for the development and sexual maturation of insects and other invertebrates.  The mechanism(s) of JH signaling remains unknown due to the chemical properties of the molecule, the complexity of the processes it regulates, and the difficulty of identifying primary responder genes.  The investigators will examine JH signaling in pine bark beetles, which have a devastating impact on US forests.  The anterior midguts of adult male pine engraver beetles, Ips pini, produce large amounts of pheromone when the beetles are treated with JH.  JH stimulates expression of genes in the mevalonate pathway, providing a simple and robust tool to monitor JH regulation.  An expressed sequence tag (EST) database and cDNA microarrays of genes expressed in pheromone-biosynthetic midguts will be mined to identify genes that respond quickly to JH treatment.  Rapid responders will in turn be used to screen a genomic library in order to isolate 5' flanking regions of mevalonate pathway genes, as well as others that react to JH.  Putative JH-response elements are most likely located in this region of the genes, and will be identified by bioinformatic analyses.  The investigators will also study the biochemistry and effects of JH on identified genes using short-term in vitro cultures of midgut cells.  This work will fill a significant gap in JH research by bringing JH studies to the Coleoptera, an order that has otherwise been overlooked.  In addition to providing new knowledge about JH signaling and pheromone biosynthesis, the investigators will uncover new molecular targets that may be used to manage these significant forestry pests.  Students and postdoctoral fellows involved in the research will receive training in biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics. \r\n\t\t\r\n",
