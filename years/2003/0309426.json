 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tactic switching, habitat selection, and evolution of alternative mating tactics.\r\n\r\nGregory F. Grether and Brenda Larison\r\n\r\nHow variation is maintained in natural populations is a fundamental evolutionary question. Among the causes of variation, sexual selection plays a prominent role, leading to exaggerated traits, alternative mating tactics, and even speciation. Numerous studies have examined alternative mating tactics in species in which individuals exhibit distinct differences in traits such as size or color, and individuals use one tactic for life. However, most species exhibit continuous variation in such traits, and individuals exhibit flexible use of alternative tactics. An important question is how alternative mating tactics evolve under these conditions. Besides exhibiting continuous variation in tactic use and physical attributes, individuals of many species have the capability of choosing the habitats they utilize. Where different habitats promote differences in tactic use, this may further influence the evolution of alternative mating tactics.\r\nThe proposed study will investigate whether tactic switching and habitat selection have promoted the evolution and maintenance of alternative tactics in a damselfly in which tactic use is associated with continuous variation in shape. This hypothesis predicts that, 1) tactic use and fitness should vary in response to environment and shape, and 2) males should select environments based on their shape. Predictions will be tested through observations, enclosure experiments, examination of energetic costs, and development of a dynamic state model. This project provides opportunities for undergraduate research for both U.S. students and local Panamanian students.\r\n\r\n",
