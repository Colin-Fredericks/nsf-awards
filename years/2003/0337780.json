 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request funds that will be used to contribute to participant costs for the 8th symposium on Study of Earth's Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany from July 4-9, 2004. Intellectual Merit SEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the Study of the Earth's Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, dynamical, and chemical state of the Earth's deep interior and of the effect that the interior has on the structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The 'deep interior' is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest may extend to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior, composition, structure and dynamics of the outer core, dynamo energetics, structure of the inner core, core cooling and the core-mantle boundary region, core-mantle boundary shape, coupling and the rotation of the Earth, lower mantle: structure, convection and plumes, nature and location of\r\ndeep geochemical reservoirs, etc. Broader Impact This proposal will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and young researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop style meeting. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth.\r\n",
