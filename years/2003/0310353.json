 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  This project's primary goal is to improve our undergraduate curriculum in NMR spectroscopy by providing students with hands-on use of a modern Fourier-transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. With the upgrade of our continuous wave (CW) spectrometer by Anasazi Instruments, chemistry students at Roosevelt University have early and frequent access to a FT-NMR with multinuclear capabilities. Faculty at nearby high schools and community colleges also visit the campus and have access to the instrument for their own courses and students. FT-NMR experiments are being integrated into undergraduate service courses. Students are introduced to 13 C-NMR early in general chemistry, leading into more detailed applications of NMR in the organic chemistry sequence. Advanced FT-NMR techniques including correlation experiments and spin-lattice relaxation measurements are being adapted into upper-level courses and undergraduate research. This project impacts many underrepresented students in terms of gender, ethnicity, and class and thereby better prepares them for scientific employment and graduate and professional studies. It also fosters pedagogical collaboration between an undergraduate institution and nearby community colleges and high schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
