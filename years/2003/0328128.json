 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. This Symposium on Solid State Chemistry is a one-day symposium on Solid-State Chemistry to be held as part of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society to be held in Princeton NJ June 8-11, 2003. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid-state chemistry areas that include novel synthetic methods, crystal chemistry, electronic and magnetic properties, dielectrics and ferroelectrics, nanomaterials, solid state ionics, and new materials. The NSF funds will be used to defray the expenses of students, post-docs, and junior faculty attending the symposium.\r\n%%% \r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by designing new materials for energy, electronics and photonics, including the design and construction of novel 'biosolids' such as biomolecules in sol-gels as sensor materials.\r\n***  \r\n",
