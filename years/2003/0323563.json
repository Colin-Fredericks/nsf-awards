 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research project is to develop a comprehensive framework for improvement of security and efficiency of modern power systems in a market context. We focus on the level of an Independent System Operator (ISO) as a natural level for control and security assessment, as it has emerged after energy system deregulation.\r\n\r\nOur program consists of three components: 1) power system component, centered at Northeastern University, 2) environmental component, centered at Syracuse University, and 3) market component, centered at Temple University. Specifically, we plan to explore use of modern convex optimization and equilibrium methods in improving security aspects of generator scheduling on the ISO level and to perform detailed (hourly) generator plant simulations. Results of these simulations will be used in environmental models to assess effects of variations in plant loadings on the environment in the Northeast. The results of environmental studies will be fed back to power system models used to assess the sensitivities of the ISO operation to possible regulatory and policy changes. The program includes an integral educational component, built around undergraduate and graduate student internships at our industrial partners, course development and outreach. The project team includes industrial partners (ISO New England) who will serve as technical advisors and as a host to our students, and provide realistic test cases for all models involved.\r\n\r\nIn terms of intellectual merit, this program has several features distinguishing it from existing activities, as it: 1) provides for systematic links among power system, electricity market, and environmental modeling tools; 2) provides for much needed sensitivity studies with respect to inevitable model uncertainties, changes in economic and emergency response policies; and 3) includes undergraduate and graduate students in the same project at the same host organization. The project will establish new links with methods for describing uncertainty in robust control theory, and develop procedures for guaranteeing compatibility among models used in various domains (power systems, economics, environmental engineering). The project organization includes participation of Deans at all three sites, while remaining flexible and responsive to the evolving needs of the project.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impact, this project will develop a model of research coordination among three distinct research areas (power engineering, regulatory economics, and environmental engineering) that are closely coupled in issues like ISO system efficiency and security. It will allow for reexamination of modeling assumptions and practices in each area given the insight from the other two, thus enabling a better flow of ideas and people. We also plan to build on the track record of all three institutions in attracting and retaining students coming from under-represented groups, and the Director of multicultural engineering programs at Northeastern will coordinate this effort. Educational benefits of the program include development of courses and teaching material, outreach activities involving undergraduate students, and training of PhD students who will be uniquely positioned for productive work in the areas of energy processing systems, environmental engineering and regulatory economics.\r\n",
