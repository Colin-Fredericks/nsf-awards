The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Lead Institution), University of Wisconsin- Stout, University of Wisconsin-Platteville, Milwaukee Area Technical College, Phillips Plastics, Serigraph, Flambeau Corporation, Teel Plastics, Bemis Manufacturing, Georgia Pacific, Kelch Corporation, Engineering Industries, Kaysun Corporation, Simtec-USDA Forest Products Laboratory, University of Wisconsin- Extension Small Business Development Centers, Eau Claire/Chippewa Falls Economic Development Association, Office of the Governor of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Wisconsin Technology Council, and Forward Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nThis project fosters innovation-driven sustainable economic growth in Wisconsin's plastics cluster by (1) catalyzing innovation through knowledge creation, technology transfer, application of emerging and novel methods and tools for polymer engineering and polymer processing, and commercialization by the industry partners, (2) building human capital through workforce education and training to provide expertise in innovative polymer materials, engineering, and processing to industry, and (3) enhancing enabling infrastructure for networking, collaboration, and entrepreneurship to catalyze innovation.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe plastics industry is one of the few industries in which the United States still holds a strong leadership in the global market.  However, the threats of global competition are very real as companies are increasingly outsourcing to foreign companies where manufacturing is far cheaper owing to lower labor and materials costs as well as fewer regulatory constraints. Manufacturing accounts for 23% of the jobs in Wisconsin. The only means to improve and maintain the United States' competitive position is through innovation.\r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in the creation, transfer and application of emerging materials, tools and technologies that lead to the development of new plastics and processes having superior characteristics and economic potential for commercialization.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity include a scientifically and technologically literate and diverse workforce prepared to capitalize on this new knowledge to drive innovation and productivity growth, plus an infrastructure that enables innovation through networking, collaboration and entrepreneurship in Wisconsin's plastics industry.  Underrepresented groups are involved in the research and workforce development programs.\r\n",
