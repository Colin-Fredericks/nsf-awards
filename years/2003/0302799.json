 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project the Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center\r\n(ATEEC) is significantly expanding and enhancing its national Environmental Resource Center capabilities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project is identifying environmental education information, materials, research, expertise and support services of value to educators, workers, and the general public; and to organizing and presenting this body of knowledge and services in formats that are stimulating and accessible to a broad array of user groups. The project builds upon ATEEC's eight years of experience and success in serving as a national NSF Center of Excellence.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact \r\nThe Environmental Resource Center is having broad impact on a wide diversity of user groups. These include: high school and community college students in environmental courses; community college students across the spectrum of academic and technical programs; workers engaged in retraining or skill upgrade; military and security personnel; community and municipal leaders including Tribal colleges; the environmental research establishment; the general public; and international environmental educators. The Environmental Resource Center supports and promotes quality teaching and learning by: \r\n(a) strengthening the Center's many communication vehicles; \r\n(b) closely linking NSF-ATE environmental projects to the Center;\r\n(c) initiating efforts to extend environmental education across the curriculum; \r\n(d) focusing upon ease of access and providing information electronically; \r\n(e) capturing emerging environmental research and making it available to students and all of society, \r\n(f) developing a segmented marketing approach to attract underrepresented students to the field; \r\n(g) providing a comprehensive mentoring program to environmental programs at colleges across the nation; \r\n(h) providing stimulating professional development opportunities; and, \r\n(i) expanding access to on-line environmental courses and materials. \r\n\r\nATEEC continues its focus on inclusiveness with special outreach activities to\r\nunderrepresented groups through the composition of advisory committees and the selection of people to highlight in marketing materials as well as by ensuring a diversity of attendees at professional development events and special activities with underrepresented groups. This project also continues to focus upon fostering the integration of emerging research and education. Much of the strength of the Environmental Resource Center derive from the manner in which ATEEC leverages its capabilities and expertise with the capabilities and expertise of its many collaborators and partners. The Environmental Resource Center is advancing environmental knowledge and understanding in high schools, community colleges, the workforce, and society at-large.\r\n",
