 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing support is provided for the international oceanographic  activities of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)  that are relevant to U.S. interests in marine sciences and the  Division of Ocean Sciences.  There are currently thirty-eight  countries represented in SCOR.  The Ocean Studies Board of the  National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S. national committee.    Individual ocean scientists participate in SCOR activities through  subsidiary bodies such as working groups and scientific steering  committees.  Funding will support two major SCOR activities: 1)  U.S. sponsorship of focused SCOR Working Groups.  Presently, there  are twelve such Working Groups covering diverse ocean-science  related topics.  Working Groups are comprised of experts from  different countries who meet on a regular basis to discuss and  assess the scientific status of their topic area and produce a  report that advises and provides recommendations for further  research efforts.  2)  Science Steering Committee activities of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) - a study of the ocean's role in the global carbon cycle and its response to global change; Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) - an effort to understand the relationships between physical variability in the ocean and the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems and how they may be impacted by global change; and Global Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (GEOHAB) - a program to improve our understanding of the processes involved in the development of algal blooms which have enormous consequences for marine resources, the economies which depend upon them and, in some cases, human health.  SCOR will also be involved in developing plans for a new program (Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study, SOLAS) to look at the interactions between the upper ocean and the lower part of the atmosphere where many important exchanges take place, in particular of carbon dioxide and other \"greenhouse gases\"; SCOR and IGBP are developing the Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Analysis ( OCEANS) project. The goal of OCEANS is to understand the sensitivity of the ocean to global change within the context of the broader Earth System.   These major programs have origins  in U.S. and have turned to SCOR to provide a forum for  international planning and coordination.  SCOR's impact has and  will continue to be evident in the standardization of measurement  protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship time, and the  enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without  international coordination.",
