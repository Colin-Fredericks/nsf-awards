 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to extend the EPICS Engineering Projects in Community Service model by vertically integrating select University of Illinois undergraduate EPICS teams with K-12 students in the Champaign-Urbana.  Depending on the nature of the project, the K-12 students will work as consultants for, clients of, or teammates with undergraduate students on real science and engineering projects that serve the community.  Problem-based learning and cooperative learning will be the key pedagogical approaches to enhancing student learning.  By presenting K-12 students with an open-ended problem and challenging them to work together to find and implement a solution, the students will development cognitively as they learn new information, analyze data and alternatives, synthesize and create solutions, and evaluate alternative.  Further, engaging K-12 students in large, real-world \"hands-on/minds-on\" problems in teams with undergraduate engineering students will increase the motivation, confidence, excitement and interest of younger students in SMET.",
