 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Travel Grant will provide partial support for 6 to 8 US scientists to attend the 27th NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Intrinsic Localized Modes and Discrete Breathers in Nonlinear Lattices, Erice, Sicily, July 21-27, 2003.  The workshop deals with properties of condensed matter that occur in materials that have a regular lattice structure but that are spatially discrete.  In such systems, nonlinear models must replace the linear models of the last century.  The nonlinearity introduces fundamentally new phenomena, such as \"intrinsic localized modes\" and \"discrete breathers\".  This Advanced Research Workshop is intended to bring together in a workshop forum both junior and senior workers to discuss the common research topic of intrinsic localization of vibrational, atomic and spin energy, electric charge, electromagnetic energy and magnetic flux in nonlinear, spatially discrete systems from the theoretical, numerical, and experimental perspectives.  The Travel Grant will enable six to eight scientists from the US to travel, attend the workshop and interact with other scientists in this field, which spans a wide area of physical and biological sciences.",
