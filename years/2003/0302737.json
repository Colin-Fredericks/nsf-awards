 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, Hedrick Smith told the National Education Goals Panel that American education is leaving behind the mid-kids of the whole technician class. Seventy percent of the jobs in the 21st century will not require a B.A. The country needs to educate thinking people to fill these technical, yet highly skilled jobs. This project proposes to do just that by focusing on the Instrumentation and Controls technicians employed in the process and manufacturing industries. Since October 2000, the Lee College Center (Consortia) for Fieldbus and Process Control Systems Maintenance Education funded by NSF has provided a venue for training and education to meet the needs of emerging instrumentation technology technicians nationwide. The Center (Consortia) is recognized worldwide as a leader in providing fieldbus education. Fieldbus, the emerging technology in the field of instrumentation, is an all-digital communications system that interconnects measurements and process control equipment in both process and manufacturing automation applications.  With its partners, Lee College is expanding the current project to realize the following goals: \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n1. Developing, teaching, and disseminating core curricula and skill standards materials related to instrumentation and controls technology. Specifically, the tasks being performed are: (a) developing and disseminating a national skills standard; (b) standardizing and updating the AAS degree plan at Lee College; and (c) increasing SMET education components the in existing curriculum. \r\n2. Developing, teaching and disseminating curricula related to emerging technologies in the instrumentation and controls field. Specifically, the tasks being performed are: (a) developing and teaching specialty course area in the curriculum; (b) providing instructor education through appropriate workshops; and (c) disseminating model for the development and delivery of course materials for emerging technology. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact\r\n3. Providing services as a center of applied research and development for use by industry. Specifically, the tasks being performed are: (a) updating equipment so that it meets the functionality required in industry; (b) encouraging industries' use of the facility for system demonstrations, research support and functional systems testing; and (c) support the publishing of research outcomes and activities in appropriate journals. \r\n4. Recruiting and retaining students in the instrumentation and controls programs. Specifically, the tasks being performed are: (a) increasing the number of students pursuing the AAS degree; (b) increasing number of female students enrolled in the program; (c) adopting a 2+2+2 articulation program with appropriate institutions; and (d) improving the student success rate in the AAS program. \r\n\r\n",
