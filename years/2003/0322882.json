Preliminary experiments demonstrate that distillation purity and productivity can be dramatically increased with this technique.  These membranes have a mass transfer resistance comparable to the boundary layer resistances in adjacent solutions.  In previous work, operation above the normal limit of flooding and below the normal limit of loading was demonstrated.  Because the current membranes have low melting temperatures, initial tests will be conducted near room temperature.  Distillation using nanoporous membranes will be attempted; it is expected that these membranes will have high mass transfer rates near room temperature, and they may be suitable for the distillation of air.  Enhanced mass transfer due to membrane spacers, which cause chaotic mixing will be studied.  Propane-propylene distillation will be used as a model system with experiments to be carried out in collaboration with Los Alamos National Laboratory.  In terms of the broader impacts, this work has the potential to increase the efficiency of distillation processes, which account for 5% of the US oil consumption.  Traditional mentoring of graduate students will also result.\r\n",
