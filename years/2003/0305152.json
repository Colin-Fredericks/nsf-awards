One of the main goals of his research is potential \r\napplications to the Novikov Higher Signature Conjecture and some \r\nother related conjectures.\r\n\r\nAsymptotic topology is a relatively new subject which studies \r\nthe large scale properties of a space. The\r\nclassical topology is a science of a very small scale, since it is based on\r\nthe notion of a continuous transformation which is local.\r\nThe classical topology has the century long history and now it is substantially\r\ndeveloped in all directions. Its long and painful birth  at the \r\nend of 19th and beginning of 20th centuries was inspired and \r\npushed by the progress in natural sciences and mathematics, in particular \r\nin analysis. By the end of the 20th century in many areas\r\nof mathematics the necessity appeared for a discipline which would be\r\nsimilar to topology and which describe  behavior of the large scale world.\r\nSuch a discipline started to hatch in a last decade or so.\r\nThis proposal is a further push for rising of such science.\r\n",
