 "awd_abstract_narration": "Papadopoulous, Kyriakos D., et al\r\nTulane University\r\n\r\n\"Confocal Viedo \\ (Capillary\\) Microscopy with Flourscence\" \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a deconvolution workstation, which, together with a number of attachments and software will enable researchers in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Tulane University to do confocal microscopy and sophisticated image analysis.  Existing video (capillary) (fluorescent) microscopy setups in the laboratories of Kyriakos Papadopoulos and Kim O.Connor have been used by all participating investigators, and this upgrade will significantly impact their individual and joint research projects that rely on microscopy.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe PIs will use this acquisition to visualize and quantify interfacial processes that are important in drug delivery schemes involving double emulsions, liposomes, and pheroidal aggregates of cancer cells.  Additionally, the equipment will be very useful in the ability to develop a capillary microscopy technique that will visualize phenomena at high temperatures, and will also make possible the quantification of luminescence in nanowires and of transport of Dense Non-Aqueous-Phase Liquids in model porous media that simulate contaminated soils.   \r\n \r\nTulane enjoys very strong research and educational ties with Xavier University, a major minority institution in the southern United States.  Kyriakos Papadopoulos has had a continuous collaborative research project with Xavier Physics Professor Elia Eschenazi, which has involved many undergraduates and which has led to three Tulane Chemical Engineering MS degrees awarded to students who had previously majored in Chemistry at Xavier.  Additionally, the PI's fully participate in the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP), a comprehensive, statewide program aimed at substantially increasing the number and quality of minority students earning bachelor's degrees in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) areas. In the last 2 years, Vijay John has supervised three students through this program (Jonathan Hijuelos and Hendekea Azene from Tulane, Stephanie Sigers from Dillard University). The program is sponsored through an NSF grant to the State of Louisiana. The investigators are committed to continuing their research collaboration with Xavier, thus providing educational opportunities to the students of that University.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
