 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History proposes to develop a 5,000 sq ft traveling exhibition, along with educational material and programs.  Motivated by the challenge of solving a crime, visitors will become engaged in a scientific investigation that cuts across the multiple disciplines of forensic science.  This project builds upon the successful implementation of \"Whodunit?  The Science of Solving Crime,\" funded by a prior NSF grant (ESI-9253370). \r\n\r\nThe proposed exhibition will travel to the member institutions of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative, where the primary target audiences will be children in the upper elementary and middle school years. The proposed 12-month planning grant would enable research, front-end evaluation, project team meetings, and the development of a conceptual plan and a business plan for the new exhibition beginning.  The Museum will develop specific plans to reach underserved audiences and to examine the feasibility of creating a version for small science centers.\r\n",
