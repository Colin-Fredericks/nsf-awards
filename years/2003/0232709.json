 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will  synthesize novel \r\nslurries for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of low dielectric constant (K) \r\nmaterials. Standard abrasives such as silica and alumina lead to significant scratching, \r\nindenting and delamination of the soft low K surface. In this project it is proposed to use \r\nnanoporous silica based slurries in which the hardness of the particle can be controlled. \r\nIn the project, synthesis of nanoporous silica particles will first be carried out followed by charcterization; next will be development of  the slurry formulation followed by charcterization and finally testing against the specific needs of the CMP application.\r\n\r\nCommercially, these slurries are expected to reduce surface defects and enhance slurry stability. It is expected that major electronic manufacturing companies will use this new type of slurry. Wafer level experiments are already planned on patterned wafers in \r\ncollaboration with key industrial partners. \r\n",
