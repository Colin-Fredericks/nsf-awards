 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NIRT proposal focuses on a new method for building multi-component nano-systems out of diverse types of nano-devices. In this method colloidal magnetic particles will be used as carriers that can deliver different nano-devices to different locations within the system. Magnetic fields generated using tiny magnets will be employed to direct the process of assembly of the colloidal magnetic particles. The new method will be called MAGDA as an abbreviation for MAGnetically Driven Assembly.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nWhile magnetic forces can be weaker than surface forces and chemical binding, they are sufficiently strong and do offer several important advantages in the process of assembly of heterogeneous nano-systems.\r\n1)\tMagnetic forces have a much longer range of action than chemical and surface forces. \r\n2)\tUnlike electrostatic fields, magnetic fields of colloidal particles are not screened by ions in solutions and are largely independent of the fluid being employed. \r\n3)\tMagnetic fields do not interfere with the biological, chemical or electronic functions of biomolecules, inorganic molecules and/or live cells.\r\n4)\tNonlinearity of ferromagnetic materials used to control the assembly process can be exploited to obtain repulsive as well as attractive forces, while magnetic memory can be used for nonvolatile operation. This will be critical in the proposed research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will deal with fundamental issues related to scaling of critical dimensions down to 100 nm and below, developing fabrication methods needed to construct various tools for MAGDA processes, developing computationally efficient numerical models of the assembly process and demonstrating applications of MAGDA to fabrication of bio-sensors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe proposed work will have a significant educational impact. It will involve undergraduate students in developing educational web site on the subject of self-assembly. The investigators will develop courses related to self-assembly that can be used as a part of general nanotechnology education effort and as a part of Drexel University/University of Pennsylvania joint IGERT program on nanotechnology. The researchers involved will also organize seminars and workshops on topics that are closely related to the subject of this research. The results of the research will be employed to make exciting presentations to attract high-school students and under-represented minorities into higher education in general and into nanotechnology area in particular.\r\n",
