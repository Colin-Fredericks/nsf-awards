 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this award is to investigate a non-contact, acoustic levitation technique for transporting relatively light and flat objects.  The objectives are to formulate a comprehensive analytical expression that predicts acoustic levitation in terms of actuation frequency, vibration amplitude, object size and mass and to design and build an industrial size, multiple-beam prototype that will be used to test closed-loop control of object stop-go motion, change of direction, and object carry-over between two beams which are mechanically free of each other.  Specific approaches to achieving the research objectives will involve mathematical modeling of acoustic transport dynamics that takes into account the physical parameters of actuators and object, numerical analysis of air streaming patterns and the nature of shear forces that propel objects into motion, and empirical testing of the performance and controllability of the transport process using an industrial size prototype.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will enable an intelligent transfer of compact disks, silicon wafers, and other high surface-quality products in a non-contact, dust-free, and noise-free environment.  A broader impact can also be found in other technology areas such as nanoscale part transport, drug delivery, and ground transportation.",
