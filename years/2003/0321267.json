 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Montana State University under the direction of Dr. Edward Dratz from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry for the acquisition of proteomics equipment for research and training.  The dawn of the post-genomic era is leading to extraordinary opportunities and terrific challenges for understanding fundamental processes in biology.  A central question is how the various gene products (primarily proteins) work together to accomplish biological functions and allow the organisms to adapt to changing circumstances.  The genome of an organism is quite static (apart from rare mutations), whereas the proteins expressed by the cells in organisms are highly dynamic and change rapidly in response to stimuli.  Proteomics is the study of the proteins that are up- or down-regulated or changed in post-translational modifications (PTMs) in response to biological or environmental stimuli.  Typical proteins may have many different PTMs, which usually affect the protein's activity and/or cellular localization. \r\n\r\nTen groups of investigators from five departments (Chemistry and Biochemistry, Plant Sciences, Land Resources and Environment, Microbiology and Cell Biology and Neurosciences) and the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University will make heavy use of the proteomics equipment and proteomics training capability that will be provided by this grant.  The projects cut across many fields, including adaptation of hyperthermophilic archaea to extreme environments, development of new, ultrasensitive multiplex detection methods in functional proteomics, mechanisms of biofilm formation in marine bacteria and regulatory pathways in biofilm control, two different studies of neurodevelopment in chick and xenopus, and mechanism of axonal sprouting in the rat brain.  \r\n\r\nOne crucial outcome from acquisition of the equipment and support is broad cross-training opportunities for postdoctorals and for students at many levels in the use of advanced proteomics methodology. Montana State University has a long history of combining research and teaching and strongly integrating undergraduate students into research laboratories during the academic year and during the summer (with several REU Programs).  Two of the REU programs are designed to attract Native American students from Tribal Colleges in Montana.\r\n",
