 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tWith colleagues in several Brazilian institutions, Dr. Lena Struwe of Rutgers University is studying the systematics and phylogenetic relationships of tropical plants of the gentian family, specifically of the tribe Helieae, with an estimated 220 species currently placed in 22 genera. These are distributed widely in South America but with concentrations on the ancient Guayana and Brazilian Shields and with relatives in regions of the younger Andean mountains and Brazilian lowlands areas. The major goal is to construct a phylogenetic framework for all the genera of the tribe, and in turn to use that genealogical \"road map\" to explore likely routes of biogeographic diversification and timing of divergences in the origins and spread of the plant genera across the South American landscape. Molecular DNA sequences from nuclear and chloroplast genes are primary targets for new data, and these will be integrated with traditional taxonomic information on these plants to construct the phylogenetic framework.\r\n\tCollaboration with scientists in Brazil will be fostered by the research in conjunction with institutional cooperation between Rutgers University and the University of Sao Paulo. A U.S. graduate student will receive travel support to work with Brazilian colleagues in herbarium and laboratory research on the plants. Efforts will continue to develop a website initiated by Dr. Struwe that serves researchers studying the family Gentianaceae, the Gentian Research Network.\r\n\r\n",
