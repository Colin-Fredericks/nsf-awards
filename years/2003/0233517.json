Johnston and students at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California and Jacques Zlotnicki of the Observatory of Earth Physics in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  The objective is to bring together theoretical, laboratory and field measurements of self-potential (SP) generation on active volcanoes, and in particular, to study sources of electric and magnetic signals around volcanoes. The investigators will study existing data for temperature, fluids and gas generation processes.  Joint comparisons will focus on separation of processes that contribute to SP and the implications for monitoring volcano activities.  The investigators will look for anomalies in laboratory and field data collected in well-known volcanic regions - Piton de la Fournaise (Reunion Island), Soufriere (Caribbean), Kilauea (Hawaii), Long Valley Caldera (US) and Miyake-jima (Japan). The US investigator brings to the project expertise on fluid vaporization and charge transport.  This is complemented by French expertise in electrokinetic effects.  The project has potential to understand signals from volcanoes and could lead to better prediction methods. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate student. The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. \r\n",
