 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n The principal innovation of this proposal is that DIC is envisioned as the\r\nprimary strain measuring technique in a large-scale structural testing facility. This non-\r\ncontacting technique yields a fully quantifiable strain field in two or three dimensions by\r\nmanipulating digital images. This emerging technology has not yet been harnessed for the\r\nstudy of civil engineering structures.\r\nThe acquisition of these instruments, when coupled with current renovation of laboratory\r\nspace within the Division of Engineering, will provide a versatile structural testing facility that will\r\nsupport a coordinated effort between faculty and students in Civil and Environmental\r\nEngineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Mathematics. The diverse, yet well-linked expertise\r\nof the senior personnel enables a broad range of research that includes structural steel, timber,\r\nreinforced concrete, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials, corrugated paper containers, and\r\nthe transient stresses in sport equipment.\r\nThe structural testing request consists of hydraulic equipment, data acquisition\r\ninstruments, signal conditioning devices, shop tools, and various transducers. \r\nThe resulting structural testing facility will serve as a blueprint of versatile, cost effective,\r\nand nimble laboratory design for other small undergraduate institutions, by building the\r\nfacility from industrial components.\r\nThe pedagogical value of the DIC technique as an aid to visual understanding in\r\nscience, mathematics, and engineering will be disseminated through publication and\r\nconferences.\r\nInitially, the DIC technique will be used in six engineering courses. As new research\r\nareas are explored with the requested facilities, it is anticipated that six additional\r\nengineering courses may benefit.\r\nThe diverse talents of the research team offer the potential to extend these new\r\ntechniques into disciplines outside of engineering.",
