 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference on Topics in Heavy Ion Collisions \r\nprovides the international community of nuclear scientists with a unique venue to present the newest developments at the forefront of this science.  The scientific presentations will span the physics of hot and dense strongly interacting matter, from intermediate to relativistic energies.  The conference organizing committee has sought to establish an atmosphere suitable for scientific stimulating discussions.  \r\n\r\nInternational conferences such as HIC03 where noted scientists gather to discuss their research are very educational and inspirational to our young scientists.  Their participation is essential to address the future manpower needs of this rapidly changing field.  The conference also provides them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the leadership roles they will assume in the future.  Therefore, it is important to encourage bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to participate in this conference and to present their ideas.  This award will support and enable the participation of students and junior scientists.  \r\n \r\n\r\n",
