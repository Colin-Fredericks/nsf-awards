 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical and algorithmic approaches to data analysis have played a\r\ncentral role in the development of modern methods for handling data.\r\nThe massive amounts of data gathered in important present-day\r\napplications ranging from the Internet to homeland security to\r\nastronomy and medicine have dramatically changed the requirements for\r\nalgorithms and provide ample motivation for a great deal of new\r\ntheoretical development. Traditional data analysis tools are incapable\r\nof handling the sheer size and complexity of these gigantic data sets.\r\n\r\nThe project will run three workshops on topics related to the size and\r\ncomplexity of modern data sets:\r\n\r\n\"Data Quality, Data Cleaning and Treatment of Noisy Data\"\r\n\r\n\"Compact Representation of Data\"\r\n\r\n\"Geographical Information Systems: Terrain Representation and\r\nAnalysis Algorithms\"\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe Data Quality workshop seeks to bring together experts from\r\ndifferent research disciplines to initiate a comprehensive technical\r\ndiscussion on data quality, data cleaning and treatment of noisy data.\r\nThe objectives of the workshop are to develop quantitative ways of\r\nmeasuring the quality of data and to search for an integrated,\r\ndomain-independent approach to data cleaning in the situation where\r\nthe sheer size of data collections prevents one from manually\r\nscrubbing or even monitoring them.\r\n\r\nThe central topic of the Compact Representation workshop revolves\r\naround the following question: Can a large and potentially complicated\r\ndata set be replaced by a short sketch such that a certain class of\r\nqueries on the original data can be answered (perhaps approximately)\r\nby performing computations on the short sketch?  The workshop will\r\nexplore metric embeddings of sampling spaces with complex structure\r\ninto spaces that are amenable to simpler analysis; space-time\r\ntradeoffs for data structures; and algorithms for analysis of data in\r\nthe streaming model.\r\n\r\nGeographical Information Systems (GIS) are called on to store,\r\ncombine, display, and analyze disparate types of spatially-referenced\r\ndata---locations of telephone poles, streets, rivers, mountains,\r\nbuildings, soil layers, pollution levels, voting districts---for\r\napplications ranging from natural resource management to urban\r\nplanning.  The goal of the proposed workshop is to address the\r\nchallenges in modern GIS by focusing on algorithmic issues encountered\r\nin such systems.\r\n\r\nThe workshops will identify areas for research and focus on future\r\nresearch challenges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nAll workshops will seek a broad impact through a mix of theoretical\r\nresearchers and practitioners and by helping to stimulate\r\ninterdisciplinary collaborations. Theoretical progress on the research\r\ntopics in these workshops will have impact on a wide variety of areas\r\nsuch as health care, homeland security, environmental management,\r\ndisaster management, marketing, bioinformatics, psychology, sociology,\r\nchemometrics, astronomy, and credit card fraud detection.\r\n\r\nA major theme of the project is integration of research and\r\neducation. It is addressed through participation of graduate students\r\nin the workshops, interaction between students and DIMACS visitors\r\nworking in related areas, and tutorial programs organized in each\r\nworkshop.\r\n",
