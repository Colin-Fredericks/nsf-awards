 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports attendance of young participants in the Summer Workshop for Synchrotron Radiation in Biological Research, which will be held at Baton Rouge, Louisiana from June 2-6, 2003. The purpose of this workshop is to introduce biophysical techniques, which utilize powerful X-ray sources to biologists, molecular biologists, geneticists and biochemists. X-rays provide an important tool to study biological molecules, and synchrotrons provide scientists with an exceptionally powerful x-ray source. The workshop will introduce the participants to the theory and practice of techniques that utilize synchrotron radiation in biological research. Speakers at the workshop will describe the different techniques that utilize X-rays to image biological molecules and structures. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to gain first hand experience in the use of these techniques so that they may in the future apply the methods to their specific areas of research.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is open to any scientist wishing to apply the various x-ray imaging techniques to his/her area of research. Special efforts will be made to invite scientists from minority-serving institutions. Because a synchrotron source is a specialized facility, students, post-doctoral associates and principal investigators at many research institutions have little opportunity to survey these techniques. A workshop in the synchotron use will provide the participants with a research exposure they are unable to obtain at their home institutions. Furthermore, once they obtain this expertise they will be able to travel to the various synchrotron facilities to pursue further studies.\r\n",
