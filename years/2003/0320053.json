 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for low-cost home medical monitoring for management of large numbers of patients with chronic diseases.  The research objectives are to demonstrate a new approach to real-time monitoring of vital signs that connects low-cost medical devices to a remote database using existing Cable Networks, a process for accessing and reporting that information, and a system for generating automated alerts based on data values.  The research will focus on creation of a system architecture that will:   (1) support vital sign data transmission by wireless monitoring devices over Cable Networks; (2) collect data in a back-end computer; (3) produce and report alarms for out-of-range and abnormal results; and (4) allow end-users and medical professionals to examine vital sign data from a computer via the Internet.  This project may result in a simple hardware/software prototype that provides continuous monitoring of vital sign inputs and creates automatic alerts for out-of-normal values.  It  will demonstrate whether Cable is a viable means of collecting real-time medical information.  The research will help develop a technology platform that can be applied in other areas such as home energy management, home security, and videoconferencing over cable.\r\n\r\nThis approach to home telemonitoring has significant commercial potential.  Potential end users number in the millions.  Changing revenue structure and demographics provide significant incentives for home health care companies to utilize home telemonitoring.  The relatively low cost of the devices and the use of cable as an information transmission modality allows for creation of a mass market.  The primary customers, cable multimedia service organizations, perceive home telemonitoring as a value-added product that can spur revenue growth. \r\n",
