 "awd_abstract_narration": "Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Interdisciplinary Informatics are sponsored jointly by the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Biological Sciences (BIO) to encourage research and training that cross the traditional disciplinary boundaries between them. These fellowships provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational activities in biology and informatics to a wide range of recent doctoral recipients (biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and others).  It is expected that the Fellows trained through these fellowships will play an important role in training the future workforce. Postdoctoral research and training in informatics will permit junior scientists trained in biology, mathematical, chemical, and physical sciences to play key roles in developing new quantitative tools and methods that will advance informatics in biology and other fields.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Standard functional motifs in biochemical networks.\"  Biochemical data have revealed complex networks of biochemical reactions for many cell functions.  These networks can be interpreted with a modular framework. The goal of this project is to (1) identify standard functional motifs in the E. coli metabolic network, (2) analyze motifs identified, and (3) develop a theory for combining two or more motifs into a larger unit while clarifying the value of a modular description of biochemical networks.\r\n",
