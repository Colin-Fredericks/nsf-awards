 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a better fundamental understanding of the physics and chemistry of solid interfaces that are crucial in modern electronic, magnetic, and photonic devices.  Within the nanoscale environments of these devices, bulk thermodynamic properties no longer apply for predicting stability, and diffusion and kinetic phenomena are not well understood.  In this research project, an innovative approach to establishing a better understanding of interfaces will be developed by concentrating on an advanced thin film fabrication technique, plasma enhanced atomic layer chemical vapor deposition, to produce nanometer scale thin films. The design of dielectric gates or magnetic tunnel junctions and metallic spin valves, optical coatings, diffusion barriers, or interconnect liners can greatly be enhanced using this technology.  The abrupt interfaces that will be produced will permit fundamental physical phenomena such as electron scattering to be examined in significantly more detail.  Deposition of the nanoscale thin films will be monitored using in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, and quartz microbalance techniques. \r\nThe education portion of the work will focus on development of a new undergraduate curriculum in association with a state-of-the-art MEMS microfabrication facility at the University of Alabama.  A diverse research group will be obtained through the recruiting and retaining of minority and under-represented students and teachers through an NSF REU and RET program.  A broad range of devices can potentially be fabricated using this technology.   \r\n",
