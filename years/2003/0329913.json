 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SENSORS proposal integrates research and education to exploit the sensitivity of a new\r\nfamily of LGX crystal devices operated in novel Shear Horizontal Surface Acoustic Wave (SH-SAW)\r\npropagation directions by combining them with highly selective molecular padlock probes to detect\r\nspecific nucleic acid sequences associated with bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella\r\ntyphi, and Vibrio cholerae in aqueous solutions. The anticipated fundamental advances in sensor science\r\nand engineering will be relevant to numerous applications, including rapid response to bioterrorism,\r\nhealthcare, epidemiology, agriculture, food safety, and pollution avoidance and mitigation.\r\nThis SENSORS program builds upon the initial proof-of-concept results provided by an NSF\r\nSGER project funded by the divisions of Electrical and Communication Systems, and Bioengineering and\r\nEnvironmental Systems. The intellectual merit of this proposal rests in the creative, integrated research\r\nand education activities related to combining the recently identified LGX SH-SAW devices with\r\nmolecular padlock probe technology to permit the design, fabrication, testing, and optimization of\r\nprototype biosensors. The specific research objectives of this SENSORS program are to: (i) Identify the\r\nsurface density chemistry for increased sensitivity; (ii) Investigate and identify the optimal LGX SH-SAW\r\norientation and device design for operation with the padlock technology; (iii) Study and develop the\r\nmolecular padlock probe system to operate effectively in conjunction with the LGX SH-SAW device; (iv)\r\nFabricate and test the prototype SH-SAW liquid biosensors; (v) Identify and optimize a procedure for\r\nsensor regeneration; and (vi) Characterize and optimize the sensor's dynamic range and cross-effects due\r\nto temperature and other physical and chemical factors.\r\nThe educational objective of this SENSORS program is to provide a multidisciplinary learning\r\nexperience to students ranging from high school to graduate student level in the area of sensors in general,\r\nand biosensors in particular. Broader impacts will be achieved through the following programs and\r\nactivities to: (i) Train and interact with high school audiences through two major ongoing programs at\r\nUniversity of Maine (UMaine), NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and the GK-12 Sensors;\r\n(ii) Involve undergraduates from Maine and other institutions directly into the research project under the\r\numbrella of the ongoing NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the UMaine;\r\n(iii) Expand existing undergraduate Sensor Technology and Instrumentation and Biochemical Engineering\r\nEngineering courses at the UMaine by adding modules relating to biosensors devices and systems; (iv)\r\nIdentify appropriate Capstone projects for undergraduates involving cross-disciplinary research and design\r\nprojects; (v) Enhance existing graduate level courses Microscale Bioengineering and Design and\r\nFabrication of Acoustic Wave Devices by incorporating research results into the course; (vi) Contribute to\r\nthe new interdisciplinary multi-institutional NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research\r\nTraineeship (IGERT) program in functional genomics, which involves UMaine, the Jackson Laboratory,\r\nand the Maine Medical Center Research Institute; (vi) Provide a experimental and/or theoretical thesis\r\ntopics for Masters and Ph.D. students; (vii) Disseminate the research and educational material on a project\r\nwebsite, and through conferences and printed literature.\r\nThe SENSORS project proposed here is designed to result in tangible research and educational\r\nbenefits. It will provide a knowledge base critical to creation of the next generation of biosensors for\r\nsingle unit production and future integration into arrays. It also seeks to establish a model program\r\nwhereby cross-disciplinary education is integrated with a state-of-the-art research program, providing a\r\nrich learning experience for students ranging from high school to graduate student level. Finally, the\r\nproject will help to strengthen US research and educational capabilities in an area of high technology that\r\ncurrently is in need of highly trained industry and academic professionals.",
