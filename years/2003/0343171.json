 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will fund department level reform the manufacturing program at the University of Cincinnati.  The approach is to place students in a virtual corporate setting, where classes are linked to job functions and the curriculum becomes a form of job rotation exposing students to traditional theory with links to practical applications. The central hypothesis and of the proposed activities is that a virtual manufacturing corporation can unify and energize the curricula motivating students and faculty to learn, provide a mechanism for addressing industry wants and needs, and can be marketed to K-12 students and teachers.\r\n\r\nIn this planning project, the goal is to restructure the entire manufacturing curriculum so\r\nthat it can be mapped into a virtual corporate structure supported by an information technology\r\nbased integration mechanism. A corporate oversight panel will be established, along with a\r\nframework for eliciting and integrating corporate and K-12 suggestions and feedback, taking\r\nadvantage of the existing Co-Op program. Finally, evaluation and accountability guidelines will\r\nbe developed along with activities to prepare other faculty members for strategy implementation.\r\n",
