 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funding for the development of manufacturing equipment that will incorporate the laser-based and welding-based deposition processes with multi-axis computer numerical controlled machining.  Specifically, this award funds the acquisition of an automatic welding torch changer, a two-axis rotary table, and a PC-based motion controller.  These items, along with already existing hardware components at the Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing, such as: a Nd:YAG laser of 1 kW in power, a four-axis computer numerical controlled machining center, a six-axis robot, two powder feeders, and two computer controlled welding machines,  together make multi-fabrication manufacturing equipment capable of building an entirely new class of components of monolithic or functionally graded composition. The equipment will be capable of fabricating parts that are characterized by complex internal and external geometrical features, as well as by high dimensional accuracy and good surface quality.  Additionally, this award supports the development of an information system that automates and coordinates the exchange of information between all of the involved elements of this equipment.  This information processing system consists of a number of modules, such as: solid data exchange module, adaptive slicing module, process planning module, process sensing and control module, and a module for the automatic generation of path planning for welding torches, laser head, and cutting tools.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will enhance the research, training, and educational capabilities at Southern Methodist University's Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing in the area of layered-based manufacturing.  The multi-fabrication system will be an unparalleled candidate for a \"Mobile Part Hospital\" that will contribute to the strengthening of America's military readiness.  The availability of hardware and software both acquired and developed through this project will provide \"hands-on\" experience and research facilities for the undergraduate and graduate students, as well as engineers from local industry.  As the project involves various aspects of engineering science and practice in nontraditional manufacturing processes, welding, design, computer control systems, interfacing, sensing, signal processing, control, and software development, students will be exposed to the related concepts, principles, methods, software and hardware.  This exposure will provide the impetus for addressing more challenging cross-disciplinary manufacturing development problems.  Layered-based manufacturing will become a major graduate thrust of the School of Engineering at Southern Methodist University.\r\n",
