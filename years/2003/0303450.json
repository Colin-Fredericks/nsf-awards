 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summer research program in solid state chemistry for undergraduate students and college faculty provides an interdisciplinary forum for learning about solid state chemistry, including the impact of materials synthesis, development and application on science, technology and society.  It provides opportunities for college students and faculty of U.S. institutions to learn about solid-state chemistry research. Over forty participants attended the summer research program in the last two years. It offered first-hand laboratory experiences to individuals from institutions where an advanced research program in solid-state or materials chemistry is unavailable. Of the forty-one attendees who participated in the 2001 and 2002 programs, eighty percent were from four-year colleges throughout the country. Research laboratories in nearly twenty states jointly host the summer research participants. This education and outreach program in solid state and materials chemistry is enthusiastically endorsed by the solid state chemistry community. \r\n%%%\r\nThere is a significant impact on both students and faculty participating in the program. Undergraduate students doing research are exposed to a wide range of career choices, and college faculty are provided the intellectual tools and experiences needed to develop solid state and materials chemistry curricula at their home institutions\r\n",
