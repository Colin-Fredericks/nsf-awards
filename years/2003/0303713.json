The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twelve month research fellowship within a duration of 36 months by Dr. Cynthia Robin to work with Brian Woodye, Director of Research, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Belize Department of Archaeology in Belmopan, Belize.\r\n\r\nDuring this fellowship, the Pis will undertake a program of archaeological excavations and artifact analysis which will examine the 1800 year history, rise and demise of the ancient Maya farming village of Chan in Belize.  Maya archaeological research traditionally looks at the higher end of society.  This study will focus on the lower strata, the farmers.  Robin will explore and test two models, the traditional primitive peasant model and the small holding farmer model.  This project will provide new insights into the roles and relations of the inhabitants of a pre-Columbian farming village.  This will help us refine our models of the organization of complex societies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the importance of this research, the project will involve training of young Belizean and U.S. archaeologists, introducing them to an international research experience.\r\n",
