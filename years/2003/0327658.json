 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our focus is on the extratropical atmosphere, with special emphasis \r\non the dynamics in highly anisotropic backgrounds, such as is the \r\ncase near the tropopause.  Theoretically, the wave dynamics for a \r\nhighly-anisotropic background atmosphere has been much less studied \r\nthan for the homogeneous and isotropic case.  Yet it is intrinsic \r\nin the atmospheric mixing process that nearly-stepwise environments \r\nform in the atmosphere.  Furthermore, when the anisotropy is in \r\npotential vorticity (PV), the impact on large-scale wave dynamics \r\noccurs at leading order, since Rossby wave propagation depends on \r\nthe presence of PV gradients.  The proposed work focuses on \r\nthe dynamical impact of background anisotropy on cyclone organization, \r\nfrontogenesis, gravity wave emission and the overall atmospheric \r\nenergy spectrum.  The unifying theme is that it is crucial to study \r\nthe whole spectrum of scales simultaneously, from energy injection \r\nat synoptic scales down to dissipation at frontal scales, because \r\nnonlinear interactions affect all scales in between.  Hence, the\r\nlow-frequency variability and predictability of the planetary \r\nscales depend significantly, through nonlinear cascades, on the \r\ndissipative process at the meso- and frontal scales.  A new \r\nclass of dynamical models take specific advantage of jumps in \r\npotential vorticity at a tropopause discontinuity.  Exact- and \r\nhigh-resolution solutions provide a testbed to assess the adequacy \r\nof current operational models in resolving the dynamical anisotropies.  \r\nRecognition of the highly-anisotropic nature of tropospheric \r\ndynamics redirects previous mathematical efforts on isotropic and \r\nhomogeneous turbulence to atmospherically more relevant anisotropic \r\nproblems. \r\n\r\nThe weather over North America is greatly influenced by \r\nthe pattern of winds near the tropopause, a level of sharp\r\nchange in the atmospheric conditions found at an altitude of\r\nroughly 10 km.  Because operational weather models often do \r\nnot have sufficient resolution to accurately describe the \r\natmospheric motions at these heights, our ability to understand, \r\nand thus forecast, the weather and climate throughout the \r\natmosphere is diminished.  An example of one of the many issues \r\nwhich will be investigated is why many of the current climate \r\nmodels show a biased error of colder temperatures near the \r\ntropopause.  The scope of this work seeks to unify the dynamics \r\nof the atmosphere from the largest continental-scale (low pressure) \r\ncells, through their subsequent collapse to intermediate-scale \r\nstorm fronts, and the generation of yet smaller-scale (gravity wave) \r\nturbulence.  The primary focus of new theoretical progress is to  \r\naccount for the important contributions of the tropopause in the \r\nevolution of weather patterns.  The proposed research lies at the \r\nintersection between mathematics and atmospheric science, which \r\nis now possible through the synthesis of the investigators' recent \r\nadvances in tropopause modeling and new results in the numerical \r\ncomputation of the statistics of atmospheric turbulence.  The \r\nanticipated impact of further understanding of how energy in the \r\nlower atmosphere evolves over the full range of thousands down to \r\ntens of kilometers would be the elucidation of currently \r\nunder-resolved features of weather prediction and climate models.",
