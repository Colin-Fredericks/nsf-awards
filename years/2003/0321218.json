 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a scalable and incrementally upgradeable Beowulf cluster system with high-speed connectivity, supports computational experimentation at a RUI institution. The project builds on work led by a group of students who independently created a Beowulf cluster of discarded systems. Creating core facilities for an expanding emphasis on computational science research, this custom cluster system will service problems related to coastal regions. Flexibility (especially in file configuration, scheduling, and processing model) constitutes the primary software and hardware development focus. The National Spill Control School, the Center for Coastal Studies, the Blucher Institute of Geomatics, the Center for Water Supply Studies, and the Center for Bioacoustics are research institutes associated with the university's College of Science and Technology; this work provides support to the local scientists engaged in computational experimentation. The experience of the student developers, combined with the PIs expertise in parallel processing and computational science, will service various research areas; some involve combinatorial optimization problems. Several examples follow.\r\n\tResource scheduling in parallel environment using genetic algorithms\r\n\tMolecular dynamics computer simulation research\r\n\tInfluence of dimensionality on phase transitions, \r\n\tEffect of adsorption in confining and curved geometries \r\n\tSimulating the dynamics of inert gas atoms and alkanes using a Beowulf cluster\r\nMost of the development time will be spent on customized system software and on application support software designed to provide maximum flexibility. The developers will also create process migration control, customized schedulers, loaders, fault and performance monitors, signal handlers, and self-test utilities.\r\n\r\nThe project, originated by the Computer Science Club, not only enhances research programs in the area, but also involves research training in an undergraduate institution. The cluster project is expected to attract more students.\r\n",
