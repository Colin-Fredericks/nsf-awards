 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support the attendance and participation of young faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students at the Microgravity Transport Processes in Fluid, Thermal, Materials, and Biological Sciences Conference in Davos, Switzerland, September 14-19, 2003.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together scientists in the thermal-fluid, materials and biological sciences and provide a forum for the exchange of technical ideas, and explore arenas of interdisciplinary research. The common thread in these different areas of microgravity science is the important area of Transport Phenomena. The expectation is that there will be identification of cross-disciplinary areas where expertise can be shared and healthy new research programs may be developed. The conference is organized so that there are no parallel sessions and all attendees are expected to participate in the different sessions. Each session will open with one invited keynote lecture followed by other papers. In addition, time will be allocated for informal discussions on selected topics that emerge at the conference. This conference has gained international exposure and this aspect is being cultivated by setting up an organizing committee that is made of scientists from United States, Europe, Russia, Italy, Japan and Canada. The travel funds will be used exclusively to support untenured faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and under-represented minorities, including women.  \r\n",
