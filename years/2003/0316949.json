 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference on plant genetics is the first of an annual series of specialized meetings to be sponsored by the American Society of Plant Biology.  The focus of this conference will be on the nature and mechanisms of genetic variation in plants and their relationship to the evolution of plant form and function, as well as on plant speciation and crop domestication.  Concepts of these processes have grown dramatically in recent years as genomic sequencing efforts for several model and crop plant species have advanced.  The conference will bring together speakers working on different organisms, and on different aspects and approaches to the problem, with the aim of achieving a synthesis of understanding to stimulate discussion and further research.  Approximately 250 participants are expected.  The secluded setting and schedule are designed to facilitate ongoing interaction between the presenters and attendees.  All meals will be on-site and the speakers will remain in attendance throughout the entire conference.  Afternoons will be free for recreation, informal discussions and other activities. Participation by graduate students and young postdoctoral fellows is strongly encouraged.  Discounted rates for registration and accommodation will be supported by this award.  Organizers for this year's conference are Dr. Venkatesan Sundaresan of the University of California at Davis and Dr. Rich Jorgensen of the University of Arizona.  Further information is available at the conference website, http://www.aspb.org/meetings/pg-2003/index.cfm\r\n\r\n",
