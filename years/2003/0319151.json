 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance innovative sensing technology to overcome the limitations of a broad range of undeclared airborne toxic industrial chemicals (TIMs) by incorporating a large number of arrays of sensing elements numbering in the 100's or 1000's into a package smaller than a conventional pager, including all data analysis, display, and batteries. In addition, this innovative technology can be applied to metal oxide semiconductors, polymer based sensors or any other sensing material. Large arrays allow much greater breadth as well as sensitivity of electronic nose devices, making them a viable option for low cost, accurate detector or analysis tool for personal air quality monitoring as well as for many industrial applications.  \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications for a low cost, small, rugged, simple and accurate sensor, capable of detecting a wide variety of chemicals, range from personal air quality monitoring to the food and beverage industry; from the medical field to military units; from permanent sensor installations (similar to smoke detectors) in hazardous areas to installation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's). The instrument can be used to analyze a patient's breath to diagnose diseases or on a battle field to detect chemical warfare agents and can be used in the rapid development and analysis of new sensing elements. Because the technology is very similar to current standard manufacturing techniques, the units can be produced in mass for small per unit price, and sold in a variety of markets.  \r\n",
