 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry, an annual conference for the discussion of topics that span bioorganic chemistry to gas-phase reactions, will be convened for the next three years. Although the range of topics is wide, all focus on the methodology used by physical organic chemists. Attendance will be limited to about twenty persons, all of whom present informal talks on new, unpublished results. Conferences will be held at remote sites in order to minimize distractions and encourage informal discussion. Strong efforts will be made to include minorities and females and, in keeping with past tradition, there will be a large number of younger investigators along with some senior investigators.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing meeting of Workshops on Physical Organic Chemistry, which is organized by Professor Jacquelyn Gervay-Hague of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Davis. The workshops will provide opportunities for the generation of new ideas, facilitate collaborations and introduce young investigators to their senior peers. The number of attendees and location of the meetings are designed to facilitate these goals. The workshop benefits the Organic Dynamics Program by identifying new and imaginative research projects and young investigators that will strengthen the Program as new awardees and reviewers.",
