 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the Northern Illinois University (NIU) and University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) groups, requests funds to fully equip a new proton sub-detector for an accelerator-based high-energy physics experiment, the D0 experiment at Fermilab. The Fermilab Tevatron is the world's highest energy collider, and will remain at the energy frontier for much of the decade. The D0 and CDF experiments will lead the U.S. high-energy frontier physics program during this period, and it is important to maximize their capabilities. The D0 experiment is a large international collaboration that has significantly advanced the understanding of particle physics through the discovery of the top quark and via a broad range of Standard Model tests and new phenomena searches. One of the new and most surprising results from Tevatron Run I was the existence of large rapidity gaps (regions with no produced particles) between high transverse energy jets.  Improved understanding of this new field of hard diffraction, which probes otherwise inaccessible details of the strong force and vacuum excitation, requires new detectors for tagging and measuring scattered protons. The experience from Run I resulted in the proposal for a new component, the Forward Proton Detector (FPD), to be added to the baseline upgrade of the D0 detector. The FPD consists of momentum spectrometers that make use of accelerator magnets along with points measured on the track of the scattered proton to calculate its momentum and scattering angle. Preliminary results from a partially equipped FPD are very promising and show that the detector is working as designed. The funding of this proposal will allow UTA and NIU to purchase the phototubes and electronics needed to fully equip the FPD and to provide a graduate student to commission and maintain the new detectors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Located at Fermilab, the FPD will be widely accessible to students from more than 60 institutions of higher learning in the U.S. and abroad. The FPD will be an important component of vigorous outreach programs already in place at UTA and NIU. Graduate students will play a critical role in the installation and commissioning of this new detector. The knowledge gained from this experiment will lead to a deeper understanding of the basic forces of nature.\r\n",
