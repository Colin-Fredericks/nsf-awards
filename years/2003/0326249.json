 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve our ability to data mine information \r\npreviously locked in unstructured natural language text.  It focuses on \r\ndeveloping novel statistical models for information extraction and data \r\nmining that have such tight integration that the boundaries between \r\nthem disappear---resulting in a powerful unified framework for \r\nextraction and mining.  Current information extraction methods populate \r\nslots in a database by identifying relevant subsequences of text, but \r\nthey are usually unaware of the emerging patterns and regularities in \r\nthe database. Current data mining methods begin from a populated \r\ndatabase, and they are often unaware of where the data came from, or \r\nits inherent uncertainties.  The result is that the accuracy of both \r\nsuffers, and significant mining of complex text sources is beyond \r\nreach.  This project uses probabilistic graphical models that make \r\nextraction and mining decisions in the same probabilistic currency, \r\nwith a common inference procedure.  Such models promise significant \r\ngains in accuracy and capability, as well as an opportunity for deeper \r\nunderstanding of the role of high-level, top-down patterns in natural \r\nlanguage processing, and the role of low-level, bottom-up language data \r\nin symbolic processing.  The project grounds this work in two \r\nreal-world applications domains: scientific research and government \r\ninformation.  The extraction and mining of large-scale databases in \r\nthese domains will have broad impacts by providing useful, \r\nconstantly-updated Web resources, by enabling insights into government \r\nefficiency and the flow of scientific ideas, and by making databases, \r\nanalyses and source code publicly available.\r\nhttp://kdl.cs.umass.edu/projects/unified-graphical-models.html\r\n",
