 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFEMA's USAR Task Force Deployments: Implications for The Management of\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nThe Urban Search and Rescue taskforces (USAR) sponsored by FEMA are a\r\nkey component of the federal emergency response system. This study\r\nexamines the a. extent to which these taskforces are impacted by known\r\nproblems at search and rescue (SAR) operations, as well as the solutions\r\nthey have developed to these problems, and b. their interaction with law\r\nenforcement agencies, in what has become a critical factor in the\r\nconduct of present day SAR operations. Specifically, the research\r\nanalyzes the relationships among FEMA USAR taskforces and support\r\npersonnel, DoD support personnel, local agencies and state emergency\r\nmanagement offices, other state and regional agencies present during\r\nmajor deployments, law enforcement agencies (FBI, local and state\r\npolice), and volunteers. It also looks at the operation of the emergency\r\nmedical system (EMS) during USAR deployments, particularly the securing\r\nand routing of injured persons and their transportation to medical\r\nfacilities.  The study identifies areas of cooperation and conflict\r\namong these social actors, and changes in SAR operations and their\r\nimpact on organizational culture, information, training, and purpose. \r\nIt also develops an inclusive description of the types of collective\r\nactors that are present during USAR deployments.\r\n\r\nFocus groups from ten USAR taskforces and approximately 100 in-depth\r\ninterviews with representatives from other agencies and groups that\r\nparticipated in nine USAR national deployment sites are done to develop\r\na useful blueprint for local, state, and federal agencies and private\r\norganizations to follow during participation in SAR operations. The\r\nintent is to improve the effectiveness of disaster responses and\r\ncontribute to the social science understanding of the emergent\r\nmulti-organizational SAR system as a form of organized, adaptive crisis\r\nresponse activity.\r\n",
