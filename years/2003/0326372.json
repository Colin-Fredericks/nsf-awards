 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     Embedded systems, for example in information appliances and networked\r\nsensors, face some of the most demanding security concerns - they are resource\r\nconstrained while frequently needing to handle sensitive information in\r\nphysically insecure environments. Security processing can easily overwhelm the\r\nlimited computation and memory resources of embedded processors, especially with\r\nthe escalation in the amount of data to be processed and the data rates of\r\nhigh-speed networks. This \"performance gap\" is compounded by the \"battery gap\",\r\nwhich is the disparity between energy requirements and slow improvements in\r\nbattery technology, for secure low-power embedded systems.\r\n\r\n     This project is an inter-disciplinary study of several core technologies\r\nthat will enable the design of secure, low-power embedded systems.  It spans the\r\nfields of security, cryptographic algorithms, embedded processor architecture,\r\ncomputer arithmetic, low power design, and enabling design methodologies and\r\ntools.  It addresses the performance, energy and security requirements, and\r\ntheir tradeoffs, in embedded processors and systems. The research goals include\r\na comprehensive analysis of the performance requirements and power consumption\r\nfor security in embedded systems. The project is developing efficient architectures\r\nfor security processing in low-power embedded systems, including configurable\r\nsecurity modules for system-on-chip designs, and architectural guidelines for\r\ntiny cryptographic processors for embedded systems.  The performance, power and\r\nsecurity tradeoffs based on customizations at the protocol, cryptographic\r\nalgorithm, and hardware and software implementation levels are studied.  Design\r\nmethodology and tools include processor design tools to facilitate the design of\r\nnew security processing architectures based on open frameworks such as the PLX\r\n(hosted at Princeton) and SimpleScalar toolkits. The project explores\r\ndomain-specific design methodologies that jointly co-design security protocols\r\nand processing architectures to meet the required security, performance and\r\npower priorities and constraints. \r\n\r\n The research enables the design of embedded systems with higher levels of\r\nsecurity, while achieving an order of magnitude or more in performance and\r\nbattery life, compared to conventional approaches.  Broad security impacts are expected for embedded system design, in addition to impact for future research and education.  Results are disseminated to industry through the Princeton Architecture Lab for Multimedia and Security (PALMS) and the NJCST Center for Embedded System-on-a-Chip Design. The research results are being woven into graduate and undergraduate courses.\r\n\r\n",
