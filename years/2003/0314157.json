This project will build on the PI's expertise in high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) concepts to determine the feasibility of a using magnetically enhanced targeted drug delivery as a viable therapeutic tool.  Although a general phenomenological theory to describe the retention of a ferrofluid drop in a flowing stream has been developed, no theoretical work has been doen to explore the limitations of the use of magnetic fields for targeted drug delivery.  The first objective is to determine theoretically the feasibility and limitations of using ferromagnetic wires to locally enhance the force on a drug-containing nanoparticle as it travels through the artery.  Simulations over a wide range of conditions will be explored.  Parameters of interest include wire magnetic properties, wire diameter, fluid velocity, and  blood viscosity.  In terms of the broader impacts, this concept has the potential to target drugs to specific locations, thus reducing overall dosage and reducing potential side effects.  The traditional mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students will also be carried out.  The novelty of this project is to determine the feasibility of using electrically-generated magnetic fields for directing drug delivery.  If successful, the project may lead to a new technique for effectively delivering increased con.centrations of drugs for use in the treatment of cancer, blood clots, and other medical conditions\r\n",
