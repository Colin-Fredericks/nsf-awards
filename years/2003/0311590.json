 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many computational biology problems are NP-hard.  For a large portion of\r\nthese problems, approximation algorithms seem to be improper,\r\nsince either the approximate solutions are too far away from the optimal\r\nor the high computational complexity prevents them from being practical.\r\nAs a result, researchers are forced to use heuristic\r\napproaches.  However, it is likely that important information is\r\nmissed which could otherwise be obtained from exact algorithms.\r\nRecent study has observed that in many\r\nbiological problems, it is possible to identify a parameter that is small in\r\nmost instances.   The notion of fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) was\r\nintroduced which provides feasible exact\r\nalgorithms for intractable problems with small parameters.\r\n\r\nThe FPT framework has not enjoyed widespread success in computational biology\r\nsince most of the research efforts are from people who were originally\r\ncomputer science theoreticians.  Without the participation of biologists,\r\nthe formulations may not be accurate and realistic.\r\nBy employing biologically adequate formulations, computational\r\ntechniques such as FPT stand in a perfect position to bridge the gap between\r\ntheory and practice.  Furthermore, the availability of huge\r\ngenome sequences requires the study of a tighter class of\r\nfixed-parameter algorithms with strictly or nearly linear time.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of the research is to bring FPT techniques\r\ninto mainstream use in computational biology.\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are as follows:\r\n(1) identify important computational biology problems which can be\r\naddressed by the FPT framework;\r\n(2) develop algorithms for these problems, trying to lower the time\r\ncomplexity as much as possible; and\r\n(3) obtain biological data and test the new algorithms on real-life data.\r\nThe research will apply the algorithmic techniques that have\r\nproven to be successful in parameterized computation to solve problems\r\nthat seem intractable but important and realistic in computational\r\nbiology.  The results of the research have the advantages of being\r\nprecise and effective, compared to the traditional approaches such as\r\napproximation and heuristic algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the project:\r\nThe research is highly inter-disciplinary, which involves\r\nheavy collaborations in both computational and life sciences, and\r\nwill provide an excellent educational environment for students\r\nwho have mutual interests in both fields.\r\n",
