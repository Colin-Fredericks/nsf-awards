 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of this proposal are: (a) Development of novel MEMS sensors and techniques to reliably and repeatedly image individual cells/organisms using bio-impedance measurements, (b) Integration of microfluidic sensors into flow-through system to develop a generic identification technique and (c) Understand and analyze the challenges in signal processing enabling differential detection. Research outcomes of this proposal would facilitate the fundamental understanding and optimizing of the science and technology of bio-impedance at a micro scale. The research will establish the fundamental science required to enable the development of a single generic sensor that would be capable to identify cells based on their bio-impedance maps.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Proposed research integrates developments in two research areas (bio-impedance and microfluidics) in a novel approach that will advance the knowledge and understanding in diverse fields, from instrumentation to detection. The research will provide a basis for quantitative diagnosis in diverse environments. This is a major advance across fields. The research team comprises of experts in different areas (microfabrication, microfluidics and systems development -PI, tissue engineering and clinical testing-collaborators) and is uniquely positioned to accomplish the task.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This research will train students in emerging cross-disciplinary areas (microfabrication, electronics, biology and tissue engineering). The research has participation of underrepresented groups (minority, women) and fosters partnerships at a global scale through collaboration and exchange. The results of the research will be widely disseminated through inclusion in courses and modules developed by PI, demonstrations and outreach.\r\n",
