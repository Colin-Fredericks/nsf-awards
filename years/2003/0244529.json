 "awd_abstract_narration": "Golubitsky\r\n0244529\r\n     A coupled cell system can be described by a collection of\r\nindividual interacting differential equations.  Cell systems are\r\nused as models in a variety of applications such as neuronal\r\nnetworks, speciation, arrays of Josephson junctions, and gene\r\ndynamics.  In this Focused Research Group (FRG) project, the\r\ninvestigators develop a mathematical theory for coupled cell\r\nsystems and with colleagues explore implications of that theory\r\nin applications.  The network architecture is a graph that shows\r\nthe couplings between cells and which cells and couplings are\r\nidentical.  Symmetries in the network architecture have been used\r\npreviously to explore certain properties of solutions to cell\r\nsystems, such as synchrony or traveling waves.  Symmetry, however,\r\napplies directly only to the most regular of networks.  For a\r\nlarger class of coupled cell networks, local symmetries defined\r\non part of the network can replace symmetries as a predictor of\r\ninteresting and important dynamics.  These local symmetries form\r\na groupoid and it is this groupoid structure that is used to\r\nanalyze properties of solutions and transitions between solutions\r\nin coupled cell systems.  The investigators and students develop\r\na theory of robust synchrony and investigate synchrony-breaking\r\nbifurcations in coupled cell systems (for example, network\r\narchitecture often forces Takens-Bogdanov singularities to occur\r\nin codimension one at such bifurcations).  They also investigate\r\nthe consequences for coupled cell systems of particular features\r\nof the internal equations of single cells, such as symmetries and\r\nfast/slow variables.\r\n     Symmetry and symmetry-breaking have been used widely by\r\nscientists and mathematicians to investigate a variety of\r\nphysically and biologically interesting topics, including\r\nimportant types of fluid flows, crystal lattices, the existence\r\nof elementary particles, and the characteristic markings of the\r\nskins of tigers and leopards.  The crucial feature of this\r\napproach is that it is model-independent in the sense that in\r\nappropriate situations symmetry permits the development of a menu\r\nof possible outcomes and the physics or chemistry or biology\r\nchooses from this menu.  Indeed, the theory of coupled cell\r\nsystems with symmetry has been applied succesfully to the\r\nanalysis of different gaits in animals, pattern formation in the\r\nvisual cortex, and speciation.  Relaxing the requirement that the\r\nnetwork under consideration has symmetries extends the\r\napplicability of this approach to a wider range of problems, in\r\nparticular to models of gene networks, as well as other network\r\nmodels from neuroscience.  In these applications it is rare that\r\nthe exact model equations are known.  It is therefore important\r\nto develop mathematical tools that study model-independent\r\nfeatures of solutions, tools that focus on solution properties\r\nthat are determined by the general structure of the equations\r\n(such as network architecture) rather than by the details of the\r\nequations.  This approach will benefit researchers outside of\r\nmathematics by describing a menu of possible dynamics that a\r\nnetwork can be expected to exhibit.\r\n\r\n",
