 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida's Museum of Natural History, Center for Precollegiate Education  and Training, College of Education, Center for Women's Studies and Gender Research, and  Departments of Environmental Engineering Sciences and Zoology, will team with the School  Board of Alachua Country to promote science and engineering careers by placing graduate  students into classrooms to implement inquiry-based modules on Ecosystem Health and  Sustainability.  The target will be middle schools in Alachua County with large populations of  students from populations underrepresented in science and engineering.  Graduate students in  Zoology and Environmental Engineering Sciences will be paired with teachers.  As a team,  they will participate in a summer institute and a workshop to learn and discuss pedagogy  associated with inquiry-based learning, to review state and national science standards, and to  decide upon specific topics that meet the needs of individual classrooms and take advantage  of team members' expertise.  Graduate Fellows and teachers will design and modify modules  focused on Ecosystem Health and Sustainability. These modules will specifically address  national and state science standards, and will stress hands-on exploration of environmental  \"mysteries\".  Experimentation, data collection, analysis, and interpretation of results will be  stressed.  Projects will have immediate relevance to the students' lives and will be posted on a  website.  All classrooms participating in the project will be furnished with computers and  technical support to facilitate this web-based communication.  After testing and refinement,  modules will be made widely available through summer training workshops, in which kits for  implementation of modules will be provided free of charge.  Modules and complete  instructions will also be made available and widely advertised on the web.  To provide mentoring, Graduate Fellows will select from a menu of options for  working individually or in small groups with students.  Likewise, middle school students will  become role models for peers and younger children by participating in already-established  science programs designed to provide opportunities for sharing scientific learning.      Specifically, the program aims to:  o foster middle school students' desire to pursue careers in science, technology,  engineering and mathematics, especially within underrepresented groups.  o provide support and preparation for Graduate Fellows to pursue a career in education.  o improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics curricula in the public  schools while addressing state and federal standards. \r\n\r\nProject Title:  Science Partners in Inquiry-based Collaborative Education  (S.P.I.C.E.)    \r\nInstitution:  University of Florida\r\nPI/Co-PI:  Douglas Level, Jean Andino, Betty Camp, Roberta Harbrucker, Mary Jo Koroly\r\nPartner School Districts: Alachua County\r\nFinancing: $1,445,013\r\nNumber of fellows per year: 9 graduate\r\nSetting:  Rural \r\nTarget audience of the project: Middle School\r\nNSF supported disciplines involved: Science and Engineering  \r\n",
