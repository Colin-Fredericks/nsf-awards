The meeting will bring together researchers from a wide variety\r\nof backgrounds, perspectives, disciplines, types of institutions, career stages, and demographics.\r\nThe program, including all speakers and discussion leaders has been confirmed.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth Gordon Research Conference on the Earth's Interior. The previous three have\r\nbeen remarkably successful as documented by evaluations required by the GRC organization.\r\nGordon Research Conferences provide a unique setting for the exchange of scientific ideas in\r\nwhich the opportunities for formal and informal discussion are optimized. The conferences are\r\nadministered through a central office in Rhode Island, which takes no overhead; the conference\r\ninfrastructure leaves the conference organizers free to focus on the content of the meeting.\r\nBroader Impacts. The requested funds would be used to encourage and support the participation\r\nof young scientists who might not otherwise be able to attend including graduate students and post-doctoral\r\nfellows. The conference is a wonderful educational opportunity for this group, not only\r\nfor the formal presentations, but for the chances to interact informally with leaders in the field, and\r\nto present their own work in the form of posters. NSF support of previous conferences on the\r\nInterior of the Earth have helped tremendously to facility a diverse group of attendees.",
