 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University will acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas such as the structure and dynamics of molecules and the chemistry of materials, including species as diverse as metal oxides, metal borides, metal chalcogenides, cluster-based nanostructures and extended metal-organic pi-systems.  Other projects which will benefit include the characterization of solid state products of hydrothermal reactions, the characterization of thin film samples, and the identification of the products from the removal of solvent and interstitial or interlamellar components from layered and open framework materials.  Specifically, researchers will use the instrument to carry out bulk analyses of samples, identify temperature-dependent phase changes, identify the degree of crystallinity in polymers, and explore the preffered orientation of such materials.\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially materials chemistry.  The instrument will also be used for formal instruction in the Chemistry and Earth Sciences Departments at Syracuse University. \r\n",
