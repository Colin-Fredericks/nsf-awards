The current proposal will support\r\nthe development of the mathematics behind these methods and the solution\r\nof several combinatorial questions that have been motivated from economic\r\nproblems, including: (1) the development of new combinatorial fixed point\r\ntheorems, (2) associated simplicial algorithms, and (3) the study of\r\nminimal triangulations and minimal simplicial covers of polytopes.  \r\nBroader impacts of the proposed work include its interdisciplinary\r\napplication to negotiation support for group decision making, and the\r\nactive participation and training of undergraduates in the proposed\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nInformally speaking, a \"fair division\" problem is concerned with finding\r\nmethods for dividing a set of goods among players in such a way that\r\neveryone can be satisfied according to some notion of fairness.  This\r\ntopic is of interest to economists, political scientists, and game\r\ntheorists, and it often motivates interesting mathematical questions.  \r\nThe set of possible solutions in such problems is often a polyhedron of\r\nhigh dimension (a polytope), and one can usually find a solution by\r\nbreaking the polytope into many pieces (tetrahedra), and walking around\r\nthe polytope in a way that is guided by player preferences.  Thus the\r\nmathematics of how polytopes can be built up from its tetrahedral building\r\nblocks using ideas from three areas (combinatorics, topology, and discrete\r\ngeometry) will have direct application to important problems in the social\r\nsciences involving human strategy and decision making.\r\n\r\nThis award is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical  Sciences and the Directorate of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Science as part of the Mathematics Sciences Priority Area.\r\n",
