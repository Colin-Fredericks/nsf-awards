 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, tunable piezoelectric resonator concepts will be explored for use in frequency control and electromechanical filter applications.  The centerpiece of the research is a technique for tuning piezoelectric resonators through the use of shunt capacitance.  This concept can be particularly useful in applications in which mechanical resonators are used as frequency sources (including electronics and radio frequency communications applications) and in electromechanical filtering.  In order to fully exploit increasing the resonator frequency, maximizing the tuning range and quality factor, and understanding the temperature-frequency characteristics of the resonator.  This proposal presents a three-year research plan to address these and other issues.  The impact of the research will be made through the generation and dissemination of knowledge that will be pertinent to the frequency control community.  The research will also have impact through the training of students.  In addition to graduate students, undergraduate and high school students will involved in the project through a new diversity initiative at the University of Pittsburgh called the Pitt Engineering Career Access Program.",
