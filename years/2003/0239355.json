Many people's lives would be improved by easy and fast access of information through the internet. Providing low-cost and fast information access for more people all over the world has great global impact on education and quality of life  through  programs  like  distant  learning. The most  promising  technology  for  achieving  this goal  is wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in optical communications. Most fiber optic systems deployed today are constructed from  rather  large  discrete  components,  requiring many  fiber-coupling  connections  that  are  inherently  expensive, large and introduce losses. So far, it has been difficult to miniaturize devices for coupling, sorting, and multiplexing of light. It is expected that integrated chip-scale WDM devices can provide lower weight, more reliability, smaller size and less sensitivity to electromagnetic interference. It further eliminates the need for labor-intensive alignment of discrete optical devices. To implement integrated chip-scale WDM modules, there is an urgent need to integrate discrete devices into a unified platform. In this research the PI seeks to use photonic crystals (PCs) as such a platform. The  possibility  of  completely  designing  electromagnetic  modes  in  photonic  crystals  devices  makes  them  the excellent  candidates  for  designing  integrated WDM devices.  Furthermore,  the  existence  of  the  photonic  bandgap eliminates  long  tails  of  evanescent  fields  that  usually  cause  crosstalk  between  WDM  channels  in  normal  slab waveguides. \r\n \r\nIn this proposal he uses PC waveguides, PC cavities, and PC superprisms  to perform the three major functionalities requires  in  WDM,  i.e.,  guiding,  filtering,  and  multiplexing/demultiplexing.  Currently  these  PC  devices  are  not optimized. There is no systematic method for designing these devices. He will develop these systematic methods in PC devices by optimally designing and controlling their electromagnetic modes. Furthermore, I will develop techniques required for optimal coupling of these devices to integrate them in the form of WDM devices. His research includes both theoretical and experimental investigation of PC structures. The major research tasks are summarized below.  Although  aimed  at  a  single  target,  each  component  of  the  effort  provides  considerable  understanding  of  photonic crystal structures that are valuable in a variety of other applications.  \r\n \r\n1) The development of fast and efficient three-dimensional analysis tools which will allow us to design and optimize specific linear and nonlinear optical properties of the photonic crystals.  \r\n2)  The  development  of  a  systematic  method  for  dispersion  engineering  in  photonic  crystal  devices,  especially superprisms, waveguides, and cavities using the simulation tool developed in \r\npart 1. \r\n3) Optimization of coupling between discrete photonic crystal devices in order to integrate them to perform WDM functionalities  \r\n \r\nThe  proposed  research  has  considerable  impact  both  at  the  basic  science  level  and  at  the  application  level.  It provides a complete understanding of PC waveguides, cavities, and superprisms as well as a systematic method to design these devices. At the application level, it can have a global impact by realizing chip-scale integrated WDM. The type of devices developed in this research can be used in other information processing applications, especially in biosensors. Combined with the small size and perforated structure of photonic crystals, these devices can be used in very small biosensors that and will enable in vivo sensors, nanosensors to swallow, spectrometers on a needle, etc. \r\n \r\nOn  the  education  side,  this  CAREER  plan  provides  an  excellent  educational  benefit  for  students.  The  ability  to analyze, model and optimize PC structures as well as hands-on lab work in fabrication and characterization of actual WDM  devices  allow  students  to  obtain  experience  in modeling,  fabrication,  and measurement  techniques.  Three graduate  and  several  undergraduate  students will  be  trained  this way  to  help  accommodate  the  huge  demand  in industry  for  experts  in  nanotechnology  and  optical  engineering.  Providing  K-12  and  minority  students  with  the opportunity  of  learning  some  basics  of  optical  systems  as well  as  involving  teachers  (with  help  from NSF's RET program) are other aspects of this CAREER plan.  He also plan to develop a graduate level course entitled Introduction to photonic crystal devices, and to add some material on state-of-the-art WDM to the existing graduate level course, Fiber  Optics  networks,  that  has  not  been  taught  for  a  few  years.   He will  also  improve  the  undergraduate  course, Lasers and Applications. The PI will also write one book on Photonic Crystal Optical Waveguides. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
