 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased awareness of power concerns and recent approaches to improve\r\nenergy efficiency and heat dissipation in computer systems have not\r\nimmediately translated into rich, adaptable, power-aware applications.\r\nThis lack of effectiveness is particularly evident in power-aware\r\nreal-time computing, where efforts to bridge the gap between hardware\r\nand software have generally been limited to developing new schedulers\r\nthat operate by modulating a relatively high-level hardware control\r\nsuch as voltage scaling and frequency scaling.  The problem with this\r\napproach is that the hardware controls operate at too gross a level to\r\nbe effective in dynamic, poorly-modeled application scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a feedback-based, control-theoretic approach to\r\noptimize and balance, at runtime, power consumption and real-time\r\nperformance.  This approach not only integrates hardware-level\r\npower-management techniques with real-time and quality-of-service\r\n(QoS) constraints, but also integrates a range of hardware\r\npower-management techniques at different granularities into a unified\r\nframework that allows better task-level control of power management.\r\nThis enables finer control of power/performance tradeoffs by the\r\noperating system, and permits applications to dynamically adjust the\r\nsystem's and chip's power-saving configuration on a per-task basis to\r\nmeet specific performance requirements while reducing power\r\nconsumption.  With the new functionality provided by this project, a\r\nricher class of power-aware applications can be developed to provide\r\nvaluable user experiences in next-generation, real-time environments.\r\nThe project specifically focuses the requirements of web server\r\nfarms where energy and cooling costs are substantial and where the web\r\nservices provide differentiated levels of QoS, thus motivating a\r\npower-aware framework that balances performance, QoS requirements, and\r\nenergy costs.",
