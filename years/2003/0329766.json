 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPopulating our world with networks of sensors requires fundamental understanding of tech-\r\nniques for connecting and managing sensor nodes with a communication network in scalable\r\nand resource-e .cient ways.The proposed research involves a comprehensive program of sensor\r\nnetwork architecture,design,evaluation,and implementation that integrates research expertise\r\nin the areas of wireless networking and multiuser communications and provides numerous op-\r\nportunities for enhancing student research and education in the area of sensor networks,at both\r\nundergraduate and graduate levels.\r\nThe dominant trend in sensor network practice is to consider a dense collection of tiny sensor\r\nnodes with limited computation and communication capabilities,all connected via a .at,or\r\nad hoc,wireless network.Yet theoretical studies in multiuser communications suggest that\r\nsubstantially improved performance can be obtained through sophisticated coordination among\r\nnodes,requiring more versatile radios,hierarchy,and perhaps even sparse wired connectivity.\r\nThus,the objectives of the proposed research are to:1)identify network architectures that\r\npermit the implementation of sophisticated transmission schemes that have been theoretically\r\nstudied,2)analyze such schemes in the context of sensor networks and design new ones adopting\r\na cross-layer approach and 3)implement these schemes and verify their behavior on a real\r\ntestbed.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the improved understanding of an important\r\nemerging class of wireless networks,and in the attempt to unite theory and practice.Clos-\r\ning the widening gap between theoretically proposed strategies and practically implemented\r\nones is crucial to understanding and improving the performance and lifetime of these resource-\r\nconstrained networks.Through a rigorous analytic approach,contributions to the emerging area\r\nof network information theory are expected,leading to substantial advances in energy-e .cient\r\nand delay-constrained protocol design.\r\nThe broader impact is manifested in part through an e .ort to integrate teaching and research.\r\nExperimentation on a hardware platform plays an integral role in both research and education.\r\nIt will be used for veri .cation,as well as for undergraduate and graduate projects that provide\r\nstudents with hands-on experience in a real sensor network testbed.This project will enable\r\nthe acquisition of the necessary hardware.Two newly developed graduate courses on multiuser\r\ncommunications and wireless networking will bene .t greatly from this project.It is anticipated\r\nthat by such close linking,research and education cross-fertilize each other within the framework\r\nof this proposal.Further,since the proposed architectures and related issues carry over to other\r\nimportant classes of networks,the .ndings from this research will have an impact on a much\r\nbroader class of wireless networks,including multihop cellular networks,that may soon become\r\nsigni .cant for a major part of our society.The broader impact will also be felt through a broad\r\ndissemination of results and through current and future interactions with other universities.\r\nA-1",
