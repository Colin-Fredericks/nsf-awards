MI techniques will be employed to detect toxic organophosphorous chemical agents using semiconductor nanoparticles (CdS, CdSe, and ZnS), dendrimers of polybenzylphenyl ethers, and electroactive monomers in a three component cross-linking methodology. These materials will be imprinted as films and monoliths and the sensing efficiency evaluated using electrochemical, evanescent wave, acoustic, and fiber optic sensor formats. Quantum dots will have optical, electrochemical, and luminescent properties sensitive to the binding of chemical agents. The dendrimers will enhance the imprinting methodology by forming high surface area and porous cavities as chemical recognition elements. Electroactive polymers will allow controlled cross-linking, selective hydrophobicity, and electrochemical transport control in these materials. It will also influence the photochemical and electrochemical properties of the quantum dots. Combinatorial methods will be used to control composition and target increased specificity, sensitivity, detection limits, and reliability for sensors. Quantitative specific and non-specific binding studies will be made to determine kinetics, mass transport, pre-concentration effects, and equilibration to properly address sensor figures of merit. In terms of the broader impacts, societal benefits should result from protection from chemical agent threats, improved security, and pollution monitoring. The training of students and interaction with academic, military, and industrial collaborators will also result.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
