 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0300034 of Savage\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is an investigation of fundamental questions\r\ninvolving the structure of combinatorial families and relationships\r\nbetween families with intrinsically different characterizations.\r\nThe first part concerns partitions and compositions constrained by linear \r\ninequalities.  Recent research has shown this framework to provide a common \r\nsetting for many partition identities. It has produced surprising connections\r\nwith families defined by rank conditions, by forbidden parts, and by difference \r\nconditions.  The PI seeks to identify the families that can be characterized in\r\nthis way, the partition statistics that can be captured, and the new insight \r\nthat might be gained.  The second part of the research studies identities\r\nof the Rogers-Ramanujan type. There has been a growing recognition of the \r\nimportance of these identities in statistical physics and\r\nLie algebra and, as a result, an explosion of research uncovering new \r\nidentities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type.  Nevertheless, these identities \r\nare still not well understood combinatorially.  The PI investigates new tools \r\nto analyze the combinatorial aspects.  The third part of the project \r\nfocuses on structure in partially ordered sets, specifically, symmetric chain\r\ndecompositions.  This extends recent work of the PI and colleagues that used \r\nsymmetric chain decompositions to solve an open geometric question about \r\nthe existence of symmetric Venn diagrams.  It pursues a new approach to the \r\noutstanding open question of the existence of symmetric chain decomposition\r\nin certain important posets.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics is the mathematics used to investigate, analyze, and manipulate\r\nstructured data sets:  the pages of the world-wide web, the nucleotides \r\nforming DNA, the customers in a telephone network, or the configuration of\r\nsubatomic particles in the nucleus of atoms. Combinatorics underlies critical\r\ncomputer algorithms for retrieving information, for designing  \r\ncommunication networks, for encrypting transactions, and for sequencing DNA. \r\nIt is of economic and strategic importance to have a scientific workforce \r\nwith expertise in this critical area, which has yet to enter the traditional \r\npublic school curriculum.  The investigator of this project is committed \r\nto the training and involvement of students in all aspects of the research.  \r\nIt is the nature of the work that the compelling open questions attract \r\nstudents at both the undegraduate and graduate level, many of whom\r\nhave made substantial contributions in previous projects with this P.I.\r\nThe results of this project will be useful to other areas of mathematics, \r\nsuch as ordered sets and representation theory of Lie groups, to the study \r\nof the statistical behavior of bosons and fermions in lasers and \r\nsuperconductors, and to the visualization of data in statistics.\r\n",
