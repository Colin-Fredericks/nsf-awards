 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) will launch an initiative called Animal Health for the Environment And Development (AHEAD) within the context of the IUCN World Parks Congress to be held in Durban, South Africa in September 2003. With AHEAD's initial focus on East and southern Africa and its key protected areas, buffer zones, corridors and transboundary visions, this venue is particularly timely. The theme of this World Parks Congress, a gathering that only occurs approximately once every ten years, is Benefits Beyond Boundaries. The participants will include regional (Eastern and southern Africa) and other world-renowned scientists to participate in the two-day forum. Fifty-five participants are anticipated, and will include a mix of experts from both basic  and applied science fields, all recognized by their peers as leaders in their fields. The symposium will focus on concrete deliverables in terms of addressing the ecological impacts of infectious disease, including a plan for follow-on action in the management and research arenas. Catalyzing real world change for the better is of course very important, and the goal of this workshop.   \r\n\r\nAnimal and human health issues represent a neglected sector of critical importance to  the long-term ecological and sociopolitical security of protected areas around the world and costs US authorities millions of dollars to manage. These issues merit more proactive attention in and around many of the world's protected areas than they have gotten to date. Finding solutions to these issues is  a multifaceted and complex process and requires sound basic and applied science as well as input from leading practitioners in the field- an iterative process that the proposed forum has a unique opportunity to catalyze.\r\n",
