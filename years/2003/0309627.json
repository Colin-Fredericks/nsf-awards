Understanding this deposit's origin is critical for developing new exploration models. This project will determine the origin of garnet- and gahnite-rich rocks in and adjacent to deposits in the Broken Hill and Olary Domains of the Curnamona Province. Field mapping will be used to determine the stratigraphic and structural relationships of these rocks to mineralization. This work will be supplemented by ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb geochronology, and major- and trace-element studies of garnet and gahnite using electron microprobe and laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer analyses.  \r\n\r\nThe project will enhance infrastructure for research and education by supporting collaboration of US and Australian government agencies, universities, and mining industry. It will also support graduate and undergraduate students, and allow them to acquire knowledge for careers involving mineral deposits in academia, industry or the government. Furthermore, geochemical and geochronological data derived from the study will be incorporated into databases made available to the public through the NSF-sponsored Geosciences Network (GEON) and the chronostratigraphic database initiative currently under development (CHRONOS). \r\n\r\n",
