 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to complete the research and continue the writing of a book examining science, technology and urban environmental policy in the twentieth century.  Specifically, it aims to incorporate an explicit examination of science and technology, as well as public reactions to specific technical proposals, into a comprehensive study of urban environmental politics.  This addition will yield a more complete analysis of important changes in twentieth century urban environmental policy.  The project focuses on the decades around World War II because this period is generally neglected by historians of urban politics and technology, and yet is formative in the history of the modern American city.  The study uses six case studies from Los Angeles' history -- air pollution, flooding, coastal erosion and pollution, water supply, hydroelectric power development, and offshore and urban petroleum production -- because this city faced an unusual range of environmental problems, and yet is widely considered the prototypical twentieth-century American city. \r\nThe activities funded by the grant will use the methods of history of science and technology, specifically the analysis of technical reports prepared for Los Angeles and collaboration with technical experts, to evaluate the merits of the proposals for Los Angeles' environmental problems.  The grant also emphasizes the use of cultural history to examine popular media for evidence of the public's understanding of and response to Los Angeles' environmental policy problems.   \r\n \tThis project is unique because it places science and engineering in their broader political and social contexts, and integrates the technical with the historical.  The study will explain technical issues in clear, lay terms, and will analyze how communities used this technical information to devise effective policy.  The project considers voters' reactions to Los Angeles' problems, as well as the impact that scientists and engineers had on the political process.  Few histories of technology, environment or cities, combine the systematic study of technology with a thorough discussion of political decision-making.  Fewer still consider the popular reaction in the political process. \r\n \tThis research will augment the incorporation of research findings into classroom teaching.  The funded work has particular significance for teaching of future primary and secondary educators, and for ongoing collaboration with public high school teachers by encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to both history and science.  The work proposed will create a book as a model of interdisciplinary study for historians of various specialties and approaches.  It will also explain how scientific development, technical experts, interest groups, public reaction, and federal and local agencies all interacted in the development of public policy in a case-study form familiar and accessible to modern policy analysts. \r\n\r\n",
