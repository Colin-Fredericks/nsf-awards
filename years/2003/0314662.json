 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to operate the Core Project Office (CPO) of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, a component of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). IGAC's goal is to promote and facilitate international atmospheric chemistry research that will lead to a better understanding of the Earth System. IGAC seeks to provide an international framework for planning and implementing scientific activities in atmospheric chemistry to address these issues, particularly when they demand human, technological, or monetary resources beyond the capacity of single nations. IGAC also seeks to serve as a vehicle for coordination of various U.S. national programs with relevant national and regional programs in other countries in order to focus attention and resources on key problems in atmospheric chemistry at regional and global scales. Functions of the IGAC CPO include: (1) project administration: a fundamental function of the CPO is to provide administrative support for Project leadership in their task of overseeing execution of the Project; and (2) communications: a key task of the CPO is to act as the communications nerve center for the Project by ensuring an effective channel for communicating information about the Project and its scientific results to the broader scientific and other client communities. This project is supported jointly by NSF, NASA, and NOAA.",
