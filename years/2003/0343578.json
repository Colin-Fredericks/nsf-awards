 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this Phase I IERI proposal is to investigate the feasibility of scaling the knowledge base on the effective teaching of reading comprehension in a manner that is accessible, reflective of the complex nature of this instruction, focused on advancing students understanding of general and domain-specific informational text, and informed by a theory of learning consistent with the task at hand. Despite recent reading initiatives, students in the upper elementary grades are not sufficiently prepared to interpret and learn from informational text, precluding full attainment of reading competence and interfering with their ability to learn from subject matter text. This is particularly the case for poor urban youth. The most likely explanation for this situation is the absence of opportunities for students to learn how to comprehend text, reflecting teachers uncertainty about how to teach reading comprehension, especially with respect to supporting learning in subject matter areas with ambitious educational goals.\r\nParadoxically, there is a significant and robust knowledge base regarding effective reading comprehension instruction. The challenge is to represent and disseminate this knowledge base effectively and powerfully. The intervention we propose integrates the resources accumulated by three programs of comprehension research with strong evidentiary bases (Reciprocal Teaching, Questioning the Author, and Guided Inquiry supporting Multiple Literacies). Specifically, we propose to conduct controlled experiments in which we compare two models of professional development. One model, informed by cognitive flexibility theory, features the use of hypermedia-based videocases, while the second features the same information, presented via traditional video-based cases. In addition to supporting teachers learning of the targeted instructional techniques, the content of these cases will address assessment, individual differences, teacher mediation, and text- and domain-specific (to science) comprehension instruction.\r\nIn each year of the proposed project, participants include 60 teachers from 30 schools (1500 students), randomly assigned to one of two conditions. SES data for targeted districts indicate that students qualifying for free- or reduced-cost lunch range from 12% to 66%; and ethnicity data indicate that 7%, 51%, and 75% of the students in the targeted districts are African-American, while the remainder are principally White. Measures of teacher knowledge/beliefs/orientations and practice, as well as student measures of general and domain specific reading achievement will be collected to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the effects of using hypermedia-based videocases versus traditional video-based cases on the development of teachers knowledge/beliefs regarding reading comprehension instruction; (2) What are the relative effects of these tools on teachers reading comprehension instruction practices; (3) What are the relative effects on students comprehension of general and specific subject matter text, measured by standardized assessments; And (4) How are outcomes mediated by teacher characteristics (e.g., knowledge, self-efficacy), student characteristics (demographics, achievement), and features of school and policy contexts that relate to successful buy-in. Throughout the study, a central focus is on identifying features of successful professional development that are scalable.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
