Weinstein, Lucent Technologies\r\n\r\nTitle: Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Photonic Microstructures\r\n\r\nABSTRACT \r\n\r\n*********** Use text below this line *******************\r\n\r\nPhotonic microstructures are heterogeneous optical media. Technologically important examples include (a) photonic crystal fibers, and (b) periodic planar structures with defects; applications range from transmission media and devices in telecommunication systems to optical computers. The optical properties of such structures depend in complex ways on the details of the microstructure. At present, direct numerical simulation is the main tool for analyzing the performance of a photonic structure.  This tool is inadequate, because while simulation can be applied to specific structures, it does not provide general principles to guide the design of better structures. The research between New York and Lucent Technologies will develop and analyze new, homogenization-based methods for understanding the characteristics of photonic structures.  These methods will provide improved intuition about how a structure's geometry determines its overall optical properties (group velocity, dispersion, resonances, radiation rates, etc.) They will also lead to improved numerical schemes for computing the spectral properties of photonic structures.\r\n\r\nThere is a large physics and engineering literature on photonic microstructures and their applications -- which include optical fibers and devices for use in data transmission and computing.  The design and analysis of such structures relies mainly on intuition, experimentation, and computer simulation. The  research between New York and Lucent Technologies will employ mathematical analysis to provide new sources of intuition and improved techniques for simulation -- leading, we hope, to the design of improved photonic microstructures and devices. This GOALI cooperative activity\r\nbetween New York University and Lucent Technologies will provide a postdoctoral researcher with valuable industrial experience.\r\n\r\n",
