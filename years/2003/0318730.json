 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a workshop on remote monitoring and maintenance of machine tool systems.  Invitees will include machine tool builders, control suppliers, users, academicians and representatives of several government agencies.  They will discuss the emerging needs and barriers to progress, and make recommendations on needed capabilities of manufacturing equipment to maintain processing consistency, improved techniques to monitor, diagnose and self-adjustment, integration of compensation and diagnostic features into legacy machine tools, health monitoring of the machine tool systems, and capabilities for prediction of component failures.  Major needs in metrology, standards, control systems, monitoring systems and sensors will be outlined and reported as a result of the workshop.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits of this workshop will be a roadmap for the machine tool community on strategies to be taken during following years,   a launch platform for comprehensive research and development programs oriented toward bringing solutions to measure performance, and improve the accuracy and reliability of machine tools.  United States machine tool builders, users and customers in particular, and manufacturing industry at large, will benefit from the results of this workshop by learning more about the hidden and vital effects of unexpected downtime, countermeasures including remote monitoring, predictive technologies and intelligent maintenance practices.  Young engineers as well as students will have an opportunity to face the real challenges of the manufacturing industry at the early stages of their career for their professional preparation.",
