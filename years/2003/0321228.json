 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the acquisition of a rapid prototyping machine, a coordinate measuring machine, a three-dimensional digital scanner, and a five-axis numerically controlled machine.  It will provide the lab facilities for the participating faculty to conduct research in reverse engineering, design and manufacturing integration, rapid modeling of geographic information systems, design of compliant mechanisms, photoelastic and experimental stress analysis, and finite element analysis of advanced microstructures.   It will also be used in developing micro and nano machine tools, new graduate and undergraduate course contents and design projects, education programs in art design and manufacturing, outreach programs for k-12 and minority students, and service to local industries.  Faculty from five academic departments in the College of Engineering, College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Education will be the primary users of the facilities.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the state-of-the-art facilities will greatly enhance ongoing research and broaden the institution's capacity to develop new projects.  It will enhance the undergraduate and graduate programs through new course contents and exposure to new manufacturing technology.  The availability of the new lab facilities will also enhance the ability to retain and recruit quality students for advanced studies and thus strengthen the graduate program.  With the new facilities, the university will have a better capacity to serve the regional industrial community and the resulting industrial projects will offer students an integrated research and education experience through real-life engineering projects.  The participation of the Earth Science Department and the Appalachian Center for Crafts, which have the mission to revitalize the economy and cultural tradition in the Appalachian area, adds additional dimensions to the application of the equipment.  The use of the facilities in K-12 and minority outreach programs will attract high school students and minorities to enter engineering and science careers.",
