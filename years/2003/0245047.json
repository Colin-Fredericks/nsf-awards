These lecture will\r\nfocus on two of the most important open questions in the fields of\r\ntopology and group theory.  The first question, the Poincare\r\nConjecture, was posed by Henri Poincare almost 100 years ago.  It is\r\nconcerned with the basic structure of very simple 3-dimensional\r\nspaces; while the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture is about algebraic\r\nstructures, and is very relevant to the Poincare Conjecture.  In\r\naddition to a survey of existing approaches, partial results and open\r\nquestions related to these conjectures, these talks will attempt to\r\ndescribe some intriguing similarities and differences between the two\r\nconjectures.  In addition, 10 leading experts from around the world\r\nwill deliver talks about their own work.\r\n\r\nThis conference will be the 28th annual Arkansas Spring Lecture\r\nSeries.  The format of the lecture series is 5 one hour talks by a\r\nworld leading mathematician, accompanied by about 10 lectures of\r\ninvited experts, and several shorter talks by a variety of people,\r\nincluding graduate students.  This structure is valuable, particularly\r\nfor younger researchers, that get an excellent learning opportunity.\r\nThis year's Lecture Series is about 3-dimensional topology. The\r\nimportance of low dimensional topology has been growing in recent\r\ntears, with numerous applications starting at robotics and control,\r\nand ending with theoretical physics and cosmology.  For example, one\r\nintriguing question is what the shape of the Universe is.  The\r\nspherical shape of the earth was discovered two millennia ago, and yet\r\nwe have no clue as to the shape of the Universe.  The work of\r\nProfessor Casson as well as other leading mathematician, may help\r\nanswer this question by leading astronomers is the right direction,\r\nand helping design the right experiments to answer these questions.\r\nJeff Weeks, a McArthur Fellow, will discuss such experiments in a\r\nlecture open to the public and using a language accessible to all.\r\nThis will give the public an opportunity to understand the work of\r\nworld leading mathematicians.  Jeff Weeks talk should have great\r\neducational value in motivating younger students to enjoy basic\r\nresearch.\r\n",
