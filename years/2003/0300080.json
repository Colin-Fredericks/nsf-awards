 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laskowski is continuing his research into model theory.  In the \r\nfirst set of problems he investigates several distinct combinatorial \r\nsituations that arise in different contexts, including recursive \r\nmodel theory and classification theory.  In each of these situations \r\na definable group is known to be present as well as an action of the \r\ngroup on the combinatorial configuration.  Laskowski will continue \r\nhis investigations into what specific properties such a group must \r\npossess.  As the group is acting on the configuration, such results \r\nwould immediately yield restrictions on the complexity of the \r\nconfiguration. In many different settings, Laskowski has been able \r\nto apply some of the tools from Descriptive Set Theory to answer \r\nquestions in model theory, primarily for theories in a countable \r\nlanguage.  Recent developments give him hope that the Main Gap for \r\nomega1-saturated models is within reach.  A third problem is to \r\ncontinue his investigations into the algebraic underpinnings of \r\nvarious fuzzy logics.  Specifically, he is aiming for a sharp bound \r\non the computational complexity of determining which sentences are \r\nlogically valid in various fuzzy logic systems. By building on previous \r\nresults, this question is cast in terms of various embedding questions \r\nbetween certain ordered abelian semigroups.\r\n\r\nModel theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., \r\nsets of sentences in a very formal language) and classes of algebraic \r\nstructures (models).  As one strengthens the theory, the class of models \r\nof the theory decreases.  In particular, some theories are strong enough \r\nto obviate specific configurations from appearing in any model of the theory.  \r\nMuch of Laskowski's prior research to date, as well as much of the proposed \r\nresearch, concerns understanding the mechanisms by which this elimination can \r\noccur.  Fuzzy logics have been useful in computer science and operations \r\nresearch for some time, but only recently have significant attempts been \r\nmade to provide a firm mathematical basis for them.  Laskowski and his \r\ngraduate students have recently made progress in this regard, and the \r\ninvestigator will continue working in this area.\r\n",
