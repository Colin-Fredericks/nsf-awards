 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species are considered fundamental units in plant and animal communities.  The major biological question in this project is whether species are also fundamental units of communities of microorganisms.  This question is hotly debated.  Although microorganisms reproduce asexually they have several mechanisms for exchanging genetic material.  If this \"horizontal gene transfer\" among microorganisms is rampant and promiscuous, it might be necessary to conceptualize microbial species quite differently from species of plants and animals.  The question will be addressed by evaluating the hypothesis, based on evolutionary theory, that genetically distinct individuals are grouped into ecologically distinct populations that exhibit properties of species -- they express unique sets of genes, occupy unique niches and are irreversibly separate in their evolution.  A well-studied hot spring microbial mat community in Yellowstone National Park and its predominating cyanobacterial populations are the targets of investigation.  Genomic sequencing methods will be used to investigate genetic variation among mat cyanobacteria.  Population genetics and evolutionary simulation methods will be used to evaluate whether these variants can be grouped into putative ecologically specialized populations with the properties of species.  Microarray methods will be used to examine which genes in cyanobacterial genomes are highly expressed in the mat.  The distribution of allelic variants of highly expressed genes should correlate with the distribution of putative ecological populations if the theory is correct.  The discovery of genetically separable ecological microbial populations will broadly impact thinking in microbial evolution, systematics, ecology and physiology and will unify evolutionary principles across the breadth of size and complexity among organisms.   \r\n\r\nThe team is a balance of young and established, male and female investigators from geographically and demographically diverse institutions.  The research integrates principles from evolutionary biology with techniques derived from the fields of microbial ecology, microbial physiology and genomics, providing a cross-training opportunity that will help fill the chasms separating these fields.  Participants will share their disciplinary perspectives with each other and the scientific community through a workshop series that will lead to web-based learning modules.  Since the microbial community under investigation is in Yellowstone Park, there will be numerous opportunities for interaction with the park's trained informal educators.  Preparation of new educational resources (e.g., resource manual for educating seasonal rangers and park managers, signage, trail guides, websites and exhibits for a new Visitor Education Center) will help millions of annual visitors, young and old, change the way they think about microorganisms. A central project website (http://landresources.montana.edu/FIBR) will (i) describe the project, (ii) link to other websites that will present genomic and microarray data, research tools and educational products, and (iii) interpret all results in the context of project objectives.\r\n",
