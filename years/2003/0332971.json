 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbes are responsible for many processes that are vital to biosphere function.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) Microbial Observatories (MO) program supports integrative studies that explore novel microorganisms, their interactions in consortia and communities, and aspects of their physiology, biochemistry and genomics in relationship to the processes that they carry out in the environment.  Investigators funded through the MO program use a variety of molecular biology and microbiology techniques to directly examine microbial communities.  This work has resulted in the discovery of novel microbial lineages, increased our understanding of the complexity and diversity of microbial communities, and helped to link microbial taxa to critical ecosystem processes in a wide variety of natural environments, ranging from the extremes of Antarctic lakes or Yellowstone hot springs to more ubiquitous environments such as agricultural and forest soils, and marine or freshwater systems.\r\n\r\nA scientific workshop that brings together researchers funded through the MO program is proposed as a means to 1) share new findings and ideas on sampling, new methods, database linkages, environmental genomics and metagenomics, and synthesis; 2) identify specific, formal ways that MO activities can be coordinated nationally over the long term; and 3) explore ideas and directions for the future of microbial life research.  The specific objective of this work is to discuss ways to link activities of Microbial Observatories projects through a coordinated network that will build synthesis and synergy between all MOs. In addition to the MO-funded researchers, postdoctoral associates who are currently funded through the NSF Microbial Biology postdoctoral program, including underrepresented minorities in science, have been invited to attend this workshop.\r\n",
