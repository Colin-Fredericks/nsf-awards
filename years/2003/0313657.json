 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is in the photochemical introduction of oxygen into organic substrates in zeolites using two approaches.  In the first approach a viologen electron-transfer sensitizer will be used to activate unsaturated substrates towards reaction with either triplet oxygen or superoxide.  Several viologens with different reduction potentials will be studied in order to understand the factors that influence the viability and reaction efficiencies.  In addition, the use of novel atropisomers of viologens will be used to determine the feasibility of enantioselective photooxygenations.  In the second approach singlet oxygen sensitizers will be used to conduct intrazeolitic singlet oxygen reactions with both alkene and sulfide substrates.  New mechanistic tools such as oxygen tracer and trapping experiments will be developed in order to understand these intrazeolite singlet oxygen reactions.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Edward Clennan of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming, Laramie.  Professor Clennan will focus his research on the development of new ways to introduce oxygen into hydrocarbons, which is of great interest to the agricultural, pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries.  Chemistry students at the graduate and post-doctoral level will be trained in Professor Clennan's lab.\r\n\r\n",
