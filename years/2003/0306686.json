The first \r\nproposed project is building a model to simulate ``tree shaped'' objects \r\nin nature, and apply it to optimal mass transportation problems. The \r\nproblems proposed here include building a transport theory of \r\nrectifiable varifolds, finding connections of this model with other \r\nproblems, and extending this theory to more general spaces. The second \r\nproject concerns minimal surfaces that live in singular spaces such as \r\nsingular complex projective varieties under their intersection homology \r\ngroups. In his thesis, the PI gave a rectifiable currents' version of \r\nintersection homology theory on stratified subanalytic pseudomanifolds. \r\nHe showed that there exists a modified mass minimizer (which is a \r\nrectifiable current) in every intersection homology class. The \r\nassociated mass minimizers turn out to be almost minimal currents. The \r\nmass minimizers the PI considered may intersect (in a controlled \r\nfashion) the singular locus of the singular space. In this proposal, the \r\nPI will continue his investigation on regularity properties of the \r\nassociated mass minimizers, and possible link with Hodge theory. One of \r\nthe main methods used in both projects is geometric measure theory.\r\n   \r\nThe phenomenon of ``tree shaped'' path is very common in nature. Trees, \r\nrailways, airlines, lightning, the circulatory system, and neural \r\nnetworks are common examples. The research of optimal ``tree shaped'' \r\npath not only expands the research area of mass transportation, but also \r\nof both theoretical and applied interest. Biologists are currently \r\nlooking for a model to give a fundamental explanation for biological \r\nscaling laws which are mathematical expressions of how organisms' \r\nbiology varies with their size. The model proposed in this research \r\nmight be the desired one. As Monge's mass transport problem is strongly \r\nlinked with many areas of mathematics, especially with partial \r\ndifferential equations, it is also possible that this new approach of \r\nmass transportation will find its applications in economics, biology, \r\nimage processing and some other subjects. Soap films are physical model \r\nfor minimal surfaces. These surfaces play an important role as a tool in \r\nthe study of  topology, geometry and physics. The research of the second \r\nproject concerns global properties of soap films that live in more \r\ngeneral singular spaces and possible links to Hodge theory and optimal \r\nmass transportation. It might provides some hint to the famous Hodge \r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n",
