 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the electronic collection, storage, and retrieval of data becomes an ever more pervasive part of modern life, there is an associated need for increased Information Assurance (IA) awareness and expertise in order to secure evolving systems. This project leverages the Information Assurance expertise of Purdue University to build a framework in Alaska that will address the IA needs of the academic, commercial, legal, and law enforcement communities. The initial focus is aimed at determining the current level of IA awareness and needs in the state. The project then continues to develop the UAF- IA curriculum specifically tailored to fit the learning needs of the state's geographically diverse population with an emphasis on distance education. Results of the project will include a statement of the current IA awareness and needs level in the state, a new IA curriculum, and development towards and application for the Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) certification for UAF. A secondary goal of this proposal is to further develop the capacity of Purdue University to meet the needs for computer forensics expertise. Purdue University is benchmarking an undergraduate computer forensics course offered at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks; Purdue University is also developing and pilot testing a computer forensics course at the undergraduate level.",
