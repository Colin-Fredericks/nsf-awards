 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has three main projects.  The first, with Harold Widom, is to \r\nstudy the connection between the ``Airy process'' and integrable differential\r\nequations.  The Airy process is a stochastic process that is expected to \r\ndescribe a wide class of growth processes.  The distribution function for the\r\nAiry process at one single time is the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution \r\nfunction.  In this case the distribution function is represented as either a \r\nFredholm determinant of a certain operator (the ``Airy kernel'') or in terms \r\nof a solution to a certain nonlinear ordinary differential equation called \r\nPainleve II.  The finite-dimensional distribution functions for the Airy \r\nprocess (at many different times) are also expressible as  Fredholm \r\ndeterminants of an integral operator (the ``extended Airy kernel'').  The \r\ngoal is to find the corresponding integrable differential equations and to use \r\nthese differential equations to analyze the Airy process.  The second project,\r\nagain with Widom, is to complete earlier work on the asymptotics of \r\nsolutions to the periodic Toda equations by determining the asymptotics \r\non what are called the ``critical curves.''  The third major project,  with \r\ngraduate student Momar Dieng, is to find explicit Painleve type \r\nrepresentations for the distribution function for the next-largest, next-next \r\nlargest, etc. eigenvalues in the random matrix models GOE and GSE.  \r\nThese distribution functions will have applications to statistics. If time \r\npermits certain combinatorial sums involving Hall-Littlewood symmetric \r\nfunctions will be analyzed.\r\n\r\nThe famous bell-shaped curve, known more formally as the Gaussian \r\ndistribution function, is well-known due to its many applications in the\r\nsocial sciences, the physical and biological sciences, and engineering.  \r\nMathematicians in the early part of the twentieth century gave precise \r\nconditions under which  one can expect to find the Gaussian distribution.  \r\nIt is now common in these disciplines to apply these conditions (``sums of \r\nindependent random variables'') to predict the appearance of the Gaussian \r\ndistribution.  When  these conditions fail and we are dealing with strongly \r\ndependent random variables, we cannot expect to see the Gaussian.  \r\nQuite remarkably it has been realized in recent years that the distribution \r\nfunctions of the largest eigenvalues in various random matrix models \r\ndescribe new universal laws for a wide variety of problems appearing in\r\ncombinatorics, growth processes, random tilings, queuing theory, the \r\nanalysis of large data sets (``principal component analysis'') as well as \r\napplications to the physics of quantum dots.  These distribution functions, \r\nknown as the Tracy-Widom distribution functions, are now realized in \r\nterms of a time dependent process called the Airy process. (The  Airy \r\nprocess plays the same role as Brownian motion does to the Gaussian \r\ndistribution.)  One of the goals of this project is to find differential \r\nequations that characterize the Airy process.  These differential equations\r\nwill facilitate analysis of the Airy process much in the same way that the \r\nordinary differential equation (Painleve II) has aided in the description of \r\nthe Tracy-Widom distribution functions.  A second project is to go beyond \r\nthe largest eigenvalue distribution functions and to consider, for example, \r\nthe next-largest eigenvalue distribution functions for a class of models \r\ncalled GOE and GSE.  The GOE case is  particularly relevant to \r\nmultivariate statistics and these additional distribution functions can be \r\nexpected to find applications to problems involving large data sets.  \r\n\r\n",
