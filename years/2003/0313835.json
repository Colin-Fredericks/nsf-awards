 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary goal of the Information Security Institute (ISI) is to produce graduates with comprehensive information technology foundations in conjunction with a robust understanding of the international, political, legal, and managerial ramifications of the range of issues needed to assume leadership positions in government and industry relevant to the pervasive and critical roles played by Information Security & Assurance (IS&A) in society. The health/medical federal information infrastructure represents a critical application domain for the IS&A technologies. The Information Security Institute in conjunction with the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University can address this need via the Masters of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) program by providing a graduate educational experience comprised of relevant courses integrated with research/development projects that serve as preparation for guidance of public health policy and practices. The graduation of MSSI students well qualified to assume leadership roles in the federal public health sectors has significant short-term impact, and from a broader perspective would represent the availability of a proven, successful model for other health-related educational institutions to adopt in order to similarly address this critical infrastructure need. Within Johns Hopkins University, the success of the program justifies considerable expansion, including enhancement of the support of the participation of underrepresented groups, development of part-time and on-line venues, and cultivation of innovative educational government/industry partnerships.",
