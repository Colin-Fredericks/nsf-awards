 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will investigate a technology for combining nanosized particulate or fiber reinforcements with a photocurable thermoset matrix resin in order to produce functionally graded composites.  The investigation will focus on optical components filled with nano-phase ceramic particles that form gradient refractive index lenses.  The technology involves using a Solid Freeform Fabrication ink-jet deposition process to form the composites, with a goal of demonstrating the fabrication of flat lenses.  The ink-jet deposition process to be developed has the advantage of incorporating nano-reinforcements into a low viscosity matrix resin that is relatively easy to process and rapidly photocures to produce functional polymeric parts.  It also has the advantage that major modifications in the basic processing methodology are not necessary.  Part of the research will be devoted to the development of advanced computer design procedures that specify the exact material deposition patterns that need to be employed in order to optimize the performance of the lens. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will demonstrate a new technology for the fabrication of optical lenses at possibly much lower costs than afforded by conventional technologies.  This will demonstrate a new level of control over the production of functionally graded materials, and it will contribute to the technology of computer aided design.",
