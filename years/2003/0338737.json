 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) monitoring is an important tool in the\r\nassignment of frequency bands and in the reduction of harmful interference between users. In the\r\npast, a major source of man-made interference was from automobile ignition. Now a major\r\nsource of man-made interference is from electronic devices, digital answering machines,\r\ncomputers etc. Communication devices like cellular phones, and wireless computer networks are\r\nrelative new comers and are making efficient use of the spectrum using Code Division Multiple\r\nAccess (CDMA) with power control to maximize capacity with the minimum transmitter power.\r\nThese devices generate a spread spectrum which cannot be easily distinguished from Gaussian\r\nnoise without knowledge of the code to de-spread the signal. Another source of noise-like signals\r\ncomes from the new digital television transmitters. In order to avoid harmful interference and\r\nminimize the elevation of the noise level in the environment, it is important to monitor the level\r\nof this noise. The natural environmental noise for frequencies between 500 MHz and 20 GHz\r\nconsists mainly of about 300 K from the ground, 3K from the cosmic background, and about 5 to\r\n30 K from the atmosphere. In the radio astronomy bands and other itreceive onlyle bands, it is\r\nimportant to prevent any increase in the noise temperature while measurement of the noise\r\ntemperature in other bands can be useful information needed to optimize the efficient use of the\r\nspectrum for various applications including radio astronomy and wireless communications.\r\nMIT Haystack Observatory proposes to develop a monitor to measure the interference levels in\r\nthe frequency range 30 to 1500 MHz, calibrated to provide the output metric in units of degrees\r\nKelvin, and with sufficient sensitivity to be able to quantify, to a level of a few degrees Kelvin,\r\nthe unwanted noise in the protected receive-only bands like those for radio astronomy, remote\r\nsensing, and deep space bands. This supports the joint initiative between the NSF and the FCC.\r\nIn phase 1, the proposers plan to study receiver and calibration designs needed to provide the sensitivity\r\nand accuracy without significant internal inter-modulation, spurious responses and spurious\r\nsignals. In this phase they will also set specifications for the design based upon preliminary\r\nmeasurements, using currently available equipment, of the RFI environment at the MIT Haystack\r\nObservatory, in Westford, MA. In phase 2 we propose to prototype the interference temperature\r\nmonitor and test the design at Haystack. In phase 3 we propose to conduct tests of the system at a\r\nfew locations in the Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire area. In the future, depending\r\non the results, such a monitoring system could be replicated elsewhere to gather a data set to\r\ncharacterize the RFI environment at other locations.\r\nBroader Impact: Through this project, the proposers aim to enhance the awareness of the properties of\r\nradio wave technology and its various applications such as radio astronomy and wireless\r\ncommunications, as well as the radio frequency interference environment. Thus, a simple RFI\r\nmonitoring system will be developed for use in pre-college educational settings to acquaint\r\nstudents and teachers with the measurement techniques of radio wave signals and the\r\nenvironment around their schools and towns. Such data could be inter-compared using the\r\nInternet, and Haystack Observatory will develop web-based educational materials to introduce the\r\nstudy of radio waves and their various applications. In particular, the proposers will arrange for the\r\ndeployment of simple radio receivers and antennas, available commercially, to local area schools\r\naround the Observatory to engage students in RFI measurements. A collaboration with students\r\nand teachers in Australia, as part of the Australian SEARFE project will be promoted to enhance\r\ninternational networking on this topic. A project with local area teachers as part of NSF's\r\nprogram 'Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)' at Haystack Observatory is starting in\r\nsummer 2003 to initiate this activity.",
