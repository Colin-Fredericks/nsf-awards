 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award entails collaborative research between the University of South Florida and Rowan University to develop a methodology for three-dimensional quantitative characterization of particle morphology, as well as to examine the effect of particle shape and angularity on the mechanical response of geomaterials.  New methods for three-dimensional characterization and imaging of particles are proposed.  Recent innovations in geotechnical particle shape identification in two dimensions, supported by emerging technologies in digital image analysis, shape recognition, and object reconstruction will be adapted to map the three-dimensional shapes of particles.  Quantitative measures for particle morphologies in three dimensions will also be introduced.   A link will be established between 2D and 3D particle shapes through digital image analysis and pattern recognition.  A digital library of particle shapes will be made available online to the scientific community.  Methods and algorithms recently developed by the PIs to model angular particle shapes in 2D will be extended to 3D, and the particle geometries obtained using the 3D image analysis will be incorporated within a Discrete Element Method (DEM) code.  The influence of particle shape on dilatancy and steady state shear strength will be evaluated through experimental measurements and DEM simulations.  The advantages and limitations of the new techniques will be assessed accordingly.  The proposed research will involve several undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions.  In addition, teachers will be engaged in developing modular exercises for middle and high school students through institutional RETs. This alone will be greatly beneficial to the large fraction of the population.",
