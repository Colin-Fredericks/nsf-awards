 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Robert Whallon, Eugene Morin will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue to analyze faunal material from Saint-Cesaire and Quincay, two sites located in southwestern France documenting the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition (roughly between 40,000 and 32,000 BP), an episode corresponding, according to many, to the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans. Numerous changes, biological as well as cultural, occurred during this short time period. In its cultural dimension, most notable are the emergence of art and bone technology, an increase of stylistic patterning, and the diversification and standardization of stone tools. \r\n\r\nUsing a set of material predictions based largely on fauna, the research examines and tests the presumed replacement of Neanderthals in Western Europe. Given the low productivity of the environment in southwestern France during this time period, the incursion of early modern humans into an area already occupied by Neanderthals would have increased the local population far beyond the carrying capacity of the environment and led to overpopulation. Based on this argument, it is suggested that the Neanderthals redefined their ecological niche in order to avoid direct competition with modern humans. This would be reflected, in a predictable manner, in archaeological faunal assemblages. Two types of comparisons are carried out to test this hypothesis. First, we should observe a decline, as a result of the modern human incursion, of high caloric return species (e.g. large herbivores) in late Neanderthal assemblages as well as more efficient utilization of carcasses and, possibly an increase in scavenging. In sum, compared to early modern human faunal assemblages, late Neanderthal assemblages should be characterized by significant subsistence stress. Saint-Cesaire and Quincay are ideal sites to conduct a detailed study of Neanderthal and modern human adaptation since the latter have been carefully excavated and because animal bone is well preserved.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to a better understanding of human origins, especially in regard of the interaction between the social, demographic, and economic aspects involved in the migration of a population. At the general level, this project will deepen the anthropological study of hunter-gatherers and add to our body of knowledge on speciation processes in human evolution. In trying to strictly test a hypothesis derived from the replacement model, this kind of study has great potential to contribute in resolving the debates on the nature of the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition since its assumptions and bridging arguments are clearly exposed and tested.\r\n\r\nThe grant will also contribute significantly to training a very promising young scientist.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n",
