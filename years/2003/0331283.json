 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breathing in many animals involves a rhythmic cycle of motor activity that can be modulated in its duration, intervals, and amplitude.  Analysis of this vital biological function of ventilation has been enhanced by contributions from theoretical and computational scientists, modeling potential interactions among neurons, muscles, cardiovascular effects, and biomechanics of the components involved in breathing, in a range of animals. Since 1978 the triennial Oxford Conference on Modeling and Control of Breathing has offered a unique forum for respiratory physiologists, neurobiologists and modelers to exchange ideas and present their latest findings in understanding mechanisms of control of rhythmic breathing.  This celebrated tradition has come of age in the current post-genomic era, where the intrinsic complexity of the respiratory system from genes to behavior calls for a concerted deployment of modeling and experimental approaches to elucidate mechanisms of respiratory control at the molecular, cellular and system levels. This time the conference emphasizes a synergy between experimental and modeling approaches, adding a new attention to integrating this 'post-genomic' perspective into understanding respiratory control. The format maximizes interactions between workers from different fields by providing a common forum for presentation and discussion of submitted contributions. The talks include work on mammals other than humans and rodents, and even include invertebrates. \r\n   The potential impact of this conference is high in fostering needed communication between experimentalists and quantitative modelers, including theoretical and computational aspects with physiology and behavior. The conference proceedings will be published in a peer-reviewed volume to make results available to others interested in the broader fields of motor control, robotics, bioengineering, and comparative physiology. This conference will have an impact on raising the interest and visibility of young investigators in respiratory physiology and computational neuroscience, and it seems likely lead to new kinds of collaborative interdisciplinary interactions. Funding from NSF will help students, postdocs, and young researchers without access to other funding to attend the conference.\r\n \r\n",
