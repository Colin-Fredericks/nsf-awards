The idea is to offer both a mini-symposium on what went wrong in the recent horrible experience with energy markets, including California's deregulation and collapse of Enron.  \r\n  \r\nFinancial institutions and markets are among the most rapidly growing part of the service sector of the economy, and the associated modeling and analysis activity, known collectively as \"financial engineering\" is a growing area of research which is highly mathematical and well suited to the skills and backgrounds of the operations research community.  This workshop has the potential to reveal major flaws in present thinking and opportunities for new research. \r\n",
