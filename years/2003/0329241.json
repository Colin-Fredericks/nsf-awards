 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applying Multiple-Instance Learning to Content-Based Image Retrieval\r\n\r\nWith the development of the web, there has been an explosion in the volume of both textual\r\nand digital media.  Effective use of that information requires efficient technology for\r\nlocating relevant material.  Algorithms for textual search, such as string matching for\r\nkeyword searches, are well understood.  However, effective techniques to retrieve images\r\nbased on semantic content need to be developed.  Manual keyword annotation is not feasible\r\ndue to the size of the image repositories, the rich contents of the images, and the\r\nsubjectivity of human perception.  This project applies new segmentation methods and\r\nmultiple-instance learning, a new machine learning technique, to the image search\r\nproblem.  The research activities promise to enable effective image search in which a user\r\nprovide an example of a desired image and indicates which of a small number of candidate\r\nimages are desirable.  Unlike existing content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems, this\r\nproject uses multiple-instance learning to automatically determine which portion(s) of the\r\nimage are important to the user.  Just as textual search technology has revolutionized the\r\nway people search for textual information, efficient image retrieval based on semantic\r\ncontent has the potential for large productivity gains in the way people work with images,\r\nincluding better utilization of the increasing volume of information available as images,\r\nwith accompanying economic benefits.  Undergraduate and graduate students will receive\r\ntraining through independent research experiences, classroom presentations, and course\r\nfinal projects.  The PI will encourage more women to study computer science through\r\ninteractions with high school women through the outreach activities of Washington\r\nUniversity's Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and through interaction with college women\r\nthrough mentoring activities of SWE.  Dissemination of the research results will be\r\nthrough conference presentations and papers, journal publications.  Also papers and\r\nsoftware will made available at www.cs.wustl.edu/~sg.",
