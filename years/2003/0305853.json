Sophisticated methods using algebra, primarily\r\ngroups, were developed to describe and explain such concepts.\r\nString theory is an area of theoretical physics which is \r\ncurrently the best candidate for solving the greatest puzzle\r\nof modern physics, namely unification of gravity with the other\r\nforces of nature. The fundamental idea of string theory is that \r\nvery small particles may not be `dots', but $1$-dimensional \r\nobjects (`strings'). The present project focuses on connections \r\nbetween algebraic topology and string theory. While physicists \r\nknow about the fact that topology is connected to the phenomenology \r\nof strings, the present project explores connections of a new \r\nnature. Notably, algebraic topology is needed in making the \r\nconcepts of string theory mathematically rigorous, which in turn \r\nis a necessary step toward possibly using such concepts for \r\nscientific prediction. On the other hand, string theory\r\nsuggests exciting new methods for algebraic topology, which \r\nwill also be explored in this project.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will continue to work on using string theory to \r\nconstruct mathematical models for elliptic cohomology.  He will \r\nalso consider extending these methods to finding generalized\r\ncohomology theories related to D-branes and M-theory. In the process,\r\nhe will work on mathematical theories which will serve as\r\naxiomatic systems for fundamental and extended objects of string\r\ntheory. Many aspects of this project are joint work with Po Hu.\r\n",
