This proposal proposes a procedure for constructing controllers that limit and route information flow in a network of AUVs.  Particular attention is paid to the objectives of maximizing throughput and bandwidth efficiency while minimizing power consumption.  The proposed research intends to (i) Create a mathematical model for facilitating analytical study of communication problems for a network of AUVs, (ii) Adopt a receding horizon control approach to obtain a piecewise continuous optimal controller for the communication network, and (iii) Testing and evaluating of the obtained results.\r\n\r\nThe major merits of this proposed research effort include (i) Addressing a fundamental challenge in distributed and co-operative control for a group of underwater vehicles, (ii) Creating a rigorous mathematical model for facilitating analytical study of communication problems for a network of AUVs rather than simply performing experimental study.  The results of this research effort will broadly impact not only the successful operation of a network of AUVs, but also different areas of science and society.  The outcome of the proposed research will be genetic. It can be applied to other engineering systems that can be modeled by differential and difference equations.  Therefore, the proposed research will significantly enhance our general understanding about dynamics and control of a distributed complex system, and will have a specific impact to the U.S. Navy in terms of their Future Naval Capabilities in research and development.\r\n",
