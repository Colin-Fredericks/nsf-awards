The School will be held at the new Center for Instrumentation, located at the University of Michoacan San Nicolas de Hidalgo (UMSNH) in Morelia, Mexico. Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the U. of Wisconsin, Madison, together with Professor Luis Villasenor, Director of the Institute of Physics at UMSNH, the goal of this first workshop is to encourage instrumentation skills by developing country physicists at their home institutions, and to foster collaboration between U.S. physicists at an early stage in their careers with their peers from elsewhere in the world.  It is expected that this first workshop will lead to a regular series of workshops/schools at the new Center for Instrumentation, which will provide researchers from the hemisphere with instrumentation skills useful for particle, nuclear, medical and other subdisciplines of physics\r\n",
