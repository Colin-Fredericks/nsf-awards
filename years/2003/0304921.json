 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference THERMEC 2003 is planned for Madrid, Spain in July, 2003. Three earlier THERMEC conferences were held in Japan (1988), Australia (1997) and United States (2000). As a result of resounding success of the LasVegas-2000-conference, and demand by researchers around the globe, the 2003-conference is planned on cutting-edge materials research with emphasis on processing, properties, fabrication, and applications of advanced materials. Around 12 scientific organizations from various parts of the world are co-sponsors of the conference. The conference covers a wide variety of materials topics including nanocrystalline, bio and eco materials as well as thin films and coatings. Other materials topics include light metals (Al, Mg, Ti), steels, composites, bulk amorphous materials, superalloys, coatings along with Residual Stresses, Textures, Severe Plastic Deformation, etc. About 28 keynote and 450 oral presentations are expected to be made with participation from 35 countries. The proceedings will be published by Trans Tech in the form of Materials Science Forum periodical series in 3 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe support is directed toward assisting graduate students in attending the meeting for travel and/or meeting registration. This will avail an opportunity to a number of US graduate students in materials science in various academic institutions to get an exposure to the latest developments and excitements in this area. As in the earlier conferences, a committee of three people will be involved in the selection process. ENG/DMII is co-funding the current request.\r\n",
