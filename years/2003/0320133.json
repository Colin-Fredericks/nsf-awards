 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to increase the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region who achieve higher education degrees in computer science, computer technology, and engineering. The target audience is high achieving high school students; marginal high school students who demonstrate an exceptional interest in the science, math or engineering fields; adult learners who are already enrolled in programs at the college; and returning adult students who have been away from science, engineering, or mathematics studies for several years.  \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives include increasing participation and retention of academically talented, low-income students and underrepresented groups; assessing the academic, educational and communications skills of participants and preparing Individual Training Portfolios for each; facilitating the personal and professional development of students by establishing partnerships with industry for mentors, job shadowing, internships, or research experiences; increasing involvement in Career Center job placement activities; providing academic and support services for increased student retention and improved academic performance; and increasing the placement of participating students in baccalaureate transfer programs and related employment.\r\n\r\nThe scholars participate in a wide range of retention-related activities utilizing an exemplary student services program. Students who require remediation will participate in a special program to accelerate learning, however, once they enter the program, they are expected to maintain high academic standards. In addition, second-year scholarship recipients are encouraged to provide tutoring to entering CSEMS students. Scholars also have an opportunity to participate in a Summer Technology Institute that includes field trips to engineering and information technology industries in the region and to four-year schools with whom the institution has articulation agreements in engineering and information technology majors. \r\n\r\nIn addition, each student is assigned a M.A.S.T.E.R. Advisor who serves as the Faculty Mentor and a Big Brother/Big Sister mentor from a business or industry related to the major of the student. The Alumni Office is establishing an Adopt A Student mentorship program to encourage volunteer alumni from business and industry to participate as Big Brothers/Big Sisters to the scholars. A CSEMS Club allows networking among  scholarship recipients, provides a monthly lecture series with industry representatives as guest speakers, provide workshop opportunities on topics such as job search strategies and resume preparation, and provide opportunities for participant input and feedback. This project serves as a model for other community colleges in areas where high numbers of unemployment has forced entire regions to change their economic base.\r\n\r\n",
