 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides operating funds for the relativistic heavy-ion \r\ngroup at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of \r\nRochester.  During the year covered by this grant we will complete the \r\nanalysis of the data collected in 2001 and 2003 with the PHOBOS detector \r\nat the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National \r\nLaboratory (BNL) and consider possible upgrade options for the PHOBOS \r\ndetector.\r\n\r\n   PHOBOS is one of the four experiments looking at the extreme energy \r\ndensities that are created when nuclei collide at RHIC.  It is believed \r\nthat a new state of matter, the so-called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), will \r\nbe formed in these collisions.  PHOBOS is looking for this new state of \r\nmatter, and its properties will provide important and new information \r\nabout the state of the very early universe (a few microseconds after the \r\nBig Bang).  \r\n\r\n   PHOBOS was designed to study as many collisions as possible, in an \r\nunbiased way, and to search for significant differences between p+p, p+A, \r\nand A+A collisions.  The data collected sofar inlcudes studies of Au+Au \r\ncollisions in 2001, d+Au in 2003, and p+p in 2001 and 2003.  It is \r\nexpected that the QGP will only be formed in the Au+Au collisions, and the \r\nstudies of d+Au and p+p are used to subtract the contribution of \"normal\" \r\nnucleon-nucleon physics from the data collected in Au+Au collisions.\r\n\r\n   The time-of-flight array, designed and constructed by the Rochester \r\ngroup, significantly enhances the physics capabilities of PHOBOS, by \r\nroughly doubling its particle identification capabilities.  For the \r\n2003 run we have increased the flight path of our arrays, allowing use \r\nto identify particles up to momenta of around 4 - 5 GeV/c.  The analysis \r\nof the 2001 data is almost completed, and the analysis of the 2003 data is \r\njust getting started.  \r\n",
