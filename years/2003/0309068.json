 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nLittle is known about the mechanisms of maternal investment that affect offspring fitness in\r\ncommunal groups. This study is the first to evaluate specific mechanisms of investment that\r\naffect the fitness of offspring in communal groups. My objectives are to: (1) evaluate dam-\r\noffspring discrimination in a communal rodent, (2) determine if communal nesting improves\r\noffspring growth even when food is restricted, (3) determine the relative importance of tactile\r\nstimulation, warmth and dams milk provided in communal groups on offspring growth, and (4)\r\nmonitor the survival and reproduction of offspring reared by communal and solitary dams. I\r\nfound that prairie vole dams treat conspecific newborns but not conspecific weanlings as own.\r\nAlso, offspring in single-dam groups grow more than offspring reared by solitary dams when\r\nfood is provided ad-lib. I will test the effect of simulated tactile stimulation and warmth provided\r\nby an additional female on offspring growth and dams milk (Expt. 3). I will monitor survival\r\nand reproduction of offspring from single-dam groups and solitary dams in outdoor enclosures\r\n(Expt. 4). By integrating proximate and ultimate levels of analysis, I will improve our\r\nunderstanding of the evolution of communal nesting. Undergraduates have and will continue be\r\ninvolved in this study.",
