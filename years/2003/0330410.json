 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed team comprises of diverse yet complementary expertise in materials science, biology and engineering, at Northwestern University (NU), University of Tennessee (UT) and UC Berkeley (UCB). Together, we will employ an in-house developed approach for integration of high sensitivity micro-cantilever sensor elements with microelectronics platform, including RF remote addressability, in conjunction with truly innovative biochemical receptors to add discriminating selectivity- especially for nerve agents and toxic chemicals. Our ambitious aim is to at least approach a complete turn-key system consisting of fully integrated technologies, capable of monitoring hazardous environment, and automated decision output for the threat.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives of the proposed research include:\r\n\r\n1. Design and development of remote integrated piezo-MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) cantilever based nanosensor arrays for multiplexed toxic biochemical sensing at parts- per-billion (ppb) or parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels, or better if possible,\r\n2. Identification/optimization of multiplexed biomolecular receptors via optical detection,\r\n3. Development and validation of highly specific methods for the detection of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) and Sarin nerve gas.\r\n4. Proof-of-concept demonstration of a complete and integrated sensor system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research, in essence, defines a new paradigm in integrated sensor technology, and may provide that much needed \"giant step forward\" for this important field.\r\n\r\nA concerted effort is proposed to couple research with effective education/outreach for not only graduate students/postdocs, but also undergraduate students and society at-large, such as:\r\n\r\n1. A commitment to enhance scholarship experience for minority students via liaison with HBCU schools, especially for summer internship program at all three institutions.\r\n2. A pledge to enhance women participation via genuine recruiting effort, coordinated with the Society for Women Engineers (SWE). We seek to achieve 50% participation of women scientists/engineers in this program.\r\n3. Leveraging the proven and successful \"Materials World Modules (MWM)\" program (collaboration with Prof. Bob Chang, NU) for nation-wide high school dissemination.\r\n4. Public display module of if \"Integrated Nanosensors\", at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, in coordination with the ongoing NSF-NSEC outreach initiative at NU.\r\n",
