 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are exploring new methods for representing damage \r\nmechanics in the Earth's crust using a continuum rheology. Using a \r\nmethod that has been developed for understanding phase transitions in \r\nliquid crystals, they are developing a new model of damage in a \r\ncontinuum material undergoing shear flow. They model crustal \r\ndeformation using a fluid phase with anisotropic properties, in which \r\nsome elastic energy is stored according to the direction of an \r\nalignment vector. The undamaged state is characterized by random \r\nalignment of the directional vectors (director). Defects can be \r\nintroduced in various configurations with appropriate alignment of \r\nthe directors. In response to shear, point defects can develop and \r\nmerge to trigger spikes in the velocity, that is, slip events. This \r\nslip mechanism, followed by subsequent healing, provides a model for \r\nthe formation of microcracks and stick-slip behavior on faults.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Deformation of the Earth's crust and upper mantle \r\nhas implications for the origins of earthquakes and the mechanisms \r\nfor plate tectonics. This study of the behavior of this system will \r\naddress the origins of damage, formation of faults, fault slip, and \r\nhealing, in the Earth's crust.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: By developing new models of damage rheology, this \r\nproject will address the underlying mechanisms leading to \r\nearthquakes, a scientific problem of fundamental societal importance. \r\nA theory of damage in a continuum has potential implications well \r\nbeyond geophysics, and could be applicable to damage in other \r\ncontinuum materials.  In addition, this project establishes a new \r\ncollaboration between geophysics and applied mathematics, leading to \r\nthe development of new methods in both fields, while educating a \r\ngraduate student and a postdoctoral scholar.",
