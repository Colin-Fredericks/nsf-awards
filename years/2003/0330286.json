 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development and application of novel signal and image representation methods and time-scale and correlation analysis methods to build effective monitoring and diagnostic procedures. Anomalies in some manufacturing processes induce recurring traces in a sensor signal. In a situation like this, the proposed algorithms automatically recognize the repeated occurrence of a sub-signal or pattern of an arbitrary shape in a time series generated by a sensor. There are several issues that need to be addressed to develop such algorithms. For example, how can a method detect repetitive patterns in a sensor signal when they are shifted in time and/or contaminated by noise? A representative set of algorithms developed in this project includes (a) the identification of signal statistics, which allow the direct construction of a functional model, through correlation analysis, for the identification of critical variables of a manufacturing process, and (b) the detection of blurred or smeared surface defects in harsh environments. All these methods will be constructed with the objective of general applicability so that several crosscutting issues in the manufacturing and other areas can be addressed.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms developed in this project are extremely useful for detection of component failures and unfavorable process conditions at their incipient stage to avoid catastrophic breakdowns and defective products. Theses monitoring and diagnostic methods have a good potential to increase production yields by minimizing defective components, preventing damage to machines, and avoiding idle times on machines.  These methods will also substantially improve work safety and provide better mechanisms for human-machine interfacing. In the second phase of the research, the methods developed in the first phase will be applied to real-world monitoring and diagnostics problems. The information and data collected from the industrial applications will be used for validating the knowledge generated through research and also for building case studies for classroom instruction.\r\n",
