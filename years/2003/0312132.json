Three types of material is presented and discussed: \r\nBackground\r\nThis material consists of well established results developed in the late 80's and early 90's.  This provides an introduction to the essential concepts and methodologies. \r\nAdvanced Topics\r\nThis material consists of more recent results that extend and generalize the earlier work. This provides students with insights into research and open questions.\r\nApplications\r\nThis material demonstrates how theoretical results can be used by practitioners in dealing with security problems in a concurrent setting.\r\nThis provides students with skills in the use of formal methods to reason about and generate solutions to practical problems, such as verification of protocols or Java specifications.\r\n\r\nFollowing the summer school the material presented by the speakers will be made available through the summer school web site. Thus, the the school can have a broader impact on the community.\r\n",
