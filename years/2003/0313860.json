 "awd_abstract_narration": "FSU has been committed to building and supporting an education and research program in Information Assurance and Security since 1997. The first Information Assurance courses were offered in the fall 1999 and spring 2000 semesters. The program has grown steadily since, with the addition of expanded Information Assurance courses and a growing student population.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative effort between FSU and FAMU is intended to benefit FAMU by helping to develop an IA program at FAMU that does not currently exist and to strengthen the program at FSU by broadening its research effort, increasing minority representation in its graduate program, and by enhancing its instructional course content at the undergraduate level.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis project is innovative in its adaptive nature and its recognition and leverage of a vast resource pool. The knowledge and experience gained in establishing the graduate IA program at FSU is transferred to undergraduate programs at FSU and FAMU, where large numbers of students are seeking such opportunities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis approach produces a large number of IA graduates from previously untapped resources. Of the anticipated one hundred graduates per year, statistics show that sixty to seventy percent of these students will be from underprivileged and disadvantaged groups.\r\n",
