Techniques for nanoscale quantitative mapping of temperature and electric fields will be developed for studying heat dissipation and local hot spots in sub-100 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and SiGe metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and in single wall carbon nanotube (SWCN) devices. A suspended micro- device will be used to characterize thermoelectric properties of nanowires and to investigate quantum thermal transport in SWCNs. The PI will further develop a technique for nanoscale mapping of Seebeck coefficient across individual quantum well and barrier layers of Si/Ge and GaAs/AlAs superlattice coolers. \r\nThe PI will adopt effective models for micro-nano scale engineering instruction. He will integrate micro-nano scale thermo-fluids teaching with existing undergraduate courses via a curriculum reform effort focused on Project-Centered Education at his home department. Further, the PI will develop a new graduate course on micro-nano scale thermal/fluid science and technology, and an introductory laboratory section for use in regular summer workshops organized by the PI's institution for K-12 teachers, women and minority students.\r\nThe award is supported by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.\r\n\r\n",
