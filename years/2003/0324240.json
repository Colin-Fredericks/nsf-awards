 "awd_abstract_narration": "A National Research Council ad hoc committee will assess the present status of research\r\nat the interface between medicine and earth science, and will advise on the high priority\r\nresearch activities that should be undertaken for optimum societal benefit. The\r\ncommittee will report on the most profitable areas for communication and collaboration\r\nbetween the earth science and medical communities, recognizing both the infectious\r\ndisease and environmental components.\r\nThe proposed activity will span the earth science and public health fields, seeking to\r\nprovide much broader awareness and understanding of research endeavors at the interface\r\nof these fields as well as raising awareness of environmental contributions to diseases and\r\nhuman health. The study will provide a focus for this emerging scientific discipline to\r\nidentify the most promising and important research priorities.\r\nThe proposed activity will:\r\nEnhance the infrastructure for research and education, by recommending\r\nstrategies for enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the earth science\r\nand medical/public health communities;\r\nEnhance scientific and technological understanding, by preparing a report for\r\nbroad dissemination that will describe the connections between earth science and\r\npublic health, addressing both positive and negative societal impacts over the full\r\nrange from large-scale interactions to micro-scale biogeochemical processes;\r\nProvide benefits to society, by identifying basic research needs in bioscience and\r\ngeoscience required to support medical geology research, and by suggesting how\r\nfuture efforts should be directed to anticipate and respond to public health needs\r\nand threats.",
