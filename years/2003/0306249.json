 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Stefan Franzen of  the North Carolina State University will conduct a research program to develop and use a set of molecules as probes of the environment of nanoparticles in solution and in ordered structures using DNA oligonucleotides as the structural scaffold.  The electrostatic environment of nanoparticles causes shifts of the optical bands of the probe molecules.  These shifts in turn serve as indicators of the surface electric field of the nanoparticles.  The method based on this phenomenon is called colloidochromism.  The proposed work entails the creation of nanoparticles suitably prepared to modulate the surface potential, as well as the development of new molecules to serve as probes.  The colloidochromism of these systems will be investigated.  In addition, purified DNA-nanoparticle dimers will be prepared and similarly studied.  \r\n\r\nThe results of this work has applications to the self-assembly of nanoparticles using DNA.  This research will be conducted with a collaborating colleague in Poland.  Students will participate in this research.\r\n",
