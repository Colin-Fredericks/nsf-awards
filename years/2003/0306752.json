They, along with their collaborators, will\r\nalso consider the spectrum of Schroedinger operators on line bundles\r\nover tori and spectral data for orbifolds.  For noncompact manifolds,\r\nthe relevant spectral data are the scattering resonances and\r\nscattering phase.  Gordon, Webb, and Pauls, along with Peter Perry,\r\nwill investigate possible constructions of Riemannian metrics with the\r\nsame scattering data.  They will also consider isoscattering\r\npotentials for the Schroedinger operator and isoscattering obstacles.\r\nIn the area of sub-Riemannian geometry, Pauls will continue working\r\ntowards a better understanding of variational problems in Carnot\r\ngroups, focusing on the regularity of minimal surfaces, the\r\ncalculations of the best isoperimetric constant for the Heisenberg\r\ngroup, extensions of previous work to more general Carnot groups and\r\non problems related to the spectral theory of the subLaplacian (joint\r\nwith Doyle, Gordon and Webb).  He will also continue working with Mike\r\nWolf (Rice University) on two fundamental problems in the theory of\r\nharmonic maps.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will address inverse spectral problems, inverse\r\nscattering problems, and sub-Riemannian geometry.  Inverse spectral\r\ngeometry is rooted in spectroscopy, the problem of understanding the\r\nnature of a system from the characteristic frequencies of light or\r\nsound emitted.  The investigators will consider various constructions\r\nof objects (Riemannian manifolds such as planar domains, balls, or\r\nspheres) which have the same spectra and will compare their geometry\r\nin order to identify specific geometric properties that are not\r\nspectrally determined.  In the quantum mechanical description of a\r\nparticle in a potential, one distinguishes between ordinary bound\r\nstates and scattering states whose wave functions are nonnormalizable\r\nand whose energies can assume a continuum of possible values.  Inverse\r\nscattering theory seeks to understand as much as possible about the\r\nnature of a potential from the scattering behavior exhibited by\r\nparticles interacting with the potential.  The investigators will\r\naddress this problem by constructing and studying potentials with the\r\nsame scattering resonances.  The investigations in sub-Riemannian\r\ngeometry are motivated by a wealth of physical phenomena including\r\nproblems in wheeled robotic control, satellite navigation and\r\nstabilization and thermodynamics.  At this point in time, relatively\r\nlittle is known about the general theory guiding these types of\r\ncontrol phenomena.  Because of this, the investigators will focus on\r\ngaining a better understanding of the solutions to cost minimization\r\nproblems on basic model spaces.  Specifically, the investigators are\r\nfocused on constructing area minimizing surfaces in these settings in\r\norder to expose some of the fundamental geometric principles governing\r\nthe solutions to these types of problems.\r\n",
