 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to obtain an improved understanding of pre-process dynamics prediction for tool/holder/spindle/machine assemblies in high-speed machining applications, leading to the development of an Internet-based software application. The approach is based on substructure analysis methods where models or measurements of individual components are combined analytically to predict the final assembly response.  The education objective is to attract students to manufacturing careers through applied science-based research activities.  An example of these recruiting efforts is Jumbotron video presentations describing engineering concepts in the language of football during University of Florida home football games. Also, students will be involved in industrially relevant manufacturing research, such as high-speed machining.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this effort will lead to improved high-speed machining, which will impact many manufacturing operations, such as aerospace manufacturing where the high machining volume of both aluminum and titanium renders such advances important. The ability to increase material removal rates and part quality using the Internet-based software application should reduce reworked parts, scrap, and cost and subsequently improve efficiency.  Additionally, the education of new manufacturing engineers will improve the infrastructure necessary for technological advances in all research sectors.",
