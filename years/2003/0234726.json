 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University will upgrade a scanning probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies on the kinetics of growth of Langmuir-Blodgett films; b) evaluation of forces at protein surfaces; c) investigations on the enhanced deposition or dissolution of materials controlled on the nanoscale by precisely applied stress; and d) measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and STM based orbital mediated spectroscopy (STM-OMTS) in the solution and electrochemical environment.  Molecular electronic materials such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines and Langmuir-Blodgett films will be studied with solution phase STM. \r\nThe scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across its surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The interdisciplinary studies that will be carried out using this instrument will have an impact in materials physicsand chemistry and in biophysical chemistry.  The graduate and undergraduate students who will use the equipment for their research projects will be directly introduced to nanotechnology.  \r\n",
