 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate a low-voltage \r\nwaveguide modulator device, capable of operation at speeds up to 40 Gb/s.  Ultimately, this device will be capable of operating at speeds up to 100 Gb/s, with drive voltages as low as 4 volts.  The enabling technology for these devices is a process for deposition and patterning of single crystal LiNbO3 thin films.  The full potential of LiNbO3 electro-optical devices has not been realized, due to the limitations of producing them by diffusion processes in bulk crystals.  This new approach to developing this technology will open the way for a new class of electro-optical devices. This work will transition the epitaxial LiNbO3 film technology to commercial viability.  A commercial supplier of electro-optical components will collaborate to provide technical guidance during this effort.\r\n  \r\nFiber optic networks are being implemented in industry, defense and domestic and international telecommunications.  The proposed technology will enable new products that will add increased speed, capacity and flexibility to growing optical communications networks.  It is anticipated that products developed from this effort will achieve a significant market share by the year 2005.  This technology will be applied to devices for all-optical computing systems, which also require single crystal films of non-linear materials such as LiNbO\r\n",
