 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel methodology for real time (in-situ) non-destructive detection of defects and damage at micron and sub-micron length scales.  The objectives of this research are (a) to demonstrate detection of defects in semi-conductor thin-films and micro-structured materials by generating and detecting high-frequency  elastic waves,  and analyzing the acoustic response; and (b) to design a damage detection technique for real time inspection of integrated circuits (IC) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) during wafer growth.  The method utilizes a high-speed polymeric electro-optic (EO) integrated sensor to analyze the acoustic response due to a pulsed  laser induced elastic waves.  The sensor is an interferometer that has an EO element  built  in,  which is used to down convert gigahertz range (GHz) acoustic response signals to lower-frequency (kHz to MHz) detectable signal by heterodyning.  \r\n \r\nThe commercial application of this work is real time (in-situ) defect detection during IC and MEMS wafer growth.  Current wafer technology utilizes high-resolution lithography and expensive, time-consuming processing steps.  Early  stage  detection of defects using the proposed method will result in high-yield  and  low-cost wafer manufacturing. \r\n",
