Numerous invariants relevant vis-a-vis\r\nthe classification theory of stratified spaces are associated to self-dual\r\ncomplexes of sheaves, as such objects induce a generalized Poincare-duality\r\non the level of cohomology. On spaces with only even-codimensional strata,\r\northogonal decompositions of self-dual sheaves have been obtained by\r\nBeilinson-Bernstein-Deligne and Cappell-Shaneson. The investigator proposes \r\nto pursue this question on spaces that include strata of odd codimension as \r\nwell. Initial evidence suggests that in many situations the odd-codimensional \r\nstrata do not contribute terms in the decomposition.  This new phenomenon \r\nleads to interesting consequences for associated characteristic classes and \r\nfor stratified maps. In earlier work, the investigator has constructed L-classes \r\nof non-Witt spaces. He would like to explore the behavior and applications of\r\nthese classes. In collaboration with S. Cappell, the investigator has\r\nobtained an Atiyah-type characteristic class formula for the twisted \r\nL-class of a singular space, assuming a ``transversality'' condition on the \r\nlocal system near the singularities.  One is interested in extending the \r\nresults beyond this assumption. This problem is already interesting on \r\nmanifolds together with a codimension 2 submanifold and a local system \r\ndefined on the complement. Lastly, the proposer in conjunction with R. Kulkarni,\r\nhas constructed self-dual strongly perverse sheaves on the reductive\r\nBorel-Serre compactification of Hilbert modular surfaces. These are \r\nnon-Witt spaces. The investigator would like to analyze the resulting invariants \r\n(particularly with a view towards their number-theoretic content), as well \r\nas generalize the results to higher dimensional modular varieties.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of geometrical objects focusing on the neighborhood\r\nrelations between points rather than on measurement of distances. In the\r\nlast century, considerable effort has been directed towards studying\r\n\"manifolds\" -- spaces that locally look uniform, at each point and in\r\neach direction. This effort has been immensely successful; a central\r\ninsight was that crucial information about a manifold is carried by one\r\nnumber: its \"signature,\" measuring intersections of geometric sub-objects\r\nwithin the manifold. In the last two decades, topologists have studied\r\n\"singular\" spaces with increasing interest, due to their numerous\r\noccurrences and applications within pure mathematics (algebraic geometry,\r\nnumber theory) and outside pure mathematics (mathematical physics). In\r\ncontrast to a manifold, a singular space may locally look different from\r\npoint to point. The proposed research tries to define, understand and\r\ncompute a signature and other characteristic numbers for singular spaces.\r\n\r\n",
