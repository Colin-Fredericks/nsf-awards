 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this  research  is  to  develop  constitutive  models  for  tensile  deformation  and  fracture  of \r\nelastomers at very high strain rates.  Specific objectives are to (a) develop an experimental program that \r\nwould characterize extensive deformation and fracture of elastomers at impact rates (1-103 s-1); (b) derive appropriate  hyper-viscoelastic  constitutive  equations  to  predict  the  dynamic  response  of  elastomeric structures when they are subjected to blast or impact loading; and (c) obtain appropriate dynamic fracture parameters  for  notched  specimens  under  impact  tensile  loads.    A  tensile  impact  apparatus  has  been designed to obtain both dynamic stress-strain curves of uniaxial strip specimens and force-extension curves of notched panels.  The apparatus uses the pendulum of a Charpy impact machine to impart tensile impact forces in two copper cables by connecting the cables to a slider bar that moves suddenly upon impact from the Charpy hammer.  The copper cables are connected to opposite ends of the specimen, where there are dynamic  load  cells  and  displacement  transducers  to  measure  forces  and  displacements,  respectively.  Designing  the  experiment  so  there  are  equal  grip  separation  velocities  on  both  sides  of  the  specimen localizes the middle of the specimen so that high-speed video photography can be used to capture fracture and crack propagation in the notched specimens.    \r\n\r\nThe material data and constitutive models that will be developed in this research will be used in protective \r\ndesign  of  federal  buildings  and  embassies,  which  are  susceptible  to  terrorist  bombings.    The  Force \r\nProtection  Branch  at  the  Tyndall  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory  has  recently  found  that  elastomeric coatings on walls offer significant protection to occupants against blast loading.  Unfortunately, high strain rate  material  data  on  elastomers  that  fracture  under  tension  and  constitutive models  that  can  accurately predict deformation and failure of elastomeric structures under tensile impact are lacking.  Most high strain rate data and material modeling for elastomers is related to the design of earthquake isolation bearings and shock  absorbers,  where  the  elastomer  (rubber)  is  in compression  and  shear  and  stresses  are  fairly  linear with strain and strain rates.  Under impact tensile loading, our experiments show that elastomers are highly nonlinear, hyper-viscoelastic materials, sometimes breaking at 300% strain or more.  A technological gap therefore exists and we intend to remove this gap with our research so that the Tyndall AFRL can develop standard design criteria in elastomeric coatings for blast mitigation.   \r\n \r\nResults  from  this  NSF  Small  Grant  for  Exploratory  Research  will  be  used  toward  developing  a  more substantial proposal for NSF consideration.  However, the Force Protection Branch at Tyndall Air Force Research  Laboratory  will  loan  us  equipment,  such  as  a  high-speed  video  camera  and  piezoelectric  load cells,  to  ensure  rapid  success  of  this  research  under  its  present  funding  level.   While  it  is  clear  that our research addresses one of the strategic goals set by the Homeland Security Department, development of our experimental  program  and  constitutive  models  has  broader  impact  than  this.    Future  research  will  be concerned with  using  viscoelastic  energy  dissipation  of  elastomers  to  mitigate  blast  and  impact  loads  of other structures, including military ships, aircrafts and helicopters.   \r\n \r\n",
