 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on investigating the mathematical structure \r\nof certain classes of variational conditions, and designing and \r\nanalyzing effective computational algorithms to solve them. \r\nSuccess in the proposed work would permit analysis to be done \r\nmore simply, with better insight, and with greater exploitation of \r\nproblem structure, for a broad class of equilibrium problems \r\nhaving substantial practical usefulness as well as intrinsic \r\nmathematical interest. It would also produce better computational \r\nalgorithms, and the means for justifying them. Sub-topics in this \r\nresearch program include:\r\n\r\n-  Gaining better insight into degeneracy and its effects through \r\nanalysis of parameterized versions of variational conditions, \r\nwith the aim of illuminating the effect of special structure on \r\nthe sensitivity and stability behavior of the problem.\r\n\r\n-  Developing new computational methods using approximate \r\nderivatives, justifying their convergence, and testing them \r\ncomputationally.  \r\n\r\n-  Improving convergence analysis for methods of linearization \r\ntype, and applying that analysis to, e.g., the computational \r\nmethods discussed just above. \r\n\r\n- Analyzing specially structured variational conditions using \r\nmethods of composition duality combined with the new \r\nstability and sensitivity information developed in this project.\r\n\r\n- Applying knowledge gained in the above research to analysis \r\nof other promising areas such as quasi-variational \r\ninequalities.\r\n\r\nVariational conditions are mathematical models of equilibrium \r\nproblems. They are useful for a wide variety of problems from \r\nareas including economic policy studies, agricultural economics, \r\nstructural engineering, transportation, materials science, game \r\ntheory (that is, models of conflict), and others. One of the reasons \r\nwhy these problems are especially hard is that they model \r\nsituations in which individuals or groups are not acting in concert, \r\nand indeed are often acting at cross purposes. For example, in a \r\nroad traffic equilibrium problem each driver is trying to find a \r\nroute that is best for him or her, but the effects of many drivers' \r\nindependent choices can make conditions bad for everyone (e.g., \r\nby creating congestion on popular routes). The research that is \r\nproposed will try to develop more knowledge about how \r\nmathematical models can represent these problems, what the \r\nproperties of those models are, and how to use those properties to \r\ncompute numerical solutions to the models. With such knowledge \r\nthe models could then be used to answer \"what-if\" questions and \r\nthus to design better management methods. For example, civil \r\nengineers interested in improving traffic flow might use such \r\nmodels to predict more accurately the effect of improving existing \r\nroads or of building new roads, and thereby determine how best to \r\nspend a limited budget to reduce traffic congestion.",
