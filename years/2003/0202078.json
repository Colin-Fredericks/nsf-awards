 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request to support the operation of the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and the CLEO detector for the next five years.  Since the new B-Factories, PEP-II at Stanford and KEK-B at the Japanese National Laboratory for Accelerator Research, KEK, now have luminosities routinely exceeding that of CESR, this is a proposal to alter CESR for operation over the energy range 1.5 to 5.6 GeV per beam to provide CLEO with access to unique and important physics and to address some of the original goals of the CESR/CLEO program in a way complementary to the PEP and KEK machines. In addition to the particle physics program, it is proposed to continue a vigorous program of accelerator science and technology for the future. The Cornell University group proposes to continue a strong program in x-ray science at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source that, using synchrotron radiation from the CESR beams, has operated simultaneously with particle physics since the inception of CESR.  The program described herein will be complete in 2006. At that time it will be appropriate to cease using CESR for particle physics and to devote it largely to x-ray science and to some accelerator R&D measurements.\r\n\r\nThe funds are requested primarily to support operation of the CESR facility, support infrastructure for CLEO collaborators including operation of the laboratory computing facility, research by the Cornell portion of the CLEO collaboration, accelerator R&D, and related educational and outreach activities. The proposed particle physics program contains opportunities for original discovery, precision measurements for unique tests of the Standard Model and enabling measurements that will be necessary for analyzing data to be taken at the B-factories and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva. The program will begin with a year of Upsilon 1S, 2S and 3S resonance running.  For the majority of the operation, however, it is proposed to run at and near the charm resonances and above DsDs threshold. By exploiting capabilities that are unique to the charm energy region, CLEO measurements will explore a large set of critical weak and strong interaction phenomena, will extend and enable flavor physics worldwide and will lay the foundation for mastery of a non-perturbative, strongly interacting theory. This is essential for a full understanding of QCD, will quite likely be crucial for understanding new theories revealed by the next generation of frontier accelerators and will impact many fields beyond particle physics where strongly-coupled theories arise. During this period, the CESR/CLEO program will serve as an important vehicle for accelerator and detector R&D in support of the national and world particle physics programs to come. Because of its great flexibility, CESR is an excellent laboratory for studying the effects of non-linearities attending the use of strong wiggler magnets and space charge detuning in high-density beams, both important features of the damping rings planned for future linear colliders. Additionally, they propose continued R&D in the physics of superconducting radio frequency acceleration techniques. As a result of this R&D, the Energy Recovery Linac has been put forward as an ultra bright source of synchrotron radiation, capturing worldwide attention and interest. \r\n\r\nTo their routine training of science and engineering graduates and undergraduates in particle physics and accelerator science, they propose to add a professional degree MS program in accelerator science and technology. An education outreach coordinator has been added to enhance their K-12 outreach to local and inner city young people.\r\n",
