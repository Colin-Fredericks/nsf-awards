 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at adaptation of recent developments in information technology for implementation of internet-enabled laboratory experiments in undergraduate Civil Engineering courses. Faculty and students are able to remotely observe, conduct, control, and analyze experimental data either in or outside a classroom. The project improves student learning through real-time visualization of theoretical concepts and fosters creative thinking by providing a first-hand exposure to conducting, controlling, and analyzing laboratory experiments. In addition to enhancing the quality of courses offered to on-campus students, one of the objectives is to develop the capability for offering these experiments via distance learning. Such offerings are likely to assist non-traditional students such as underrepresented minorities, working parents, part-time students, career-changing adults, etc. who are seeking a career in Civil Engineering. The adapted information methodologies are developed in such a way that they can be easily applied to experiments other than those considered in this project. New software interfaces to be developed are made available to instructors in other institutions for free downloads through a project web site. Supplementary documentation needed to avoid potential pitfalls in future implementations is also disseminated. Project team members collaborate with faculty at North Carolina A&T University, historically a black college, by providing them access to conduct and control these experiments for teaching purposes. Effectiveness of the project is evaluated using both formative and summative approaches. Benefits of distance learning courses are addressed with respect to retention and increased participation of non-traditional students.\r\n",
