 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical understanding and experimental creation, characterization and utilization of fluid jets of nanoscale dimensions present significant scientific, engineering and technological challenges. These challenges originate from fundamental issues pertaining to the physical properties of liquids whose dimensions approach the molecular scale, as well as problems related to the design, creation and characterization of liquid jets with such reduced sizes. The interdisciplinary program developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology, that combines researchers from the schools of Physics, Electrical & Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, aims at developing, implementing, and applying theoretical and experimental tools that will allow systematic investigations targeted at gaining deep insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying the formation of nanojets and governing their stability, as well as leading to the design, fabrication and application of nanojets.  Applications of nanojets are envisaged in diverse future nanoscale technologies, including: surface patterning, electronic circuit printing, coating, fiber spinning, and trans - membrane needless injections. The theoretical techniques that will be employed in this program include large-scale computer-based atomistic simulations, as well as continuum hydrodynamic modeling modified to include size-dependent fluctuations, with a focus on the development of reliable methodologies of predictive capabilities. The critical materials issues and outstanding fabrication and characterization challenges, will be addressed through the development and adaptation of imaging techniques, including electron microscopy and atomic-force-microscope imaging of nanojets during flow, as well as post-deposition analysis of nano-printed features and applications of nano-structural fabrication techniques and detection methods that are at the frontiers of nanoscale engineering and detection capabilities.
