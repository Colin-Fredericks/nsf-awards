 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nThe principal investigators will work on two fundamental\r\nprojects in the field of geometric analysis.  The first\r\nproject concerns the interrelated analytic study of\r\nrational billiards, moduli spaces of abelian\r\ndifferentials, and the dynamics of the Teichmuller\r\ngeodesic flow. A recent theme has been the interplay\r\nbetween the dynamics on flows on homogeneous spaces on the\r\none hand, and the dynamics of flows on rational billiards\r\nand flat surfaces on the other.  This synergy has led to\r\nrecent breakthroughs in both subjects.  Broadly speaking, the\r\nprincipal investigators propose to apply the methods and\r\nideas developed in the case of homogeneous spaces to study\r\nrational billiards and dynamics on Teichmuller space.  \r\nThe second project is to give a combinatorial approach\r\nto the study of Teichmuller Space and its geometry.  One\r\nof the major goals is to develop a complete analogue\r\nbetween this theory and the classical theory of the\r\ngeometry of the modular curve.\r\n\r\nMany natural phenomena are studied via the branch of\r\nmathematics known as dynamical systems.  One important\r\nexample is planetary motion. Another centuries old example\r\nis the theory of billiards, or the study of collisions of\r\nmolecules. Triangular billiards occur in the study of\r\nelastic collisions of two masses in an interval.  The\r\nstudy of a dynamical system can take many forms. One\r\nexample is to study periodic orbits (or repeating\r\nbehavior); another is to study choatic behavior.\r\nThe principal investigators plan to study a variety of\r\ndynamical systems that occur in mathematics. One of the\r\nprominent topics will be billiards in polygons in the\r\nplane, and a generalization known as flat surfaces.  \r\nThese surfaces also fit together into a family known as a\r\nmoduli space, and the principal investigators plan to\r\nstudy dynamics on moduli spaces. A major component of the\r\nproject will be educational. The principal investigators\r\nplan to give workshops for students, both at the\r\nundergraduate and graduate levels, in order to introduce\r\nthem to these fields of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
