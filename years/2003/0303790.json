 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current focused ion beam techniques are capable of writing nanometer-sized features, but are inherently very slow.  The aim of this project is a novel, radically different approach to high-throughput and versatile fabrication of nanometer scale complex patterns over large areas (tens of sq. cm).  A broad area collimated beam of ions will be directed at a silicon wafer, and focused as an orderly array of nanometer size spots with the use of sub-micron sized electrostatic lenses. Simulations indicate that regardless of the achievable resolution of current lithography, this method can improve resolution by a factor of up to 100. When the wafer is tilted off normal (with respect to the ion beam axis), the focal point is laterally displaced, allowing the focused beams to be rastered, thus forming any arbitrary pattern. This is the essence of nano-pantography. The desired pattern is replicated simultaneously in billions of spots over tens of sq. cm. The plan is to apply this method to deposit small metal particles that will nucleate the growth of an ordered array of isolated, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, for field emission applications.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide challenging projects for graduate and undergraduate students, with rich scientific and educational merit, as well as technological advances, not the least of which would be a clear path to large scale manufacturing of nano-devices.  It is expected the latter will lead to a high level of interest from, and partnerships with, developing nano-technology companies and consortia.  Diversity in undergraduate involvement will be facilitated by several programs at the University of Houston (a designated Minority Status University) and the  University of California-San Diego.  Outreach activities at the local public schools will help introduce the importance and excitement of nano-science and technology to students at an early age.  Besides field emission devices,  applications in quantum dot devices and ultra-small transistors will be investigated.  The ability to deposit nanoparticles with a variety of size and/or composition could advance combinatorial approaches in fields such as catalysis or sensor development.\r\n",
