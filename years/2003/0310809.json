 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is investigating methods for jointly adapting transmitters \r\nand receivers in a wireless network. The objective is to optimize\r\nperformance by measuring and exploiting properties of the channel \r\nand interference. Parameters adapted at the transmitter include \r\ndata rate and power, along with transmitted signatures, which can \r\nspan dimensions across space, time, and frequency. An important\r\npart of this effort is to account explicitly for limited feedback\r\nfrom the receiver to the transmitter. Both cellular and non-cellular \r\n(e.g., peer-to-peer) wireless networks are being considered. \r\nIn the latter case, the PI is investigating methods for allocating \r\nrate and power across degrees of freedom associated with \r\nmultiple antennas and links in a multi-hop network.\r\n\r\nJoint power and signature optimization problems are being studied\r\nboth with perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, and with \r\nlimited feedback. Signature optimization serves to avoid interference while \r\nsimultaneously exploiting channel conditions.\r\nSolutions to problems with perfect channel knowledge\r\nprovide benchmarks for comparisons with suboptimal transmission schemes, \r\ne.g., when channels are unknown. Channel models of interest include \r\nmultiple access (reverse-link) and forward-link channels, and \r\nthe uncoordinated multi-input/multi-output channel, which models \r\na peer-to-peer network. Transmitter optimization is being studied\r\nin the context of both direct-sequence spread spectrum and\r\nmulti-carrier signaling. Implications for joint transmitter-receiver \r\nadaptation over time-varying channels are being considered.\r\nTransmitter designs, which can exploit link diversity in a \r\nsimple multi-hop channel model, are also being explored.\r\n\r\n",
