The IEEE AP-S provides financial support of various forms including assistance in finding low-cost housing, but does not reimburse travel expenses.\r\n\r\nWithout financial assistance many young scientists and engineers selected to participate in these student paper competitions will not be able to attend the conference. The PI believes it is important that these most talented new researchers be present with fresh and innovative ideas to discuss their work with those who have more experience. \r\n",
