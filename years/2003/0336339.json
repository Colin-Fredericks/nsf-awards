 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Subhash Goel, University of Michigan\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research proposal is to seek NSF funding for: (1) travel support for a group of 10-12\r\ninvited US side participants to attend the International Workshop on Steel and Concrete Composite\r\nConstruction in Seismic Regions (IWSCCC-2003) to be held at the National Center for Research on\r\nEarthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taipei, Taiwan, on October 8-9, 2003, in conjunction with Pseudo-\r\nDynamic Testing of a Full Scale 3-Story composite CFT- Buckling Restrained Braced (BRB) Frame on\r\nOctober 2-7, 2003, and (2) to partially support a doctoral student to be able to continue analysis and\r\ndesign studies jointly with the NCREE research team prior to and after the full scale test. The \r\nanalysis/design methodologies to be developed will be formulated for incorporation in the new\r\ngeneration of performance-based design codes. The P.I.'s believe that this program is a good example\r\nindicative of the future trend when international cooperative research will become more common using\r\nglobally networked facilities and modern information technology, including the NEES facilities\r\ncurrently being established in the US.\r\n\r\nResearch Plan\r\nThe proposed research is a follow up of Phase 5 of the US-Japan Cooperative Research Program on\r\nComposite and Hybrid Structures (1993-2000) where major emphasis was place on obtaining more\r\nbasic knowledge through studies of components and sub-assemblages. In this current US-Taiwan\r\nCooperative Program two full scale frames (RCS and CFT-BRB) are subjects of thorough study. The\r\nRCS frame study has been completed, and the study and testing of the CFT-BRBF is currently in\r\nprogress. The proposed research proposal has two components. The first component involves carrying\r\nout pretest and post-test analyses and related design implication study of the CFT frame cooperatively\r\nwith the Taiwan research team. The second component includes travel of a group of 10-12 US\r\nparticipants to attend the International Workshop on Steel and Concrete Composite Construction that\r\nwill follow immediately after the testing of the CFT frame. The main purpose of the workshop is to\r\ncreate a forum of researchers, practitioners and constructors to discuss the recent developments and\r\nexperiences as well as to explore the challenges and opportunities for further research and\r\ndevelopment of innovative composite and hybrid structures in the future.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact - Research: The research work will result in rational and well founded seismic\r\nmodeling, analysis and performance-based design methodologies for advanced composite structures,\r\nwhich show promise of excellent structural efficiency and performance. That will accelerate the use of\r\nthose structural systems in seismic design practice. The performance-based design and analysis\r\nmethodologies as developed in this research will have been validated by testing on full size structures,\r\nthereby convincing the profession and the code writing bodies to incorporate the recommendations\r\nquickly in the future codes and practice.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact - Educational and International Cooperation: The research work in this project will\r\nconstitute a major part of one doctoral student's research training and education. Therefore, the project\r\nwill not only contribute to further advancement of the knowledge base and improvement in the\r\nprofessional practice and codes, but will also help in educating highly qualified professionals needed to\r\ncarry out the earthquake hazard mitigation program in the future. Results from this project will also\r\nlead to important advances in inelastic modeling and design tools that are used in structural analysis\r\nand design courses. Additionally, the project will provide great opportunity for international\r\ncooperation and exchange of research personnel.\r\n",
