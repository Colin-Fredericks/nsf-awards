The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results. A wide range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The meeting is an especially important venue for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The 45th Annual meeting will feature 45-minute talks by five invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.  The invited speakers will be: Hugo Dooner, Rutgers University; Steve Henikoff, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Susan McCouch, Cornell University; Neelima Sinha, University of California-Davis; and Vicki Vance, University of South Carolina.  The workshops will be:  \"Maize Genomics Resources\" and \"Maize Quantitative Trait Loci:  Practical Aspects and New Approaches\".\r\n\tThe annual Maize Genetics Conference offers members of the maize genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss research results in many areas of maize genetics and genomics.  The format of the meeting includes talks, poster sessions, and workshops. The Conference provides an outstanding venue for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.  \r\n",
