 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal investigates a new class of systems, formulated in terms of \r\ntime dependent and stationary partial differential equations. The systems\r\nhave inherent switching properties, leading to their interpretation as free\r\nboundary problems. What defines them as new is their characterization as\r\nsystems rather than scalar equations, underscoring interlocking, complex\r\ndependencies. This work, part of which is joint with Siegfried Carl,\r\nextends the work of many mathematicians who have worked on free boundary\r\nproblems for scalar equations during the last four decades. Systems of \r\nfree boundary problems are associated with such diverse models as\r\nchange of phase, semi-classical band gap theories, threshold switching, \r\nand combustion. Using significant models for illustration, we employ\r\na multi-tiered analysis, permitting the development of an infrastructure\r\nfor analysis and computation. The principal investigator and Michael Rose\r\nintroduced the initial comprehensive finite element study of the two-phase \r\nStefan problem in 1982. In this proposal, iteration and discretization \r\nare studied as companion entities. A particularly significant aspect is \r\nthe identification of the system map and its efficient approximation \r\nvia smoothing and linearization. The cooperation of Monica Torres has been\r\nsecured to study the interface of these systems with homogenization\r\ntheory and the theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nMathematical models of free boundary problems build upon a rich tradition.\r\nFree boundary problems were studied intensively during the 1970s and\r\n1980s. A major impetus in the U.S. was the construction of the trans-Alaska\r\npipeline, which required knowledge of the complex process of melting\r\nof permafrost. The free boundary refers to the so-called mushy region\r\nbetween solid and liquid phases. A mathematical model of temperature,\r\ncalled the two-phase Stefan problem, was employed for this purpose. One of\r\nthe principal contributors to this effort was John Wheeler of the Exxon \r\nCorporation. Progress was slow in coming in the modeling of systems,\r\nwhere several effects may be present. Associated free boundary problems may\r\narise in many application areas, due to discontinuous switching induced by\r\nsources or sinks within the system. An environmental example is the\r\ndischarge of a contaminant species into a river, the regulation of the\r\ndischarge, and the ensuing response of control mechanisms to ameliorate the\r\ndischarge. Sophisticated systems of partial differential equations,\r\nincorporating physical principles describing the contaminant density and\r\nthe river temperature, are utilized, and include the switching phenomena.   \r\nThe incorporation of quantum principles into models of nanostructures also\r\ninduces switching and free boundary problems, as does the study of certain\r\nprocesses of combustion. Another application of these ideas, which \r\nis not pursued in this proposal, is the pricing of certain financial\r\ninstruments. An area of broader impact of the proposal has been identified \r\nin relation to the international community sponsoring the Workshops on\r\nComputational Electronics. The principal investigator has been an advisory\r\npanel member since 1990, and details of some of this work, part of the \r\neffort toward making quantum computing possible, will be disseminated to\r\nthe community at a regularly scheduled workshop, and in the journal,\r\nComputational Electronics. Publication will also occur in regular\r\nmathematics journals.\r\n",
