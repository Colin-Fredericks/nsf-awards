 "awd_abstract_narration": "Context Statement \r\n(Sensor and Sensor Networks Panel, June 12 and 13, 2003)\r\n\r\nApproximately 930 proposals were submitted in response to the Sensors and Sensor Networks Solicitation (NSF 03-512) during fiscal year 2003.  A total of 469 of these proposals were considered in the Small-Team competition.  All proposals were grouped according to their relevance to one of the three general topical areas identified in the solicitation.  This proposal is one of 30 considered in a panel on June 12-13, 2003 on the subject of Designs, Materials and Concepts for New Biological Sensors and Sensing Systems. This panel was jointly run by program directors from the Experimental and Integrated Activities Division of CISE and the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems Division of ENG.  The panel included sixteen panelists, all technical experts, who were invited to NSF and who reflect the range of expertise needed for the proposals under consideration.  The panelists had reviewed the proposals in their areas of expertise, and sent their individual reviews via FastLane, prior to coming to the panel meeting.  Proposals were reviewed  and evaluated against both merit review  criteria established by the National Science Board, namely, \"What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?\" and \"What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\"  In addition, the proposals were assessed for relevance to the Program Solicitation (NSF 03-512). \r\n\r\nAt least three panelists provided written evaluations for each proposal.  The written evaluations were presented to the panelists who debated the strengths and weaknesses of the proposals, which were then assigned preliminary ratings.  The panel discussions concerning the proposals were documented by a panel Recorder, who submitted the summary of the discussion to the panel for unanimous approval.  After all the proposals had been reviewed and rated, the panel placed the proposals into two categories: (1) Recommended and (2) Not Recommended for funding.  The panel provided sufficient information for the Program Director to make a recommendation.\r\n",
