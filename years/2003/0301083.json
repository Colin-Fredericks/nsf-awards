The first project concerns\r\ncontinuing investigations (jointly with S. Konyagin) of subtle\r\ninequities in the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions.\r\nSuch problems are intimately connected with the distribution of non-trivial\r\nzeros of Dirichlet L-functions and the Riemann zeta function.  The research\r\nfocus is on further illuminating the influence of hypothetical zeros of the\r\nL-functions having real part different from 1/2.\r\nA second project deals with the limitations of sieve methods, which are\r\npowerful techniques for bounding the number of primes (or numbers with\r\na bounded number of prime factors) in an integer sequence.\r\nThe goal of the proposer's work is an improved understanding of\r\nhow the distribution of primes in a sequence is influenced by the\r\ndistribution of the sequence in arithmetic progressions and the distribution\r\nof the sequence on numbers with an odd number (respectively and even number)\r\nof prime factors.\r\nThe final project is to improve bounds for the density of integers possessing\r\na divisor in a given interval, a problem which is central to the theory of\r\nthe distribution of divisors of integers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of prime numbers is more than 2000 years old, and the most important\r\nproblems revolve around how the primes are distributed.  Besides applications\r\nto many other branches of mathematics, prime number theory is crucial to\r\nmodern coding theory and cryptography, e.g. secure Internet communication.\r\nThe proposed research deals with questions concerning how the primes are\r\ndistributed within certain sets of integers, and questions on the related\r\nsubject of the statistical behavior of the distribution of divisors of\r\nnumbers.  The proposer will involve graduate students,\r\npost-docs and/or talented undergraduate students (REU) in these research\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
