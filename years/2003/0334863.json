The objectives of the workshop are multi-fold: 1) assess and benchmark the present state-of-art and state-of-practice, 2) forecast the future, 3) identify technological barriers and gaps between present and future, and 4) capture and summarize workshop findings for the benefit of IARP member organizations and other stakeholders. In meeting the objectives of the workshop the technical program gives special emphasis to the following topics: 1) Surgical Robots (telesurgery; active surgical robots; semi-active surgical robots), 2) Computer-Assisted and Image-Guided Surgery (surgical navigation technologies; image guidance technologies, and 3) Rehabilitation Robotics and Robotic Prosthetics (robotic exercisers; motion assist devices; prosthetics).\r\n\r\nThe workshop proceedings includes a final report, presentation slides and movies, talk abstracts, selected background materials, and other media suggested by the participants. Dissemination of the proceedings is to be via the Web (http://www.ri.cmu.edu), hardcopy, CD's, and. Each attendee will receive both a hard copy of the report and a CD version; each IARP country representative will receive 50 copies of the CD and a master copy of the printed report.",
