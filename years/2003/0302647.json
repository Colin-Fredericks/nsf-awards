(A famous question on this theme is\r\n``can you hear the shape of a drum?\".) This leads  to the study of\r\n spectral invariants of  geometric operators, which\r\nare   geometric invariants of the manifold. The\r\nzeta invariants of geometric elliptic operators form a family of\r\nsuch spectral invariants which includes in particular the\r\ndeterminant of the Laplacian and certain integrated local\r\ninvariants such as the Yamabe functional.\r\n It is well known that among metrics of a given\r\nvolume and conformal class, the Yamabe functional is extremized at\r\na metric of constant scalar curvature, and the same is true for\r\nthe determinant of the Laplacian on surfaces.  This raises many\r\nquestions regarding  how the determinant of the Laplacian behaves\r\nin higher dimensions, what happens for different types of\r\nLaplacian, and how  other zeta invariants behave. There has\r\nalready been progress on several of  these questions, the\r\nmotivation being both to understand the behavior of specific zeta\r\ninvariants and to investigate possible applications of zeta\r\ninvariants  to geometry. Okikiolu proposes to study a number of\r\nissues related to the existence, uniqueness and behavior of\r\ncritical metrics for the determinant of the Laplacian and  other\r\nzeta invariants, including questions concerning global upper or\r\nlower bounds, gradient flow, behavior across conformal classes,\r\nbehavior of model problems, and development of the basic analytic\r\ntheory of zeta invariants. In addition, Okikiolu proposes to work\r\non  related questions concerning  spectral invariants of Toeplitz\r\noperators on manifolds, and in a somewhat different  direction, on\r\nthe problem of extending the Verlinde formulas from quantum field\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n Understanding the relationship between the\r\ngeometry of a space and the spectra of natural geometric\r\ndifferential operators on the space is a problem which arises in a\r\nnumber of branches of science. Individual eigenvalues are hard to\r\nanalyze and often the geometry of a space is more clearly\r\nreflected by certain weighted averages of the eigenvalues such as\r\nzeta invariants. In particular, determinants of Laplacians on\r\nmanifolds have been studied and applied in several fields of\r\nmathematics and physics including topology, quantum field theory,\r\nstring theory, algebraic geometry, and conformal geometry.  The\r\nresearch proposed here should lead to a more complete mathematical\r\ntheory of zeta invariants for geometrical and physical\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
