 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the synthesis of novel `orthogonal` solid   phase supports. These will be used for the preparation of protected   oligonucleotides, and oligonucleotide conjugates with functional groups   or peptides attached at defined positions.  Related oligoribonucleotides   will also be prepared.  The research  will extend the types of reactions   that can be used to cleave the oligonucleotides from the solid support to   include reductive and enzymatic reactions, and extend the scope of   chemistry available for conjugating protected oligonucleotides.  With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Dr. Marc M. Greenberg of the Department of   Chemistry at Colorado State University.  The research focuses on   developing solid phase supports from which protected fragments of DNA and   RNA can be cleaved under mild conditions, and on expanding the repertoire   of reactions available for extending the number of nucleotides linked  to   form the oligomers.  The work will provide useful approaches to others   attempting to synthesize oligonucleotides, and will have practical   biomedical applications.  Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows   will receive training in the synthesis of small molecules and   biopolymers, and get the kind of training needed in the growing   biotechnology area.",
