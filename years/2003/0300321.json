The Fontaine-Mazur conjecture\r\nand generalizations of it predict that for Galois groups of number field\r\nextensions unramified at p the latter actions have finite image whereas  \r\nthere should exist tree actions with infinite image. The investigator's\r\nprogram will identify these actions and hence these (as yet mysterious) Galois\r\ngroups, allowing direct verification of Fontaine-Mazur in these cases.\r\nPossible spin-offs of this include improved root-discriminant bounds and\r\na quantitative version of Fontaine-Mazur along the lines of Cohen-Lenstra\r\nheuristics, together with applications for the pro-p group theorists such\r\nas new families of branch pro-p groups.\r\n   \r\n   Number theory has been revolutionized in recent years by the use of       \r\n\"Galois representations\", most notably by Wiles in his proof of Fermat's\r\nLast Theorem. In particular his co-author, Taylor, has gone on to apply\r\nthese techniques to many other longstanding problems. The only drawback\r\nis that these methods only work in one half of cases, the \"p-ramified\" ones.\r\nThis proposal develops a new theory of Galois representations suited to\r\nhandling the other half. The work of Taylor and Wiles proves cases of the\r\nfundamental Fontaine-Mazur conjecture, from which solutions to Fermat's\r\nLast Theorem and similar equations simply follow - in the other half\r\nthe Fontaine-Mazur conjecture has many striking consequences and the new\r\ntheory presents a program for verifying the conjecture and hence its\r\ncorollaries. \r\n\r\n",
