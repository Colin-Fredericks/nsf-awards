 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award of Rodl 0300529\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims at deepening our understanding of\r\nspontaneous order (studied in Ramsey theory) and of random disorder\r\n(investigated by quasi-random techniques).  One of its goals is to\r\ndesign efficient methods for finding and enumerating collections of\r\nspecified sub-objects in discrete structures.  The project seeks\r\nfurther development of a methodology - the Regularity Method - that\r\nhas had a series of striking successes over the past 25 years, and to\r\napply the method to a variety of problems in extremal combinatorics\r\nand Ramsey theory.  In the area of quasi-randomness, one of the PI's\r\nlong-term projects is to investigate the properties of quasi-random\r\nsparse graphs and uniform hypergraphs.  In particular, the PI is\r\ninterested in extending the applicability of the Regularity Method to\r\nthese structures.\r\n\r\nThe understanding of discrete, combinatorial structures is very\r\nimportant in modern science and technology.  For instance,\r\nprobabilistic reasoning is crucial in the design of large networks and\r\nof algorithms.  In discrete mathematics, one of the most successful\r\ntechniques is the probabilistic method, which enables one to prove\r\nresults about deterministic objects.  One of the more recent\r\ntechniques employs the idea of quasi-randomness.  A quasi-random\r\nobject is an object that shares several properties with many other\r\nobjects of the same kind.  Quasi-random properties that enable one \r\nto find and enumerate sub-objects of a given type are of particular\r\ninterest. The main part of this proposal aims to extend the\r\napplicability of the current techniques to a broader class of combinatorial\r\nstructures.  The results should lead to applications in different\r\nareas, ranging from phase transition and game theory to theoretical\r\ncomputer science.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
