The new programs with multiple entry and exit points will prepare technicians for the wireless communications industry.\r\n\r\nThe project components include curriculum development and adaptation and program development, professional development for high school and community college faculty, and development of 2+2+2 articulation in wireless communications. As an NCTT regional partner, the project staff is working to implement similar programs throughout the region and generally contribute to program development and improvement at collaborating institutions. In addition, this ATE project serves as the focal point for regional dissemination and training to regional business and industry, through the development of materials and faculty.\r\n\r\nBesides NCTT, strategic partnerships for this project include the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), The New Jersey Center for Advanced Technological Education (NJCATE) and the Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC). Other project partnerships have been established with post-secondary institutions, area technical high schools, and regional industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
