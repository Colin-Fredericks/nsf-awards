 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bal\r\n     The investigator and his students study wave and particle\r\npropagation in heterogeneous media and related inverse problems.\r\nMore precisely, they analyze the refocusing and stability\r\nproperties of time reversed waves, which can be used in\r\nnon-destructive testing and wireless communication.  They also\r\nanalyze photon propagation in human tissues to understand how the\r\nproperties of these tissues can be imaged from photon intensity\r\nmeasurements.  Numerical tools and software are developed to\r\nsimulate the aforementioned forward and inverse problems.  The\r\ninvestigator also develops a course on theoretical and numerical\r\ninverse problems.\r\n     In many applications a good understanding of wave and\r\nparticle propagation in complicated media is necessary: seismic\r\nwave propagation generated by earthquakes, acoustic wave\r\npropagation to destroy kidney stones (lithotripsy), microwave\r\npropagation in wireless communication, or photon propagation in\r\noptical tomography, a quite powerful imaging technique to detect,\r\nfor instance, brain tumors and finger arthritis.  The investigator\r\ndevises theoretical and numerical tools to analyze wave and\r\nparticle propagation and to understand how it can be used to\r\nsolve practical problems, such as the maximal capacity of\r\ncommunication that can be obtained in a specific environment, or\r\nthe minimal size tumor that can be imaged in optical tomography.\r\nIt is also a primary goal of the investigator to teach coming\r\ngenerations of undergraduate and graduate students the novel\r\ntechniques that have emerged recently in the applied mathematical\r\ncommunity to address these problems.\r\n\r\n",
