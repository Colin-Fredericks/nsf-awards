Fulton\r\n\r\nThere has been exciting recent work involving interactions among Schubert\r\ncalculus (intersection theory on Grassmannians and related flag\r\nvarieties), eigenvalue and singular value problems in linear algebra,\r\nrepresentation theory, geometric invariant theory and related symplectic\r\ngeometry.  In addition to solving the Horn conjecture about eigenvalues of\r\nsums of Hermitian matrices, a variety of related problems have been raised \r\nand are being solved.  There are quantum analogues of many of these problems, \r\nwhich are part of this project.   The project also involves a problem of \r\nenumerative geometry, and a more difficult problem of constructing moduli \r\nspaces of subvarieties to resolve away multiple components.  Three writing \r\nprojects, on stacks, toric varieties, and curves, have each already led to \r\nsome new research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns nine topics, most on the borders of\r\nalgebraic geometry with other areas.  Much of algebraic geometry concerns\r\nthe geometry of quite general spaces.  This research, however,\r\nconcentrates on a collection of special varieties which have a rich\r\nstructure that one can hope to analyze in detail.  These arise in\r\nneighboring areas of mathematics, especially representation theory, but\r\nalso linear algebra, combinatorics, commutative algebra, and symplectic\r\ngeometry.  For example, although the notion of quantum cohomology -- which\r\ncame from physics -- make sense in great generality, few spaces have had\r\ntheir quantum cohomology thoroughly worked out, and we plan to expand this\r\nknowledge in this project.  Three book-writing projects are in progress,\r\ntwo of which should be useful to graduate students in algebraic geometry;\r\nthe third is aimed at undergraduate mathematics majors.\r\n\r\n",
