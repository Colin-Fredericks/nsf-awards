 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Informatics for fiscal year 2003.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. These fellowships provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational activities in biology and informatics to a wide range of recent doctoral recipients.  There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Biological responses and feedbacks to abrupt climate change.\"  Biological systems both depend on climate and control critical elements of the climate system.  Prediction of climate change and the impacts that result therefore depends on better understanding of this two-way interaction.  This research examines the biosphere's role in the climate system by using computational models that represent global scale processes of the earth system.\r\n",
