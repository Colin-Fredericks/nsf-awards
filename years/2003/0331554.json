 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue of repairing and upgrading the existing civil engineering infrastructure has been\r\none of great importance for over a decade. Deterioration of bridge decks, beams, girders\r\nand columns, buildings, parking structures and others may be attributed to ageing,\r\nenvironmentally induced degradation, poor initial design and/or construction, lack of\r\nmaintenance, and to accidental events such as earthquakes. Recent developments related\r\nto materials, methods and techniques for structural strengthening have been various. One\r\nof today's state-of-the-art techniques is the use of externally bonded fiber reinforced\r\npolymer (FRP) composites.\r\nThere are also many applications in the area of using prestressed FRP tendons and FRP\r\nbars to reinforce bridges and structures. Structural engineers view the use of advanced\r\ncomposites as highly promising in the construction industry currently.\r\nThe Workshop is organized on the premise that the exchange of existing American and\r\nforeign experience in the area of utilizing FRP products in repairing existing structures is\r\nbeneficial for both parties. The workshop will focus on the repair of ancient structures\r\nusing FRP. Research related to composite materials has been carried out in the U.S.,\r\nCanada, Europe, Egypt, and Japan. However, there has been little communication\r\nbetween the American, Japanese, and European researchers. There is a need for an\r\ninternational exchange of advanced experience to increase the research efficiency and to\r\ninsure that the United States is at the leading edge of engineering research. Experts from\r\nthe United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the Middle East will identify the topics for\r\nfuture cooperative projects in the area of repair, reinforcing, and rehabilitation of\r\nstructures using FRP. Site visits will be organized to historical structures in Egypt in\r\ncollaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Culture to investigate the possibility of using\r\nFRP to repair monuments and historical structures (several hundred years old).\r\nIn order to ensure a productive workshop, the expected participation will be about 90\r\nspecialists from universities, research centers, bridge authorities and consulting\r\ncompanies from around the world. Each participant will submit a written contribution on\r\none of the topics. The discussions, additional contributions and final recommendations\r\nwill be included in the Workshop Proceedings. The Proceedings will be widely\r\ndistributed in the US to researchers and code writers. The presentations will also be made\r\navailable at various professional meetings and conferences (ASCE, ACI) as well as in\r\nprofessional journals.\r\nThe Workshop is scheduled for December 16-17, 2003, in Cairo, Egypt. Cairo is the\r\ncapital of Egypt and is the largest city in Africa.",
