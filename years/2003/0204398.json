In the 21st century, this involves reaching out to \r\nwidely diverse populations including recent immigrants from Asia, \r\nLatin America, Africa and Eastern Europe.  The success of these \r\noutreach programs depends on understanding the language and culture \r\nof the families in these communities and providing activities, \r\nsupport, and education that is deemed appropriate and relevant for \r\nall of the girls and adults involved.\r\n\r\nGirls all over the country are faced with a range of opportunities \r\nthat were not available to previous generations.  Part of the Girl \r\nScout mission is to help \"girls gain insight into coping with \r\ncontemporary moral and social dilemmas.\"  Through a series of \r\nGirl-Scout-sponsored series of innovative and engaging programs, \r\ngirls learn about preventing teen pregnancy, avoiding substance \r\nabuse, and understanding the influence of popular culture on creating \r\nfaulty self-images regarding one's body and mind.\r\n\r\nWith support from ITWF, the Hornets' Nest Council will deliver this \r\ncontent in a new and innovative way - through a custom \r\ntechnology-based simulation entitled, \"Making Choices.\"  \"Making \r\nChoices\" will use a variety of technologies including wireless \r\nnetworked laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), \r\nprinters, scanner and digital cameras to deliver a series of \r\nsimulation activities (totaling 3-5 hours of instructions).  A \r\nresearch evaluation study will assess attitudes of girls and women \r\nvolunteers who participate in the standard programs versus the \r\ntechnology-based programs.\r\n",
