 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reports on the state of freshwater reserves warn that severe local shortages\r\nare imminent, and predict that violent conflicts will emerge in water-scarce\r\nregions around the world. Water scarcity has been shown to cause civil\r\nconflict, particularly when accompanied by high population density, poverty,\r\nand income inequality. Urban migrant communities, where ethnic, religious,\r\nand class differences can exacerbate tensions, and community-wide patterns\r\nof adaptation to environmental scarcities are not well-formed, may be\r\nparticularly vulnerable to water conflicts. To better understand how\r\nconflicts develop in water-scarce regions, a PhD student of cultural\r\nanthropology will sample 60 households in Villa Israel, a barrio of\r\nCochabamba, Bolivia, where conflict over water is an established part of\r\nlife. Every winter, seasonal water shortages threaten the lives of the\r\npeople of Villa Israel, forcing them to make choices in how they use their\r\neconomic and social resources. Using a combination of formal and informal\r\ninterviews, participant observation, and archival research, the student will\r\ndetermine if and how cooperative economic and social ties break down during\r\nthe dry season, facilitating the emergence of conflicts. \r\n\r\nBroader implications: In addition to contributing to the education of a\r\ndoctoral student and a Bolivian undergraduate, the study has practical\r\napplications for those seeking to anticipate and manage coming conflicts\r\nover scarce freshwater. By determining when and how social ties become\r\nvulnerable during periods of severe water scarcity, the research will point\r\npolicymakers and development planners to possible avenues for conflict\r\nprevention in marginal urban communities.\r\n",
