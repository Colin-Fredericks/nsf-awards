Steinhorn\r\n\r\nThis project funds travel awards to graduate students in logic to\r\nsupport their participation in the Annual Meetings and the\r\nEuropean Summer Meetings (Logic Colloquia) of the Association for\r\nSymbolic Logic. These two events are arguably the most important\r\nmeetings in the field of logic; since their inception, they have\r\nbeen international scientific meetings of the highest standard of\r\nexcellence. The Association works to ensure that these meetings\r\ncover logic comprehensively and that they represent the highest\r\nquality work being done in this field. They accordingly have\r\nprovided important opportunities for intellectual exchange, thus\r\nacting as a stimulus to advancement of research.  For graduate\r\nstudents in logic, the opportunity to attend one or both of these\r\nASL meetings is an indispensible component of serious\r\nparticipation in the profession.\r\n\r\nThe Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international\r\nprofessional society for logicians, whose membership includes\r\nresearchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics,\r\nmathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number\r\nof important meetings. Most prominent among these are its Annual\r\nMeeting, held each year in North America, and its European Summer\r\nMeeting. The Association also has met for many years at the Joint\r\nMathematics Meetings and with the American Philosophical\r\nAssociation. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia,\r\nAustralia, Europe, and North and South America. During the last\r\nfew years, the Association has actively sought to increase the\r\nrange and number of meetings of which it is a sponsor. A\r\nparticular aim of this effort is to embrace new and emerging\r\nfields in which logic has come to play an important role,\r\nincluding computer science, linguistics, and cognitive\r\nscience. This project will permit the continuation of a\r\nsuccessful program of graduate student travel awards that the\r\nAssociation has administered since 1993 and that has been partly\r\nfunded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly\r\neffective means of bringing students in logic to important\r\nprofessional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas\r\nwith leading logicians, an experience which is a vital component\r\nin training future Ph.D.'s in the field. Almost fifty percent of\r\nthe awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2001 (the\r\nfirst N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students\r\nwho subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic.
