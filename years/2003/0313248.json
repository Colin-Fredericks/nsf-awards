 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of self-organizing sensor network applications can be  \r\nsimplified with distributed composition services that cooperate with \r\ndistributed adaptation and lookup services to enable sensor nodes \r\nto be self-aware, self-configurable, and responsive to real-time \r\nchanges. This research focuses on developing novel concepts, architecture \r\nand mechanisms for distributed composition services that support \r\ncontinuous operation of self-organizing applications to meet on-demand \r\nneeds in spite of ad-hoc deployment, frequent node failures, dynamic \r\nreconfiguration, and mobility. The utility of the self-organizing \r\nservices will be demonstrated in collaborative sensor fusion \r\napplications for detecting, classifying and tracking moving objects \r\nand distributed sensor-actuator control. The testbed is an ad-hoc \r\nnetwork of sensor nodes that are equipped with embedded processors, \r\nRF communication, multi-mode sensors and actuators. Sensors nodes \r\nare augmented as reconfigurable smart components with capabilities \r\nfor impromptu networking, self-assembly, dynamically adaptation to \r\ndevice failure and degradation, node mobility, and changes in task \r\nand network requirements. They use innovative techniques including: \r\n(1) Services and mechanisms for self-organizing sensor applications, \r\n(2) scalable hierarchical composition services, (3) lightweight \r\nreconfigurable communication mechanisms, and (4) implementation of \r\ndistributed services over event-based data-centric networks. Broader \r\nimpacts of this research include the development of advanced and \r\nintroductory course curriculum and innovative sensor network testbeds \r\nand laboratories for education and research training of graduate and \r\nundergraduate students including minority students.\r\n",
