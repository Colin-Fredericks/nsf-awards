 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research program will address the challenges posed by the continuing \r\ngrowth of the Internet and shared-spectrum networks in a finite-spectrum world.  Current \r\nspectrum allocations are generally either \"static,\" or allow user transmissions insensitive \r\nto nearby users and overall network efficiency.  To maximize wireless network \r\nperformance it will be  necessary to understand and develop  efficient \"self-organizing \r\nmethods of spectrum allocation\" in which transceivers cooperate using new wireless \r\nprototcols  to  locally  maximize  total  wireless  channel  capacity  (bits  s-1 Hz-1  m-2) and \r\nnetwork utility (reliability, latency, equity, and economic factors). \r\n \r\n  The performance limits of alternative architectures for spectrum self-organization will \r\nbe explored, including networking schemes: 1) without \"side-channel\" control \r\ninformation, 2) with side-channel information from active transmitters only, and 3) side-\r\nchannel information from passive ports too, permitting power and antenna control by \r\nlocal transmitters that boosts network performance.  Any side-channel information would \r\nsupplement that which is always available by monitoring transmitter emissions. \r\n \r\nMethods to be Employed \r\n  Urban  user  and  multipath  propagation  models  will  be  formulated  using  existing \r\nand/or new wireless data recorded using equipment to be developed.    Based on these \r\nmodels,  wireless  multi-user  network  configurations  will  be  statistically  analyzed  using \r\nquantitative metrics that facilitate understanding and development of  alternative self-\r\norganizing approaches to spectrum allocation.  New methods for multivariate blind signal \r\nseparation  will  be  developed  for  multi-antenna  systems  that  employ  self-organizing \r\nspectrum-allocation  strategies.    Strategies  and  protocols  for  self-organizing  wireless \r\nnetworks  will  be  formulated  and  tested  using  these models  and metrics,  and  the  results \r\nwill be integrated to inform policy makers and technologists of limits and new options. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity \r\n  The intellectual merit lies in the development and evaluation of: 1) new strategies for \r\nefficient cooperative use of wireless spectrum in crowded urban environments, 2) \r\neffective new methods for blind multivariate signal separation, 3) stochastic models for \r\nmulti-user  wireless  multipath  environments,  and  4)  integrated  models  for  the  nominal \r\nlimits to wireless performance and economics. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\n  Successful completion  of these program  elements should provide  a useful \r\nfoundation for: 1) formulating telecommunications regulations that promote increased \r\nspectral efficiency and wireless utilization for internet and other services, 2) development \r\nof devices  and systems by the private sector that increase spectrum capacity and \r\nutilization, and 3) further research utilizing: the models to be developed for the wireless \r\nenvironment,  the  multi-antenna  multi-channel  wireless  sensor,  the  databases \r\ncharacterizing the observations and models, improved algorithms for blind separation of \r\nmultivariate signals, and new algorithms for self-organizing spectrum allocation.",
