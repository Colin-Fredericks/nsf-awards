These are conveniently encoded  by the\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants.  The  investigator intends to  investigate the\r\nreasons behind   this surprising phenomenon by    looking into the finer\r\nstructure of Seiberg-Witten monopoles  relying on an adiabatic deformation\r\nof the Seiberg-Witten equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of the present proposal is  to   perform a  micro-analysis of\r\nsingularities,  objects  popularly known as `catastrophes'. One could\r\nvisualise these as surfaces  which are nice  most everywhere  except at\r\nfew places   where one sees forming `cusps' and  `spikes', mathematically\r\nreferred to as `singular points'.  If an observer  sits at a regular point\r\nand looks around, the `horizon'  he/she observes    is round, spherical.   The\r\n`horizon '  of  a singular point is  an object mathematicians refer\r\nto as `the link of the singularity'   and is  shaped quite differently\r\nthan the `horizon' of a regular point.   In fact,  the shape of  this link\r\nalone  contains a wealth of information about how the space in the\r\nvicinity  of the singular point  twists, bends and folds.   This kind of\r\ninformation   is carried in abundance by      certain objects the\r\nphysicists refer to as `monopoles'. These  are similar in many respects to\r\nthe electromagnetic waves, but  they  are more sensitive to the   shape of\r\nthe Universe they travel in.   The investigator  will analyze the\r\nstructure of these monopoles by   `looking  at these singularities\r\nthrough a  high resolution microscope', a process mathematically know as\r\nadiabatic  deformation of the space.   This technique has already produced\r\nencouraging preliminary results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
