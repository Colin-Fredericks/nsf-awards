 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop avalanche-warning systems to improve the safety of those who travel and live in mountainous areas.  Avalanches produce low frequency infrasound (1-5 Hz), which can propagate miles from their origin, and thus provide a means for remote, automated detection and warning systems.  Single sensor monitoring systems are capable of detecting avalanche infrasound, but associated detection algorithms suffer from false alarms under high noise conditions.  Sensor array based systems provide spatial signal information, which can be used both for noise suppression, and source location, potentially greatly improving detection capabilities.  However, the use and limitations of array-based signal processing techniques and associated theoretical assumptions, as applied to the large scales and field demands of avalanche infrasound, needs to be investigated and understood.  A monitoring system will be operated during planned avalanche control activities to gain experimental data to determine the feasibility of sensor arrays for avalanche detection. \r\n\r\nCommercial applications of this technology exist for monitoring, warning, and controlling routes of travel and commerce, for backcountry travelers, recreation areas, search and rescue operations, and for monitoring and warning of avalanches where people reside. It is estimated that there is a large international market for this technology.",
