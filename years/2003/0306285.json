 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the main obstacles to the development of efficient and \r\nreliable computational tools for simulating waves are rooted in the \r\nmultiple spatial scales which are universally present. The focus of \r\nthis project is the detailed study of select questions which are \r\nrelevant for overcoming these obstacles. A unifying feature of the \r\nquestions addressed is that all involve the efficient approximate \r\nevaluation of integral operators in space and time. Although the \r\nwork, if successful, has the potential to impact numerous \r\nscientific and engineering disciplines, the efforts will be directed \r\ntowards problems in aeroacoustics and electromagnetics. \r\nPrecisely, the following will be developed: (i) Accurate, efficient \r\nand reliable computational domain truncation methods, allowing \r\nthe direct simulations to take place only in regions where the \r\nmedium is complex or where nonlinear effects are important; (ii) \r\nEfficient time-stepping methods allowing the simple treatment of \r\nconcentrated regions of high resolution or geometric detail.\r\n\r\nWave propagation problems are of fundamental importance in \r\nmany areas of applied science and technology. They encompass a \r\nwide range of physics (electromagnetics, fluid and solid \r\nmechanics), but share essential mathematical properties. The \r\ndefining characteristic of a wave is its ability to travel long \r\ndistances relative to its basic dimension, the wavelength, carrying \r\ndetailed information about the medium through which it has \r\ntraveled. For this reason, waves are the primary method by which \r\nwe probe nature and communicate. A consequence of this \r\nfundamental characteristic is that wave propagation problems \r\ntypically involve disparate spatial scales - from the geometrical \r\ndetails of scatterers through a range of wavelengths to the \r\npropagation distances. These multiple scales, in turn, lead to \r\ndifficulties in computational analysis. In particular, their uniform \r\nresolution would lead to a prohibitive number of degrees of \r\nfreedom. Thus methods must be developed which can concentrate \r\ncomputational resources only where they are needed, providing \r\nthe primary motivation for the problems we consider. In addition \r\nto this analysis, the plan is to collaborate with researchers who are \r\nbuilding software for simulating jet noise, electromagnetic \r\nscattering in complex structures, as well as general-purpose wave \r\npropagation problems. Thus any positive developments from the \r\nresearch can come into use as rapidly as possible.\r\n",
