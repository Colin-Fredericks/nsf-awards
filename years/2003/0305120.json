 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  investigators   have  developed  a  set   of  parallel  algebraic multilevel techniques for solving distributed sparse linear systems of equations,  leading to the  ``parallel Algebraic  Recursive Multilevel Solver'' (pARMS),  a portable and general purpose  library for solving sparse  linear systems  on  parallel computers. One of their goals is to begin to address the `efficiency gap' between `special purpose'  and `general purpose'  methods.  On one  extreme of the spectrum of solvers available, lie sparse direct methods which are robust,  general-purpose, but  expensive.  On  the other  extreme, are special purpose methods, such  as multigrid, which utilize information about  the  underlying   problem  to  tailor-design  certain  solution procedures.  Such methods  can be optimal but they  aim at solving the original physical problem instead  of the resulting linear system.  In between  these extremes  are the  preconditioned Krylov  methods whose performance is variable.\r\n\r\nThis research is characterized by a different vision of what a library of parallel iterative solvers should offer. The investigators strongly believe that a new paradigm is  required where a solver is no longer a monolithic  box comprising a  set of  preconditioners, but  allows the user to input specific information,  indeed even parts of the solution algorithm, in order to tailor the multilevel solution procedure.  This approach,  which is  enabled by  the modular  design of  pARMS,  is in perfect agreement  with the standard  approach used in  industry.  The new  paradigms  and methods  envisioned  in  this  research will  also\r\ninclude a number of other key issues which arise in a typical solution process.  Thus, it is important to exploit the underlying context when solving  nonlinear systems  of  equations.  It  is  also important  to ensure that the pARMS code provides a fall-back option to an efficient sparse direct solver for  situations where the iterative solver fails. The  investigators  also  plan  to  explore new  questions  which  are starting  to  emerge  with  the  advent  of  the  Computational  Grid. Finally, they  will keep  in mind architecture-  and problem-dependent tuning of solution algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe software developed  by the investigators will continue  to be made publicly available.   Both investigators have  major interactions with researchers in important applications areas.  The pARMS-X code is also likely to have  an impact on graduate education, as  was the case with SPARSKIT in the past. \r\n\r\n",
