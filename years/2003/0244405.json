The lever being used to study this\r\narea is in developing the understanding of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules\r\nand extensions of modules.  In addition, the project also studies \r\nseveral areas central to commutative algebra, including the tight closure of\r\nideals, integral closures of ideals, the core of an ideal, evolutions,\r\nsymbolic powers,  and rational singularities. The focus of this proposal\r\nis on several open conjectures, especially regarding rings of finite and\r\ncountable Cohen-Macaulay type, conjectures of Auslander on the vanishing\r\nof extension modules, and questions of Schreyer, among others.  Among\r\nthe methods being used is the study of maximal Cohen-Macaulay\r\nmodules not only through study of infinite resolutions, but with techniques\r\ncoming from tight closure and reduction to characteristic p.  The methods are\r\nin part classical methods as well as those being developed by the proposer.\r\n\r\nCommutative algebra arose from the 19th century study of polynomial equations in\r\nmany variables, and their solutions. The relationship between polynomial equations and\r\ngeometry goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane.\r\nCommutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power series equations\r\nby forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions.\r\nThe algebraic properties of these generic solutions then give insight into the\r\ngeometric and algebraic nature of the equations. An important technique in this\r\nfield has been to study such equations by reducing the coefficients modulo prime numbers\r\nfor all large primes. A particular example of this has been the explosive development\r\nof the theory of tight closure over the last fifteen years. Commutative algebra combines\r\ntechniques from a number of other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
