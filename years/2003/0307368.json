The potentially critical role of magnetic fields in star formation has long been recognized, but remains hard to ascertain, because of the difficulty in directly measuring the field strength. This is particularly true for the dense cores of molecular clouds, which are the centers of star formation. Working at the University of Virginia, Dr. Li will carry out a program of research to elucidate the role of magnetic fields in the formation of both single stars and stellar systems. For single stars, he will develop a model for isolated magnetized cloud cores that couples dynamics and chemistry. For stellar systems, he will extend the existing axisymmetric calculations of magnetic cloud evolution driven by ambipolar diffusion to non-axisymmetric cases. These non-axisymmetric calculations will enable a detailed investigation into the role of magnetic fields in cloud fragmentation, which lies at the heart of the problem of stellar system formation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of Dr. Li's program are the training of a graduate student at the University of Virginia and close collaboration between researchers specializing in dynamical simulations and astrochemistry. Successful completion of the program will lead to a better understanding of the birth of stars, a topic that captures the public imagination. Dr. Li will integrate his research results into undergraduate courses and public presentations.  \r\n",
