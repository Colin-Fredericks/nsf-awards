 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neutron interferometer is a device that uses the quantum mechanical  \r\n(QM) wave-like properties of free neutrons to measure certain  \r\nproperties of nature very precisely. It functions much like an optical  \r\ninterferometer, except that it detects the interference of neutron  \r\n\"waves\" rather than light waves. A slow neutron (speed less than about  \r\n2000 m/s) has an associated QM wavelength comparable in size to the  \r\nspacing of atoms in a solid, so it interacts with matter coherently,  \r\ni.e. like a wave rather than a particle.\r\n\r\nWhen a slow neutron enters the interferometer, its QM wave is  \r\ndiffracted in a perfect silicon crystal and splits into two sub-waves,  \r\neach taking a different path. These two sub-waves then strike a second  \r\nsilicon crystal and are diffracted again, into four sub-waves, all  \r\nstill associated with the original single neutron. Two of these four  \r\nsub-waves meet again in a third silicon crystal and can interfere with  \r\neach other. The degree of interference determines the probability of  \r\ndetecting the neutron in a neutron detector placed behind the  \r\ninterferometer. We can place a piece of matter, a magnetic or electric  \r\nfield, or even a gravitational field inside the interferometer to shift  \r\nthe phase of one sub-wave relative to another and change this  \r\ninterference. By noting the resulting change in the neutron detection  \r\nrate we precisely measure the amount of phase shift. This gives  \r\nimportant and often unique information about the strength and nature of  \r\nthe neutron's interaction in the material or field.\r\n\r\nIn one experiment, we single out the neutron phase shift caused by its  \r\ninteractions with electrons in a silicon crystal. Overall the neutron  \r\nis electrically neutral, but it does feel a force from charged  \r\nparticles such as electrons because of its magnetic moment, and because  \r\nit contains charged quarks. Our measurement will lead to a much better  \r\nunderstanding of the internal charge distribution in the neutron. In  \r\nanother experiment, we precisely measure the phase shift due to the  \r\nneutron's interaction with He-3, a rare light isotope of helium, and  \r\nhow it changes when the neutron's spin direction is made the same or  \r\nopposite to the spin direction of the He-3 nuclei. This will provide  \r\nimportant details about the nature of the force between neutrons and  \r\nprotons inside atomic nuclei. A third experiment measures the neutron's  \r\nphase shift in the Earth's gravitational field using a special neutron  \r\ninterferometer that floats in a zinc bromide solution. We will try to  \r\nresolve a long-standing discrepancy between past neutron experiments of  \r\nthis type and Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle, which states that  \r\na particle's gravitational and inertial masses are equal.\r\n",
