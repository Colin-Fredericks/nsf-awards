 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thieme\r\n     The investigator undertakes mathematical studies of\r\nquestions arising in ecology and population biology, focusing on\r\nhost-parasite systems and structured populations.  With their\r\nrapid turnover, parasitic populations are ideal objects to study\r\nthe principles of evolution; in turn, it is important to\r\nunderstand these principles to control infectious diseases\r\neffectively.  Mathematical models and their analysis are very\r\nmuch needed for a deeper understanding and as a theoretical\r\nlaboratory to devise control and management strategies.  In fact,\r\nmany of the arguments on the adaptive dynamics of virulence have\r\nbecome so complex that they can be more easily formulated\r\nmathematically than verbally.  While the health aspects of\r\nparasite-host interactions are of immediate concern, their impact\r\non biological diversity may be as important.  The mediation of\r\nspecies coexistence through chaotic dynamics has gained a lot of\r\nattention recently, but coexistence at equilibrium mediated by\r\nparasites and by population structure may be far more prominent.\r\nIn the context of competition, coexistence, and evolution in\r\nhost-parasite systems, the investigator studies:\r\n  Coexistence and evolution of endophytic fungi,\r\n  Parasite mediated coexistence and competition, and\r\n  Prey-predator-parasite interactions.\r\nUsing structured population models, he studies:\r\n  The evolution of parasite virulence in structured host populations,\r\n  Apparent Allee effects in structured predator-prey systems, and\r\n  The evolution of polymorphism in amphibians.\r\n     Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and the danger\r\nof bioterrorism have led to a renewed interest in host-parasite\r\nsystems.  The fact that infectious diseases afflict not only\r\nhumans and their food sources (domestic animals and agronomic\r\nplants), but also natural animal and plant populations, has\r\ndirected attention to the important and fascinating role of\r\nparasites in ecosystems and in the maintenance of biological\r\ndiversity.  Studying mathematical host-parasite models enhances\r\nour insight in evolution in general and in evolution of hosts and\r\nparasites in particular (evolution of virulence, co-evolution of\r\nhosts and parasites).  These models help to design disease\r\ncontrol strategies that avoid parasite resistance and decrease\r\nparasite virulence (virulence management).  They also lead to\r\nenvironmental management strategies that are compatible with\r\nspecies preservation.  They can be used as educational tools in\r\ngraduate and undergraduate instruction and for effective\r\ncommunication with the scientific community, public health\r\nofficers, and an educated public audience.\r\n\r\n",
