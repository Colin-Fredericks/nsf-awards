 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing the technology for Distributed Immersive Performance (DIP), deals with live, interactive musical performances in which participants in different physical locations are interconnected by very high fidelity multichannel audio and video links. DIP, a specialized realization of broader immersive technology, creates the complete aural and visual ambience that places a group in a virtual space to experience events occurring at a remote site or communicate naturally regardless of location. The assembled DIP experimental system will have three sites in different locations on the USC campus. The sites will have different types of equipment to test the effects of video and audio fidelity on the ease of use and functionality of different applications. Two will have high-definition (HD) video or digital video (DV) quality images projected onto wide screen wall displays completely integrated with an immersive audio reproduction system for a seamless, fully 3-dimensional aural environment with the correct spatial sound localization for participants. The system will be capable of storage and playback of the many streams of synchronized audio and video data (immersidata) and will utilize novel protocols for the low-latency, seamless, synchronized real-time delivery of immersidata over local-area and wide-area networks such as Internet. Partners in the project include New World Symphony (NWS) of Miami Beach, University of Maryland, and Georgia Tech. The latter two contribute the Internet2 infrastructure as server sites. The enabled research addresses the following challenges:\r\n\tLow latency continuous media (CM) stream transmission, synchronization and data loss management\r\n\tLow latency, real-time video and multichannel immersive audio acquisition and rendering\r\n\tReal-time continuous media stream recording, storage, playback\r\n\tHuman factor studies: psychophysical, perceptual, artistic, performance evaluation\r\n\tRobust integration of all these technical areas into seamless presentation to participants\r\nStudents participate in the assembly, integration, testing, and research applications using the DIP system via thesis research, directed research projects, and classroom work. Offering an opportunity for students to receive a broad cross-disciplinary education in media systems engineering, undergraduate engineering majors from USC and CSULA are invited to participate.\r\n\r\n",
