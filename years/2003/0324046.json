 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics, and the College of Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have previously been awarded two NSF CSEMS grants; $495,000 in January 2000 and 2001 supporting 40 students per year with $3,125 scholarships; and a second grant of $400,000 in 2002 supporting 29 students per year with $3,125 scholarships. The CSEMS Program at UMass, which gives preference for transfer and upper-level students, has successfully supported economically disadvantaged students with above-average percentages recruited from under-represented groups. To date, 22 students have graduated with support from the CSEMS Program and 27 additional scholars in May 2003.\r\n\r\nThis proposal increases the number of baccalaureate degrees in CSEM fields by building a new cohort starting with 29 freshmen in fall 2003. These students, selected for their exceptional academic promise but financial limitations, are supported with annual scholarships of $3,125 for four years -- from their first year through graduation. Particular attention is paid to the recruitment of women, minorities and persons with disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe newest CSEMS cohort are participating in a faculty-driven, comprehensive mentoring program combining the key elements of 1) recruitment, 2) financial support, 3) close monitoring and communication, 4) special opportunities and 5) academic and personal support resources. \r\n",
