 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Daniel Rabinovich, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina - Charlotte, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division to study Tetrahedral Nickel Thiolate Complexes. The goal of the project is to develop models of the nickel site in [NiFe] hydrogenases, a group of bacterial metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen to protons. In order to obtain data on species that closely resemble the architecture of the active site in [NiFe] hydrogenases a series of tetrahedral nickel complexes having a single terminal thiolate group will be synthesized and characterized. In order to stabilize these compounds, sterically demanding tripodal ancillary ligands will be employed. The reactivity of these complexes will be studied with regards to protonation and alkylation reactions, redox chemistry, and the production of thioesters. \r\n\r\nThe compounds studied in this project are significant because of their relevance to the properties of nickel in biological systems. The results of the research will refine our understanding of the relationship between molecular geometry and reactivity in [NiFe] hydrogenases. This project will provide a meaningful research experience to students with a variety of backgrounds, interests, and abilities. This will include high school, undergraduate, and masters level students. A number of these students will be women and/or from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
