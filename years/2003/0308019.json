 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the development of a mathematical\r\ntheory, models, and computational  tools which underpin the design and\r\nof macromolecular materials  and nano-composites.  These materials are\r\ncomprised of anisotropic molecules (nematic polymers), which undergo a\r\nspontaneous disorder-order transition  above a critical concentration.\r\nMaterials made from nematic  polymers achieve their properties through\r\nthe  collective  molecular  alignment structure.   Specific  molecular\r\nelements  yield  diverse  property  enhancements, from  strength  (the\r\nDupont  product Kevlar  and spider  silk), to  electrical conductivity\r\n(carbon  tubes  and   conducting  polymers),  to  barrier  penetration\r\nproperties  (discotic   clay  platelets).   The   major  technological\r\nchallenge is to extend results with fibers to other geometries such as\r\nfilms and  molds.  However, in  typical laminar processing  flows, the\r\nmolecular response is highly sensitive  to flow type and strength, and\r\nto molecular properties such  as shape and concentration.  In addition\r\nto  complex  dynamics,  during  flow  processing there  is  a  spatial\r\nconflict  between  interior  flow  response  and  molecular  anchoring\r\nconditions  at solid  boundaries.  The  result  is that  instead of  a\r\nuniform molecular  orientational distribution, as  in fiber processing\r\nflows, film and mold flows always generate morphology on length scales\r\nbetween the  molecules and  the processing devices.   These ubiquitous\r\nstructures are not understood, either theoretically or experimentally,\r\nyet they  dictate the effective  properties of the  end-use materials.\r\nThe research supported by this award will help to understand the dynamics\r\nand  structures  that  occur  in  typical  laminar  flows  of  nematic\r\npolymers.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern  high-performance materials  and nano-composites  are primarily\r\ndesigned with  simple elements,  from rod-like to  platelet molecules.\r\nRemarkable  property  enhancements  have  been achieved  thus  far  in\r\nlaboratory-scale experiments, with  increased strength and durability,\r\nthe ability to shield heat  or gases, and to tune electromagnetic wave\r\ntransmission.    The  technological  challenge   is  to   scale  these\r\nexperimental results  to industrially viable  processes and materials.\r\nThe challenge to  mathematics and computational science is  to build a\r\nsolid foundation of theory,  modeling, and simulation tools from which\r\nto  design and control  the processes  and final  material properties.\r\nThe theory of flowing molecules  in confined spaces is still unable to\r\npredict  and  control  the  molecular structure  created  during  flow\r\nprocessing.   Yet micron-scale  molecular structures  always  occur in\r\nprocessed films  and molds of nano-composites.   Furthermore, the bulk\r\nmaterial performance  properties as well  as their failure  and damage\r\nmodes  are   dominated  by  the  molecular   structures  generated  in\r\nprocessing.   The award will support a  research program  combining\r\ntheory, modeling, simulations, and comparisons with laboratory data in\r\nthe dynamics and structure properties of nematic polymer materials and\r\nnano-composites in processing flows.   These results will be the basis \r\nfor the next phase of the materials pipeline,  where  bulk  material\r\nproperties are deduced from the molecule properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
