 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's propose to conduct research on theoretical\r\nheavy ion physics. The emphasis of this proposal is reaction dynamics over a\r\nrange of beam energies, from intermediate ( > 10 AMeV) to ultra-relativistic\r\n(100 AGeV). Particular attention is paid to theory that is relevant to exper-\r\niments at the NSCL, GSI, CERN-SPS, and RHIC. The co-PIs have a long\r\ntradition of collaborating with experimental groups in the US and abroad,\r\nand they will continue to do so.\r\nThematically, themain emphasis lies on the investigation of correlations\r\nbetween emitted particles, as well as phase transitions in heavy ion reactions\r\nat different energy regimes. An important component of this proposal is the\r\ntheoretical support for the future Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) program\r\nand its connection to nuclear astrophysics. Since the RIA construction was\r\nidentifed as the highest priority in theNSAC long-range plan, it is impera-\r\ntive to deepen the theoretical underpinning for this feld.\r\nThe proposed topics are of present interest to the investigators in light\r\nof the present experimental situation. A traditional strength of the investi-\r\ngators is the ability to adapt their research directions to new experimental\r\nfndings, and it can be predicted that this will continue during the proposed\r\ngrant period.\r\nAlmost all of the funds proposed will be spent for salaries for two gradu-\r\nate students and one post-doctoral associate. In year one, there is a request\r\nfor some computer support. This is justifed, because almost all proposed\r\nresearch makes extensive use of numerical work.",
