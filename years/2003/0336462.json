 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) The University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and Metropolitan Community College (MCC) have developed a collaborative effort to increase associate and bachelors degrees in the STEM areas of biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics and physics. This project is testing and refining the working hypothesis that a broad, collaborative and multi-faceted approach will be effective in improving the pathways and opportunities for students pursuing STEM degrees. The goal is to simultaneously boost STEM enrollments and degrees awarded in six departments located in two different UNO colleges, as well as two MCC departments. To accomplish this, new associate degrees are being developed at MCC, articulation agreements for complete programs of study are being forged, and interdisciplinary options at UNO are being expanded. High school outreach, scholarships, tuition waivers, and enhanced learning center components provide the stimulus to attract and retain more students.\r\n\r\nThe project is being accomplished through close collaboration between the two institutions.  It is being coordinated by the PI, two co- PI's at UNO, two co-PI's at MCC, and involves a number of faculty and staff at both institutions.  In addition, MCC is providing an Outreach Coordinator and UNO is providing an Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences to oversee articulation issues and a faculty member to carry out project evaluation.  The scope of the project includes the following: high school outreach; articulation agreements; scholarships for underrepresented, financially needy, and nontraditional STEM majors at UNO; bridge scholarships for transfer students; new internship opportunities at MCC and UNO; early undergraduate research at UNO; an effective mathematics and science learning center at UNO; and new interdisciplinary courses and majors at UNO in Bioinformatics, Information Assurance, Medicinal Chemistry and Neuroscience. \r\n \r\n",
