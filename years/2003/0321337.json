 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal to acquire a nanoindentor system from MTS corporation to support exciting and diverse\r\nresearch and training at the intersection of nano and microsystems technology.  In its\r\nbase configuration, the load resolution is 50 nN and the displacement resolution is 0.01 nm. These can be\r\nsignificantly lowered to 1 nN and 0.0002 nm, respectively with an additional indentation head. The\r\nnanoindentor is typically used to indent (push the tip into) a material while simultaneously measuring the\r\nload and displacement. The concept is common to many techniques in materials characterization, except\r\nthat the mode of deformation is extremely complicated. However, with suitable analysis, typically via the\r\nfinite element method, the measured load vs. displacement curve can be inverted to infer a host of\r\nimportant material properties. Because the measurement area is so small (on the order of 100s of nms),\r\nthe instrument is ideally suited to obtain quantitative information regarding mechanical properties as a\r\nfunction of position in complex material systems and structures.\r\nThe nanoindentor will be the heart of a unique micro/nanomechanical characterization facility at the\r\nUniversity of Colorado (CU). It will greatly impact numerous diverse research efforts that are currently\r\nsupported including applications in the characterization of advanced materials, experimental mechanics of\r\nmicromechanical structures and devices, studies of biological materials/systems ranging from protein/cell\r\nstructure up to full arteries, and as a nanomanufacturing tool for the development of nanoscale circuits\r\nusing biomolecular templates. \r\nInitially the nanoindentor will be used by the groups of 12 faculty members, spanning six\r\nDepartments and three Colleges at CU. It will be used to support research projects and instructional\r\nactivities at the graduate and undergraduate levels. A number of activities are planned to increase our\r\nuser base and the overall level of diverse expertise with the instrument. These include: i) the development\r\nof a Micro/nanosystems Forum in which two types speakers will be solicited: those with expertise in\r\nnanoindentation and related fields, and those with interesting research activities that may be able to make\r\nuse of the nanoindentor; ii) the development of a website devoted to activities using the nanoindentor; iii)\r\ndissemination of capabilities and results, along with the solicitation of potential collaborative users at\r\nsemiannual meetings of our NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (CAMPmode and\r\nMAST); iv) a user-fee structure that requires users to disseminate their results to our user community; and\r\nv) a plan to recruit new users, particularly underrepresented groups and women pursuing advanced\r\ndegrees.",
