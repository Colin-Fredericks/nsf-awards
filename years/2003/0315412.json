With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, he is applying low energy electron microscopy and x-ray photoemission microscopy to the study of model three way catalysts.  In the presence of CO, O2, NO and SO2 reactants, oxide supported noble metal catalysts undergo morphological and compositional changes on the nanometer scale that can be monitored using these methods.  Results of these surface kinetic and dynamic studies provide understanding for the improved design of these catalytic systems. \r\n\r\nIn order to continually reduce the emissions from automobile exhaust, improvements in catalytic converter technology must be made.  This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed dynamics of operation of the commonly used three way catalytic converter.  Using state of the art microscopic methods, in situ studies of the reaction process, and direct monitoring of the operational catalyst, Professor Bauer and his coworkers are developing the fundamental understanding needed to improve catalyst design. \r\n",
