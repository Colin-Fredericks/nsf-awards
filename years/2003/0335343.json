 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, geoenvironmental engineers have been responsible mainly for characterizing contaminated sites, designing in-situ barriers and landfills, and characterizing the use of waste materials.  Recently, geoenvironmental engineers have expanded their involvement in risk assessment and remediation of contaminated sites, designing and monitoring barrier systems to contain difficult contamination, such as non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), and developing environmentally benign large-scale reuse of waste and recycled materials.  In addition, innovative waste management strategies, such as bioreactor landfills, end-uses of closed landfills, and subaqueous waste containment, are being developed.  Such an expanded scope of geoenvironmental engineering requires a broader multi-disciplinary knowledge, particularly hydrogeology, geochemistry, microbiology, as well as economics and public policy.  Geoenvironmental engineers are also challenged to utilize rapidly developing technologies such as sensor technologies, nanotechnologies, and information technologies into the practice of geoenvironmental engineering.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workshop is to bring together geoenvironmental researchers, practitioners and other interested persons to review the recent advances in technology and understanding, as well as identify the technical challenges in the design, operation and monitoring of geoenvironmental systems.  The specific objectives of the workshop are:\r\n\tTo summarize the current state-of-the art and the state-of-practice of geoenvironmental engineering.\r\n\tTo identify the specific roles of geoenvironmental engineers.\r\n\tTo identify gaps in knowledge of the current geoenvironmental systems.\r\n\tTo explore how emerging technologies, such as sensor technologies, nanotechnologies and information technologies may be utilized for geoenvironmental systems.\r\n\tTo identify and prioritize research needs in geoenvironmental systems.\r\n\tTo identify geoenvironmental educational needs.\r\n\tTo facilitate collaboration among researchers and practicing engineers.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will involve participants with different backgrounds from academia, government agencies, and engineering practice.  An effort will be made to include a diverse group of professionals, including under-represented minorities, and also educators from small colleges.  A workshop webpage and a workshop e-mail discussion list will be set up to enable an exchange of ideas before and after the workshop towards the development of a coordinated plan specifically designed to solve subsurface pollution problems.  The workshop proceedings will be posted on the workshop website and relevant web sites.\r\n",
