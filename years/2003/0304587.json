The variational \r\ntechniques involve the study of  constrained variational  problems \r\nfor lagrangian cycles. These problems can be formulated in arbitrary \r\nKaehler (or symplectic) manifolds and involve minimizing volume among \r\nlagrangians that represent a fixed homology class and proving optimal \r\nregularity of the minimizer. In particular the project hopes to show \r\nthat if the ambient manifold is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold then, for a \r\nsuitably formulated problem, the minimizer is special lagrangian. It \r\nhas long been known that the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian \r\nsubmanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the ambient \r\nmanifold is Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate the \r\nregularity properties of the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian \r\nsubmanifold of a Kaehler-Einstein manifold.  In  particular, it \r\nintends to investigate the conditions under which the flow does and \r\ndoes not develop singularities in finite time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariational problems with geometric constraints and mean curvature \r\nflow in codimension greater than one are on the frontier of \r\nmathematical analysis. These problems are natural in geometry but \r\nthey are also important in many different applied problems. In \r\nmaterial science a ``model'' problem asks to find a minimizer of \r\n``kinetic energy'' among area preserving maps between disks and to \r\nfind the optimal smoothness of the minimizer. At present, the \r\nexistence of a minimizer is known but nothing is known about its \r\nsingularities. Parts of this project are closely related to this kind \r\nof  ``regularity'' question. In string theory  well known work \r\nconjectures the existence of a certain class of volume minimizing \r\nthree dimensional surfaces called special lagrangian submanifolds. \r\nThis project is a direct attempt to answer this question in the \r\naffirmative.  Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many \r\ndifferent physical phenomena. This project  attempts to exploit  the \r\n``lagrangian'' constraint to get an understanding of mean curvature \r\nflow  in higher codimensions. This subject is relatively unexplored. \r\nThe techniques investigated in this project hold the promise of \r\nenhancing the interaction between geometry and various fields of \r\napplied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new results and \r\ntechniques into these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
