 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Gardella and his group at the State University of New York at Buffalo are examining the surface composition of various model polymer systems. Using a range of surface spectroscopic probes, the composition, polymer molecular weight characteristics, and the surface reaction kinetics of siloxane- and fluorocarbon-based polymer systems are studied.  Copolymers, polymer blends, and polymer/molecule mixtures are examined, with the goal of providing a quantitative understanding of the relationship between surface structure and composition, and the reactivity and properties of these materials. This project includes an extensive effort to integrate research with the education of undergraduate students and secondary school teachers.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the composition and structure of polymer and polymer blend materials is the goal of this research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Information obtained from these studies is useful in applications of polymer materials in microelectronics, packaging and pharmaceuticals. \r\n\r\n",
