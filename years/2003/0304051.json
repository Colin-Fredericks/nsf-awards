 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNER:New Nanoscale Probes of Molecular Motors\r\n\r\nOne of the major objectives of the National Nanotechnology Initiative is to develop a fundamental understanding of nanoscale biological structures and processes, such as the mechanics of molecular motor proteins. Molecular motor proteins are enzymes that convert chemical energy directly into mechanical work.  These proteins are found in a vast array of biological processes, such as the contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle, cell division, and trafficking materials inside cells and across the cell membrane.  Recent experimental advances in motor protein biophysics have resulted in unprecedented insight \r\ninto the mechanics of single motor molecules. For instance, it was found that the molecular motor myosin makes discrete 5nm steps, and stalls when opposed by approximately 5 piconewtons (pN) of force.\r\nDespite this progress, a major obstacle in motor research has been the\r\ninability to resolve the action of the working stroke, when the load-bearing domain of the motor moves forward.  The PI proposes to measure the dynamics of the working stroke with sub-nanometer resolution on timescales as small as 25 nanoseconds using a novel light-\r\nscattering motor assay.  The PI's approach will also provide insight into the mechanical properties of cells and cell movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
