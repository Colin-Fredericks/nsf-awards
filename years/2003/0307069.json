Arone\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to apply calculus of functors, especially the\r\n\"orthogonal calculus\" version developed by M. Weiss, to the study of spaces of\r\nembeddings. In more detail, let M, N be smooth manifolds. The PI would like to\r\nstudy the space of embeddings Emb(M,N) by taking the cartesian product of one or\r\ntwo of these manifolds with a generic Euclidean space, and investigating the\r\nproperties of the obtained functor of the Eucliedan space. The general theory of\r\ncalculus associates with such a functor a sequence of \"derivatives\", where the\r\nn-th derivative is a spectrum with an action of the orthogonal group O(n), and a\r\n\"Taylor tower\" - a sequence of approximations by polynomial functors. The study\r\nof the derivatives of the embedding functor leads one to consider a rather\r\nbeautiful array of topological constructions, some classical, some new. The\r\nclassical constructions that one encounters include (a generalization of) the\r\nFulton-McPherson compactification, partition posets and spaces of trees. The PI\r\nhopes that this project will yield significant new insights into the topology of\r\nspaces of embeddings and automorphisms of manifolds.\r\n\r\nManifolds are among the basic objects of study in mathematics. Manifolds come in\r\ndifferent dimensions. One dimensional manifolds are curves, two dimensional\r\nmanifolds are surfaces, and high dimensional manifolds are suitable extensions\r\nof these concepts. One of the basic questions about manifolds is: given a\r\nmanifold M, what are the possible symmetries (diffeomorphisms) of M? It was T.\r\nGoodwillie who came up with the very striking idea that rather than approach\r\nsuch questions \"one manifold at at a time\", one should study systematically how\r\nthe space of symmetries (or whatever it is we want to study) changes, as one\r\nvaries the manifold. This results in a theory analogous to the classical\r\ndifferential calculus, where functions are studied via their derivatives, Taylor\r\npolynomials and so forth. This idea provides one with a powerful and beautiful \r\nframework for studying manifolds (and other objects of interest in mathematics, \r\nespecially topology), subsumes a fair amount of classical techniques, and leads \r\none to discover beautiful new constructions in topology.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
