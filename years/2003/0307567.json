 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), examines the\r\nantecedents of public support for U.S. military incursions into foreign states. In particular, it will\r\nexamine the factors that motivate U.S. citizens to support the proposed invasion of Iraq through\r\nmethodologies developed in social psychology. The current international situation presents a\r\nunique yet perishable opportunity to gather empirical data that address this topic. A growing body\r\nof evidence suggests that individuals make punishment decisions on the basis of just deserts rather\r\nthan utilitarian justifications such as deterrence or incapacitation. The present research will\r\nexamine whether citizens -- contacted through a nationally representative survey -- respond to\r\npotential military action against sovereign states in a similar manner. Specifically, it is\r\nhypothesized that support for war will be determined primarily by an individual's perception that\r\nthe foreign state is deserving of the invasion, and that the invasion represents a morally appropriate\r\nand proportional response to prior acts of harm. It is further predicted that concerns with\r\nincapacitation (e.g., limiting Iraq's ability to wage war), deterrence (e.g., inhibiting other potential\r\n\"rogue nations\" from threatening U.S, interests), and general utility (e.g., economic outcomes) will\r\nbe only weakly related to attitudes about the invasion. These studies represent an important step\r\nforward in tracing individual psychology to matters of international relations, and will provide a\r\ntest of whether micro-level theories of punishment can be extended to include macro-level\r\nsituations.\r\n",
