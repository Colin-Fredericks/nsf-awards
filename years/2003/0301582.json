In this challenge, there is enormous\r\nopportunity for contributions from geometric function theory and\r\nnonlinear partial differential equations. Broadly speaking, this theory is\r\nabout weakly differentiable mappings which distort small circles in a controlled manner (finite distortion). It elevates all\r\nthe analytic and geometric spirit of holomorphic functions in the complex\r\nplane to higher dimensions; domains of the Euclidean  n-space or\r\nRiemannian manifolds,  Mappings of finite distortion owe much of their\r\nimportance to recent developments in\r\nseveral fields of applied mathematics: continuum mechanics, nonlinear\r\nelasticity, material science, composites with  microstructure, crystals,\r\nand so forth. However, in this proposal we focus on practical questions\r\nonly through  mathematical formulations, sometimes without proclaiming\r\ndefinite answers. We emphasize the fundamental role of the Jacobian\r\ndeterminant and other nonlinear differential expressions, called  null\r\nLagrangians, which have driven (over the past twelve years) a very\r\nproductive study of mappings with unbounded distortion. The present\r\nknowledge of null Lagrangians will tell us something about the regularity\r\nand topological behavior of those mappings. This also brings  us closer to\r\nthe methods of harmonic analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations. However, we depart\r\nfrom the earlier theories, which are governed by\r\nuniformly elliptic systems, and move into the realm of degenerate elliptic\r\nequations, where important new applications lie. \r\n\r\n Broader Impact.\r\n\r\nHopefully this proposal gives some appreciation of the\r\ndiversity of applications and directions in which current research of the\r\nPI is moving, as well as a glimpse of the substantial body of joint work\r\nwith young scholars. It is at this point where the proposed research meets\r\nthe broader impact criteria, such as: effective training and educational\r\nmaterials, enhancing partnerships, participation of under-represented\r\ngroups from non-PhD granting institutions in the USA and abroad, women and\r\nmen. \r\nThe Principal Investigator plans to organize a conference at Syracuse to bring together\r\nresearchers in geometric function theory and in applied areas. The\r\nproposed program reflects continued efforts of the PI to reach out\r\ngraduate students. In the final analysis, education is the path to\r\nopportunities for countless individuals, and the mathematical community as\r\na whole is the beneficiary.\r\n\r\n",
