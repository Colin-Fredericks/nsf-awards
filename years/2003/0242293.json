Berque\r\nTitle:  REU Site - Research Experiences in Computer Science for Students at Undergraduate Institutions\r\n\r\nThe project directly impacts twenty-four students (eight during each of three summers) by giving them first-hand experience with several of the most rewarding  activities  that  characterize  graduate  study  and  research careers.  These  activities  include: conducting research as part of a team, disseminating results, and participating in a community of scholars.  Students have access to DePauw University's computing facilities, including a pen-based computing collaboratory that facilitates the study of multiple machine interfaces.  This Collaboratory was recently enhanced with a NSF MRI grant and houses a 72\" diagonal touch-sensitive electronic whiteboard,  four  61\"  diagonal  touch-sensitive plasma displays, and  twenty  Pentium  student stations that use pen-based video tablets as their primary input device.  The grant is also funding a display server, six  handheld  Windows-CE computers,  and a database server  for  experimentation with  wireless database access.  The program is geared toward students enrolled at undergraduate institutions who have had little exposure to graduate departments. \r\n\r\nThe research projects are drawn from a number of fields of Computer Science including  Text  Summarization,  Wireless  Database  Access, Multiple Machine  Interfaces,  Programming Language Pedagogy, and Assistive Technology.\r\n",
