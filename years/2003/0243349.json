 "awd_abstract_narration": "Provenance and data derivation are important to many aspects of scientific computation. In \r\nmolecular biology, where data is repeatedly copied, corrected, and transformed as it passes \r\nthrough numerous genomic databases, understanding where data has come from and how it \r\narrived in the user's database is of crucial to the trust a scientist will put in that data, yet this \r\ninformation is seldom captured properly.  In astronomy, useful results may have been been \r\nobtained by filtering, transforming, and analyzing some base data by a complex assemblage of \r\nprograms, yet we lack good tools for recording how these programs were connected and the \r\ncontext in which they were run. \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the new insights that it will bring to the \r\nimportant topics of data provenance and data derivation.  \r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity relate primarily to the establishment of \r\nnew ties between distinct disciplines that have strong interests in data derivation and provenance \r\nbut have not, historically, talked to each other. These new ties will tend to accelerate both \r\nresearch and education in the participating disciplines.",
