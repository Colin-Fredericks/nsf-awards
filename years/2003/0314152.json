 "awd_abstract_narration": "Krylov subspace methods are widely used for the iterative solution of large\r\nsparse linear systems that arise in scientific and engineering applications.\r\nThe standard Krylov subspace methods have been developed based on either the\r\nsingle starting Lanczos procedure (SSLP) or Arnoldi procedure.\r\nSince the multiple starting Lanczos procedure (MSLP) was invented,\r\nthe superior robustness of MSLP to SSLP has been demonstrated through a variety \r\nof applications. Block Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems with \r\nmultiple right-hand sides have been derived from MSLP. However, there has been \r\nrare study of deriving Krylov subspace methods from MSLP for systems with a \r\nsingle right-hand side. Of course, multiple right-hand sides includes the single right-hand\r\nside as its special case. The PI, however, expects that finer methods can be\r\nobtained when we focus on the single right-hand side case. Tony Chan and the PI\r\nrecently made the first attempt in this direction and methods named ML(n)BiCG\r\nand ML(n)BiCGSTAB, respectively, were developed. This project continues this\r\ntrend and aims at (i) generalizing the existing standard methods from SSLP\r\nto MSLP; (ii) reducing the storage requirement of ML(n)BiCGSTAB; (iii) improving \r\nthe robustness of ML(n)BiCG. This is the next step toward attainment of the PI's \r\nlong-term goal of developing parallel Krylov subspace methods. The feasibility of the \r\nproposed aims have been demonstrated by the PI's preliminary studies of \r\nML(n)BiCGSTAB and of a transpose-free MSLP algorithm. The approaches employed \r\nto attain the aims are based on certain ways of adapting the derivation of BiCG from SSLP and\r\nthe derivation of the BiCGSTAB(n) from BiCG.\r\n\r\nThe results will be tested extensively with industrial databases, for example,\r\nthe Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection. If successful,\r\nthe research proposed will be significant because it will\r\ndramatically improve the robustness of the existing methods and, as a result,\r\nsignificantly drive down the time and cost in computation. It also allows for\r\nthe development of more robust parallel Krylov subspace methods, for example,\r\nby rescheduling the operations into parallelism. The research will also provide \r\nideal topics for class learning and thesis research. Moreover, the PI once participated\r\nin research in Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, University of Wyoming, on\r\nremoving nitrogen oxides from combustion exhaust streams. The resulting\r\nmethods of the project will promote the collaboration in future because more robust\r\nalgorithms will then be available to use in solving the PDE models\r\narising from the collaborative study.\r\n\r\n",
