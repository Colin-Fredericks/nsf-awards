The co-organizers are Professor Jan Leach at Kansas State University and Professor Shinji Tsuyumu at Shizuoka University in Japan.  The meeting will bring together research scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two countries where important and exciting progress in this area of science is being undertaken.  With the advent of new genomic tools and the use of these tools in combination with classic genetic tools and resources, the progress toward deciphering the molecular basis of plant-microbe interactions is rapidly accelerating.  Discussions will focus on advances made in two intimately linked areas of plant-pathogen interactions, i.e., pathogen virulence and avirulence and host recognition and response.  \r\n\r\nThe co-organizers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract the best biological scientists to participate.  The seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be published on this web site and also as a book.        \r\n\r\n\r\n",
