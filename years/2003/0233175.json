The combined efforts of the German and US groups will test the hypothesis that understanding of language is action based and extends the hypothesis to the domain of numerical cognition.  According to the theory, words and phrases are indexed to perceptual symbols or actual objects in the environment.  Ultimately, understanding language is understanding the actions described to the implications for action in the situation described.  Recent work has supported the hypothesis for English, and the present work will test it for German.  This work has considerable implication for both basic and applied research.\r\n\r\nThe project also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.\r\n",
