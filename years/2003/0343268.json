 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will undertake department level reform at the University of Central Florida to reengineer the Undergraduate Industrial Engineering program.  This comprehensive multi-faceted plan will involve making significant changes in the curriculum, transforming faculty instructional strategies, introducing new technology in the classrooms while providing additional developmental experiences for the students, as well as developing aggressive strategies of recruiting students into the Industrial Engineering Profession. The specific objectives\r\ndesigned to be pursued during this implementation grant to achieve the stated vision and goals of the project include the following:\r\n\r\nA. Reengineering of the Curriculum to include courses that prepares students for careers in\r\nnontraditional manufacturing industries (i.e. service industries, information technology\r\nindustries); also the curriculum will be modified to allow students to Minor in Engineering\r\nManagement to adequately prepare for job positions and role responsibilities in engineering\r\nmanagement and leadership\r\n\r\nB. Integrating Cognitive Learning Theory, which emphasizes human information processing,\r\nwith instructional design theory, which emphasizes strategies of instruction. To drive\r\nspecific course development and learning pedagogy that will influence instructional\r\nstrategies, experiential learning, and student experiences in the classroom.\r\n\r\nC. Integrating Cognitive Learning Theory and Instructional Design Theory, to identify\r\nappropriate uses of technology to support classroom instruction goals and student learning\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nD. Developing aggressive recruiting strategies that increase awareness of IE careers among HS\r\nstudents and serves to entice them to pursue Industrial Engineering with special emphasis\r\nupon exposing members of historically underrepresented groups and females.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
