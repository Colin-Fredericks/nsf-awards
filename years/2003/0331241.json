Tinker and Shirley Dutton\r\nEAR-0331241\r\nUniversity of Texas\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAcquisition of cores and other rock material is critical for conducting much of the geologic research supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Earth Sciences. Because of the volume of material involved, long-term storage, preservation, and curation of cores and other collections are beyond the resources of most NSF-funded academic researchers. Most researchers have a place where cores, rock samples, and fossils can be accessed during the initial stages of research and sampling but lack an adequate facility where these materials can be permanently preserved, accessed, and sampled/resampled as needed.  \r\nAt present no facility exists for the permanent storage and curation of lithified (\"hard-rock\") rock cores, samples, or paleontologic collections acquired during NSF-funded research for continental-based projects. The Bureau of Economic Geology of The University of Texas at Austin proposes to establish a facility at their Houston Research Center (HRC) for long-term storage and curation of core and rock samples and selected paleontologic collections that have been or will be acquired by NSF research projects. The center would curate this material and facilitate continued access to, and use of, the material by researchers in the academic community. Laboratories and equipment needed for examining and sampling the material will be provided for the use of visiting researchers. Sufficient space is available at the Houston facility for the permanent storage and curation of NSF rock cores and other collections.\r\nA geological curator, a core handler, and a database manager will store and curate the core and other samples, respond to requests by researchers for samples, assist visiting researchers at the facility, and maintain the metadata associated with the samples as part of the GeoInformatics system. An Advisory Committee consisting of four to six members of the academic community who are experienced in scientific curation will be established to review operations and policies and advise the Bureau on curation of NSF cores at the HRC.\r\n",
