 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Hartland will study the material properties of nanospheres and nanorods by means of ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy.  Specifically, the technique relies on beats due to coherently excited vibrational modes that result from short pulse laser illumination.  Electronic properties are probed by examining electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling.  Six individual projects will be undertaken, ranging from measurements of the symmetric breathing modes of metal nanoparticles at high temperatures, through ultrafast studies of electron-electron interactions in bimetallic particles, to measurements of the time-resolved anisotropy of single Au nanorods.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research includes the development of new methods that will result in applications to the technology of nanoparticles.  Teaching and training of students will be done at all levels, inclusive of research participation.  The students will thereby receive training in one of the forefront areas of materials science and chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or employment in industry, academia, or government laboratories.\r\n\r\n",
