Maciej Ciesielski in the US, Bruno Rouzeyre and Emmanuel Boutillon in France, and Rolf Drechsler in Germany plan an international project to develop new software computer tools.  The objective is to develop fundamental techniques in design verification and architectural synthesis based on modern data structures, such as decision diagrams.  They will explore the application of Taylor Expansion Diagrams (TED) to verification designs at the behavioral and register transfer levels (RTL).  They will also investigate the application of TEDs to architectural synthesis from algorithmic descriptions.  The project takes advantage of complementary expertise in architectural and high level synthesis, test, and binary/word-level decision diagrams. \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF, the CNRS, and the DAAD.   NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS and DAAD will support visits by French and German researchers and graduate students to the United States. \r\n",
