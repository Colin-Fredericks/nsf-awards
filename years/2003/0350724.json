These objectives are being achieved by focusing on active and cooperative learning, visualization of concepts, and use of simulations in post-calculus introductory probability and statistics courses at the University of Alabama - Huntsville and Middle Tennessee State University via the adaptation and implementation of two recently developed National Science Foundation funded materials. The materials are (a) A Data-Oriented, Active Learning, Post-Calculus Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Methods, and Theory (DUE-9950476) and the (b) Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics (DUE-9652870). Project activities include faculty enhancement at the institutions, the respective institutional adaptation and implementation (A&I) of the materials, the evaluation of the A&I of the materials, and the assessment of students learning while using the materials. The University of Alabama Huntsville is providing the evaluation.\r\n",
