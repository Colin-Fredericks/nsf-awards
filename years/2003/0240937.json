 "awd_abstract_narration": "The condensed matter physics project will focus on self-assembly methods for fabricating nanostructures with one-dimensional order.  Particular emphasis is placed on achieving atomically-precise structures, such as a chain of atoms as the ultimate nanowire.  Silicon surfaces are chosen as templates because silicon is the natural interface for connecting nanodevices to microdevices and because of the wealth of processing methods developed for silicon technology.  The following goals will be pursued: (1) \tProduce atomic chains on silicon with tailored properties, such as dimensionality, metallicity, and magnetism; (2) Map energy bands and Fermi surfaces of atomic chains by angle-resolved photoemission and search for predicted exotic states in one dimension; and (3) Explore fundamental limits of data storage at the atomic scale, using self-assembled tracks at surfaces.  The budget is primarily devoted to the education of graduate students.  They will gain expertise in the field of nanotechnology that will serve them well for careers in academia, industry, and government.  A course on nanoscience and technology is under development that aims at a web-based, up-to-date introduction to new and exciting developments in this rapidly-evolving field.  This project can be expected to have impact on the fabrication methods for new materials in microelectronics, particularly in self-assembled storage media.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is the design of artificial materials with one-dimensional character, for example chains of metal atoms at silicon surfaces. An atom chain represents the ultimate nanowire. The wave functions of the electrons in atomic wires will be determined in order to explain conductivity in one dimension, where exotic phenomena are predicted.  This project can be expected to have impact on the fabrication methods for new materials in microelectronics, particularly in data storage. The self-assembly methods developed during this project enable mass-production of nanowires and patterned storage media on silicon and extend silicon technology down to the single nanometer regime. By going all the way to the atomic limit it is possible to achieve structures with atomic perfection, such as a memory with tracks exactly 5 atoms wide and a single atom storing one bit.  The proposed budget is primarily for the support of graduate students, including summer projects for beginning graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.  They will gain expertise in the field of nanotechnology that will serve them well for careers in academia, industry, and government.\r\n\r\n",
