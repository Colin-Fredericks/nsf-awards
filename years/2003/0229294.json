 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Explore Evolution\" is a three-year project that uses a combination of traveling exhibits and activity kits to introduce the concept of evolution to museum audiences and 4-H groups.  Six museum partners will collaborate on the development of eleven interactive exhibit modules on the following topics:  disease in humans, eye development in animals, fruit fly diversity, sexual selection, hominoid development and extinction.  The museum consortium includes the Kansas Museum and Biodiversity Center, Museum of the Rockies (MT), Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, Science Museum of Minnesota, University of Nebraska State Museum and the Exhibits Museum of the University of Michigan.  The inquiry-based activity kits will be modeled after the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's \"Wonderwise\" kits, funded in part by NSF, and designed for middle school audiences.  An \"Explore Evolution\" website will be launched to support the exhibits and activity kits.  Dissemination will occur through museum education programs as well as a consortium of 4-H programs in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Michigan, Nebraska and Wyoming.  It is anticipated that more than 1.8 million museum visitors and 800,000 4-H members will participate in this project.",
