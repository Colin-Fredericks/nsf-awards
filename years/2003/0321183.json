A global network of ring lasers has the potential to provide for very sensitive (10-8) geodetic measurements including fluctuations in the earth's rotation rate or length of day measurements, polar wobble, solid earth tides and the rotational component of seismic waves.  The development project supports sensor development in an academic setting and will serve to impart students with knowledge of optical gyroscopes and the natural phenomena that affect these sensitive instruments.  The project will also foster collaborations between Hendrix College faculty and students and a local aerospace engineering firm (BEI Sensor and Systems) that is interested in assisting with development of the ring laser for its potential commercial applications.  BEI will offer an internship program for Hendrix students to gain experience working with aerospace engineers.  The PI has also developed  collaborations with University of Arkansas and regional seismologists interested in applications of ring laser data as a complement to existing geodetic and seismic networks proximal to the New Madrid fault system in the central U.S.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n\r\n",
