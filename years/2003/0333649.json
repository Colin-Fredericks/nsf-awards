 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating the characteristics of \"entry points\" to NSDL that are specifically geared to middle schoolers to promote science information literacy and more generally, to use NSDL resources. Master teachers and students are involved in all aspects of this project's research and development, with an Advisory Group providing guidance on several aspects of the project. These include the selection of the Master Teachers; the creation of a functional specification for the entry points; the development of prototypes; the study of their characteristics from both a human computer interface and a learning gains perspective; and evaluation of their impact on student attitudes and performance. This work is informing the NSDL community's understanding of how to provide services tailored to the needs of children, and more generally, it is contributing guidance to the integration of future services into the NSDL core.",
