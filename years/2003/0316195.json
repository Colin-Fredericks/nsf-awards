 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the role of three-dimensional diffusion in the energization and transport of relativistic electrons in the earth's radiation belts.  There are three primary objectives of the research: (1) A diffusion tensor which will describe the diffusion process and allows all three of the adiabatic invariants to be broken will be derived using an analytical phase-space Lagrangian approach.  This diffusion tensor will include the effects of VLF (Very Low Frequency) wave-particle resonances as well as bounce and drift frequency (ELF and ULF) wave-particle resonances.  (2) A new computer code will be developed to solve the 3-D, time-dependent phase-space diffusion equation.  This new code will be able to incorporate a variety of diffusion tensor elements including the newly derived tensors mentioned in task 1.  (3) The newly developed code will be run using a variety of transport coefficients to evaluate which transport processes dominate under different conditions.  This will include comparison of the model results with other radiation belt simulations and with spacecraft data.  The project will involve a PhD graduate student and the results will be useful in space weather nowcasting and forecasting.",
