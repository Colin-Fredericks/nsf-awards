 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops and implements a freshman oriented multi-disciplinary team design experience using distance collaboration between the University of Kentucky Lexington and Paducah campuses. The project addresses the following issues pertaining to first-year engineering programs:\r\na. There are few meaningful yet quantitative design experiences geared towards engineering freshmen. \r\nb. There is a need to introduce the concept of \"distributed collaboration\" to engineering students. Many engineers find themselves working as a member of a geographically distributed design team, despite the fact that they have not participated in such teams during college.\r\nc. There is a need to increase the number of students entering the engineering field from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nTeams of introductory engineering students from two campuses work on designing a mechanism or assembly using solid-modeling software that can then be prototyped using a 3-D printer. Group communication is facilitated using dedicated interactive video conferencing capabilities already in place at both locations, including web-based video and interactive television, and supplemented by telephone, email, and facsimile. Students from local high schools participate in full-day workshops to create a simple solid model, and see it fabricated by the 3-D printer. Each workshop includes tours of the engineering facilities, and a presentation outlining the career opportunities available in engineering.\r\n",
