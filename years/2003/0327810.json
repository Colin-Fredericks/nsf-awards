 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis International Workshop on \"Historical preservation of structures with FRP composites\" to be held in Lecce, Italy, on June 10-11, 2004, following the First International Conference on Innovative Materials and Technology for Construction and Restoration (IMTCR-04).\r\nIn the last two decades, advanced composites (fiber-reinforced polymer or FRP) have gained\r\nconsiderable worldwide interest and growing acceptance in the construction industry. The\r\nhistorical preservation of structures is one of the most appealing applications of FRP\r\ncomposites in the construction field. However, this application presents some critical\r\nissues still not sufficiently investigated: long-term durability of FRP-repaired\r\nstructures; compatibility of the FRP system with the parent material; minimal invasiveness\r\nand reversibility of the upgrade; optimal material selection.\r\nAll the aforementioned issues, of paramount importance for intervention on structures of\r\narchitectural/historical interest, are also relevant when dealing with any other category\r\nof structure, when looking at long-term performance and global cost-benefit balance. Each\r\nof these issues requires an interdisciplinary effort between researchers with\r\nmaterial-oriented and structural-oriented backgrounds and experts of architectural\r\nrestoration.  The primary objectives of the workshop are to review the advances in research on the topic\r\nof the workshop; provide to researchers with material-oriented and structural-oriented\r\nbackgrounds and to experts of architectural restoration the opportunity to interact and\r\ndevelop a cooperation network; identify the gaps of knowledge on the sub-topics of the\r\nworkshop (long-term durability, compatibility, minimal invasiveness and reversibility, and\r\noptimal material selection); identify major barriers to the effective utilization of\r\nadvanced composites for historical preservation; renew the human network of experts in the\r\nfield and integrate new entrants; prioritize and document the needs for effective research\r\npolicies and programs.\r\n\r\n",
