The emphasis is placed on some key\r\nproblems where these areas intersect. These problems include the\r\nstudy of higher spin curves, quantum K-theory, enumerative\r\ngeometry, and Frobenius manifolds.\r\n\r\nGromov--Witten theory was born in early 1990's through the\r\ninteraction of mathematics and physics. On the mathematical side,\r\nit starts with Gromov's invention of a new way to produce\r\nsymplectic invariants. On the physical side, it was Witten's\r\nstudy of string theory. Although of a relatively short history,\r\nGromov--Witten theory is a major active field of research.  This\r\nis due not only to its powerful solutions to old problems, but\r\nalso to its interdisciplinary nature, with continuing inputs from\r\nseveral fields of mathematics and string theory. This project\r\nproposes to investigate Gromov--Witten theory through various\r\nperspectives and to search for its applications in other subject\r\nareas.\r\n",
