 "awd_abstract_narration": "0300421\r\nMortazawi\r\n\r\nThe RF power amplifier is one of the key components in radio frequency communications. It is the determining factor in cost, power consumption, reliability and system performance. Since the power amplifier is the most power consuming element in a communication system, the design of high efficiency power amplifiers has drawn considerable attention in the past several years. The requirement for high efficiency originates from the limitations imposed by the available dc power, as well as the size, weight and cost requirements for the system. These requirements are even more severe for mobile and space borne communication applications. In response to the above technology needs, this program proposes to develop novel approaches for the design of efficient, linear and compact RF power amplifier architectures.\r\n\r\nThe key objective of the proposed research is to incorporate thin film barium strontium titanate (BST) ferroelectrics into power amplifier circuits for improved linearity and efficiency. This approach would allow significant benefits in terms of better matching and control of the circuit properties through the introduction of the ferroelectric components to yield compact, versatile and reproducible designs.  Specifically the PI will design RF power amplifiers integrated with BST varactor based predistortion linearizers and tunable matching networks to improve the amplifier's overall performance and functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Research\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the design of low cost, power efficient and compact transmitters for electronic communications at RF, microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. Services and applications provided by satellites will also benefit from these developments due to the limitations on available dc power.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact of the Proposed Research\r\n\r\nThe combination of RF Engineering and Materials Science expertise required here will provide rapid insight and learning into the development of tunable high frequency electronics for wireless applications, where there are numerous applications of strong commercial value. The dissemination of research will be based on journal publications, conference/workshop presentations and through their collaboration with ATMI. The Radiation Laboratory at UofM offers biweekly seminars on current research that are well attended by both graduate as well as undergraduates.\r\n",
