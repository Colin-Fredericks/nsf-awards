 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nMembrane reactors combine reaction and separation in the same unit and shift the equilibrium and increase yield by removing a product as it is formed.  Selective oxygen permeable membranes may be used as selective catalytic reactors for example to make syngas commercially.  The PI plans to use photolithographic techniques to fabricate multi-functional catalytic membranes consisting of assembled catalyst clusters on a functioning selective oxygen permeable membrane.  The use of photolithography should result in a highly reproducible fabrication process that will reduce the intra-batch and inter-batch variability that is inherent in current catalytic manufacturing techniques.  The fabrication process will reduce membrane fabrication cost by producing an automated manufacturing process similar to the wafer fabrication technology employed in the semiconductor industry.  The enhancement effects on the oxygen flux through the membrane will provide the technology necessary for selective oxygen permeable membranes to become industrially attractive.  The technique could also influence the study of model catalysts by fabricating multi-component, multi-functional heterogeneous catalysts that can be tested and characterized to gain fundamental information about the functionality of each catalyst component.  In addition, the successful completion of the project should result in a membrane reactor that can be studied and modeled at bench scale and then scaled-up by making larger membrane wafers or stacks of parallel reactors.\r\n\r\nFundamental information about cluster size, uniformity, and membrane stability during processing will be obtained, as well as an understanding of the reaction mechanism, the role of each component, and the direct effect of the catalyst on the oxygen transport through the membrane.  The membranes will be characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis.  The oxygen permeation and the stability of the membranes will be tested using the partial oxidation of methane monitored with an online gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroad Impact:\r\n\r\nThe potential advances achievable using selective oxygen permeable membranes could make them a viable technology for applications such as hydrogen production for fuel cells (energy and environmental impact), oxygen sensors (homeland security), filtration of hazardous components from an oxygen stream (homeland security), and oxygen generation systems.\r\n",
