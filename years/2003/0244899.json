 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology includes both experimental research and theoretical research addressing key issues in nuclear physics and related areas of particle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Research topics include high-energy electron scattering, ultra-cold neutron research, and ultra-high energy cosmic ray studies. Participation by postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students is integrated throughout the program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance their training and education in these frontier areas of nuclear physics and astrophysics .\r\nThe goals of our research in high-energy electron scattering are twofold:  a.) study of the internal structure of the protons and neutrons that are the basic constituents of the atomic nucleus, and b.) high-precision testing of the basic theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions to reveal potential new physics. We will perform theoretical work related to the interpretation of the results of  these experiments.\r\nWe will also embark on a new experimental program utilizing novel techniques to produce and study ultra-cold neutrons. These neutrons are converted to very cold temperatures where they can be trapped for long periods of time, enabling very precise measurements of their properties. The first experiment will study the violation of mirror symmetry in the decay of ultra-cold neutrons. We will also perform research and development towards a new measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron. The goal of the new electric dipole moment experiment is to improve the precision by a factor of 100 compared to previous measurements; observation of the electric dipole moment signals violation of time reversal, and would provide important information related to the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe and the new physical phenomena responsible. Theoretical studies related to these experimental efforts are also part of this program.\r\nWe will continue our deployment and operation of the first phase of the California HIgh school Cosmic ray ObServatory (CHICOS). The goals of this innovative program are a.) establish an important scientific facility for ultra-high energy cosmic ray research by utilizing the Los Angeles area school system infrastructure, b.) provide LA high school science teachers and students with an exciting opportunity to participate in a frontier scientific research project. During this grant period we plan to complete the deployment of ~90 sites to form the largest operating ground array in the northern hemisphere and begin to collect a sample of ultra-high energy air shower events. Operation of this array during this period will yield results capable of shedding light on the origin of these remarkable events and will demonstrate a new cost-effective approach to constructing and operating very large ground arrays. In addition, the impact of the CHICOS program in providing opportunities in research for the high school teacher and student population of Los Angeles is potentially enormous\r\n",
