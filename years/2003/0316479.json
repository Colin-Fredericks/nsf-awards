 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research involves three goals.  First, asymmetric ditopic supramolecular reagents (SR's) will be designed, synthesized and used to facilitate supramolecular coupling reactions between two different hydrogen-bonding functional groups irrespective of the size and shape of the components.  Second, four different classes of SR's that can act as assembly sites for quaternary and quinternary supermolecules will be designed and synthesized.  Third, the asymmetric ditopic SR's developed, as the first goal, will be used as non-covalent coupling reagents of different bowl-shaped molecules and macrocycles.  The internal volume in the resulting hosts will be varied and asymmetric molecular capsules that can incorporate two different guests within the same cavity will be prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Christer B. Aakeroy of the Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University.   Dr. Aakeroy will focus his work on developing libraries of supramolecular reagents that are capable of constructing, in high yield, supramolecular architectures with desirable and predictable connectivities    The project also provides an excellent venue for the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and results from the project could have broader impact for materials design and for the preparation of biological mimics.\r\n",
