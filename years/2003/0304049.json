 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Nanoscale Issues in Manufacturing,\" at Texas A&M University, under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey E. Froyd is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC).  The objective of this diverse, interdisciplinary project is to develop a nanotechnology curriculum that: 1) integrates well with the existing curriculum, 2) uses innovative teaching and learning approaches, with a special emphasis on active learning, visualization, and technology-enhanced learning, and 3) brings the latest research into the classroom.  This curricular change has four components which will introduce elements of nanotechnology throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Components 1 and 2 include curricular changes in the form of modules integrated into required engineering courses for first and second-year engineering students that will focus on introducing nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing concepts as well as on communicating the excitement and future potential of nanotechnology.  The third component is a module that will be integrated into a junior-level course offered by the Mechanical Engineering department which will cover issues related to nanomanufacturing in more detail.  The fourth component will be a new course available to all engineering and science students who have completed the prerequisite courses and will include manufacturing of nanoscale components and integration of nanoscale components into micro and macro-scale devices and bulk materials.",
