 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing laboratory course modules in the interdisciplinary area of proteomics. Proteomics is an emerging area at the interface of biology and chemistry, which affords students the opportunity to explore complex biological systems with molecular detail. The availability of organized teaching materials using a proteomics approach at the undergraduate level is limited. Vassar College and Marist College have formed a partnership to develop prototype modules in proteomics for introductory undergraduate biochemists. The new laboratory modules blend biochemistry with disciplines in molecular biology, analytical chemistry, and computer science. Students gain exposure to a wide range of biochemical techniques including electrophoresis, MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. The goal of the overall experience is to introduce beginning undergraduate biochemistry students to the emerging field of proteomics. During the first phase of the project, prototype laboratory modules are being developed for the heat and cold shock responses in E. coli. Laboratory protocols and supplementary materials are being created during this phase. During the second phase of the project, the modules are being implemented as a laboratory course at both institutions. These courses serve to establish the suitability of a proteomics laboratory experience in an undergraduate level curriculum for a diverse range of students. These pilot trials of\r\nthese modules will allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the pedagogical effectiveness of these new proteomics laboratories and also assess the ability of these modules to prepare students to undertake careers in the life sciences.\r\n",
