Ismat Shah, Department of Physics, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware and Dr. Mohamed Barakat, Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDI), Helwan, Egypt.   Precious metal doped and decorated titania nanoparticles have the potential to be efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of harmful chemicals in water and air.  The economic feasibility of the synthesis process is unknown.  Also unknown is the difference in the photocatalytic behaviors of doped titania and the decorated titania, where the decorated titania refers to nano-TiO2 surfaces on which nanostructured noble metals have been deposited.  In this project the PIs will test a method to synergize two processes to make use of precious metal doped/decorated titania as a feasible material for the degradation of environmental pollutants.  The initial process involves the extraction of the precious metals from industrial wastes followed by the use of the extracted metals in doping and decorating nano-titania and a comparative evaluation of the performance of the two types of catalyst for the destruction of industrial pollutants.   \r\n\r\nScope: This collaborative research will involve a U.S. post-doctorate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student.  In addition to the advanced material physics concepts that these young scientists and students will be exposed to during the course of the project, the participation in this research will provide them an opportunity to interact with their Egyptian counterparts during the mutual visits of the scientists and the students.  Funds for one student to visit CMRDI are included in the budget.   In addition this project will provide several prospects for societal benefits.  The recycling of the industrial waste and the remediation of air and water are the two expected immediate and direct outcomes of the proposed scientific research. \r\n",
