 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of robust and stable ultrascale networking, at 100 Gbps and higher speeds in the wide area, is critical to support the new generation of ultrascale computing and petabyte to exabyte datasets that promise to drive discoveries in fundamental and applied sciences of the next decade. Continued advances in computing, communication, and storage technologies, combined with the development of national and global Grid systems, hold the promise of providing the required capacities and an effective environment for computing and science.  A key challenge to overcome is that some of the current network control and resource sharing algorithms cannot scale to this regime.  The goal of the Caltech FAST Project is to develop theories and algorithms for the future ultrascale networks, implement and demonstrate them in state-of-the-art testbeds, and deploy them in communities that have a clear and urgent need today.  \r\n\r\nA critical component of this effort is an experimental infrastructure on which to develop, test, and demonstrate new algorithms at both high speed and large delay.  It is impossible to conduct this research on network simulators or in the high performance wide-area networks (WAN) available today.  The propose project will build such a facility: WAN in Laboratory.\r\n\r\nWAN in Lab will consist of four major building blocks: high speed servers, programmable routers, electronic crossconnects, and WDM equipment including long-haul fibers with associated optical amplifiers, dispersion compensation modules and optical multiplexers and demultiplexers.\r\n\r\nThis \"wind tunnel\" of networking has five features that combine to make it a truly unique facility in the world:\r\n1.\tIt is literally a WAN, not an emulation, that provides both high speed and large distance, critical for developing protocols for ultrascale networking.  \r\n2.\tIt can be easily configured into logical networks of different topologies, link speeds and delays, and can stay cutting-edge by incorporating latest advances in optical technologies, routers, or servers, as need arises and funds become available.\r\n3.\tWAN in Lab will have built-in passive monitoring facilities that will complement end-to-end monitoring tools such as Web100.   These are critical to resolve many performance problems that arise only in live networks but that are hard to debug from just end-to-end measurements.\r\n4.\tIt is a network that can break and is suitable for risky experiments, possibly including those that involve reprogramming the routers.\r\n5.\tIt will be integrated with global high performance research networks and will be a shared resource for the networking community.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: WAN in Lab will be part of the Federated Emulab led by University of Utah's Jay Lepreau and will be managed on a uniform software platform.  It complements nicely the existing facility in Emulab, which focuses on large scale (>200 servers) but low speed (100Mbps network interface card).  Participation in Federated Emulab makes WAN in Lab instantly available to the Emulab user community and useful to those projects that need both high capacity and large distance, as FAST does.   This facility is expected to serve much more projects than the few that motivated it.\r\n\r\nWan in Lab is a key element in the overall process of research/in-lab development/experimental networks for field trials/production networks. We are engaged in this process on an ongoing basis to get the next generation(s) of protocols into production, in the service of science and engineering.   We have been working with the HENP community and their partners to achieve the transition to production.  We are partnering closely with SURFnet, Starlight and in the future UKlight to provide a global 10 Gbps UltraLight testbed.  These activities and WAN in Lab complement and leverage on each other.\r\n",
