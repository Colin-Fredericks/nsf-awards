 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support a U.S.- Taiwan workshop on soil liquefaction, with an emphasis on learning from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake (Mw = 7.6), and to develop a web site for pre- and post-workshop information sharing and discussions.  The workshop, to be held in Taiwan, November 2003, is jointly supported by the National Science Council (NSC) for Taiwan and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe Chi-Chi earthquake triggered extensive soil liquefaction in Central Western Taiwan.  It also raises important research questions that need to be addressed in order to advance knowledge in geotechnical earthquake engineering.  Taiwan has an extensive seismic instrumentation system that provided 70 three-component recordings of strong ground motion within 20 km of the main fault.  Significant issues regarding the Chi- Chi earthquake are the apparently anomalous ground motions, and its implications regarding liquefaction.  Significant data was obtained in the extensive liquefaction of soils, particularly in silty and gravelly soils.\r\n\r\nGovernment and industrial research agencies in Taiwan and the U.S. have supported activities to study the geotechnical earthquake engineering issues related to the Chi-Chi earthquake.  This workshop offers a forum for researchers from Taiwan and the U.S. to discuss and share the knowledge learned from this earthquake.\r\nThe utilization of Internet resources provides an effective way for pre- and post-workshop distribution of information and enhances the overall theme of the integration of research and education.  The workshop web site will be of value to the workshop participants, researchers, and engineers, and to the educators and students who are interested in geotechnical earthquake engineering.",
