 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract:\r\n\r\nSystems are only as secure as their weakest point of attack.  Indeed,\r\nthe only way to increase the security of a system as a whole is to\r\nimprove the resilience of its most vulnerable component. Much\r\nsuccessful research has focused on developing cryptographic protocols\r\nwhich are secure as long as some information (i.e., a key) is kept\r\nsecret from the adversary. However, as such algorithms are\r\nincreasingly deployed on inexpensive, mobile, and unprotected devices\r\n(e.g., laptops, mobile phones, and PDAs), the risk of key exposure is\r\nbecoming a serious threat to the security of many real-world\r\nsystems. This project aims to develop new paradigms and to design\r\nefficient algorithms for maintaining security even in the event of a\r\nkey exposure attack. Among other topics, the project will focus on (1)\r\nforward-secure public-key encryption; (2) forward secrecy in\r\nkey-exchange protocols; and (3) protecting signcryption schemes\r\nagainst key exposure attacks. The techniques developed as part of this\r\nresearch are expected to help improve the security of a number of\r\ndifferent systems, from handheld devices to ad-hoc networks.\r\n\r\nGraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this project, and\r\nundergraduate involvement will be encouraged as well. The techniques\r\nstemming from this research will be incorporated into undergraduate\r\nand graduate courses in cryptography and computer security. In these\r\nways, the project will help train future scientists in the important\r\narea of information security.\r\n",
