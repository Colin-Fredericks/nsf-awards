 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the issues of attracting, engaging, and competently training students in computer science by developing innovative multimedia-based instructional software for introductory computer science classes. The software tools is built on top of an existing system called Online Web-based Learning (OWL), a system that has been used with great success in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. \r\n \r\nThis project identifies three broad characteristics of first year CS instruction in object-oriented (OO) programming instruction, particularly in Java: 1) there is too much material for students to learn in a single 14 week semester; 2) staffing in introductory courses is stretched too thinly and devotes too much time to background chores such as grading; and 3) because of very uneven instruction in high schools and varying expectations about the purpose of programming instruction, student competence, interest, and expectation varies greatly in a single class. Moreover three additional features characterize defects in teaching strategies: 1) students are reluctant to read code (programs) carefully; 2) students often complete the first two semesters of Java programming instruction with a very poorly developed sense of high-level design; and 3) students are isolated and work together poorly. \r\n \r\nWe are implementing the following pedagogical and technical remedies for these problems in the context of the first two courses in a traditional CS curriculum, introduction to programming and data structures. These remedies include: the development of a wide range of on-line exercises that teach about the fundamental concepts of OO programming and data structures; the development of exercises that train students to be careful code-readers; the development of exercises that teach students first to understand code from a UML perspective, and second to use UML thinking to design code at a high level; and finally, through the mechanism of an informal drop-in center, and through the development of multi-student on-line exercises, we train students to collaborate more effectively with their peers. \r\n",
