The PIs plan to study the development and testing of properties of new fibers.  New polyblend fibers based on modified cellulose/modified chitosan blends will be prepared and their antibacterial activities examined.  The design of such fibers will be accomplished through preparation of iminochitosan, chemically modified chitosan, oxidized and/or hydrolyzed cellulose, the dissolution of the prepared substances in different organic solvents, and examining the spinnability of the modified cellulose/modified chitosan blends.  Testing and analysis of these newly produced fibers will be made and their utilization as medical textiles and for other uses will be performed.\r\n\r\nScope:  The research deals with materials that could have antibacterial properties and thus have significant applications for surgery and other medical purposes.  They could also be used to treat natural fibers such as cotton to add certain desirable properties.  Despite their significance the production of these materials has been limited because of the lack of needed scientific and technological information.  The results of this work will have applications in the textile industries in the United States and in Egypt. The two collaborators are well known for their past independent research and for the long experience in textile research and in chemistry.  Dr. Hebeish is among the most recognized scientists in the field of textile chemistry in Egypt, and his experience will benefit this project.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
