 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThis project studies the role of ecological and social factors in shaping social\r\norganizing relationships in fission-fusion ungulate societies. Current models of fission-\r\nfusion societies focus either on examining preferential associations between individuals\r\nor on examining factors that determine group size and its correlation with group size\r\nvariations. Individual relationships are still not completely understood. A novel model for\r\nanalyzing individual relationships incorporating key ecological and social drivers (i.e.\r\nforage, water, predators and bachelor males) together with female internal state is used to\r\npredict rules for associations between individuals. The consequences of these individual\r\ndecisions for population level association and dispersion patterns are also explored. The\r\npredictions derived from this framework will be tested using ecological and behavioral\r\ndata from two endangered Equids: Grevys zebra (Equus grevyi) and Asiatic Wild Asses\r\n(Equus hemionus) at four sites. Both species have similar morphology, physiology and\r\nsocial systems. The four sites provide natural variation in ecological and social factors\r\nand serve as an ideal system for exploring the predictions of our model. The broader\r\nimpacts of the study include educational activities about the value of ecological and\r\nbehavioral data for lay public, students and forest managers, and improvement of\r\nconservation strategies for endangered Equids.",
