 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tremendous progress has been made in the last ten years in calculating the properties of atomic\r\nnuclei microscopically starting with the free nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. One of the most\r\nsuccessful theoretical approaches in this regard is the No Core Shell Model(NCSM). Instead\r\nof invoking the standard shell-model assumption, that most of the nucleons occupy an inert\r\ncore, one treats all A nucleons as being active. In this way one is able to formulate a systematic\r\nprocedure to derive e.ective interactions starting from realistic microscopic ones. This procedure\r\nmakes use of the similar structures that two- and three-body clusters are expected to have in all\r\nnuclei. It was shown that these e.ective interactions speed up convergence tremendously and\r\nmake converged solutions possible.\r\nIt has now become apparent that present theoretical techniques are able to accurately calculate\r\nthe properties of light nuclei using the NN interaction as input. Because the results show\r\na considerable underbinding, it is clear that some extra ingredient is necessary, such as threenucleon\r\ninteractions. Hence, the NCSM will be expanded to include the three-body cluster (or\r\ne.ective interaction) based not only on the two-body microscopic forces, but also on realistic\r\nthree-nucleon (3N) bare interactions. It is important do this, because, for example, the spectra\r\nof light nuclei are expected to be sensitive to the spin structure of the 3N interaction. With these\r\nhigher-body interactions one will also be able to perform NCSM calculations for heavier nuclei\r\nin smaller basis spaces and obtain better convergence and, hence, more accurate results. The\r\ndevelopment of this three-body cluster approach is an major step forward, as it will enable one\r\nto study the e.ects of current 3N interaction models and models based on chiral perturbation\r\ntheory on the spectra. Consequently, it will become an important tool to probe these interactions.\r\nBy developing a technique for computing the three-body cluster exactly, one can also\r\ninvestigate its structure, depending upon the number of nucleons in the nuclide being studied\r\nand upon the size of the model space.\r\nOne of the goals of all nuclear structure calculations is the understanding of collective structures\r\nbased on microscopic calculations. The structure of 12C is an interesting example. The\r\n.rst excited 0+ state is believed to have a 3a structure. Converged solutions for this problem\r\nare a challenge, but are within the reach of NCSM calculations. Once they can be obtained,\r\none can study in detail the di.erence between the ground state and excited state structures.\r\nAnother important aspect of the current investigations is the extension of the NCSM methods to\r\narbitary operators. The NCSM is based on a unitary transformation of the cluster Hamiltonian.\r\nWhen one is able to extend this transformation to transition or current operators, it becomes\r\npossible to extract meaningful values for physical observables from the NCSM wave functions.\r\nThe prediction of electroweak properties of light nuclei will be an important application of this\r\nnew technique.",
