 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Tech University Graduate K-12 (GK-12) Teaching Fellows Program  partners the Colleges of Applied and Natural Science, Engineering and Science, and Education at  Louisiana Tech University with four nearby rural school systems and three informal science education  organizations .SciPort Interactive Science Center, The IDEA Place, and the NASA Outreach  Center, CATALyST (Center for Applied Teaching and Learning to Yield Scientific Thinking),  a regional science math education center housed at Louisiana Tech.  The Fellows work with their teacher partners to develop and deliver grade level appropriate modules that bring the Fellows research directly into the classroom.  The middle and high school students are developing realistic and positive ideas about what scientists and engineers do at the same time as they learn science content and concepts.  The Fellows are gaining an understanding of effective teaching methods in science.  The teachers and schools have been provided with needed technical assistance.  Each Teaching Fellow is partnered with a K-12 Partner Teacher.  A seminar course for Teaching Fellows and Partner Teachers  introduces  Teaching Fellows to teaching and learning in K-12 schools and introduces both teachers and fellows to nationally recognized curricular  materials.  Partnerships with local museums provide the partners with opportunities to introduce their students to local informal science education  programs. The broader impacts of the program are reflected in the enhanced and expanded  collaborative partnerships developed between Louisiana Tech University and surrounding school systems as exemplified by their participation in an electronic learning  community of Teaching Fellows, Partner Teachers, and University Faculty; and the opportunities they now have to  participation  in the publication of a new journal,  The Journal of K-12 Research in Science and Mathematics.  This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nTitle of Project:  The Louisiana Tech University GK-12 Teaching Fellows Program  \r\nInstitution:    Louisiana Tech University  \r\nPI/CoPI:  David K.
