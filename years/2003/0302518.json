Using methods of\r\nsemi-classical analysis (the mathematics of the classical limit of\r\nquantum mechanics), the high frequency limit of eigenfunctions is related\r\nto the dynamics of the geodesic flow.  The first application is to the\r\nwell-known inverse spectral problem for analytic plane domains.\r\nThe new idea is to use an exact\r\nformula for the Dirichlet resolvent and  a Feynman\r\ndiagram analysis of  its trace.\r\n One obtains for the first time explicit formulae for so-called\r\nwave trace invariants in terms of the Taylor coefficients of the domain at\r\nendpoints of a bouncing ball orbit. From these one seeks to recover the\r\nTaylor coefficients and hence an analytic domain.  So far the best result\r\nis that one can recover a mirror symmetric analytic domain from its\r\nspectrum.\r\n The second application\r\nis to geometry of eigenfunctions. Sogge and the proposer proved that \r\nthe maximum possible  growth rate of sup-norms of eigenfunctions\r\n only\r\noccurs  on boundarlyless\r\nRiemannian manifolds  which contain recurrent points, such that\r\na positive measure of geodesics leaving the point return in a fixed\r\ntime.  \r\nOne project is to prove this (if true) for bounded domains. A similar \r\nanalysis is interesting for boundary values of eigenfunctions, which\r\nare important\r\nin boundary control theory. Hassell and the proposer have recently\r\nproved\r\nthe ergodicity of boundary values of eigenfunctions when the billiard\r\nflow\r\nof the domain is ergodic, and this gave the first asymptotic estimates\r\nof\r\neven the L2 norms of the boundary values.  Methods developed in that\r\npaper\r\nshould have further applications to the geometry of eigenfunctions. The\r\nthird project,\r\njoint with B. Shiffman\r\nis to apply semiclassical methods to statistical algebraic geometry,\r\ni.e., to\r\nfinding statistical patterns in the zeros of polynomials.  Among the\r\npatterns found\r\nso far are that zeros of systems of polynomials tend to repel in\r\ndimension one,\r\nbe liike a neutral gas in dimension two and attract in higher\r\ndimensions. New\r\nproblems are to explore the dependence of the distribution of zeros on\r\nthe Newton\r\npolytope or on the number of monomials, as in Khovanski's fewnomial\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nSemiclassical analysis is the area of mathematics which explores the\r\nclassical\r\nlimit of quantum mechancs,  i.e.the  limit where the fuzzy, jumpy small\r\nscale behavior\r\nof atoms and molecules merges with the solid, mechanical world we\r\nexperience.\r\nPlanck's constant h measures the length scale. Although it arose in\r\nphysics,\r\nthe same limit, as h tends to zero, arises in many problems in\r\nmathematics and\r\nscience, often quite disconnected from the original physical\r\nbackground. This\r\nproposal is concerned with several problems of this kind. Several are\r\ntraditional\r\nand well-known problems, for instance trying to determine a domain from\r\nits\r\nfrequencies of vibration.  Using semiclassical analysis of a kind more\r\nfamiliar to\r\nphysicists than mathematicians (Balian-Bloch methods, Feynman\r\ndiagrams), \r\nthe first project is to obtain the best results to date on the problem,\r\ncan one\r\nhear the shape of a drum.  The results so far indicate that this method\r\nis better\r\nthan any prior method. Another project is to view the degree of a\r\npolynomial\r\nas 1/h (inverse Planck constant)  and to use semiclassical methods to\r\nfind new\r\nstatistical patterns in zeros and critical points of polynomials.  One\r\nresult is\r\nthat the exponents which occur in the polynomials have a big impact on\r\nthe\r\npositions of the zeros, leading to a tunnelling theory of zeros\r\nanalogous\r\nto the tunnelling theory of electrons through barriers.\r\n\r\n",
