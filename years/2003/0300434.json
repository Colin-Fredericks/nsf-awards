 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his collaborators propose to \r\nwork on aspects of Langlands' program and related topics.\r\nA conjecture of Serre predicts that certain 2-dimensional mod p\r\nrepresentations of Galois groups over Q arise from modular forms,\r\nand it further predicts the level and weight of the form.\r\nSerre's conjecture can be viewed as a mod p version of Langlands'\r\ncorrespondence, and the weight part as a manifestation of its\r\nlocal behavior at p.  A main focus of the proposed research concerns\r\na generalization of the weight part of Serre's conjecture to the \r\ncontext of Hilbert modular forms and totally real fields,\r\nwhere the developing formulation reveals new phenomena. \r\nThe research also addresses topics to which this has connections\r\nand applications, including congruences between modular forms, \r\ndeformations of Galois representations, the global Langlands'\r\ncorrespondence and special values of L-functions.\r\n\r\nLanglands' program predicts a deep correspondence between objects from\r\nalgebraic geometry (solution sets of polynomial equations, such as elliptic \r\ncurves) and objects from representation theory (functions with symmetry \r\nproperties, such as modular forms).  While there has been significant recent \r\nprogress (for example, the advances of Wiles and of Lafforgue), Langlands'\r\n program remains largely conjectural.  The links it provides  between two \r\nseemingly different branches of mathematics reveal properties of the integers, \r\nwhich can, in turn, have applications to cryptography.\r\n",
