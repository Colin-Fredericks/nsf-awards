Approximately holomorphic linear systems on symplectic\r\nmanifolds give rise to structures such as Lefschetz pencils and maps to\r\nthe complex projective plane, whose monodromy is described by morphisms\r\nwith values in mapping class groups or braid groups. By studying the\r\nmonodromy invariants of symplectic manifolds, new insight will be\r\nobtained into the relationships between symplectic manifolds and\r\ncomplex projective manifolds: symplectic versus complex deformation\r\nequivalence, isotopy and non-isotopy phenomena, topological constraints\r\non symplectic manifolds. In addition, relating monodromy invariants\r\nwith Gromov-Witten invariants or Floer homology should help to\r\nunderstand mirror symmetry, while the more combinatorial aspects of the\r\nproject are closely related to the algorithmics and computational\r\ncomplexity of mapping class and braid groups.\r\n\r\nSymplectic manifolds are geometric spaces with special structures,\r\nwhich first arose in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical\r\nmechanics. Mathematicians have recently become very interested in their\r\ngeometry and topology (intrinsic structure), in part due to motivating\r\nquestions from theoretical physics (string theory). This project aims\r\nto study the topology of symplectic manifolds using an approach\r\ndevelopped first by S. Donaldson and subsequently by Auroux, which\r\nmakes it possible to obtain a complete description by combinatorial\r\ninvariants involving braid groups (a concept closely related to knots).\r\nOne of the main goals of the project is to relate the topological\r\nfeatures of symplectic manifolds with those of complex algebraic\r\nmanifolds (a more special, much better understood class of geometric\r\nspaces). In addition, some applications to other domains such as\r\nmathematical physics (the \"mirror symmetry\" duality in string theory)\r\nand cryptography (the computational complexity of combinatorial\r\nproblems involving braid groups) will be explored.\r\n",
