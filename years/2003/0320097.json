The U.S. organizer is Professor B. F. Spencer of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  An Asia-Pacific Network of Centers on Research of Smart Structures Technologies was established last year.  This workshop will enable American participants to have in-depth discussions with researchers of the affiliated Asian centers, with the goals of enhancing information and data exchange, promoting activities with regional industries, facilitating exchanges of young researchers and students, and developing cooperative research projects that take advantage of the networked centers' infrastructure.  Given the strengths of the Chinese, Japanese and Korean research communities in the general areas of sensors, materials, structures technology, and disaster mitigation, there are great potential benefits to having U.S. researchers cooperate with their Asian counterparts in these fields.  The exchange of ideas and data with Asian experts in these fields will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve students.  Findings of the meeting will be publicized via the World Wide Web and through a published proceedings.\r\n",
