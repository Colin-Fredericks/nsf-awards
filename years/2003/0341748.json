 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yale University has been funded to have a workshop on biogeoreferencing in the collections community. It will bring together an interdisciplinary group of 20 - 25 participants including curators, collection managers, application developers, digital library scientists, geographical information system specialists, and georeferencing project managers.  The September, 2003 workshop will provide the opportunity for discussion of specific biodiversity community needs for georeferencing and analysis of functional requirements to meet those needs.  This will help establish an architectural framework for further development of georeferencing services, and will address providing technology tools for a number of national and international georeferencing projects.  Topics of the workshop include issues pertinent to providing automated and semi-automated georeferencing solutions for natural history collections in a distributed environment, formulation of strategies to promote interoperability between georeferencing applications, digital library gazetteers, and distributed biodiversity information retrieval protocols.  Workshop products will be made available to a broader community via a white paper of the proceedings and recommendations which will be posted online.",
