 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. R. Hill of the Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB), University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, to study the complex microbial communities that live in marine sponges.  Drs. F. Chen (COMB) and C. Fuqua of Indiana University are co-investigators in this research.  Molecular techniques will be used to identify and characterize as yet undescribed microbes in three sponge species from Key Largo, Florida and one from the Chesapeake Bay.  The stability of these bacterial communities between different individuals of the same sponge species and at different seasons will be assessed.  Typically, less than 1% of sponge-associated microbes can currently be grown.  Efforts will be made to cultivate novel microbes shown to be present by the molecular analysis.  Culturable bacterial isolates will be screened for the production of signaling compounds produced by the tightly-packed microbial cells within sponges, and the role of these signaling compounds in the bacterial colonization of sponges will be determined.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance understanding of microbial diversity and is likely to result in discovery and cultivation of new bacterial species.  The project has significance for discovery and production of new marine bioactive compounds, including those of pharmaceutical potential.  Sponges are a prolific source of these compounds, many of which may be produced by symbiotic bacteria. The new methods that are developed for cultivating these sponge symbionts may be applicable to symbionts that produce important drugs.  Advances in understanding of signaling compounds from bacteria will contribute to efforts towards manipulating bacterial behavior by interference with signaling pathways in industrial and medical applications.  The project will address the national need for scientists by training three graduate students and by offering two summer courses in Marine Microbiology for minority undergraduate students.\r\n",
