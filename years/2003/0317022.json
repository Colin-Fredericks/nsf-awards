 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surface of all insects is covered by a thin layer of very long-chain hydrocarbons that serve the critical function of restricting water loss to prevent a lethal rate of desiccation.  Many species also use hydrocarbons in chemical communication. Despite their importance for an insect's survival and absence among most other animals, there have been few studies aimed at understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology of hydrocarbon formation. A clear understanding of this critical process in insects is also needed to design inhibitors of key steps that could function in novel and environmentally sound insect control techniques. The housefly, Musca domestica, is an excellent model insect with which to study the biochemistry and molecular biology of hydrocarbon formation. Ovarian produced ecdysteroids regulate hydrocarbon production, which results in the female producing (Z)-9-tricosene and a series of methyl-branched hydrocarbons, all of which function in the sex pheromone.\r\nThe work proposed herein is designed to gain an understanding of a critical process in hydrocarbon formation, the elongation of 16 and 18 carbon fatty acids to the very-long chain 24-36 carbon fatty acids that are the immediate precursors to hydrocarbons. Specifically, the objectives are to: (1) Isolate, clone and sequence key enzymes involved in hydrocarbon synthesis, (2) Determine the ecdysteroid regulation of these enzymes at the molecular level and (3) Assay the key enzymes.\t\r\nIn addition to training post-doctoral fellows and graduate students, undergraduates also will be trained in aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of critical processes in insects that could lead to new targets for future pest control strategies.\r\n\r\n",
