 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this international cooperative research project between Gregory Taft and Thomas George of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and their Hungarian partners, Laszlo Nanai and Sandor Szatmari of the University of Szeged, is to understand the physical processes occurring in semiconductors at femtosecond time scales. The Hungarian expertise in experimental laser physics complements that of the Stevens Point group whose strengths include femtosecond pulse generation and measurement and theory of laser-matter interaction.  Together, these U.S. and Hungarian physicists will examine the Dember electric field effect and its role in earliest stages of the charge carrier evolution.  They expect to determine if that effect could become large enough to initiate structural changes in semiconductors.  Results are expected refine the theoretical framework and improve our basic understanding of the propagation of fast electronic signals in semiconductors, with potentially broad general applications in high-speed optical communications.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis project in experimental physical chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
