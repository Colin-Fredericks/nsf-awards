 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)  This project implements new laboratory experiments and overhauls existing experiments in the intermediate and advanced undergraduate courses in the Boston University Physics Department.  The main objective is to promote student understanding of quantum mechanics by emphasizing interactive engagement, aided by application of new equipment and technology. This project has a broad impact, affecting 250 students per year, improving their understanding of fundamental concepts in modern physics. \r\n\r\nIn the Modern Physics courses the project adds Magnetic Torque and single-photon experiments (see for example, Schneider and LaPuma, A Simple Experiment for Discussion of Quantum Interference and Which-Way Measurement, Am. J. Phys., 70 (3), 266-271, 2002) to build on student's experience and to provide a foundation for later work. The laboratories employ new equipment so students can carry out measurements more efficiently and investigate underlying principles in greater depth. The project also includes the construction of a revised lab manual requiring more intellectual effort from students.  In the Advanced Laboratory course, three experiments are added that produce better results, less frustration than previous experiments, and significant insights into fundamental principles of physics.  To evaluate the project, a new Quantum Concept Exam and questionnaires for students and faculty is developed.  Publication of results will be in peer reviewed journals and via the University web site.",
