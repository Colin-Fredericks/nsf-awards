 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earthquake of moment magnitude 6.4 (USGS and KOERI) occurred at 10 km north of Bingol at 03:27 am (local time) on 1 May 2003. The epicenter of the earthquake was at 38.94N- 40.51E (ERD-Ankara). The depth of the quake was estimated to be at 6 km. The strongest record of the earthquake was recorded at Bingol. The peak ground accelerations (PGA) of the three components of this record are 0.55g (NS), 0.28g (EW) and 0.47g (UP). The duration of the strong motion is 17 s. After the earthquake 12 buildings were collapsed and 13 buildings were damaged severely. It was also reported that several bridges appear to have been destroyed pending verification. The official numbers of fatalities and injuries were 105 and 600, respectively. The main objectives of the group are to document: \r\n(a) the damage to reinforced concrete frame buildings and monuments, \r\n(b) the damage to bridge structures, and \r\n(c) the geotechnical and geological aspects of the event.  \r\n\r\nFrom our experience in connection with the aftermath of the 1999 Marmara and Duzce earthquakes in Turkey, we know that documenting the properties of the structures that survived the ground motion is as important as documenting the properties of the damaged buildings. Therefore, we intend to use our time in Bingol to document not only the damaged but also the undamaged structures. It is also our plan to use the data from Bingol to expand our database (anatolianquake.org) and to test and improve the methods \r\ndeveloped for assessing earthquake vulnerability. \r\n \r\nSignificance: \r\nThe collection and recording of scientific perishable data related to the Bingol event in as precise form as possible is proposed so that this experience can be shared with interested engineers and scientists. It is hoped that the careful study of the data shall contribute to earthquake hazard mitigation efforts in the US, Turkey and other seismic regions of the world. In particular, there is a great deal of knowledge to be gained from the performance of 4-5 story reinforced concrete structures. Such structures abound in the Midwest and Eastern United States. Also, it is important to document the bridge performance to assist code developers and engineers dealing with seismic upgrading of bridges in the US. \r\nFurthermore, the investigation is proposed in close collaboration with researchers from METU, to promote cooperative activities between Turkey and the USA in the field of earthquake engineering. \r\n \r\nFor this effort we are requesting $28,202.00 to cover travel and other related expenses for a team consisting of eight members. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
