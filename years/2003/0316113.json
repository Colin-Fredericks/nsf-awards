 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanisms of Same/Different Concept Learning in Pigeons\r\n\r\nJeffrey S. Katz\r\n\r\n\tThis project examines same/different (S/D) concept formation in pigeons. The ability to discriminate same and different relations has been a central issue for experimental psychology because of its applicability to the areas of perception, intelligence, and learning. In the S/D task pigeons peck the lower of two pictures to indicate the pictures are the same and a white rectangle, located next to the lower picture, to indicate the pictures are different. The S/D abstract concept has been learned when pigeons discriminate new pairs of pictures they have never seen before as well as the trained pairs of pictures. Using this procedure, the role of set size (the total number of training pictures) and observing response (the number of times a pigeon pecks the upper picture) on the formation of abstract-concept learning will be assessed. The PI will also train graduate student researchers in the teaching of Advanced Experimental Psychology. The class will use the research as the basis for class papers and discussions about experimental design. The integration of research and education should result in students developing an improved understanding and appreciation of the research issues and develop critical thinking skills in a discovery-based learning environment.\r\n",
