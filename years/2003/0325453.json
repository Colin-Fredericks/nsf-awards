 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks of interacting agents play a fundamental role in many\r\ndomains, ranging from physical communication networks such as the\r\nInternet to social networks arising from relationships between people.\r\nThese networks grow and evolve through interactions of large numbers\r\nof participants, yielding complex global structure and dynamics.\r\nOften this leads to systems that function efficiently and reliably;\r\nbut in other, seemingly similar settings, networks can exhibit latent\r\ninefficiency or cascading failures.  Such failures occur not only in\r\nphysical networks but also in social ones, as illustrated by recent\r\nfinancial crises which propagated through networks of relationships and trust.\r\nDespite considerable interest in these topics, the research community\r\nis only beginning to understand the behavior of networks such as\r\nthese; small variations in the incentives, information, and\r\ncomputational power possessed by the agents in a network can have\r\nprofound effects on network behavior, yet the principles underlying\r\nthese effects remain elusive.  \r\n\r\nThis project develops theoretical and algorithmic underpinnings of networks\r\nthat arise from the interaction of strategic agents.  By combining\r\ngame-theoretic approaches with computational models of interacting\r\nagents, the work develops models that are richer and\r\nmore informative than either those that consider strategic agents in\r\nthe absence of interaction networks or those that consider network\r\nstructure in the absence of game-theoretic models of the agents.\r\nNetworks of strategic agents are investigated at several different levels, \r\nextending from questions of structure to those of function and behavior.  \r\nOne of the project's central goals is to examine the\r\ninter-relationships between these three levels.  In contrast, most\r\ncurrent techniques are tuned to a single level in isolation, with\r\nwork in computer science and mathematics focusing primarily on structure \r\nand work in economics emphasizing strategic behavior.\r\n\r\nThe project's inter-disciplinary nature exposes similarities between\r\nquestions in communication networks, including the Internet, and\r\nthose arising in social networks, such as trust in markets.  \r\nBeyond analyzing questions arising from these networks in general,\r\na particular goal is to better understand the\r\nnetworks of interactions underlying electronic markets.  \r\nIndeed, while it was widely predicted that such marketplaces would \r\nrevolutionize trading of goods and services, very few have survived.\r\n\r\nThe project participants contribute expertise from several perspectives.  \r\nThey have made some of the fundamental contributions to\r\nalgorithmic game theory, computational and economic analysis of\r\ninteracting agents, and models for complex networks, as well as to the\r\nunderstanding of market microstructure and the design of electronic markets.\r\n\r\nFurther, the investigators have been key participants in \r\nthe new Information Science program at Cornell.  \r\nThis program seeks to broaden the reach of computational\r\nideas by attracting students from non-technical backgrounds, and\r\nincorporating notions of computation as a human-centered activity\r\nthat is intrinsically embedded in social, legal, and economic contexts.  \r\nThe scientific results of the project support\r\nthe intellectual underpinnings of this program at both\r\nthe graduate and undergraduate levels.\r\nMany of the models involved in the research have an immediate intuitive \r\nappeal, and are well suited to interactive graphical demonstrations.\r\nThese demonstrations can be used to broaden general understanding \r\nof the nature of strategic interaction and its networked character, \r\nand can be made broadly available through the National Science Digital Library \r\n(NSDL) where appropriate to pre-collegiate educational levels.\r\n\r\nThe Internet is but the newest of many networks of strategic agents.\r\nHowever, it has served to change the structure and function of other\r\nnetworks, as it enables instantaneous, always-on, global communication.  \r\nUnderstanding the theoretical underpinnings of these\r\nchanges can provide important societal benefits in terms of more\r\nsecure, stable communication and economic systems.\r\n",
