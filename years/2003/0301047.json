The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n                                                   \r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Daniel N. Leszkiewicz to work with Dr. Stuart Cull-Candy at University College London in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe NMDA receptor is a subtype of glutamate receptor which is an ion channel closely involved in synaptic processes associated with learning and memory.  The goal of this project is to study the role of NMDA receptors in synaptic transmission by examining the subunit composition of these receptors and how they shape synaptic responses in the cerebellum.  Specifically, NR1 and NR2 subunits will be characterized with regard to their biophysical and modulatory influences on synaptic transmission.  A successful outcome of these experiment will fill gaps in our knowledge of NR2 subunit heterogeneity, distribution, kinetic properties, and how these factors play a role in determining NMDA excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).\r\n",
