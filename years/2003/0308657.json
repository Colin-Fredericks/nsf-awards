 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project include: i) preparation of good optical quality single crystal films of organic materials having exceptionally large second or third order optical nonlinearity, ii) establishment of appropriate methods for fabrication of special device structures using the films, iii) detailed nonlinear optical measurements and iv) demonstration of devices. The approach utilizes the \"shear method\" for preparation of single crystal films of organic materials. Electro-optic effects will be measured in such films at various wavelengths and used to assess modulator operability at high speed up to 100GHz. In order to increase modulation depth, the interaction length will be increased by using i) thicker films, ii) Fabry-Perot geometry and iii) a guided-wave configuration. Demonstration of femtosecond all-optical modulation using single-crystal films is anticipated. Measurements will be made by time-resolved techniques with 150 fs pulses in single-pass or reflective mode operation and also using a Fabry-Perot cavity. \r\n%%%  The project addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic/photonic materials having technological relevance. The project directly involves one graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow. Additionally, the project has broader impact in training undergraduate students, and developing and maintaining multidisciplinary collaborations in this field. The PI teaches specific courses in senior undergraduate and graduate levels that make use of the optics laboratory in demonstrating fundamental principles to students. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research, students across disciplines will be recruited to perform research tasks. Under-represented, minority and undergraduate students will be involved to provide them with a broader and stronger scientific and technological experience. The program is expected to increase the skilled workforce in an important field of optoelectronics with a special emphasis on enhancing participation of under-represented minorities.  \r\n***   \r\n",
