 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-0233767\r\nReiners\r\n\r\nThe use of (U-Th)/He chronometry has expanded significantly in the last several years, primarily in applications involving constraints on the timing and rate of shallow-crustal exhumation as applied to tectonic and geomorphic problems. The Yale He dating lab supports many of these projects, both within and outside the department, involving students and other researchers. In addition, the lab also conducts both experimental development and innovative applications of He dating, performing experiments necessary for use of the technique on new phases, improved analytical methods, and applying He dating to a wide range of problems such as the dynamics of magmatic heating in the shallow crust, detrital studies, and natural coal fires. All of these projects (as well as use of the sector ICP-MS) require support from the lab manager/technician for sample processing and user training. This funding will provide partial support for a full-time lab manager/technician (Dr. Stefan Nicolescu) for the Yale (U-Th)/He chronometry and sector ICP-MS facilities. Nicolescu's responsibilities include user training, sample processing, equipment maintenance, and planning/design in the lab, as well as maintenance of and user-training on the high-resolution ICP-MS associated with the lab. This support will facilitate broader impacts in research, learning, and infrastructure by providing support for: a) access to, and user training and experience in, He chronometry and ICP-MS analysis for students and other researchers both at Yale and other institutions; b) \r\nundergraduate/faculty advisor summer workshops on He chronometry, modeling, and interpretations in a variety of applications; c) continued professional development and training for Nicolescu. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
