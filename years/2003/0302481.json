 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. K. Anne Pyburn, Christopher R. Andres will analyze data gathered during his archaeological investigations of the Maya site of Chau Hiix in northern Belize.  Chau Hiix is a medium-sized ceremonial center distinguished by a lengthy occupational history extending from at least 1000 B.C. through 1450 A.D.  The community is notable because it was continuously occupied into the contact period and may have provided refuge for individuals displaced when Spanish entradas penetrated the region in the 15th century.  Chau Hiix not only maintained a significant population following this period of upheaval, but reflects spatial patterns in its architecture which depart from those of earlier periods.        \r\nAndres' project will examine the extent to which Maya monumental architecture may have played a more active role in pre-Hispanic society than has traditionally been acknowledged.  While the Maya built environment is often viewed as a product of human activity, there is growing evidence that buildings were systematically manipulated to structure social relations.  As a form of material culture involved in the negotiation of social relations, architecture at Chau Hiix offers insight into changing relationships between members of different social groups.  Preliminary investigations suggest these changes between the Classic and Postclassic periods involve construction activity at previously undeveloped locations, remodeling of existing buildings, and changing patterns of accessibility to the central precinct and its constituent structures.  Andres' excavations will further document these architectural alterations.  Changing access and traffic patterns will be examined using formal methods of spatial analysis and compared with similar data from the neighboring Maya sites of Lamanai and Altun Ha, Belize.  These analyses will serve as a basis for explanations of architectural change and should help illuminate inter- and intra-site socio-political relationships in northern Belize between the Classic and Postclassic periods.  \r\nBesides addressing questions of interest to architects and social scientists, this project will build on a decade-long effort by Pyburn to involve members of the Belizean community of Crooked Tree in the scientific investigation of the past and in protection of archaeological resources.  Public understanding of work at Chau Hiix will be enhanced through excavations carried out collaboratively with members of Crooked Tree Village; by presentation of research findings in the Crooked Tree Museum and during the annual Cashew Festival; and through guided tours of excavations available to visitors to Chau Hiix.  Communication of our findings to residents of other parts of Belize will take place at the Belize Archaeological Conference held in San Ignacio, Belize in July of 2003.  In the US, research results will be presented to the general public and academic community at open houses including Indiana University's annual Archaeology Day and through the Chau Hiix Archaeological Project's website.  American undergraduate students will receive training in a variety of skill sets, including excavation of monumental architecture.  The author will be trained in methods of architectural analysis.  Following the analyses discussed above, research results will be communicated to the scientific community through conference presentations and contributions to edited volumes and refereed journals.   \r\n\r\n           \r\n",
