 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project continues a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship program for undergraduate and graduate students majoring in computer science, engineering technology, and mathematics majors over a four-year. The project provides scholarships for academically talented, financially needy students, enabling them to enter the high technology workforce following completion of a baccalaureate or masters degree. The project accomplishes the following objectives: increases the number of graduates and the retention of students in the three disciplines, provides enhanced educational opportunities, improves student support services, and strengthens partnerships between the CSEMS departments and high technology industries.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the program maintains a group 30 students each year to receive a $3000 scholarship. These students are recruited from MTSU and from surrounding community colleges via announcements, informational brochures, the MTSU CSEMS web page, and personal contact with the mentors. The students are selected based on their major field of study, their financial need, their academic standing in the university and in their department, and letters of recommendation from their major professors. In addition to receiving the scholarship funds, participating students are assigned a faculty mentor in their department with whom they meet at least twice per semester to insure they remain on track for graduation, to determine any additional needs they may have, and to provide assistance in career placement.\r\n",
