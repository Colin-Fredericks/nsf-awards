 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biogenic methane is a major contributor to the 1% yearly increase in atmospheric methane and accounts for 80% of the 500 million metric tons of methane produced each year. Approximately two-thirds of all biogenic methane is derived from the methyl group of acetate, yet only two genera, Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta (formerly Methanothrix), are able to utilize acetate as a substrate for methanogenesis. Methanosarcina continues to be extensively studied; however, Methanosaeta has received little attention in recent years due to difficulties in culturing. While Methanosaeta is a specialist able to use only acetate, Methanosarcina prefers numerous methylated compounds as growth substrates compared to acetate. Methanosaeta are widely distributed in nature, and due to their high affinity for acetate prevail over Methanosarcina in the low acetate environments of rice paddies and anaerobic waste digestors, both major sources of biogenic methane. Thus, Methanosaeta is likely to be the predominant methane producer on earth. Sequencing of the genome of Methanosaeta concilii GP-6, the type strain of the species, will be conducted at the University of Washington Genome Center and annotation and curation will be performed at Clemson University and the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Addition of Methanosaeta to the methanoarchaeal genome sequence compilation will have a broad scientific impact, offering an opportunity for significant insight into this difficult-to-study microbe and the use of comparative genomic approaches to address the nature of these microbes and their biological impact and potential. The M. concilii genome sequence also provides an ideal platform for microbial genome education through involvement of undergraduates in annotation and curation of the genome sequence and comparative genomics.",
