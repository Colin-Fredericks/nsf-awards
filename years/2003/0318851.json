 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show proof of principle for \r\nan innovative optical technique using backscattered laser light to perform particle sizing \r\nmeasurements. Limitations of existing systems include the need to measure transmitted \r\ninstead of reflected light, the inability to make accurate measurements in dense particles \r\nfields, and the inability to characterize particle shape.  Phase I research will lead to the \r\nrealization of a unique diagnostic system capable of fast, non-invasive measurements in \r\nmedia of high turbidity; use of backscattered, not transmitted, light; solid-state fiber optic \r\nconstruction; cost effective gain-guided laser diodes  for light sources;  and assembly \r\nfrom commercial-off-the-shelf components. \r\n\r\nParticle sizing techniques are critical for process characterization and control in diverse \r\nareas of manufacturing and research.   The  worldwide market  for particle sizing \r\ninstruments has been estimated at $300 million.  Industries using particle sizing include \r\nagrochemical, cement,  ceramics, cosmetics, personal care, soil testing, wastewater \r\nprocessing, paints, inks and other surface coatings.  The proposed system will introduce \r\na patentable new technology to the field of particle sizing by the novel  extension of a \r\nproven commercial technique.  \r\n\r\n",
