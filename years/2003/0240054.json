 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for a workshop of ca. 40 US and New Zealand scientists interested in the study of the Waipaoa sedimentary system under the MARGINS program. Waipaoa River and its offshore dispersal system on the North Island of New Zealand is one of the two chosen focus areas of the \"source-to-sink\" initiative under MARGINS. A synopsis of what is known about the system and what needs to be monitored for developing meaningful models, as well as details of an implementation plan for research will be discussed at the meeting. The workshop will allow a more coordinated planning for MARGINS research on the Waipaoa system and the planned field trip will allow participants with first-hand experience of the on-land part of the system and the scientific issues involved. The workshop is seen as an important step towards developing a well-integrated and coordinated set of research proposals for the study of this focus area. A workshop report to NSF is planned.",
