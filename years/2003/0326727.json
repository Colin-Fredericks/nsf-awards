 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand the social processes underlying the effects of poor neighborhoods on adolescents. Why do adolescents in high poverty neighborhoods have higher rates of teenage pregnancy than adolescents from low poverty neighborhoods? Focusing on male adolescents, this project investigates the ways in which neighborhood disadvantage affects sex and pregnancy related behaviors, such as sexual intercourse, contraceptive use, and romantic relationships. I draw on recent work in cultural sociology to develop and test a meso-level theory that links neighborhood context to adolescent fertility outcomes using peer networks and cultural models. The National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health provides the primary data for the analysis. This quantitative analysis will be supplemented with qualitative, in-depth interviews with male adolescents and their parents in three Boston neighborhoods chosen for variation in neighborhood structural disadvantage. The broader impact of this research will be to shed light on the role of neighborhoods in adolescent fertility outcomes but also generally to inform our understanding of the role of cultural factors and peer networks in neighborhood and stratification processes. In addition, this project will add to knowledge about the sexual attitudes and behaviors of minority adolescent males, a relatively under-researched group. Teenage childbearing and sexual activity incurs health, social, and economic costs on teenage parents, their children, and society, and public policy has been concerned with reducing teenage pregnancy and other harmful fertility-related outcomes. By understanding the social processes that underlie the role that neighborhoods and peers play in these outcomes, scarce policy resources can be better directed toward the individuals and communities most at risk for negative outcomes, potentially leading to more effective education and intervention programs.",
