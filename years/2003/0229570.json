 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explorers of Antarctica's heroic era (early twentieth century) erected buildings and brought large amounts of supplies to survive the extreme environment during their Antarctic exploration. These buildings were abandoned once the expedition was over, leaving huts and thousands of artifacts (e.g., furniture, scientific apparatus, food stores, clothing) behind. Today these historic sites provide a remarkable view into the past and while the extreme polar environment has provides some protection from rapid decay, serious deterioration is apparent. This project (in collaboration with New Zealand scientists) and is a continuation of research to identify the bacteria and fungi attacking these historic structures and artifacts and to elucidate the mechanisms of biodegradation occurring in the polar environment. Studies will also be done to better understand the non-biological (e.g., salt, UV light, wind) deterioration processes taking place and to test methods for protecting the historic woods from continued attack. Pollutants (e.g., polyaromatic hydrocarbons) that contaminate the historic sites pose serious problems to the Antarctic environment and investigations will assess the extent of contamination and develop appropriate protocols for remediation. \r\nThis project will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to become involved in research. The preservation of the historic wooden structures will be of great interest to those in the international community and the general public who are intrigued by the last great age of polar exploration. Results will provide the scientific data needed by conservators to help protect these important Antarctic historic sites for future generations. This research will also add significantly to our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the Antarctic microorganisms, the biodiversity of microbes present in the polar environment and elucidate unique deterioration processes.",
