 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI research program will investigate the fundamental chemical phenomena associated with the adsorption of noble metal coordination complexes from solution onto widely used oxide and carbon supports.  A highly recognized predictive tool, the Revised Physical Adsorption (RPA) model, has been developed which has led to a new understanding of the interaction of anionic or cationic noble metal complexes and the protonated or deprotonated hydroxyl groups at surfaces.  The \"point of zero charge\" and the solution pH determine the nature of the ionic interaction. Proton transfer between the bulk solution and the surface has been identified as a key mechanistic step.   The main focus on this ongoing research will be on the development of new scientific insight that can be used to engineer the properties of several important industrial catalyst supports including carbon.  The adsorption of active noble metals such as Pt and Pd will the primary emphasis because of the importance of these catalysts for hydrogenation reactions and for fuel cells.  Control of  adsorption on carbon will be exercised primarily through  the incorporation of specific types of O-containing surface groups; niobia, sulfated zirconia, and mixed metal oxides will also be examined.   Industrial collaborators will provide key material synthesis capabilities and complementary characterization techniques.  Access to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories is inherent to the work.  Combined in-kind and actual support from the GOALI collaborations is $500,000 for the 3-year research project.\r\n\r\nReviewers rated this proposal very strongly, both on the basis of its scientific excellence and its importance to key catalytic processing technology.  The prior research accomplishments have been recognized as making an innovative, ground-breaking contribution to the understanding of catalyst preparation.   Characterization techniques such as EXAFS have now allowed key aspect of the theoretical understanding to be confirmed.  A highly respected industrial team is part of this GOALI project, and the university investigator has a demonstrated record of interaction with industry.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the work include the practical applications of the fundamental science to important national research priorities, such as the development of improved carbon-based electrodes used in PEM fuel cells.  Other aspects of the work will have applications in improved environmental approaches to catalyst preparation, especially for heavy metals.  Educational aspects of the research project are strong at both the graduate and undergraduate level.  Students will be involved through a successful NSF REU site on Novel Materials that has involved significant numbers of students from underrepresented groups.\r\n",
