 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing an innovative manufacturing process to produce cost-effective, high-performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites for Next-Generation Vehicles applications.  There is general concern in the U.S. over the growing usage of imported oil, and about 68 percent of the total U.S. consumption of petroleum are related to transportation.  Materials technologies to enable production of safe and cost-effective lightweight vehicles have been identified as critical to reducing fuel consumption in future vehicles.  This project will validate the concept of using compounding technique to produce well-mixed long-fiber thermoplastic composites with a fiber length exceeding its critical length.  Additionally, the innovation would be versatile and inexpensive enough for widespread use.\r\n\r\nThe commercial and broader impacts of this technology will be to supply the automotive and other industries with improved performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites at a significantly lower cost (by 30-50 percent) to meet their needs for lighter, stronger, recyclable and cost-effective materials for future generation vehicles applications. \r\n",
