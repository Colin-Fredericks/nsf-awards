 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the in situ deposition of epitaxial MgB2 superconductor thin films and multilayers by hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD). MgB2 is a conventional superconductor with a high transition temperature of 39 K, promising Josephson junctions like the low-Tc superconductor junctions but operating at 25 K. The PIs have developed the HPCVD technique and grown epitaxial MgB2 films with excellent superconducting and transport properties. This project will further improve the HPCVD technique to make it more controllable and compatible to multilayer deposition for Josephson junctions. The research will model the HPCVD growth conditions, test various reactor configurations, and address various materials issues in the growth mechanism, the suitable tunnel barrier material, and the deposition of multilayer structures. A demonstration of a 25-K Josephson junction suitable for superconducting integrated circuits and a large scale processing technique will have a significant impact on the microelectronics industry. Students trained in this project will be exposed to both physics and materials science and acquire skills important for their careers in materials research in both academic and industrial environments.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract \r\nThis research focuses on the thin film deposition of the newly-discovered MgB2 superconductor.  Unlike the unconventional high-Tc superconductors, MgB2 is a conventional superconductor with a high transition temperature of 39 K. This makes it more promising to produce MgB2 Josephson junctions, the most elemental devices for superconducting integrated circuits for ultrafast digital processing. To achieve MgB2\r\nJosephson junctions and integrated circuits, a thin film technique compatible with multilayer depositions is required.  The PIs have developed an innovative technique, hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), to grow epitaxial MgB2 films with excellent superconducting and transport properties. However, the technique is in its very early stage of development and needs improvements. This project will use theoretical modeling to guide the HPCVD improvement, address various materials issues in the film growth, and develop multilayers for Josephson junctions. The success of the project will have a significant impact on the microelectronics industry. Students trained in this project will be exposed to both physics and materials science and acquire skills important for their careers in materials research in both academic and industrial environments.\r\n\r\n",
