 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a catalytic process for the generation of hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon fuel gases from biomass. The project will generate fuel gases by reactions of oxygenated hydrocarbons derived from carbohydrates (biomass) with liquid water at low temperatures (~200 C). Current hydrogen production is based on fossil hydrocarbons. The problem with fossil hydrocarbon use is that it is non-renewable, increasingly imported and generates greenhouse gasses. This project represents a new route for renewable fuel gas generation. The overall project objective is to identify cost effective catalysts, catalytic structures and operating parameters to maximize the efficient production of hydrogen and/or hydrocarbons derived from US grown biomass for use in fuel cell and combustion engine applications. \r\n\r\nThe commercial and broader impacts of this project will be improved energy security as well as clean and renewable fuel gases that may be used as fuel sources for fuel cells, internal combustion engines, and gas turbines.\r\n",
