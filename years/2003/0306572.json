 "awd_abstract_narration": "Testing integrated circuit chips at elevated temperature and voltage,\r\nknown as burn-in testing, is used to improve product reliability by\r\nscreening out chips that pass all their regular tests, but might fail\r\nduring customer use. Burn-in of high performance chips such as\r\nmicroprocessors requires increasingly expensive power and temperature\r\ncontrol to avoid destroying good chips. Burn-in test is also becoming\r\nless effective in newer technologies. The combination of these\r\nproblems means that burn-in test can now cost more than regular chip\r\ntesting for high-performance products. Burn-in test is already too\r\nexpensive for many products, even though they have high reliability\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nOne way to improve chip reliability without burn-in is to throw away\r\nchips which are \"different\" from the rest of the chips. They are\r\ndifferent in that they work correctly, but some measurements have\r\nabnormal values. These \"black sheep\" chips are known to statisticians\r\nas \"outliers\". What makes this problem challenging is that past\r\nexperience shows that most of the chips thrown away will work just\r\nfine for the customer. So throwing them away represents lost profits\r\nto the manufacturer. The research goal is to find techniques that more\r\naccurately identify outliers that would fail for the customer.\r\n\r\nThere are two research challenges. The first is to identify a set of\r\nmeasurements that are good at detecting outliers. The second is to\r\ndetermine when a measurement is so abnormal that a chip should be\r\nthrown away. Historically the standby power consumed by a chip has\r\nworked well for detecting outliers. However this is becoming less so\r\nin new technologies. New ideas are to consider other measurements,\r\nsuch as behavior under abnormally low operating voltages, or how\r\ndifferent a chip is from its neighbors on the semiconductor\r\nwafer. This research will evaluate these and other ideas using chip\r\ndata from IBM, LSI Logic and Texas Instruments to identify approaches\r\nthat work well in practice.  The primary merit of the research is that\r\nit will develop techniques to reduce chip manufacturing costs and\r\nimprove the reliability of chips shipped to customers.\r\n",
