The instrumentation will consist of a dual inlet, continuous-flow stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer and several prep-systems (i.e., a multi-preparation headspace gas handling system, a high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer, and a gas chromatograph combustion device).  The prep-systems will be interfaced to the mass spectrometer so as to maximize the efficiency of sample analysis and better meet the needs of research and teaching at Florida State University (FSU) and neighboring Florida A & M University (FAMU).  The instrumentation will be capable of on-line measurements of stable isotopic ratios of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen in bulk organic and inorganic samples as well as in individual compounds.  These measurements are critical in studies undertaken by the PIs and their students including determination of paleodiet, study of paleo-oceanography, reconstruction of paleoecology and paleoclimate, examination of carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, forests and wetland ecosystems, investigation of food web and trophic interactions, and study of methane oxidation in wetlands and landfills. The mass spectrometer will be housed in the Geochemistry Facility at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and will provide routine analytical capabilities needed to support existing programs in Earth and environmental sciences at FSU and neighboring FAMU. The Geochemistry Facility at the NHMFL provides a modern environment for isotopic studies and is available to scientists and students from local neighborhood and from around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
