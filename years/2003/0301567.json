 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental capabilities for an autonomous or\r\nsemi-autonomous robot system is the ability to quickly plan and\r\nreliably execute its own motions.  We will study these fundamental\r\nproblems for underactuated mechanical systems -- systems with fewer\r\nactuators than degrees-of-freedom.  Our interest in controlling this\r\nclass of systems stems from two considerations.  (1) It allows\r\nsoftware control redundancy (as opposed to mechanical or actuation\r\nredundancy) when one or more actuators of a fully actuated system\r\nfails.  (2) It is possible to design inexpensive mechanical systems by\r\nminimizing expensive mechanical elements such as actuators and\r\ntransmissions and replacing them with advanced control algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe will explore a novel concept for mechanical control systems called\r\nkinematic reductions.  A kinematic reduction of a mechanical system is\r\na first-order driftless system whose trajectories can be followed by\r\nthe second-order mechanical system.  Kinematic reductions allow\r\nkinematic constraints (such as obstacles and joint limits) and\r\nactuator limits to be handled in a computationally efficient manner,\r\nallowing the possibility of real-time trajectory generation for\r\nunderactuated systems.  Kinematic reductions encode the notion of\r\n``preferred'' motion directions for the system, allowing the planned\r\ntrajectories to be followed quickly.\r\n\r\nTo make full use of these properties of mechanical systems for\r\nreal-time trajectory generation and control, we will study a number of\r\nopen issues.  These include understanding when the kinematic reduction\r\nallows for closed-form calculation of motion plans for underactuated\r\nsystems; adapting efficient kinematic motion planners from the\r\nrobotics literature to kinematically controllable systems; local\r\ntrajectory optimization; feedback control to stabilize trajectories of\r\nthe kinematic reductions; and implementation and validation of the\r\ncontrol strategies on an experimental vehicle.  We also plan to\r\nexplore the role kinematic reductions will play in developing\r\nreduced-complexity hierarchical hybrid motion models.\r\n\r\n",
