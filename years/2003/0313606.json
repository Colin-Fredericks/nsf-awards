 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this U.S.-Romanian research project between Rodney M. Feldman and Carrie E. Schweitzer of Kent State University and Iuliana Lazar of the University of Bucharest is to expand our knowledge of the diversity of fossil decapods during Jurassic and Cretaceous time intervals when stem groups of the order experienced major diversification events that set the stage for the appearance, then expansion, of modern decapod fauna, such as crabs, lobsters and shrimp.  The team of U.S. and Romanian experts and students will jointly examine the sedimentological history and paleontology of four sites in the southern Carpathian Mountains, a region that has not been well studied due to previously limited access.  Stable isotope analyses and new data derived from the fieldwork will be combined to describe the taphonomic and paleoecological history of the assemblages.  Because these mountains lie at a crossroads between northern and western Europe, known to contain rich decapod faunas in the Jurassic and the Tethyan seaway to the south, the researchers hope to determine where the two major diversification events were centered.  Results are expected to enrich our understanding of the taxonomy, biostratigraphy, biogeography and evolution of decapods, a globally important group of organisms. \r\n\r\nThis project in paleontology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. students to the benefits of international collaboration through fieldwork at Carpathian sites and direct involvement in the project's analysis of ancient sediments and fossil decapod radiation.",
