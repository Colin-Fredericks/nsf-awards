While computations of the genus zero\r\ninvariants have been quite successful, leading to proofs of physicists'\r\nMirror Symmetry - based predictions in that case, there has been no\r\nprogress so far in higher genus. The main obstacle has been a lack of\r\nconcrete understanding of the virtual fundamental classes of the moduli\r\nspaces of higher genus stable maps. In recent work, the PI and Kapranov\r\nhave developed an approach to virtual classes via differential-graded (dg)\r\nmanifolds. Dg-manifolds appear as derived versions of algebro-geometric\r\nmoduli spaces. The PI and Kapranov constructed such a structure on the\r\nmoduli spaces of stable maps. The greater flexibility of the dg-point\r\nof view restores some of the features that facilitated the genus zero\r\ncomputations. The ultimate goal is to prove the higher genus ``mirror\r\ntheorem'', as predicted by the physicists Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri,\r\nand Vafa. A crucial part of the program involves a novel construction of\r\na virtual class in situations outside the reach of earlier approaches.\r\nThis is of great independent interest in algebraic geometry, as it allows\r\nto extend the theory of virtual classes to all moduli spaces, as opposed\r\nto just the (rather small) subset to which it currently applies.\r\nCiocan-Fontanine also proposes to establish a relationship between the\r\ngenus zero Gromov-Witten theory of a GIT quotient X//G by a reductive\r\nalgebraic group G, and that of the associated abelian quotient X//T,\r\nwhere T is a maximal torus in G. Precise conjectures are made on what the\r\nrelationship is, inspired by results obtained recently by the PI and his\r\ncollaborators in the case when X is a complex vector space and G is the\r\ngeneral linear group. They are  consistent with expectations on how the\r\nphysical theories associated to X//G and X//T are related and will be of\r\ninterest to physicists, as well as to algebraic geometers.\r\nThe third problem proposed by the PI is to give a proof of a combinatorial\r\nformula for the three-point, genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of complex\r\nGrassmannians. This is the only outstanding unsolved problem remaining in\r\n``Quantum Schubert Calculus.''\r\n\r\nThis is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the\r\noldest branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and\r\nideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have\r\nbeen employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics.\r\nDevelopments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between\r\nthe two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study\r\nof many unexpected new phenomena. The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants\r\nand Mirror Symmetry are particularly striking examples.\r\n",
