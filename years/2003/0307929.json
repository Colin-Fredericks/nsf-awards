 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0307929\r\nBrown\r\n\r\nDr. Michael Brown's research program with this award  will  provide  a  unique  window  into  the  time-variable  structure  and dynamics of the poorly understood atmosphere of Titan. This window will come at a critical time, when imminent arrival of the Cassini spacecraft will soon focus intense scientific scrutiny on the satellite. The projects take advantage of the Dr. Brown's recent detection of small clouds near the south  pole  of  Titan  and  of  two  unique  observational  capabilities  available  to Dr. Brown  to vastly expand our currently minuscule knowledge of clouds and weather on Titan. The first unique capability will be the ability to provide the first ever daily monitoring \r\nof  global-averaged  cloud  formation  and  dissipation  on  Titan  using  a  proven  method  on  a  new dedicated  robotic observatory  run  by  Dr. Brown.  The  robotic  observatory  will  be able to  detect the existence of even relatively small clouds on Titan on an ~hourly basis throughout the observing season.  With  five  total  years  of  observations  acquired  by  the  end  of  the  award period, fundamental questions about cloud activity will be able to be addressed for the first time, such as: What are the timescales for formation and dissipation of clouds of the smallest to the largest sizes seen? Is the current period of frequent cloudiness related to the recent southern summer solstice? Are clouds preferentially present at particular Titan longitudes? \r\n\r\nThe second unique capability will be the ability to obtain high spatial-resolution adaptive optics  images  and  spectra  frequently  throughout  each  observing  season  using  a  newly implemented target-of-opportunity interrupt mode at the Keck and Palomar observatories. Rather than obtaining infrequent observations at pre-determined times, as would be typical with standard astronomical  scheduling,  the  target-of-opportunity  interrupt  mode  allows  observations  to  be obtained  at  times  dictated  by  the  cloud  activity  level  on  Titan  (which  we  will  know  from  the robotic monitoring) and allows for a large number of short blocks of time. With these frequent targeted  observations, a full range of cloud conditions on Titan will be able to be observed that would otherwise take many years of continuous pre-scheduled observations to obtain. These data  will  allow  the  first  ever  understanding  of  the  latitude  of  cloud  formation  and  dissipation, seasonal  changes  in  these  latitudes,  wind  speeds  on  Titan,  the  growth  and  decay  lifetimes  of  individual clouds, and the dynamics of infrequent hurricane-scale storms. Together these projects will provide the first long term quantitative data on the formation, evolution, and dissipation of the poorly understood clouds on Titan. \r\n   \r\nThese  activities  will  have  a  major  impact  on  the  education  and  training  of  all  of  the \r\nstudents and post-doctoral scholars involved.  In particular, this project will  form the basis of the \r\nPh.D. thesis of a Caltech graduate student.  Dr. Brown has a strong commitment to the education and training of women and underrepresented minorities, as is demonstrated by the students currently in  his  research  group. A  major  aspect  of  the  proposed  work  will  be  commissioning  and  gaining  experience using a robotic telescope soon to be installed at Palomar Observatory. Once commissioned, this telescope will be available for all of the research and teaching activities of Dr. Brown, including, in particular, undergraduate students joining the group for the summer through Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Foundation (SURF) program. Moreover, Dr. Brown is working with Scitech, the  manufacturer  of  the  robotic  telescope,  to  help  define  and  refine  priorities  for  astronomical usage of automated telescopes in the hopes that astronomers will finally be able to have access to off-the-shelf turnkey robotic telescope facilities for a wide variety of usages. \r\n***\r\n",
