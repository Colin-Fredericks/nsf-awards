 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the workshop is to bring together leading researchers from many different\r\ndisciplines in the current trend, challenging unsolved problems, and applications of nanoscale\r\nsystems, dynamics and control as a new emerging field. Nanotechnology which is aimed to\r\ncontrol the materials and processes at the molecular and nanoscales has become one of the critical\r\ntechnologies of this century. Scientists and engineers are focused on solving basic and\r\ntechnological problems, and system based research is still very immature. Modeling, design,\r\nintegration, and control of nanoscale systems is of vital importance in a host of applications\r\nranging from nanomanufacturing, micro/nanorobotics, and material characterization, to the design\r\nand control of devices for biotechnology, information technology, and medical applications. The\r\nworkshop will address both the state of the art and future directions of the field with very\r\ninterdisciplinary presenters and audience.\r\nInvited speakers with different areas of specialty would introduce the state-of-the-art issues,\r\nachievements and open challenges in their topics which include scanning probe microscope\r\ndynamics and control, nanomanufacturing system monitoring and control, nanorobotics,\r\nnanoscale system integration, nanomanipulation and nanoassembly, bionanosystems, controlling\r\nand directing self-assembly, nanopositioning systems and control, biomimetic and smart\r\nnanoscale systems and structures, nanoscale physics, modeling of nanoscale dynamics and\r\nsystems, novel nanoscale system applications in biology, medicine, information technology,\r\nmaterials, etc., hard disk storage systems using nanoprobes, advanced man-machine user\r\ninterfaces for nanorobots, and etc.\r\nA final report after the workshop will be submitted to the NSF which could be used for defining\r\ncurrent status, open research challenges, funding guidelines, possible initiatives, etc. in the\r\nnanoscale systems, dynamics and control area.",
