 "awd_abstract_narration": "One consequence of the phenomenal storage density improvement is the\r\nemergence of highly compact disk storage that can be integrated into\r\nvarious computing and networking devices of various shapes and forms.\r\nOur conjecture is that mobile storage will become a dominant form of\r\nstorage in the near future, especially for personal user data,\r\nsubsuming conventional disks enshrined in server rooms.  This proposal\r\ndescribes a project that studies how to build, manage, and use\r\ndiscrete storage devices to form ad hoc, distributed storage systems.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we propose to build system software to intelligently\r\ncoordinate the discrete storage elements.  The system has four core\r\nmechanisms: (1) a multicast-like data location mechanism, (2) an\r\ninvalidation mechanism for purging obsolete data from the system, (3)\r\na snapshot mechanism for supporting sharing and backup, and (4) a\r\nstorage level solution that can support existing file systems.  In\r\nthis proposal, we describe how combinations of these four core\r\nmechanisms allow us to achieve our consistency, transparency,\r\nreliability, security, and performance goals.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the data management needs addressed by this project are\r\nby no means limited to traditional desktop applications.  As the data\r\nmanagement functionalities are separated from cumbersome generic\r\ncomputing devices, and as these functionalities are cleanly\r\nencapsulated in modular small form factor devices that can readily\r\ninteract with other consumer electronic devices (such as cameras, MP3\r\nplayers, phones, and email devices), these application-specific\r\ndevices would be freed from the burden of having to solve and re-solve\r\na difficult mobile storage problem, and we may multiply the utility of\r\nthese devices and potentially foster new applications.\r\n",
