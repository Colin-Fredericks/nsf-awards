 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Mark G. Packard, Dept. Psychology, Texas A & M University\r\n\r\nResearch investigating the neurobiology of memory has revealed that memory is not a unitary phenomenon that involves a single \"center\" in the brain.  Rather, memory is organized in multiple brain systems, and these systems acquire different types of information.  A \"cognitive\" memory system that includes a brain structure termed the hippocampus acquires information concerning relationships among various stimuli in the environment, and allows for flexible goal-directed behavior (e.g. if car traffic is bad, taking an alternative route may help one arrive at their destination earlier).  An independent \"habit\" memory system that includes a brain structure termed the caudate nucleus acquires information concerning invariant or fixed associations between environmental stimulus and appropriate behavioral responses (e.g. push the car brake pedal when the light turns red).  A third brain structure termed the amygdala is involved in emotional processing, and activation of this structure can influence the strength of memories acquired by the cognitive and habit learning systems.  In a given situation in which new information is acquired, the cognitive and habit memory systems are simultaneously activated.  Although it is clear that emotions can impact the strength of various memories, the manner in which emotional activation of the amygdala modulates the relative use of cognitive and habit memory is not well understood.  The research in this project will use behavioral testing methodologies in lower animals to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms by which the amygdala mediates the influence of emotion on the use of multiple memory systems.  The research is expected to increase understanding of the neurobiological bases of emotion and memory.  The proposed research will provide support and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in the Behavioral Neurosciences.\r\n",
