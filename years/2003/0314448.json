 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUMMARY \r\n\r\nThe Gordon Research Conference on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion, first held in 1981, has served as the off-the-record forum for scientists from all over the world interested in using laser light to understand combustion problems.  Each meeting has been a workshop, and interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the meeting.  The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) brings together approximately 135 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion.   The meeting program is advertised in the publication Science, and the attendees are chosen by the meeting chair from the pool of applicants;  past GRC meetings on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion have attracted over 200 well-qualified applicants.  \r\n\r\nThe 2003 Program features updates on the latest advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in combustion emissions from land-based propulsion systems.  Revolutionary technology in X-Ray and far-infrared sources and applications are also featured in 2003 - potentially enabling breakthrough sensor technology for important National Security applications beyond those strictly related to combustion.  This is the only scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based diagnostics of combustion.  Therefore it is important to insure that young and emerging US scientists have access to this meeting. \r\n\r\n",
