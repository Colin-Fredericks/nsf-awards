Deutsch\r\nUniversity of New Mexico\r\n0329339\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network is a consortium of universities, national laboratories, and industry with the purpose to promote the exchange of scientific ideas and resources in the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum information science (QIS).  Under this project, the 2003 student summer school and retreat is being held from June 15-19, 2003 in Asilomar State Park, California.  A series of pedagogical lectures aimed at the beginning graduate students and new researchers in the field with special focus on computer science and engineering aspects of QIS with lectures regarding algorithms, complexity, and control theory are central to the program.  A strong series of lectures on laboratory implementations in a variety of physical settings are also being presented.  The close collaboration of theorist and experimenters in QIS is crucial to the success of the field and a hallmark of this SQuInT Network.  This summer school is providing about 50 students from all over the country a valuable opportunity to network and build a strong community of future QIS researchers.\r\n",
