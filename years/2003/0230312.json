Richard L. Weaver in the US and Bart A. Van Tiggelen in France lead this cooperative project on the mesoscopics of elastic and seismic waves.  They will investigate diffuse elastic waves in randomly disordered open structures.  The objective is to explore the applicability of modern concepts in mesoscopic wave phenomena to seismic waves in the earth's crust.   The project involves laboratory and/or field and/or theoretical aspects.  Students will be trained in ultrasonic techniques and seismic measurements.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in mesoscopic issues, work on diffusion and incoherent transport of ultrasound.  This is complemented by French expertise in optical waves, and waves in random media.  \r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF, and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).   NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS will support visits by French investigators and graduate students to the United States. \r\n",
