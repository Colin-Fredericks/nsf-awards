 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to support travel by participants in a symposium entitled \"Compensatory responses of mitochondria in stressful environments\", as part of the Sixth International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry (ICCPB) of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), to be held 2-8 February 2003 at the Mt. Buller campus of LaTrobe University, Melbourne Australia.  Mitochondria are well known for producing the majority of cellular energy. This organelle has received renewed attention because of novel responses to environmental challenges imposed on cells and organisms within which it resides, and because mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as the basis for a large number of human metabolic diseases.  Cellular insults that alter mitochondrial function can result in reduced energy production for cellular and\r\norganismal survival.  Recent work in this field by symposium participants has provided exciting new concepts on mitochondrial function and technological innovation.  From this symposium, a new synthesis of ideas will be published in a proceedings format, and new and renewed collaborations are expected to ensue.  This award will support both invited speakers and participating presenters, up to 8 people in total, 4 female and 4 male.  The participants from several US institutions range in stage of academic career from full professor to graduate student.  Scientific meetings are one of the best avenues available to foster and promote research and technological exchanges, collaborations, and career enhancement opportunities.  The ICCPB, in its 4-year cycle, has consistently been a premier meeting for workers in the field, and the 6th ICCPB should continue in this tradition.\r\n\r\n",
