 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on the dynamics of information flow and security in complex networks with respect to failures and attacks. The research is important because large networks such as the Internet and the electrical power grid are the backbone of a modern infrastructure, and their security is of great concern. \r\n\r\nThe basic research challenges to be addressed are: (1) cascading failures (or avalanches) in complex networks triggered by attacks; (2) the effect of range-based attacks on links; (3) fundamental structure and dynamics of social networks; and (4) synchronous dynamics on complex networks. The proposed research is expected to yield a solid foundation for understanding network dynamics and security. It will be a demonstration of how an interdisciplinary approach can lead to solutions to problems of  current concern. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research activity can find applications not only in physical sciences, engineering, and social sciences, but also in problems of significant societal concern. Involvement of students in interdisciplinary research is emphasized. The nature of the proposed research renders it relevant to industrial and defense applications, such as homeland security and critical infrastructure protection, and makes it interesting to the public as well.\r\n",
