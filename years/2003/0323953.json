Meerkov\r\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109\r\nAbstract\r\nThis grant provides funding for the development of theory and techniques for design of controllers in\r\nfeedback systems with linear plants and nonlinear sensors and actuators. This type of systems, referred\r\nto as linear plant, nonlinear instrumentation (LPNI) systems, often appear in aerospace, automotive\r\nand other applications, where plants can be linearized but the instrumentation is fundamentally\r\nnonlinear due to cost, power, weight and other physical constraints. Within this project, all main\r\nproblems of control, i.e., disturbance rejection, reference tacking, conservation laws, etc., will be\r\naddressed. The approach is based on the method of stochastic linearization, whereby the nonlinearities\r\nof the instrumentation are replaced by static gains, calculated as functions of the variance of the\r\nsignals at their inputs. Unlike local (i.e., Jacobian) linearization, this method is semi-global in the\r\nsense that it approximates the original system in arbitrarily large domains, defined by the signals\r\nat the inputs of the nonlinearities. The set of techniques, to be derived using this approach, is\r\nenvisioned as extensions of corresponding linear control tools, augmented by nonlinear relationships\r\nthat account for instrumentation nonlinearities. This set of tools is referred to as quasi-linear control\r\ntheory (QLCT).\r\nIf successful, the results of this work will lead to improvements in design of controllers for a wide\r\nrange of practical LPNI. Today, such controllers are often designed using linear theory and then\r\ntime-consuming and expensive validations and incremental improvements, based on simulations, are\r\ncarried out. QLCT will, to a large extent, eliminate the necessity of extensive simulations, since\r\nthe optimal controllers will be designed directly taking into account instrumentation nonlinearities.\r\nInitial application of these techniques for design of air-to-fuel ratio controllers at Ford Motor Co. is\r\nplanned.",
