 "awd_abstract_narration": "0331824   Logan   In this project we will demonstrate power generation from wastewater is optimal for current flow in an MFC when substrate is first fermented, and that power generation can be much higher than previously believed. Current flow has recently been demonstrated by others from microbial sediments in the ocean. However, power generation was low and it was not shown that power was coupled to specific substrates. Our hypothesis is that substrates produced by fermentation are optimal for electricity production if used by metal-reducing bacteria. Fermentation end products, such as acetate, ordinarily are used by slow growing methanogens. However, in a MFC bacteria capable of metal reduction have higher growth rates and will out grow methanogens. Thus, electricity generation could be stable and bacteria on the electrode would not be out competed by methanogens for available substrate.",
