 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bridges for Engineering Education Planning grant is a unique partnership between the University of Central Floida College of Engineering and College of Education and the Tangelo Park Community.   It  provides  the Tangelo  Park  children  with  new  high-tech  career  opportunities  with  high  economic  potential.  Further it increases the probability  that these children  will take advantage of guaranteed Tangelo Park Program college scholarships, and it builds on Tangelo Park.s commitment to improvement and growth.  The goals of this project are to increase the understanding of the entire community about  high-tech  career  opportunities,  and  to  ensure  that  their  students  have  the  skills  and knowledge  needed  to  succeed  in  post-secondary  quantitative  education  programs.    Specific objectives  of  the  planning  project  are  to  (1)  evaluate  the  ability  of  the  community  to  engage students in quantitative fields, (2) apply well-known pedagogical principles to improve the math and science curriculum in schools serving Tangelo Park students, (3) broadly disseminate results of  the  project  to  engineering  educators,  and  (4)  develop  a  full-scale  implementation  plan  for  a program  that  would  lead  to  increased  participation  and  success  of  minority  students  in engineering and other quantitative fields.  As with other aspects of the Tangelo Park project, this program  is  translatable  to  similar  communities  throughout  the  country  resulting  in  similar opportunities for economic development and community improvement.   \r\n \r\nTo meet the objectives described in Section 2, four tasks are envisioned.  These will include (1) a \r\nbaseline assessment of schools, students, and the community, (2) design of math and science pilot \r\nactivities  for  preK,  elementary,  middle  school,  high  school,  and  the  community,  (3) \r\nimplementation  and  assessment  of  the  pilot  programs,  and  (4)  development  of  a  program \r\nimplementation plan.  Expected outcomes of this project are an increase in the number of well prepared  Tangelo  Park  students  entering  engineering  and  related  fields,  documentation  of  the level of awareness \r\nin Tangelo Park of these careers, and a plan for implementation that can be used at similar communities anywhere. \r\n",
