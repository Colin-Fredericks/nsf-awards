 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world's oceans below 6,500 meters are presently virtually unexplored. These\r\ndiverse and inaccessible tectonic regimes pose significant questions about a wide range of fundamental problems in the earth and ocean sciences. These regimes include deep areas of active continental margins where major earthquakes are generated and hydrologic exchange occurs between subducted oceanic lithosphere and island arc complexes. Deep access to the seafloor in areas of ultra-slow spreading mid ocean ridges, primarily found in geographic regions of inhospitable weather or ice covered ocean (e.g. Arctic), would be a primary use for such a vehicle. The capability to routinely access the deepest ocean depths also has important implications for a broad range of science and engineering associated with ocean observatory and event response research that will explore 3D and 4D multidisciplinary problems for decades to come. Hybrid ROVs will enable the scientific community to quickly react to ocean floor volcanic and hydrothermal events from a wide range of UNOLS vessels, whereby follow-on experiments\r\ncan be designed and implemented based on detailed, first-order mapping and sampling conducted by the 11,000 meter HROV. Moreover, the HROV will provide the United States with fully global capability for search, survey, and recovery missions of national strategic importance.\r\n***\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWHOI has developed the Nereus vehicle to provide the U.S. oceanographic community with the first capable and cost-effective technology for regular and systematic access to the world\u00c6s oceans to 11,000 meters.  This new class of vehicle will be referred to as a Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle (HROV). In June of 2009, Nereus reached its design depth by exploring the bottom of the Challenger Deep at 10,902 meters.\n\nThe HROV has capabilities of both an AUV and ROV.  While operating untethered, the vehicle will enjoy the freedom of movement of an AUV, which had proven highly effective for a variety of survey operations.  While connected to the surface with the lightweight fiber optic tether, high bandwidth two-way communications will permit the return of high quality video and sensor data, enabling close-up inspection, sampling, and instrument deployment/ recovery operations to be conducted under the command of pilots and scientists onboard a research vessel.  Our vehicle concept allows conversion from an AUV to a Hybrid-ROV (HROV) while at sea; thereby enhancing the science mission capabilities on a single cruise from non-dynamically positioned vessels.  Our technical approach builds on the success of WHOI ROV and AUVs such as Jason 2 and ABE have established collaborations with the research groups that have pioneered the use of lightweight fiber optic tethers and ceramic pressure housing for 11,000 m operation.\n\nThe detailed design and construction of the vehicle has been completed and an initial series of maximum depth sea-trials undertaken in the Spring of 2009. Reports on results of these successful trials have been presented in meeting with each of the Federal Agencies involved in funding this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew D Bowen"
