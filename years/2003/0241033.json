Preliminary data demonstrate that the basalts were emplaced during reversed polarity chron 33R or younger, less than 83 million years ago. Hence, these rocks provide an ideal opportunity to further examine the evolution of the geomagnetic field (through comparisons of high latitude records from lavas erupted during and younger than the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron), and to understand the geodynamic significance of the Strand Fiord LIP (especially with respect to plume and nonplume models of formation). The shallow marine to terrestrial sediments associated with these rocks is also ideal for preserving climatically sensitive\r\nfossils, which they hope to continue to investigate. The proposed work will support a PhD student and undergraduate students.  Four to six undergraduates per field season typically take part in the field work. Many of these students will  continue analyses of samples in the laboratory as part of independent study projects and as part of undergraduate senior theses.\r\n\r\n",
