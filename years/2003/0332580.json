 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FAIM conferences focus on current research, best practices and future trends within the areas of global competitiveness and rapidly advancing technologies in flexible automation, information management, and integrated manufacturing. The conferences' objective is to provide a forum for both researchers and practitioners in the fields of Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing to share the latest research, developments and practices in the areas of the conference scope.\r\n\r\nThis year's FAIM conference includes nano-manufactuing and biomedical manufacturing as a part of its focus topics. These topics are an important direction of research for the College of Engineering, as well as the whole University of South Florida. Lead by the Industrial and Management Systems Engineering Department, the College of Engineering is working on developing an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Biomedical Manufacturing. The conference is expected to attract several leading researchers, providing a forum to share the latest research, developments and practices in these areas. Special tracks are planned in both of these topics. The biomedical manufacturing track will involve the Biomedical Manufacturers Consortium in the Tampa Bay area. The conference is promoted within the companies that are members of Consortium and a track is planned where biomedical manufacturing related issues will be discussed. Both of these topics are at the forefront of National Science Foundation's initiatives as indicated by special solicitations and workshops to motivate research in these areas and fit perfectly with the University's goals. \r\n\r\n",
