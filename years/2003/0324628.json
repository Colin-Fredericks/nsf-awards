 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nIn many mechanical and aerodynamic systems structural strength, stability and lightness are of primary\r\nimportance. The stability of a structure with a specified support and external loading can be characterized by\r\nan eigenvalue problem whose solution determines the non-trivial equilibrium configurations of the system.\r\nThe maximum external load that can be imposed on the structure is determined by the least eigenvalue of the\r\nsystem. The problem of designing an optimal structure that can support the largest load is more involved. It requires\r\nthe determination of structural parameters, e.g., the variable cross-sectional area of the structure, which\r\nmaximize the least eigenvalue of the system. An important example is due to Lagrange, who attempted to\r\ndetermine the shape of the strongest column with a specific length and mass. This apparently simple problem\r\nremained unsolved for more than one hundred and fifty years. Its analytical solution is still surrounded by\r\ncontroversy. \r\nThe main thrust of this research is that the standard optimization procedure is by no means the best way to\r\naddress the structural optimization problem involved. Depending on the failure criterion, there is a certain\r\nrelation between the structural mode of failure and the physical parameters of the optimal structure. In the\r\nLagrange problem the maximum bending stress in the ideal column is constant along its length. This condition\r\nimplies that the square of the fundamental buckling mode is proportional to the cube of the cross-sectional area\r\nfor the optimal column. This relation was vital in determining the exact analytical solution to the problem. It\r\nalso plays a major role in the new methodology proposed here, which consists of two stages:\r\n(a) Determining the relation between the mode-shape of failure and the physical parameters of the optimal\r\nstructure. This relation leads to an eigenvalue problem where elements of the stiffness matrix are known\r\nfunctions of an eigenvector of the system, and\r\n(b) Solving the inverse eigenvalue problem of determining the unknown parameters in the stiffness matrix\r\nsubject to the eigenvector constraint.\r\nThe project has practical engineering applications in new and emerging technologies related to fabrication\r\nof microstructures and their integration in new generation of mechanical components. Another important\r\napplication of the proposed research is in design of safe, reliable, and lightweight aerospace structures\r\nThe proposed activity will also contribute to the curriculum development of Machine Design Lab and\r\nStress Analysis. The students will take part in a design competition involving optimal design of structures\r\nThe project will support disadvantaged minority students by (a) directly involving them in the research,\r\nand (b) stimulating their interest in advancing themselves to pursue graduate study\r\n",
