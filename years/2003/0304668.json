 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to fund the design development of the MECO detector in FY 2003.  The MECO experiment is a large part of the Rare Symmetry Violating Processes (RSVP) program approved by the National Science Board in February 2001.  However, for a variety of reasons MREFC funding for construction of the experiments has not yet begun.  In order to proceed in an orderly manner with the RSVP experiments the Physics Division has provided modest R&D funds to develop the experimental detectors required.  This proposal is part of that activity.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this proposal seeks funding for a variety of essential R&D tasks to prepare for detector construction.  These tasks include beam line studies, superconducting solenoid magnet design, target design, straw tracker design, electron calorimeter R&D, trigger and data acquisition (DAQ) design, and project management.  The proposal does not prioritize the various projects except to note that the large state-of-the-art superconducting solenoids are on the critical path for the experiment.  \r\n \r\nRegarding broader impacts, the proposal discusses the profound impact on all of science a positive result for the MECO experiment would have.  Also, in this R&D proposal, the education and training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs are discussed and reference is made to the RSVP construction proposal in which activities to reach a much broader audience for science are discussed.   \r\n",
