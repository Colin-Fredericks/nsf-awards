 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perceptual learning is defined as experience-induced changes in the way information is extracted by these researchers who intend to investigate how perceptual learning occurs and whether it has implications for mathematics and science learning.  It is the process by which learners differentiate relevant structure from irrelevant variation.  The methods of research involve experimental investigations of conditions affecting perceptual learning, effects of structure discovery, and structure mapping variants of learning procedures on transfer.  Experiments will employ objective measures of learning such as speed, accuracy, and transfer to novel problems.  They will test and apply new learning technology such as automated sequencing algorithms that use a learner's speed and accuracy to assess learning and to sequence events for optimal efficiency.  \r\n\r\nThe panel reviewers noted that an investigation that might clarify perceptual learning might help supplement or even challenge prevailing constructivist theories of learning.  This way of thinking about learning could be an important discovery for mathematics and science learning.  \r\n",
