 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synchronization is an important component of reliable\r\ndata transmission. The problem of avoiding conflicts in asynchronous\r\nmultiple-access channels is investigated by utilizing methods from\r\nalgebraic and combinatorial coding theory.\r\nDifference systems of sets are combinatorial structures\r\nthat are being used to facilitate the design of codes with good\r\nsynchronization properties. Comma-free codes are brought into play \r\nin the organization of protocols for transmission over collision \r\nchannels in the absence of word synchronization.\r\n   Group testing techniques have numerous applications in fault \r\ndetection, error-control codes, and experimental designs.\r\nIn recent years, group testing has been studied in connection \r\nwith emerging new applications in multi-access communications,\r\nthe analysis of genetic information, chromosome mapping,\r\nand DNA library screening. This project explores the link between  \r\noptimal 2-stage testing schemes and combinatorial designs that \r\nminimize the expected number of tests, as well as algorithms \r\nfor the reconstruction of sequences by their subsequences or \r\nsuper-sequences.\r\n   Packet loss is a common source of errors in Internet transmissions \r\nthat has renewed the interest in deletion-correcting codes.  \r\nThe research concerning deletion and insertion correcting \r\ncodes will focus on finding bounds on the optimal size of a code \r\nwith prescribed error-correcting capacity, as well as\r\nconstructions of good 2-deletion-correcting codes that exceed\r\nthe Gilbert bound, and constructions of ordered Steiner\r\nsystems that yield optimal deletion-insertion correcting\r\ncodes.\r\n   The proposed research program presents an excellent \r\nopportunity for introducing graduate and upper level undergraduate\r\nstudents to the use of computers for learning and solving problems\r\nthat involve large scale algebraic and combinatorial operations \r\napplied on data structures of formidable size,  and utilizing\r\nthe computer as a tool for learning  and solving real-world problems\r\nthat arise in  various areas of science and engineering\r\nof today's information age.\r\n",
