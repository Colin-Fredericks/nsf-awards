 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical Engineering (55)-The Department of Electrical Engineering (ECEN) is developing and implementing a two-course sequence in electromagnetic (EM) fields based on proven teaching methods called VECTOR (Vitalizing Electromagnetic Concepts To Obtain Relevancy). VECTOR is being built around three exemplary modules: Module #1, \"Electromagnetic Fields and Waves\", is adapted from a model developed at the University of California at Berkeley; Module #2, \"Radio Communication Circuits\", is adapted from a model developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and, Module #3, \"Wireless and Circuits and Systems Design\", is adapted from a model developed at the University of South Florida. Project goals are to make EM relevant to students. This is being done by utilizing modern engineering tools and techniques to teach fundamental concepts, by pipelining students into the electromagnetics-photonics curriculum, and by evaluating VECTOR as a test-bed for future development of exemplary curricular materials. This project meets a substantial number of the criteria that show intellectual merit. VECTOR engages student teams in the design-build-test development of a realistic product by ensuring relevancy of the activities by including realistic product concepts and characteristics in the undergraduate EM fields curriculum. Furthermore, VECTOR addresses the target audience by adapting active learning techniques that are suitable for use in classes with large enrollments, and by emphasizing the fundamental physical concepts of EM fields rather than focusing only on rote analytic solutions. Assessment methods are directly correlated with project goals. That is, multiple assessments are being employed throughout the project period. For example, assessment of both student learning and project implementation processes are aiding in determining critical issues involved in the long-term sustainability of the VECTOR model. The involved faculty has expertise in education, assessment, and the specific pedagogies adapted. Thus, they are fully qualified to carry out the tasks of this project. The broader impact of this project is addressed in specific identified problems that exist at local and national levels, and by adapting active learning techniques that have been demonstrated to increase the retention of women and minorities in STEM degree programs. A modular approach is used in the dissemination of the exemplary teaching materials.",
