The funds requested will be used to fund graduate students, in particular, female and under-represented graduate students, and provide them with an exceptional opportunity to learn about the frontiers of colloid and surfactant science.  Funds will also be used to support the attendance of foreign speakers. The participation of foreign speakers will enrich the conference by enlightening the US participants of research in supramolecular engineering and science outside of the US.  \r\n\r\nAttendance of 110 -120 scientists and engineers is expected.  The conference will be organized along the lines of synthesis, properties and applications.  The program for the conference has four themes: 1) Novel Materials for Sensing, 2) Surfactant-Templated Materials, 3) Novel Surfactant Systems and 4) Supramolecular Chemistry for Nanotechnology.  A final report will be prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation. \r\n",
