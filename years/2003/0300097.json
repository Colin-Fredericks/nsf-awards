 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patient-Adaptive Feedback Controllers for Heart Assist Devices\r\nA. Project Summary\r\nHeart transplant candidates often wait long periods (300 days or more on the average) before a suitable\r\ndonor heart becomes available, and many of these candidate die while awaiting heart transplantation.\r\nConsequently, the medical community has been placing increased emphasis on the use of mechanical\r\ndevices that can substitute for, or enhance, the function of the natural heart. A Ventricular Assist Device\r\n(VAD) is such a device. This device if often used as a bridge to mechanically support a patient while\r\nawaiting heart transplantation, or while their natural heart recovers. But the ultimate use of this device is as\r\na long-term iocurelr for heart failure. In either case, the goal of a VAD is to provide the patient with as close\r\nto a normal lifestyle as possible. The goal for all concerned is to allow patients to return home and return\r\nto the workforce.\r\nAn important challenge facing the increased use of VADs is the development of an appropriate controller\r\nfor these devices. The latest generation of VADs, based on turbo-dynamic pumps, requires a controller that\r\ncan adjust the speed of the rotor (pump impeller) to meet the circulatory demand of the patient. Therefore,\r\nin addition to being robust and reliable, such a controller should be able to adapt to the daily activities and\r\nthe physiological changes of the patient. In this project we propose to investigate the theoretical and\r\nfundamental issues associated with the development of such a controller. More specifically, (1) we will\r\ncontinue our ongoing work on the development of a generalized model of a rotary blood pump that, when\r\ncoupled to existing model of the human cardiovascular system, will serve as a simulation model for further\r\ndevelopment; (2) we will develop a robust optimal feedback control algorithm that provides the flexibility\r\nto incorporate various sensor inputs as available, and (3) we will implement the control algorithm into a PC\r\nplatform and test its responsiveness in a mock circulating flow loop. The principal functions of this\r\nfeedback controller will be: (1) to determine and maintain appropriate cardiac output, subject to constraints\r\nimposed by the device and the patients condition including avoiding ventricular suction; (2) to identify\r\nsystem variables and parameters to monitor the patient's condition, indicating when the patient's\r\ncardiovascular status is improving or deteriorating and detecting component failures; (3) to recognize\r\ndifferent operating conditions and data environments, responding to changes in the signals available for\r\nmeasurement from the patient and the assist device; (4) to monitor the control strategy (algorithm) itself to\r\navoid uncontrollable situations and inappropriate or dangerous control actions; and (5) to provide a fail-safe\r\nmode of operation by entering a preset open-loop operating mode when a hardware or algorithmic failure\r\noccurs.\r\nThe primary intellectual merit of the proposed research will be to increase our understanding of\r\nfundamental technical issues related to the control of non-conventional complex systems, such as the\r\nVADs, that involve both electromechanical as well as physiological components. A truly interdisciplinary\r\napproach, with expertise coming from the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical engineering fields as well\r\nas the medical profession, is needed to develop the mathematical framework needed to be able to\r\neffectively control such systems.\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research will primarily be in improving the quality of life for\r\ncardiovascular patients awaiting heart transplantation. Any improvement in the existing technology of the\r\nventricular assist devices will have a tremendous effect on the physical condition and ultimately the\r\nrecovery of patients suffering from congestive heart failure. It is hoped that this study, leading to the\r\ndevelopment of a patient adaptive feedback controller, will provide an opportunity for these patients to\r\nleave the hospital, return home, and re-enter the work force while awaiting for a donor heart. Another\r\nimportant impact of this project is in training engineering graduate (and a few undergraduate) students\r\nfrom the electrical, mechanical, and biomedical, departments to work together as a team in this highly\r\ninterdisciplinary field. This project will provide an opportunity for students to apply what they have\r\nlearned in the control and signal processing courses to a realistic (but not very well defined mathematically)\r\nproblem that has a tremendous societal impact.",
