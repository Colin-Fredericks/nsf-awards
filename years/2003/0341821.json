The PI's studies indicate that large (>25m) and rapid (<<1m.y.) eustatic variations occurred in the Late Cretaceous Greenhouse world.  This requires that either small ice sheets paced sea-level changes during this time, or our understanding of causal mechanisms for global sea-level change is fundamentally flawed.  Foraminiferal oxygen isotope changes are consistent with a glacioeustatic cause.  This award will allow the PIs to take advantage of an opportunity for joint funding and collaboration with the New Jersey Geological Survey (NJGS) and the US Geological Survey (USGS) by drilling a borehole on the coast of NJ near Manasquan, NJ that will provide the thickest marine Upper Cretaceous section in the region and tie to offshore MCS profiles obtained in 2002.  These seismic profiles cross thick marine Upper Cretaceous strata, revealing sequence stratigraphic geometries for this Greenhouse interval;  drilling at Manasquan will provide detailed age and facies controls on these seismic sequences.  In addition, the NJGS is funding drilling costs for Upper Cretaceous targets at Millville, NJ (1500 ft) and Batsto, NJ (1500 ft.).  Together, these 5 sites will provide updip-downdip and along-strike transects that will fully characterize the ages, facies, and distribution of Late Cretaceous sequences.\r\n\r\nThe USGS Eastern Earth Surface Processes Team will drill a 1600 ft. borehole at Manasquan;  and will follow this with a 1500-1600 ft. borehole at Batsto in Spring 2004\r\n",
