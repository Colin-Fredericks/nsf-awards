Researchers from the ongoing NOAA research program on BWT will present current studies, and a Maritime Administration (MARAD) National Defense Reserve Fleet vessel will be visited to illustrate ballast water operations and possibilities for using NDRF vessels as in port tenders for BWT. Presentations about the range of ANS and about microbial hazards to human health, fish and shellfish will lead off two days of short presentations and breakout working groups on approaches to BW management system and to BW treatment. The groups will develop research issues and research needs in these areas, perhaps accomplishing prioritization and research approaches for some technologies. A report will be prepared by the PI, posted at the website for discussion, revised and submitted to NSF in the summer.",
