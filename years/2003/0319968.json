 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses development of an epoxy-less fiber pigtailing technology using anodic fiber bonding appropriate for use with telecommunications transmitters or receivers, or for integration of sensors directly with fibers. The subgoals include: development of the anodic bonding technology for parallel fiber; modeling of the stress distribution in the fiber due to this bonding; characterization of the strength of the fiber-to-Si bond; and, fabrication of a prototype Si bench with a V-groove suitable for passive alignment of fiber to an active device and measurement of the thermal stability of the coupling efficiency. This is based on a solid body of preliminary work, including demonstration of facet-to-Si anodic bonding, and development of telecommunications modules using epoxied fiber-in-a-V-groove to telecommunication laser characterization\r\n \r\nThe  research will result in unprecedented levels of cost effectiveness, device performance, miniaturization, and ruggedness of a variety of photonic devices. This will substantially increase U.S. competitiveness in international microelectronics production, new fabrication and assembly technologies. Applications may be found in detection, telecommunications, information processing, micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS), and X-ray device technologies. \r\n\r\n",
