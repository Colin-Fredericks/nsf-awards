Questions such as: Who do people pay attention to for learning the concepts, theories, practices, techniques, habit and categories that govern their behavior? Do children, for example, principally learn from their parents, siblings, friends, or other 'popular' children? Are they conformists? (and if so, to what degree?) Does 'who they learn from' or their degree of conformity vary with age? What is the relative importance of teaching, role model imitation, conformity and punishment in transmitting cultural beliefs, values, etc? For adults, how much are their changes in beliefs, practices, values and goals influenced by prestigious peers, conformism to the most popular beliefs or individual experience? How do individual characteristics like social status and gender affect the relative importance of these different sources of influence? The nature and complexity of modern life (many social groups, TV, etc.) makes this question extremely difficult to address with anything but superficial survey research or 'out-of-context' laboratory manipulations. However, by focusing on a population on a small island in a remote part of the Fijian archipelago, this project takes advantage of an analytically simpler context to gather both cross-sectional and longitudinal data (initial grant is for 5 years) on the process of cultural learning in cultural domains related to social relations (moral norms) and ecological knowledge. Using detailed observation, interviews and experimental techniques, the researchers will be able to chart but the distribution of culturally learned beliefs, etc. and the pathways of learning. Combining these data with recently developed (and developing) analytical techniques, the researchers will be able to quantitatively address the above questions and more. Educationally, this research program will also provide training and research experience for young and aspiring scientists. The educational component is designed to integrate both across disciplinary boundaries (e.g., anthropology, biology and psychology) and across universities, as well as to provide students with a unique combination of field experience and methodological tools for studying the processes of cultural learning. More broadly, this research has substantial implications for public policy and education. Policy makers at many levels and across a variety of areas are interested in designing programs and interventions to change people's beliefs (e.g., about STD transmission), practices (whether to use genetically modified seeds), and values (about drugs, crime or 'the environment'). This research goes to the core of the issue, by developing rigorously grounded theories about 'who influences whom' (and when, developmentally) in populations. Such knowledge could be essential for making constructing more targeted interventions (e.g., for spreading novel practices) in fields as diverse as public health, agriculture and conservation. Further, in addition to the scientific knowledge, the research program will contribute to training the next generation of researchers to see beyond the usual disciplinary boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004. \r\n\r\n",
