Her research will explore the nature of intervening absorption between distant Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO's) and ourselves.  This absorption of ultraviolet Lyman-alpha radiation by neutral hydrogen atoms is seen at all redshifts, and can be used to map out the intervening material.  Dr. Rosenberg will combine ground-based optical and radio observations with space-based ultraviolet spectroscopy to study the nature of these absorbers locally, i.e. at low redshifts. She will use deep galaxy surveys to look for correlations between low redshift absorbers and galaxies. Ultraviolet space-based observations will also allow her to use these absorbers as probes of a statistically significant sample of galaxy halos. Using these two techniques she will study the sizes and structure of the galaxy halos, as well as the spread of heavy elements through those halos due to feedback processes. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her research, Dr. Rosenberg will conduct a two-pronged effort in teaching and outreach at the K-12 and undergraduate levels. She will work with the Science Explorers program at the University of Colorado, a program that provides professional development for K-12 teachers through day-long, activity-based workshops with the teachers and five of their students.  Dr. Rosenberg will work on curriculum development in astronomy and also assist with some of the workshops. After a year of working with this program, she will work with astronomy professors in developing material using innovative methods for the large undergraduate survey course in astronomy.  \r\n***",
