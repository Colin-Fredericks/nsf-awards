 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I aims to develop an electrochemical DNA biosensor to simultaneously detect and identify multiple nucleic acid determinants of a variety of biological pathogens using a combination of dynamic hybridization, microfluidics, and electrochemical detection.  The sensitivity of the detection method is high enough that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification could be eliminated.  The detection system would consist of a sampling device, sample lysis and hybridization chamber fluidically connected to an electrochemical cell for detection.  With this method, specific target nucleic acid species captured by oligonucleotide probes on magnetic particles are released into neighboring working electrode where the nucleic acid targets are directly detected by electrochemical oxidation.  This provides a method of rapid, highly sensitive, and specific DNA detection without the need for complicated sample purification procedures, exogenous labels, labile reagents, or expensive, heavy, power-hungry instrumentation.  \r\n\r\nThe commercial use of this product will be in military applications and homeland defense for prompt detection of potential bioterrorist attacks. Development of such devices for DNA and RNA detection without the need for amplification steps would also find wide application in the detection of pathogens in medical diagnostics, point-of-care clinical testing, environmental monitoring, agriculture, food production, and various industrial settings. \r\n",
