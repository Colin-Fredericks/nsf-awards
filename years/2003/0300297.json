 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate strategies and techniques for optimizing five-axis tool paths required in high-speed machining of complex products.  To generate optimal feed schedules for high-speed machining, both the geometric error analysis and the physical mechanistic errors that are relevant to five-axis machining of complex parts are considered.  A robust modulated performance control system combined with a machining potential-field analysis will be developed to improve the computational efficiency of contour-curve interpolation for optimization of five-axis high-speed machining.   \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research project would open up a number of possibilities for high-speed machining of complex products.  The application of high-speed machining has been recognized as an economically viable manufacturing technology for increased productivity and throughput.  The results of this research will provide techniques that are critical for future development of high-performance, five-axis machining with feed scheduling.  This research could also extend the capability of computational geometric and mechanistic modeling of high-performance machining to provide both the speed and accuracy required for state-of-the-art manufacturing operations.  The developed techniques will enable more adaptive and agile machining processes for next-generation manufacturing.",
