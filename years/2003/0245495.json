 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is one of three proposals to each plan participation in a new multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to both industry and universities on the analysis of multiphase phenomena. This new multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the industry through having each member's resources being enhanced by those of its partners which are also being recommended to receive a planning grant.  The three partners, of which this is one are the Michigan State University, University of Tulsa, and University of Akron.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Center's goal is to focus on tackling the sophisticated  challenges of computational multiphase transport phenomena which are  of importance in the  automotive, biochemical, chemical, food, mining, petrochemical an pharmaceutical industries.\r\n\r\nThe new center will focus on challenging  problems in:\r\n\r\n- Multiphase turbulent flows\r\n- Multiphase materials processing,\r\n- Multiphase mixing\r\n- Next generation filtration based on nanoscale fibers, and multiphase separations.\r\n",
