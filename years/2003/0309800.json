 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to illuminate one of the largest remaining gaps in our knowledge of primate and human evolution-understanding when, where, and how the earliest primates evolved.  Modern primates include lemurs, lorises, bushbabies, tarsiers, monkeys, apes and humans. Currently, the fossil record is inadequate to resolve a number of important questions about the earliest phases of primate evolution. At present, the oldest fossil primates are roughly 55 million years old. However, by this time primates already possessed virtually modern anatomy, and they had already diversified into several major groups. Both of these points imply that primates experienced some earlier interval of evolutionary history that has so far eluded the best efforts of paleontologists.  Because the nearest living and fossil relatives of primates are found in Asia, we will search for additional fossil evidence of early primates on that continent. Specifically, we will survey fossil-bearing strata of appropriate age in Inner Mongolia to test whether primates appear earlier in Asia than they do elsewhere on the planet. Preliminary fieldwork in this region has shown that small, tree-dwelling fossil mammals can be recovered there in great abundance, suggesting that early primates will also be found once reasonable samples are collected. \r\n\r\nWe will also undertake anatomical and evolutionary studies of fossil primates from Asia that were collected by our earlier expeditions to this region. Among other things, this research will show that Asia harbored a wider range of early primates than was previously suspected.  Some of these new and undescribed Asian primates are related to fossils from North America, while others share affinities with African fossils.  Once evolutionary studies of these new Asian fossils are completed, we will have a much greater understanding of how global climate change and continental drift impacted the early evolution of our distant primate relatives.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance broader societal objectives by: (1) increasing public understanding of evolutionary biology and paleoanthropology through popular books, magazine articles, museum exhibits, and public lectures; (2) training students in practical and theoretical aspects of paleontology and paleoanthropology; (3) enhancing international collaboration among American and Chinese scientists; and (4) generating a unique collection of fossils that will become a permanent resource for scholars for generations to come.   \r\n",
