The Division of Neurobiology is one of the youngest of the ten divisions of SICB; this symposium is its second annual program. The symposium highlights work from the local region near the meeting city, with a unique plan that pairs talks from a junior member with one from the laboratory head. This plan gives excellent experience and exposure with low cost to younger researchers in a small meeting. This year the talks are related to motor control, with five pairs of speakers, and the meeting in Toronto, Canada involves international participants. The topics are timely, on invertebrate and vertebrate systems, and the main speaker in each pair is widely recognized. Modest funding is for travel awards for participants. Dissemination of the SICB Symposia is through publication in the journal Integrative & Comparative Biology.\r\n   The SICB meetings also have an impact on training and education by bringing in graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs for interdisciplinary interactions with established investigators.\r\n",
