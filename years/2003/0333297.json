 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to produce annotated genome sequences for two biovars of Agrobacterium; the biovar II strain, A. radiobacter K84 and the biovar III strain, A. vitis S4. Previous analysis of the biovar I representative of this diverse species provided intriguing insights into the evolutionary relationship shared between this pathogen and symbionts of the Rhizobiaceae. Our choice of K84 as the bv II representative is based on the large amount of published data available regarding the field properties of this strain as well as its position as the single most effective biological control agent available for any bacterial disease of plants. The bv III representative, S4, was chosen based on a number of intriguing biological properties including its narrow host range, its unique T-DNA composition and organization as well as its ability to produce a hypersensitive response on non-host plants via a mechanism that is apparently distinct from that of other phytopathogens. This project brings together expertise from five independent groups with significant experience in Agrobacterium biology, genomics and undergraduate education. A key portion of this project is geared towards providing a training platform in genomics technology for undergraduate researchers at different participating institutions. Such participation will both facilitate our project goals and provide key training for new scientists. Access to the genome sequence of these organisms will allow extensive comparative genomic analyses, relate genotype to field biology and behavior, and facilitate the molecular characterization of biological control, host range and the unique factors mediating the hypersensitive response.",
