 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant explores synthesis and detailed structural mechanical characterization of iron-based bulk metallic glasses. A major objective is to synthesize bulk metallic glasses using powder metallurgy technique of mechanical alloying followed by consolidation using pressing at elevated temperatures. The aim is to produce composites with fine dispersion of nanometer-sized particles of intermetallics in the amorphous matrix by judicious selection of processing parameters. The structural characterization involves x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The mechanical properties will be investigated using instrumented indentation to establish the correlation between structure and properties of the new types of alloys. \r\n\r\nSynthesis of bulk metallic glasses and their nanocrystalline composites by mechanical alloying will enable production of glassy materials in the systems that could not be produced or produced insufficient section thickness by other and more traditional techniques starting from the liquid state. Instrumented indentation over nano- and microscales offers itself as an effective and versatile tool for qualitative and quantitative mechanical characterization. The mechanical characterization from the continuously decreasing size of engineering structures will have application in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The broader educational impacts include integration of research into teaching through the development and introduction of new courses such as 'Experimental Techniques in Mechanics and Materials,' and 'Non-equilibrium Processing of Materials.' The outreach is planned to high schools and diverse communities through the Florida Engineering Education Delivery System (FEEDS).",
