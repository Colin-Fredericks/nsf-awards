 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is in the development of multi-functional polymers that can alter and change recognition properties.  This is accomplished by the use of restricted rotation about C(aryl)-N(imide) bonds.  The molecules can be annealed in the presence of a guest to form complementary structures. These can then be \"saved\" as stable conformers by cooling to room temperature.  \"Saved\" conformations can be \"erased\" by heating in the absence of guest or \"rewritten\" by heating with a different guest.  The proposed mechanism for this behavior shares some similarities with dynamic biological processes such as protein folding.  \r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Ken Shimizu of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, S.C.  Professor Shimizu will focus his research on the development of \"smart polymers\" capable of recognizing particular molecules.  This research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the principles governing the behavior of polymeric materials.  Chemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will be trained in Professor Shimizu's laboratory, and outreach activities to K-12 students will be extended.\r\n\r\n",
