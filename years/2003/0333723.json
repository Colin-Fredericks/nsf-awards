 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a contribution to the NSDL that overcomes barriers to mainstream use of image processing and analysis (IPA) in K-12 education. The system (1) makes IPA accessible to mainstream educators and the public as an easy to use tool for learning; (2) affords access by educators to extensive and updateable archives of imaging data; and (3) provides a pedagogical structure that helps educators use imaging data in a manner that supports attainment of specific national education standards.  The project creates a three-tiered structure that supports student's use of IPA from basic explorations of how imaging is used in various fields of science to original research on data available from an archive. The first tier features tutorials that guide students through case studies replicating research conducted by leading imaging scientists and explains key concepts in imaging science. Tier two implements, in an online format, updated versions of existing materials and new lessons based on guided-discovery approaches. Tier three provides a structure for students and teachers to conduct self-guided research using archive images as well as images from selected Internet sources.  Schools, teachers, and districts from across the United States have been recruited to be testers for the project, representing a cross-section of the educators and students who can be expected to use the finalized system. Sustainability is addressed by producing CD-ROM versions of the software and resources for sale online and via established resellers. Additional online subscription is available through a \"pay-per-license\" service for lessons and resources provided by the Web site.  All of the developed materials are available to NSDL developers at no cost.  The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences is providing significant co-funding of this project in recognition of the importance of a digital library for the support of this project to enhance tools and adopt and generate resources for image processing and analysis for teachers and students.",
