Sullivan\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the topology of\r\nmoduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, their applications to string\r\ntopology, and certain mathematical questions arising from string\r\ntheory in physics. It is a collaborative project involving\r\nalgebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and Riemann surface\r\ntheory. It will pursue significant new research opportunities\r\narising from three recent important developments: The\r\nMadsen-Weiss proof of the famous conjecture of Mumford on the\r\nstable cohomology of moduli spaces, the discovery by Chas and\r\nSullivan of the new structures on the topology of loop spaces of\r\nmanifolds, and recent advances in open string theory in physics.\r\nOne of the goals of this project is to understand the\r\nimplications of Madsen and Weiss' theorem on the Chas-Sullivan\r\n\"String topology\" theory.  Another aspect of this project is to\r\nstudy the relationship between string topology and Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory in algebraic geometry.  A longer term goal of this project\r\nis to investigate how this theory can help to give a mathematical\r\nframework for analyzing certain specific questions motivated by\r\nopen string theory in physics.\r\n\r\nGeometric questions have long been motivated by the attempt to\r\nunderstand physical theories.  Einstein's general theory of\r\nrelativity, and the attempt to place it in firm mathematical\r\nfoundations, motivated much of the development of differential\r\ngeometry throughout the 20th century.  During the last 20 years\r\nof the century generalizations of the famous Maxwell's equations\r\nfor electricity and magnetism led to new techniques for studying\r\ngeometry and topology in dimensions three and four.  String\r\ntheory is a relatively new quantum theory of gravity.  Placing it\r\nin firm mathematical foundations is quite challenging, and has\r\nmotivated quite a bit of new research in geometry.  For example\r\nthe techniques of string theory predicted the answers to some\r\nclassical questions in enumerative geometry, many of which were\r\nlater verified using a new theory in algebraic geometry due to\r\nthe mathematician M. Gromov, and the physicist, E. Witten.\r\nString theory involves understanding how vibrating strings evolve\r\nthrough time.  As a string evolves, it maps out a two dimensional\r\n\"world sheet\".  So the mathematics behind string theory must\r\nstudy spaces of \"strings\", or curves and loops, as well as spaces\r\nof two dimensional surfaces in an ambient space.  This project\r\nhas been motivated by recent advances in understanding the\r\ntopological structure of spaces of strings, (\"string topology\"),\r\nas well as a separate breakthrough in understanding the space of\r\ntwo dimensional surfaces.  The goal of this project is to\r\nunderstand the implications of this breakthrough on \"string\r\ntopology\", understand how this topological theory is related to\r\nthe geometric theory of Gromov and Witten, and to apply these\r\ntheories to certain specific questions arising from string theory\r\nin physics.  This award supports a Focused Research Group based\r\nat Stanford University and SUNY at Stony Brook.\r\n",
