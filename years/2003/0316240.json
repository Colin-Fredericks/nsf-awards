 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coordinated movements are characterized by precise temporal sequences of muscle activation, referred to as \"motor patterns.\"  These motor pattern sequences are produced by networks of neurons (nerve cells) called \"central pattern generators\" (CPGs) in the central nervous system.  This project examines the neuronal mechanisms that are utilized by spinal cord CPG networks to generate rhythmic and coordinated swimming movements of the forelimbs and hindlimbs.  Neural pathways that coordinate the timing of forelimb and hindlimb CPGs will be investigated, as well as the intrinsic cellular properties of spinal CPG neurons.  These experiments permit the investigation of cellular mechanisms contributing to the construction of complex, coordinated limb movements.  This research will provide opportunities for behavioral neuroscience training for graduate and undergraduate students. The investigation of motor control mechanisms in biological neural networks has direct impact on new approaches to paralysis and the design of biologically inspired control systems in robotics.",
