 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the Fall semester of 2003 the Mathematical Sciences Research\r\nInstitute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California will sponsor a special program in\r\nDiscrete and Computational Geometry. The organizers for this semester-long\r\nprogram are Jesus De Loera (University of California at Davis), Herbert\r\nEdelsbrunner (Duke University), Jacob E. Goodman (City University of New\r\nYork), Janos Pach (New York University), Micha Sharir (Tel Aviv\r\nUniversity), Emo Welzl (ETH Zuerich), and Guenter Ziegler (Technische\r\nUniversitaet Berlin). The program will have many activities, including\r\npublic lectures, research for undergraduates, mini-courses, weekly\r\nseminars, and three workshops. This award provides funding to help cover\r\nlodging and travel expenses for participants in the workshops.\r\n\r\nThe Introductory Workshop is designed to introduce a broad range of\r\ncomputer scientists, mathematicians, scientists working in related fields,\r\nand others interested in the topics of the program to current research in\r\nthese areas. The second workshop, on Mathematical Foundations of Geometric\r\nAlgorithms, is intended more as a forum for researchers in computer\r\nscience and mathematics to discuss their recent work with other active\r\nresearchers. This workshop will focus on the design and analysis of\r\ngeometric algorithms, and on the mathematical and algorithmic techniques\r\nneeded to make these algorithms efficient. The third workshop, on\r\nCombinatorial and Discrete Geometry, will study discrete geometric objects\r\n(polyhedra, geometric graphs, sphere packings, tilings, lattices, and so\r\nforth) and their combinatorial structure, stressing the connections\r\nbetween discrete geometry and algebra, combinatorics, and topology.\r\n\r\nThe Introductory Workshop in particular will extend the impact of the\r\nprogram well beyond the core of recognized researchers in this particular\r\narea. MSRI's Human Resources Advisory Committee established the\r\nintroductory workshops in 1992 as a vehicle for making the material of\r\nMSRI's major programs available to a broad scientific audience,\r\nparticularly women and minorities who are still much too underrepresented\r\nin the scientific enterprise. Through outreach activities such as a\r\nspecial weekend on geometry at Howard University in September 2002, MSRI\r\nhas recruited participants from underrepresented groups to participate in\r\nits 2003-04 programs and particularly the introductory workshops, and will\r\nwork with these participants to help make the material of the workshops\r\nuseful for their endeavors at their home institutions. The PI and co-PI\r\nfor this grant have already recruited several participants for these\r\nworkshops who are from historically Black colleges and universities, and\r\nwho have expressed a strong interest in bringing material from these\r\nworkshops into contact with students in their undergraduate research\r\nprograms and classrooms.\r\n",
