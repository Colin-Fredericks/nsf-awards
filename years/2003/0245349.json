Friedman\r\n\r\nFriedman proposes to continue his efforts into extending the\r\nscope of the incompleteness phenomena. Under prior NSF support,\r\nFriedman has discovered a new mathematical theory which seeks to\r\nanalyze the Boolean relations that hold between sets and their\r\nimages under functions of several variables. This new Boolean\r\nrelation theory seeks to analyze statements of the form \"for all\r\nfunctions of a certain kind, there exist sets of a certain kind,\r\nsuch that a given Boolean relation holds among the sets and their\r\nimages under the functions\". Under prior NSF support, Friedman\r\ndiscovered a \"singular\" statement of a particularly simple form\r\nin Boolean relation theory that can be proved only by going\r\nbeyond the usual axioms for mathematics.  Friedman has considered\r\nall 6561 statements of the same simple form and showed that all\r\ncan be proved or refuted using weak axioms, with the sole\r\nexception (up to symmetry) of the \"singular\" statement.  Friedman\r\nproposes to develop Boolean relation theory in several\r\ndirections, including expanding the set of 6561 statements, and\r\nshifting to many diverse mathematical contexts.\r\n\r\nBy the early part of the 20th century, the standard axioms and\r\nrules of mathematics had been established - the so called Zermelo\r\nFrankel axioms of set theory (ZFC). In the 1930's, Kurt Godel\r\nstunned the mathematical world with his incompleteness theorems\r\nthat showed that any systematization such as ZFC is\r\nincomplete. I.e., there will always remain sentences that can\r\nneither be proved nor refuted within that systematization. This\r\nis normally referred to as the incompleteness phenomenom. Godel's\r\noriginal examples of statements of unprovable and unrefutable in\r\nZFC were very far removed from the usual considerations of\r\nmathematicians. Through a series of developments, starting with\r\nlater work of Godel and Cohen, various specialists in set theory,\r\nwork of Friedman recognized by the NSF Alan T. Waterman Award in\r\n1984, and more recent work of Friedman, a body of such examples\r\nhas been built up that are of increasing relevance to normal\r\nmathematical considerations. Recent work of Friedman along these\r\nlines gives new reasons for rethinking and extending the usual\r\nZFC axioms for mathematics. To test the broader impact of the\r\nresearch, Friedman actively seeks and obtains regular feedback on\r\nthe \"naturalness\" and \"normality\" of the various examples from\r\nthe wider mathematical community. Friedman seeks to widen this\r\nbroader impact.\r\n",
