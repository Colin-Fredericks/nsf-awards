 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UTeach Noyce Scholarship program is providing support to mathematics, science, and computer science majors and post-baccalaureate candidates preparing to become secondary teachers.  For each of three years, 21  undergraduates and post-baccalaureate teacher candidates enrolled in the UTeach teacher preparation program at the University of Texas at Austin receive Noyce scholarships or stipends. The UTeach teacher preparation program, jointly developed and taught by the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Education at the University of Texas at Austin, offers multiple entry points for undergraduates and post-baccalaureate students.  The program includes courses built around field experiences in high-need schools, development of teaching portfolios, participation in internships, and extensive induction support for new teachers.   Through a partnership with Austin Independent School District, UTeach preservice students teach model lessons with supervision from master teachers.  The effectiveness of Noyce Scholarship recipients is being evaluated through the use of a Fitness to Teach instrument developed by the UTeach program.",
