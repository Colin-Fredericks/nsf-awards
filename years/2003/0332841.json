 "awd_abstract_narration": "When educators read the AAUW Educational Foundation's Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age (2000) report they generally have two responses, We must change the way we teach, and then How can I change the way I teach? The report highlights the critical need to encourage girls in technology from early childhood through middle and high school. It was instrumental in creating a movement to change technology education. Tech Savvy summarizes research that shows that girls do not perceive technology as interesting nor technology careers as appealing. The way technology is currently taught often dissuades them. \r\n\r\nA new Tech Savvy video and teacher's resource guide were designed as tools for educators, parents, students, and community-oriented professionals to change girls' experience of technology. AAUW Educational Foundation will use its national network of 100,000 members (parents, educators, students), 1,300 Branches, and 600 College/University member institutions to distribute copies of the video, guide and the report. In addition, the video will be broadcast via Fairfax County Public School satellite television network and others. \r\n\r\nThe dissemination project will leverage the value recognized in the original Tech Savvy report and intensify its reach, with the ultimate aim of closing the gender gap in technology education and in the information technology workforce. \r\n\r\n",
