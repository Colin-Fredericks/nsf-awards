 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the synthesis of polyfuran and co-polymers of polyfuran, pyrrole, and thiophene, doped with various concentrations of p-toluene sulfonate, trifluoromethyl sulfonate and perchlorate.  The thermal and mechanical stability as well as electrical conductivity of the polymers will then be characterized and compared to undoped counterparts.  The research will be carried out by undergraduates in order to help prepare them for graduate school and careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nWith this RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Rose M. McConnell of the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Arkansas, Monticello.  Professor McConnell  will focus her work on developing methods for the synthesis of a series of doped polymers which will be investigated for interesting physical properties.  The research will be used to train undergraduate students in research skills not normally available in an undergraduate institution.",
