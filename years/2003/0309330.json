Many studies have demonstrated how\r\nenvironmental circumstances, both ecological and social, influence the benefits\r\nand costs associated with the various behavioral options available to\r\nindividuals and thus how they these factors structure animal societies.  Yet in\r\nspecies where potential relationships are many and those that form are fluid,\r\nthe link between environmental features and the relationships that develop are\r\npoorly understood. This project explores how ecological features, such as the\r\ndistribution of food, water and predator-free sites, together with the\r\ndemographic and social features, such as population density and sex ratio,\r\nshape individual relationships in the Grevy's zebra and wild ass, two\r\nevolutionarily closely related species exhibiting 'fissioning' and 'fusing'\r\nsocial systems. We have developed a novel model that predicts rules for the\r\nformation and breakdown of relationships in such 'open-membership' societies\r\nand forecasts the impact these rules will have on population-wide social\r\npatterns and processes.  Data will be gathered on two endangered equid species,\r\nGrevy's zebra and Onagers, from four sites. The four sites provide natural\r\nvariation in the key environmental and social forces and will serve as an ideal\r\nsystem for testing the predictions of our model. The study will also provide\r\nuseful information needed to improve conservation strategies for these species\r\nby educating students and the local populace and by demonstrating to natural\r\nresource managers how fundamental behavioral research can assist in designing\r\neffective management plans.\r\n\r\n",
