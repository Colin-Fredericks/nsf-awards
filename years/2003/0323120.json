 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal partially supports a workshop on stochastic programming scheduled for October 9-10, 2004, at the University of Arizona, in conjunction with the tri-annual conference of the Committee on Stochastic Programming of the Mathematical Programming Society October 11-15.  The idea is to leverage the presence of leading researchers at the conference to offer a tutorial symposium that will inform and attract Ph.D. students to the field, including overviews of recent progress and opportunities for future research.\r\n  \r\nStochastic programming was once so computationally challenging that it existed only in textbooks, but recent progress has made it possible to solve model of application scale.  Methods are now used routinely in design and financial planning activities involving major risk and uncertainty.  This progress has reinvigorated researcher interest, but the unique synthesis of optimization and stochastic branches of operations research required to conduct research in this area makes it difficult for Ph.D. students to enter.  This symposium will contribute to overcoming these hurdles, by exposing promising students to several of the best minds in the field.\r\n",
