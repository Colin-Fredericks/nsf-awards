 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the preparation of metallodendritic nanosensor architectures susceptible to a specific change in fluorescence in the presence of anions.  The building blocks will be composed of a receptor moiety capable of anion binding, and a ligand, connected by a fluorescent pi-conjugated oligomer. The metal-ligand coordination will drive the assembly of nanosized dendritic architectures.  The ligand and metal template are selected to form fluorescent tris(quinolato)AL3+, bis(quinolato)Zn2+ or tris(1,10-phenanthroline)Os2+ complexes exhibiting metal-to-ligand charge transfer states.  The resulting metallodendrimers would form a highly fluorescent architecture that would be susceptible to a change in optical properties in the presence of anionic substances that can bind to the receptors contained in the architecture.\r\n\r\nWith this Nanoscale: Exploratory Research (NER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Chemistry Office of Special Projects are supporting the research of Dr. Pavel Anzenbacher of the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green University.  Professor Anzenbacher will focus his work on the development and characterization of self-assembled optical nanosensors for chemical sensing in multianalyte environments.  The research could have an important broader impact on the production of materials for sensing multiple anionic substrates such as inorganic anions, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals at very low concentrations\r\n\r\n",
