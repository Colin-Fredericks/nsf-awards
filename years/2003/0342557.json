A primary theme will be the integration of education and research and methods for improving these activities through mentoring and networking.  Workshop activities will be planned and directed by an organizing committee co-chaired by the PI, former chair of the CAREER Coordinating Committee (CCC) at NSF and by Theresa Maldonado, a former CCC member.  Three additional organizing committee members will be sought to broaden representation from other disciplines.  The grant will support about 60 participants consisting of CAREER awardees and invited speakers including university administrators.  Participation from underrepresented groups, HBCUs, HSIs, and tribal colleges will be encouraged.  Both plenary and breakout sessions will be included.  Workshop proceedings will be generated and disseminated through a website.  Assessment will be conducted through a series of surveys.  The PI has previously conducted two NSF workshops on the Advancement and Retention of Underrepresented and Minority Engineering Educators.  A successful outcome will be to identify obstacles to success and to provide recommendations for improving awareness of best practices, which will then be widely dissemination.\r\n",
