 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program of research is in the area of theoretical physics with an emphasis on\r\nmany-body problem in nuclear structure physics, fusion reactions below the Coulomb barrier,\r\nreactions involving heavy-ions, multifragmentation and phase transitions in nuclei, solar and\r\nsupernova neutrinos, nucleosynthesis and other neutrino astrophysics. Theoretical research in\r\nthese areas is chosen to have a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the\r\nUnited States and abroad.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Work: Successful completion of the proposed projects\r\nwill lead to i) A better understanding of nuclear equation of state for applications in nuclear\r\nreactions and nuclear astrophysics; ii) Understanding dependence of nuclear reactions on the\r\nisospin of the reacting partners through the recently developed techniques of isoscaling; iii) A\r\nbetter understanding of the neutrino masses and mixings; iv) Understanding neutrino propagation\r\nthrough dense media and in strong gravitational fields; v) A better understanding of various\r\naspects of core-collapse supernovae; vi) A better understanding of the origin of elements, especially\r\nthose produced in rapid neutron capture; vii) A better understanding of fusion in astrophysical\r\nenvironments, and viii) A better understanding of pairing and elaboration of its role in nuclear\r\nmany-body problem.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity: Proposed research contributes to the\r\nsupport of national priorities in nuclear science such as the proposed National Underground Science\r\nLaboratory and Rare Ion Accelerator. The proposed research involves collaboration between\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison and Michigan State University, University of California at San\r\nDiego, and University of Washington as well as international collaborations between University of\r\nWisconsin-Madison researchers and those from Brazil, China, France, Italy, Japan, and Turkey.\r\nThe principal investigators participate in multidisciplinary research activities that connect particle,\r\nnuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics. Both principal investigators are involved\r\nin exposing physics to broader audiences. Balantekin plans to continue playing a major role in\r\ndeveloping National Underground Science Laboratory. In addition to enhancing research and education\r\ninfrastructure of the Nation in underground science, this proposed laboratory will provide\r\noutreach to the visitors in general and regional Native American colleges in particular.",
