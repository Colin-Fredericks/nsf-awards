 "awd_abstract_narration": "Annular modes, an observed large-scale pattern of climate variability, have marked impacts on weather throughout large regions of the globe. They have potentially important implications for weather prediction, and they have contributed substantially to recent climate change. This research seeks to improve our understanding of these important patterns of variability. The research is delineated by three principal scientific objectives: 1) to better understand the processes whereby annular variability in the extra tropical circulation is coupled to the circulation of the tropics; 2) to better understand the processes whereby the annular modes orchestrate climate variability on hemispheric scales; and 3) to better understand the dynamic coupling between\r\n\r\nannular variability in the stratosphere and troposphere.  The PI will employ a suite of observations and a climate model to address these objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader  Impacts.\tThe educational outreach (through the PI's web site on annular modes) and societal benefits (through advances in weather and climate prediction) expected from this research are very good and of high potential realization for this project.\r\n",
