 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to develop a sensing methodology that enables highly reliable and accurate monitoring and diagnosis for manufacturing processes.  This proposed research is to use a system approach to study the design, fabrication, optimization, assessment, and applications of distributed micro sensors embedded in metal tooling that is fabricated by Rapid Tooling manufacturing processes.  A multidisciplinary research team seeks to advance fundamental knowledge in sensor technologies, including sensor design and fabrication for high-temperature strain and temperature measurements, the embedding of sensors into metal manufacturing tooling, and the interpretation and use of sensor data in decision-making for manufacturing process monitoring and control.  Three interrelated research tasks are planned.  Task 1 will focus on the design, fabrication, embedding, and optimization of distributed micro thermo-mechanical sensors in metal tooling.  Task 2 focuses on the research on a new process monitoring and diagnostics methodology that can quickly identify both sensor and process faults.  Task 3 will address issues related to the sensing system implementation and testing.  The validation and testing of the system will be conducted on an industrial testbed.  Wireless system implementation will also be explored.\r\n\r\nNew course development, existing course improvement, mentoring and outreach activities will attract and engage students as well as industry to smart tooling technologies.  Embedded sensing systems will provide measurement with high spatial and temporal resolution at critical process locations, thus enabling a much more reliable and accurate monitoring and diagnosis system.  The proposed embedded sensing system would also be extremely appealing in practice, striking to enhance the competitiveness of US Tooling industry as well as numerous manufacturing processes.",
