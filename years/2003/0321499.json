 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II (SBIR) project will develop and demonstrate a novel prototype solvent extraction (SX) device, which, by virtue of its highly uniform shear and mixing intensity, has the potential to supplant existing SX units in terms of extraction and phase separation rates. The technical approach of the Phase II project is as follows: 1.) Develop performance and scale-up principles for the SX device, optimize the hardware configuration and process conditions; 2.) Apply the results to the design of a reliable prototype SX system that demonstrates improved mass transfer and phase separation, and decreased entrainment at power consumption levels equivalent to existing equipment. The Phase I copper extraction work showed a 3-5 fold improvement in extraction and phase separation rates over existing mixer-settlers that are used in the minerals industry for the recovery of copper. \r\n\r\nThe commercial benefits of the ResonantSonic solvent extraction device to the minerals industry are reduced equipment size and footprint, reduced solvent loss, and improved electrowinning efficiency. Reducing the solvent loss to the environment has great societal benefit as losses can exceed 100,000 gallons per year per mine site. Other potential applications are metals separation, and the recovery of vitamins, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals\r\n",
