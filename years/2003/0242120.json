 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  The theoretical research deals with quantum coherence in a variety of physical systems.  As such, the research may find application in quantum information sciences.  In addition, some of the systems to be considered have novel properties at the nanoscale.  The systems under investigation include possible phase transitions in cold confined Fermi gases and magnetic properties of small metal grains.  Also to be studied are superconducting grains and films.  The focus of these studies will be the clarification of theoretical issues that are impeding progress at the interface between theory and experiment.  \r\n\r\nThe work will be done in collaboration with groups at Birmingham in England and Munich in Germany, in addition to Cornell.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award is made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).
