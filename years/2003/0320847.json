 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of Microwave and Wireless Communications Test and Measurement Laboratory\r\nWith this proposal we respectfully request the NSF approval for establishing a critically needed \"Microwave\r\nand Wireless Communications Test and Measurement Laboratory\" in the College of Engineering at the\r\nUniversity of Hawaii. In an attempt to diversify the tourism-based economy in the State of Hawaii, and help\r\nbetter prepare a qualified workforce that will attract high tech companies to the State, the State recently\r\nestablished the Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications (HCAC) with the mission to do multidisciplinary\r\nresearch in broadband wireless communications and promote much needed ties with industry. The center has\r\nestablished several initiatives along these guidelines, and the proposed laboratory facility will be used to support\r\nseveral of these ongoing and growing number of activities. Specifically, it will help the faculty effectively work\r\non our externally funded research projects, and also help attract industry-sponsored projects for the recently\r\nestablished Engineering Clinic Program for undergraduates. Examples of the ongoing research projects include:\r\n(a) development of low cost, high performance antenna arrays with beam steering capabilities; (b) propagation\r\nprediction modeling in urban wireless communications environments; (c) development of computational and\r\npower efficient iterative decoding techniques; (d) DSP algorithms for smart antennas, multiuser detection, and\r\ncooperative diversity; (e) retoradiative antenna arrays; and (f) RF and Quasi-Optical devices. Our faculty has\r\npublished hundreds of papers in these areas and the proposed lab facility will help extend its capabilities and set\r\nthe stage for its future multidisciplinary research directions. As for the Engineering Clinic program, it places\r\nteams (4-5 students per team) in projects proposed and sponsored by industry, and the College charges $25k per\r\nproject. All raised funds go directly to support student activities including project expenses, scholarships for all\r\nparticipating students, and travel expenses for the final design reviews at the locations of the sponsoring\r\ncompanies. In 2002-2003, the College was able to attract seven projects from in and out of state companies.\r\nHCAC has also been approved to participate as a partner in the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research\r\nCenter (I/U CRC) at Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, and the proposed lab facility will\r\ncertainly help support this as well as the growing number of graduate and undergraduate courses being offered\r\nin the wireless communications area. In addition, the proposed lab facility will help in the implementation of\r\nthe collaborative program between the College of Engineering and the College of Business Administration\r\naimed at preparing the next generation of entrepreneurs in communications technology.\r\nSpecific components of the proposed lab facility include: (a) a microwave network analysis lab (Agilent\r\nE8361A-Microwave Vector Network Analyzer and an Agilent E4448A spectrum analyzer); (b) an indoor\r\nantenna range (Agilent 8530A-Microwave receiver for antenna measurement); (c) a wireless communications\r\ntest-bed (Agilent E4438C signal generator, Agilent 89610A vector signal analyzer, Spirent TSA 5600W\r\nuniversal interference emulator, and Spirent FLEX5/Q1 RF Ch. Emulator); and (d) for the undergraduate lab an\r\nadditional two Agilent 8720 network analyzers (in addition to access to the equipment in the above listed\r\nresearch labs).\r\nIntellectual merits: With the phenomenal growth of wireless communications technology, and with the\r\nrecognized and long-standing distinguished expertise in the communications technology area at the University\r\nof Hawaii (first to propose the ALOHA protocol for packet radio systems that subsequently strongly influenced\r\nthe development of access Ethernet protocols), the proposed lab facility will help support several externally\r\nfunded (NSF, ARO, DARPA, AFOSR, Raytheon, and TRW) research projects, help promote integrative\r\nresearch and multidisciplinary efforts that will lead to significant advances in developing next generation\r\nwireless communications technology. This laboratory facility will also help attract industrial sponsors in\r\nprograms such as the Engineering Clinic for undergraduates, and support UH participation in the NSF I/U CRC\r\nprogram with other universities.\r\nBroader impact: With the recognition of this technology as one of the strategic high tech avenues for\r\ndiversifying the Hawaii economy and better preparing the local workforce to help attract companies and grow\r\nthe industrial base in the State, it is expected that the proposed lab will play a critical role in realizing the vision\r\nand achieving the mission of the recently established HCAC. It will also help attract industrial sponsors in\r\nprograms such as the Engineering Clinic for undergraduates, and provide test and measurement capabilities for\r\nlocal industry and start-ups. The impact of this NSF equipment investment will reach far beyond the University\r\nand would certainly impact the entire State of Hawaiipreparation of its workforce, growth in its high tech\r\nbase, and support for its local industry.",
