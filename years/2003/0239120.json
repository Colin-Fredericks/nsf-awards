 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kleiman will study poly-conjugated molecules and their photo-physical properties using both ultrafast experiments and quantum chemical calculations in order to understand novel properties that arise from the macromolecule as a whole.  This program involves collaborative work aimed at the synthesis of hyper-branched polymers, dendritic macromolecules and charged oligomers.  Ultrafast spectroscopy is used to examine energy transport in conjugated polymers whose electronic and optical properties can be chemically controlled at the molecular level.  Theoretical calculations will provide an understanding of the experimental data and allow the prediction of measurable properties and delineation of a fundamental model of energy-transport.  The PI will make an intensive effort to involve young women in an area of chemistry where they are vastly underrepresented.  This will be accomplished via conscientious recruiting, mentoring and encouragement of both undergraduate and graduate students.  Promotion and expansion of an exchange program with undergraduate students from Latin-American countries will also be pursued.  Community outreach activities in grades K-12 will showcase the essential role of female scientists in today's life.\r\n\r\nNew materials with novel photophysical properties are crucial for developing revolutionary molecular-photonic and optoelectronic components.  Conjugated polymers have emerged as materials exhibiting valuable properties in optical sensing, energy transport, and light harvesting.  This research program is highly interdisciplinary, dealing with synthetic organic, polymer, material-science, theoretical, and nonlinear-optical research.  The results of these investigations will provide an understanding of the electronic and photo-physical characteristics that lead to unique optical properties useful for optoelectronics, sensing and energy harvesting.\r\n",
