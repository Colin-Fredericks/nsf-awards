 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wavelets Based Response of Structural / Mechanical Systems to\r\nEvolutionary Earthquake & Wind, CMS proposal 0301201\r\n\r\nPI: Spanos, Rice University\r\n\r\nThe proposed program will use the wavelet transform in deriving the stochastic characteristics of the response of structural systems to non-stationary models related to seismic and wind excitations. The wavelet transform has been employed in a variety of applications. Its combined time-scale representation as\r\nwell as its localization properties have been used in the analysis of various systems. The present program focuses on the application of the wavelet transform to nonlinear structural system response due to non-stationary models of natural hazards, and its implementation to real systems. The time-scale localization properties of the wavelets will be utilized to capture the variation of the spectral characteristics of the non-stationary seismic and wind models across time, and to assess the time dependent dynamic behavior of structural systems. A time-dependent wavelet transfer tensor will be derived and a theoretical framework will be introduced to derive wavelet input/output relationships for linear multi-degree of freedom systems under non-stationary excitations. This will be pursued by using wavelet families with characteristics\r\nappropriate for the specific objective. New approaches will be introduced for structural system modeling in the time-scale domain by employing the wavelet transform. The findings will be applied to parameter identification, diagnostic procedures and reliability studies. Structural systems under seismic and wind loads will be examined. The work will be extended to diagnosis and monitoring procedures of such systems. \r\n\r\nThe research program will be pursued in conjunction with a concerted effort of maximizing the broader impact of the proposed work by continuing to provide mentorship to students from underrepresented groups, to engage undergraduate students in research, and to interact with teachers of K-12 grades.\r\n",
