A  promising new transistor structure (the back-gated thin-film MESFET)  will be developed, one that is more scalable and much simpler to  manufacture than the conventional MOSFET structure employed in integrated-circuit (IC) devices today.  The MESFET will provide for  tremendous gains in functional density, not only by transistor scaling  but also by three-dimensional integration (stacking multiple layers of  transistors in an IC) for maximum circuit layout efficiency and system  performance.  This work will enable improvements in performance and cost  to continue for at least 20 more years, supporting the growth of the  semiconductor industry over this time period.  It will also serve to  bridge the technological gap between CMOS devices (scaling limit ~10 nm)  and molecular/nanotube devices (~1 nm minimum dimensions), while easing the manufacturing challenges of nanometer-scale fabrication.  Given the  key role of information technology and emerging role of nanotechnology  in modern society, this project will have very broad impact.  Graduate  and undergraduate students will directly benefit from it via hands-on  research and course lectures, and new knowledge will be disseminated  widely via presentations at international workshops and conferences, as \r\nwell as in archival journals. \r\n",
