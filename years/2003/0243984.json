 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site will allow ten talented undergraduate students to enroll in an intensive six-week summer program at Northwestern University.  The Site focuses on Culture, Language, and Cognition and will utilize a multidisciplinary approach.  Student research projects will explore such topics as culture, language, cognition, categorization, reasoning, learning, and social behavior.\r\n\r\nActivities in the program will include a lecture series, research conducted closely with a faculty mentor, and a conference at the end of the program in which students will present their research.  The objectives of the program include educating students to think about culture from a multidisciplinary perspective as well as familiarizing them with some of the broader conceptual and methodological tools required in the social sciences.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program and contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
