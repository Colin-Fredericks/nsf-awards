 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nOver the past quarter-century and more, social choice experiments have \r\nstudied how people choose between what can be earned by each acting in pure \r\nself-interest as against what would be jointly earned if all could commit \r\nthemselves to act in their common interest.  This  proposal grows out of a \r\npilot project that produced striking early results from fresh analysis of \r\narchived data from several prominent sets of experiments, using an \r\nunconventional extension of standard rational actor theory to allow for \r\nsocial motivation (\"nsnx\"), and giving close attention to what has been \r\nlearned in recent decades about the cognitive cuing of \r\nchoices.  Coincidentally (since the proposal was submitted) the Nobel prize \r\nfor Economics this year has been shared between Vernon Smith, who has \r\npioneered in the use of rational choice theory in experimental work and \r\nDaniel Kahneman who (with Amos Tversky) pioneered in the application of \r\ncognitive concerns to economics.  The project builds on that work.\r\n\r\nResults of several strong tests for \"nsnx\" effects have shown effects of \r\nsize and robustness beyond what has often been seen in the social \r\nsciences.   A downloadable \"template\" allows other researchers to run the \r\ntests on data of their own choice.  The work aims at gaining insight from \r\ncontrolled experimental conditions that can be applied to socially urgent \r\nproblems (from voluntarism at home to terrorism and ethnic conflict aboard) \r\nthat turn heavily on the ability of groups to sustain or disrupt \r\ncooperation under conditions where binding agreements and third-party \r\nenforcement are difficult.  This is arguably the most fundamental issue \r\nof the social sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
