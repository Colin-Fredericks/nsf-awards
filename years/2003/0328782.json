This project seeks to find principled solutions to these problems through systematic investigation of a number of fundamental issues related to contact states and compliant motion involving general objects, which include objects with curved surfaces, articulated objects, and certain deformable objects. As an integrated part or derivative of such basic investigation, the project will further study: physically accurate haptic display of contact states in virtual environments, and general compliant motion planning and execution in real world, as well as their related applications.\r\n \r\nThe general problems addressed in this project (as introduced above) are crucial to advancing the state of the art in several related areas and their many applications, including robotics, haptics, and dynamic simulation, and yet there has been little principled and systematic research towards these problems. The PI has studied aspects of the problems restricted to contacts between only polyhedral rigid bodies. Hence, the project represents a very significant, multi-dimensional extension with new and substantial challenges, but not without the considerable foundation built upon the PI's related previous work. \r\n\r\nThe project research activities, aside from its expected contributions to both basic research and a wide range of related applications, will also have a significant impact on student education and research training. The interdisciplinary breadth of the research activities spans many areas in robotics and control, AI and intelligent systems, computational geometry, geometrical and physical modeling and simulation, haptics, computer graphics and virtual environments, as well as human-machine interaction and virtual collaboration. The project is also comprehensive with both theoretical and algorithmic components and experimental and system integration components. It will thus provide a rich and balanced environment that can accommodate students from all levels (from Ph.D. to undergraduate) to obtain knowledge and research training in the various related areas. \r\n\r\nThe research project will also provide an excellent opportunity for (a) cross-discipline research collaboration between the PI and her colleagues at the newly established College of Information Technology (COIT) at UNC Charlotte, and (b) close international collaboration between the PI's group and a leading research group on compliant motion control in Europe. Such collaborations will be instrumental to enhancing research capabilities as well as research infrastructure at the new COIT. The project will clearly enrich student education and contribute significantly to the special goal of COIT of providing students an interdisciplinary learning and research experience in the broad spectrum of Information Technology.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
