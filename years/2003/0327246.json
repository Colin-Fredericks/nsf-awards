 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of Dr. J. Mark Kenoyer, Randall Law will analyze a wide range of raw materials from the ancient site of Harappa, Pakistan in order to reconstruct the avenues of inter-regional exchange and resource access that existed in the Indus Valley during the late 4th to early 2nd millennium B.C. This time period is important because it encompasses the emergence, existence, and decline of South Asia's first state-level society, the Indus Civilization, a contemporary of early states in Mesopotamia and Egypt.  This study being accomplished through a systematic, broad-scale provenience examination of Harappa's raw rock and mineral commodity assemblage.  Unlike past examinations of prehistoric South Asian lithic exchange networks, this study uses up-to-date geologic reference material, modern mineralogical identification techniques, and geochemical provenience analyses of archaeological materials to generate a new, more accurate model of inter-regional interaction.  \r\n\r\nHarappa was a center of numerous lithic craft activities and excavations by the Harappa Archaeological Research Project since 1986 have collected abundant and highly varied amounts of rock and mineral debris. In addition, for comparative purposes, geologic samples have been collected from potential source areas surrounding the Indus Valley in Pakistan and India. Geochemical provenience studies of selected archaeological and modern materials have indicated that an expanded program of analysis will provide the types of information needed to produce a map of possible sources and the trade routes used during the prehistoric period in this region of South Asia.\r\n\r\nSupport from the National Science Foundation will be used to collect and analyze additional geologic samples from India and Pakistan in order to create a database for these materials that is more regionally comprehensive and statistically significant.  Funding will also support the analysis of archaeological samples from all chronological periods and occupational areas of Harappa so that a full diachronic picture of material acquisition and distribution at the site can be generated.  Past studies of trade networks, craft production and subsistence exploitation suggest that changes in those activities accompanied the process of urban development at Harappa. This study will result in a new framework for examining the political and economic strategies of the group or groups that ruled the city of Harappa.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts derive from the new scientific perspective on regional and local processes relating to inter-regional interaction and urban development in prehistoric South Asia. The geochemical characterization database will be of great benefit in future provenience studies at other South Asian sites and during other periods. The resulting data and interpretive models of inter-regional exchange and resource access can be used for cross-cultural comparisons by scholars in the larger field of early state studies and are relevant to the current geo-political interactions in this region of the world. The PI and Co-PI have been involved in significant outreach with scholars and graduate students in both Pakistan and India. This outreach has included presenting collaborative papers at conferences, training students in sample collection and processing as well as providing offprints and research results to local institutions and libraries. \r\n\r\n",
