Both students and teachers will be recruited nationally. Each summer 18 undergraduate participants will be placed at one of the four NRAO sites (Socorro, New Mexico; Green Bank, West Virginia; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Tucson, Arizona) for a period of 10 to 12 weeks.  Four teacher participants will be placed in either Socorro or Green Bank for a period of eight weeks. During their appointment, the participants will work with staff advisers on a project in the staff adviser's area of expertise. Students and teachers alike will take part in a summer lecture series introducing them to the fundamentals of radio astronomy and to current topics in astronomical research. Teachers will also take part in teacher workshops and participate in weekly educational sessions to develop classroom activities which make use of their research experience at the NRAO. At the conclusion of their appointment, participants will produce both an oral and written report of their work, and will have the opportunity to present their results at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. During the following school term, teachers will field-test their curricula and send revisions to NRAO staff so that they can be disseminated to past and future RET participants and teachers in other venues.\r\n",
