 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary: Energy-aware Synthesis of Embedded Systems on\r\nMultiprocessor Platforms \r\n\r\nSanjoy Baruah James H. Anderson\r\n\r\nTwo evident trends in the real-time embedded systems domain are (i)\r\nthe proliferation of multiprocessor platforms, and (ii) the\r\nproliferation of applications for which energy consumption must be\r\nminimized.  In the years ahead, it is reasonable to expect these two\r\ntrends to converge: indeed, one major advantage of multiprocessor\r\nimplementations over uniprocessor ones is that the former tend to be\r\nmore energy-efficient.  To date, however, the little work that has\r\nbeen done on energy-aware multiprocessor designs has been limited to\r\nrelatively simple table-driven scheduling schemes; a precise\r\ncharacterization of the energy savings realized by moving to a\r\nmultiprocessor implementation is not known.\r\n\r\nThese observations point to a significant need for research to be\r\nconducted on the tradeoffs that exist when designing energy-aware\r\nmultiprocessor systems.  This project proposes to fill this need by\r\ndeveloping and experimentally evaluating design methodologies and\r\nscheduling algorithms that facilitate the synthesis of embedded\r\nreal-time systems upon multiprocessor platforms, with the primary goal\r\nof minimizing energy consumption.\r\n\r\nBroader impact.  Based partially on the results of this project, two\r\nnew courses will be developed: an introductory graduate course on\r\nembedded systems, and a graduate seminar on multiprocessor embedded\r\ndesigns.  The introductory embedded-systems course will be created as\r\na follow-on to current real-time systems and advanced operating\r\nsystems courses.  The seminar course on multiprocessor designs will be\r\na follow-on to the introductory course.  A concerted effort will be\r\nmade to involve underrepresented groups in our research.  Results from\r\nthe algorithmic research will be disseminated through publications.\r\nAny software of general utility that results from this project will be\r\nmade publically available on the web.\r\n",
