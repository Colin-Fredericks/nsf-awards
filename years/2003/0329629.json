 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nShin abstract\r\n\r\nSmall low-cost sensor devices, each equipped with limited resources,\r\nare networked and used for various critical applications.\r\nThe nature of these applications may require the underlying sensor\r\nnetwork to be secure even though it is usually deployed in\r\na harsh, sometimes hostile, and unsupervised environment,\r\nand hence, is subject to capture, reverse-engineering\r\nand manipulation.\r\nExisting tamper resistance techniques are either hardware-based or intended for\r\nenvironments with sufficient computation and communication\r\nresources, but they cannot be used for low-cost (thus resource-limited)\r\nsensor devices. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the development and evaluation of\r\na Program-Integrity Verification (PIV) protocol that intermittently \r\nverifies integrity of the program code of a sensor device, e.g., whenever\r\nit joins a network or has experienced a long service blockage.\r\nThe PIV protocol augments sensor devices to make them\r\nusable for applications that require high-level security.\r\nPIV uses a randomized hash function,\r\nby which the algorithm for hash computation on the program code\r\ncan be randomly generated whenever the code needs to be verified.\r\nBy applying this algorithm, the PIV protocol will offer protection\r\nagainst manipulation/reverse-engineering/reprogramming of sensors;\r\nprovide software-based protection without requiring tamper-resistant hardware;\r\nexploit infrequent triggering of verification, thereby not\r\nstressing or interfering with normal sensor functions; \r\nand assure cryptographic security.  The project consists of the following four\r\nclosely-related tasks, Program-Integrity Verification, Key Management, \r\nAdaptive Intrusion Detection, and Experimentation and Validation.\r\nThe goal of the project is the fundamental\r\nadvancement of software-based tamper-resistance techniques.\r\nBroader impact is epxected in emerging\r\nsensor networks that will play key roles in safety-critical\r\nand homeland security applications such as surveillance\r\nof the physical infrastructure, including buildings and bridges,\r\ntransportation systems, water supply systems, and power generation\r\nand distribution systems.\r\n",
