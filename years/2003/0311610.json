 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This project addresses the need for the integration of content knowledge and pedagogy in science teaching methods courses.  The project adapts elements from two successful NSF CCLI projects.  These are the Westminster College, Utah \"Great Salt Lake Project\" (http://www.westminstercollege.edu/education_gslp/) and the University of Arizona \"Integrated, Thematic Approach to Biology Methods for Teacher Training,\" (https://www.ehr.nsf.gov/pirs_prs_web/search/RetrieveRecord.asp?Awd_Id=0088855 ) both of which use their local ecosystem as a focal point for developing inquiry-based lessons.  The current project is adapting these model projects to the local needs of both the university and the K-12 schools by integrating discipline-based content knowledge, experimental methods, and pedagogical methods within a \"Biology Teaching Methods\" course.  In this way they provide a rich experience for teachers-in-training that allows them to implement inquiry-based lessons during their student teaching internships. Students, primarily secondary education biology majors, are guided through the process of developing inquiry-based experimental modules focused on the regional ecosystem.  They then gain practical experience teaching these inquiry-based lessons in the classroom as part of their K-12 internships. The project also enables students to implement experimental biology lessons in K-12 schools through an equipment-lending center that supplements the resources of the rural K-12 schools in which they are student teachers. The project benefits university students and their current/future pupils, thereby offering a significant and long-lasting impact.\r\n\r\n",
