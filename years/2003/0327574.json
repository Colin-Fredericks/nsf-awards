 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to establish a summer school aimed at quantifying \r\nuncertainty in earth modes obtained from seismic imaging. The \r\nresolution in imaging techniques in global seismology has increased \r\ndramatically in recent years due to the explosive growth in the \r\namount of digital data and computational facilities.  However, the \r\naccuracy of the spectacular images of 3D Earth structure that are \r\nbeing produced is usually poorly known.  The deployment of the \r\nUSArray component of Earthscope will dramatically increase the \r\ncoverage of the continental US with digital seismic stations, \r\nresulting in unprecedented quantities of data.  The full potential of \r\nthis data set can only be realized when the uncertainty in the \r\nconstructed earth models can be quantified adequately.\r\n\r\nThis school focuses on the quantification of uncertainty in seismic\r\nimaging in the geosciences.  Since this problem requires the input from\r\nseismologists and mathematicians, the school is aimed at equal\r\nparticipation from both groups. The material that will be covered\r\nincludes tutorial material as well as recent research. The presented\r\nmaterial will be presented in the form tutorial lectures, lectures on\r\nrecent research, computer exercises and problem sets, group meetings\r\nwith a a mentor, poster presentations, and field trips. The school\r\nwill be held at the campus of the Colorado School of Mines in the\r\nsummer of 2004. The duration of the school is two weeks.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The topic of the school addresses an issue\r\nthat is of paramount importance in the geosciences. The connection\r\nbetween the constructed 3D Earth models and decision making can be\r\ncalled poorly-developed at best. Addressing these questions requires a\r\njoint effort of mathematicians and geoscientists.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The quantification of uncertainty in 3D models in the\r\nearth sciences is of relevance for the exploration and production of\r\nhydrocarbons, a better understanding of geo-dynamics with implication\r\nfor natural hazards, as well as to non-seismological aspects of the\r\ngeosciences that include ground water management, the detection and\r\nspreading of pollutants, the detection of un-exploded ordnance, and\r\nmonitoring nuclear treaties. The quantification of uncertainty in\r\nseismology is essential for the analysis and interpretation of the\r\nUS-Array data that will be collected as part of Earthscope.\r\n\r\n",
