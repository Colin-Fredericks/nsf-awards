 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is intended to increase understanding of gravitational physics both at large distance scales and at very small distance scales.  In particular, the following aspects of gravitational theory are studied; Dynamical behavior and gravitational radiation from binary systems such as black holes and neutron stars; Theory of classical and quantum graviational fields with Symmetry; Mathematical structure and dynamical behavior of cosmological models; Conservation laws for gravitational theories.\r\n\r\nA number of open questions of mathematical and physical interest are addressed, which are related to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and its extensions.  Through this work, understanding of gravitational physics and quantum physics as well as the interaction of these two cornerstones of contemporary physical theory is enhanced; theoretical support to the emerging field of gravitational astronomy is provided, and the state of the art in various areas of applied mathmatics is advanced.  Finally, the education and training of prospective students in mathematics and theoretical physics is facilitated by activities associated with this research.",
