 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical turbulence may be modeled by a hierarchy of \r\npartial differential equations including both \r\nwaves and turbulence.  In each model, the vortical, non-wave motions\r\ncorrespond to observed, long-lived structures such as the jet stream\r\nof the tropopause, the persistent horizontal layers of the stratosphere, \r\nand hurricanes.  Despite decoupling of vortical modes and waves at \r\nfirst order in weak turbulence expansions, numerical simulations \r\nhave demonstrated the generation of the anisotropic, vortical modes \r\nfrom fast waves.  These simulations suggest major modifications to\r\ncurrent models designed to capture only the large-scale dynamics.\r\nFor example, they show the dominance of vertically\r\nsheared, horizontal flow modes in strongly stratified flows, \r\npresently not included in large-scale models.  Our work\r\nfocuses on (1) stability analyses to understand the \r\nmechanisms responsible for the formation of slow, large-scale coherent \r\nmotions from fast, small-scale turbulence, and (2) the\r\ndevelopment of improved ordinary and partial differential equations\r\ndescribing the slowly varying, large-scale dynamics, reflecting\r\nthe physics observed in the numerical simulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost current models of turbulence are based on isotropic theory, and\r\nassume that small-scale turbulence acts as a sink of energy for\r\nlarger-scale flows.  Such turbulence models are used in\r\nnumerical prediction, for example, of weather and climate change.\r\nHowever, turbulence in nature and in engineering flows is anisotropic\r\nmore often than not, for example, due to the presence of\r\nboundaries.  In this study, we focus on anisotropy induced by\r\nstrong rotation and stratification, both of which give\r\nrise to wave motions.  In anisotropic wave-turbulence systems, \r\nturbulence may act as a source of energy for larger-scale flows.\r\nFurthermore, coherent structures often\r\nemerge spontaneously from small-scale, random fluctuations.\r\nOne example in nature is the generation of hurricanes\r\nfrom smaller-scale motions in the atmosphere.    This study\r\naims to understand large-scale, coherent-structure generation\r\nfrom small-scale turbulence in the atmosphere and oceans.  In\r\naddition, new models will be developed to capture these physical\r\nphenomena, absent in current models.  The results should impact \r\nour ability to predict long-term variability in ocean-circulation,\r\nweather and climate.\r\n",
