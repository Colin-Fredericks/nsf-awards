The organizing committee consists of Robert Langlands, Pierre Deligne and Mark\r\nGoresky.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed conference are (1) to bring together scholars from a\r\nvariety of disciplines with a common interest in geometric techniques and (2) to describe\r\nsome of the recent achievements of younger mathematicians in MacPherson's school. It is\r\nexpected that the audience will consist of mathematicians from many different fields, and\r\nthe speakers have been requested to deliver survey talks designed to be accessible to such\r\na wide and varied audience. A substantial portion of the funding for this confernce will be directed\r\ntowards the support of graduate students and postdoctoral mathematicians. The lectures\r\nare expected to be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The\r\nparticipation of women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities will be\r\nencouraged.\r\n",
