 "awd_abstract_narration": "Henson, Hayward\r\n     Understanding and predicting fluctuations in numbers of\r\norganisms in time and space is a fundamental issue in ecology.\r\nThe ability to accurately forecast the state of ecosystems with\r\nmathematical models would enable, for example, rigorous\r\nhypothesis testing, prediction of threshold phenomena, and\r\ninvestigation of system response to disturbance.  As in physics,\r\nthe primary challenges include the identification of scales at\r\nwhich asynchronous individual-level activities form patterns,\r\nmechanisms behind pattern formation, and appropriate methods of\r\ndata collection.  During the last few decades, enormous progress\r\nhas been made in ecology through the integration of mathematics,\r\nstatistics, and laboratory experiments.  The hypothesis that\r\nfluctuations in animal abundance are explainable largely by\r\nsimple rules has been rigorously and successfully tested in\r\ncontrolled laboratory studies.  Robust qualitative and\r\nquantitative prediction has become possible for several\r\nlaboratory systems, but this success has not been duplicated in\r\nthe field.  The investigators wish to extend this success to the\r\nfield.  The existence of a predictive mathematical model for a\r\nfield system, and a successful test of nonlinear dynamics theory\r\nin the field, would constitute a major advance in ecology.  In\r\npreliminary work the investigators used the techniques of\r\ndynamical systems theory to explain and predict the dynamics of\r\npatch occupancy by seabirds at three temporal scales.  Based on\r\nthis success, they now 1) develop an accurate mathematical\r\npredictive model of the spatial distribution dynamics of seabirds\r\nin a heterogeneous system of habitat patches, 2) rigorously test\r\nnonlinear dynamics theory in the field, and 3) reduce the schism\r\nbetween mathematics and biology by developing a paradigm of tight\r\ninterdisciplinary vertical integration.  Integration of activities\r\nis three-tiered, including interdisciplinary research,\r\nsubstantial undergraduate participation, and development of a\r\nquantitative literacy program for undergraduates.  Collaboration\r\nof undergraduates in a research team with the investigators is\r\nexpected to lead to publication and presentations by the\r\nstudents.  Courses in both mathematics and biology train students\r\nin basic mathematical techniques applicable to biology.\r\n     The ability to predict how many plants or animals will\r\noccupy a certain habitat at a given time could help solve many\r\npressing world problems related to the spread of disease, food\r\nproduction, biological control, environmental protection, species\r\nconservation, interference between national defense activities\r\nand wildlife, and human population growth.  Mathematical equations\r\nhave been used to accurately predict numbers of organisms in the\r\nlaboratory, but such successes have not been extended to\r\npopulations outside the laboratory.  In preliminary work, the\r\nresearchers devised a mathematical equation that accurately\r\npredicts fluctuations in the number of seabirds occupying a\r\nspecific habitat on Protection Island National Wildlife Refuge,\r\nWashington.  Given the day of the year, the height of the tide,\r\nand the solar elevation for some specific time in the future, the\r\nequation predicts the number of seabirds that will occupy the\r\nhabitat at that time.  The ability of the equation to predict\r\nseveral months into the future was tested and validated.  The\r\nresearchers expand this technique to predict fluctuations within\r\nan entire network of connected habitats.  The birds are not\r\ndisturbed in any way; they are counted through a scope from a\r\n33-m-high observation point on a bluff more than 100 m west of\r\nthe seabird colony.  The research involves 1) collaboration\r\nbetween mathematicians and biologists, 2) extensive research\r\nparticipation by undergraduate students, and 3) development of a\r\nbiomathematics literacy program for both mathematics and biology\r\nundergraduate students.\r\n",
