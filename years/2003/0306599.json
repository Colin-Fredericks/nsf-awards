 "awd_abstract_narration": "We describe three problems in this proposal, all in the general \r\narea of knot theory and 3-manifolds.  A Heegaard splitting of a \r\n3-manifold is a decomposition of the 3-manifold into simple pieces, \r\ncalled handlebodies.   This decomposition is an effective way to \r\nstudy many of the interesting open questions about 3-manifolds, but \r\nthere are some startling gaps in our basic information about Heegaard \r\nsplittings.   We know that given two Heegaard splittings of the same \r\n3-manifold, one can move from one to the other by a series of moves. \r\nThe first problem in this proposal asks how \"far apart\" two different \r\nHeegaard splittings of a 3-manifold can be under these moves.    The \r\nsecond problem is to explore a particular aspect of the Poincare \r\nConjecture prompted by Dunwoody's recent attempt and suggested by \r\nearlier work of Freedman and Yau.   We will look carefully at whether \r\na plan analogous to what Dunwoody proposed can be made to work on a \r\nreal 3-ball, beginning with an even simpler version of the question \r\non a triangulated 2-sphere.     The final problem is a generalization \r\nof recent work of the proposer on immersed curves in the plane to \r\nimmersed 2-spheres in 3-space.  We will look at the set of \r\nsingularities  (including, for example, curves of self-intersection \r\nand points of zero curvature) and try to derive relationship between \r\nnumbers and types of singularities, similar to the kinds of results \r\nknown for immersed curves in the plane or in projective 2-space.   We \r\nalso describe how these and other related problems have been used by \r\nthe proposer to stimulate interest in the field and in mathematics in \r\ngeneral at levels ranging from high school students,  including \r\nundergraduates and graduate students, through postdocs.\r\n\r\nLow-dimensional topology is the study of properties of spaces in \r\ndimensions two, three, and four.  It is a field that used to lie \r\nsquarely in the realm of \"pure\" mathematics, and research in the \r\nfield was pursued largely for its intricacy and beauty.  As we \r\ncontinue to understand the universe, from the shape of space itself \r\nto the knotting of strands of DNA, the deep connections between this \r\nabstract area and the real world are increasingly apparent. This \r\nproposal aims to explore some of the fundamental questions in \r\n3-dimensional spaces and knot theory, including understanding the \r\nrelationships between different decompositions of 3-dimensional \r\nspaces and quantifying the complexity of 2-dimensional spheres \r\nimmersed in a standard 3-dimensional universe.\r\n",
