 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project uses robots in an undergraduate liberal arts computer science curriculum to enhance two courses: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Advanced Topics. Work done by other educators on using robots in the Artificial Intelligence course are adapted and extended in two ways: 1) learning objective for the use of robots is based on high-level knowledge-based AI algorithms rather than low-level reactive algorithms, and the impact of robot construction on liberal arts students is minimized; and 2) robots are incorporated into the existing AI course rather than by creating a separate course on robotics. This minimizes the impact of using robots on faculty resources at smaller liberal arts Computer Science departments. Finally, robots are used for open-lab projects thereby minimizing the impact of using robots on the credit requirements for the major, while at the same time, providing students with a greater opportunity to be creative in their solutions. This project adapts the work done earlier in incorporating robots into the AI curriculum at St. Bonaventure University, Bryn Mawr College, and Swarthmore College.",
