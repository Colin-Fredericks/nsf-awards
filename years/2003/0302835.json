 "awd_abstract_narration": "A consortium of American Indian tribal colleges is creating an Information Science and Technology Learning Community (ISTLC). The ISTLC provides a range of education, training, and information-sharing services to the faculty, students, and professional IT staff at the participating institutions.  The activities of the ISTLC are:\r\n(1)\tStrengthening the information science and technology and STEM programs at each participating college;\r\n(2)\tEstablishing and maintaining a single community of information science practice and learning that includes faculty, students and IT staff at all consortium members;\r\n(3)\tDeveloping and disseminating successful practices, materials and technologies throughout the community of tribal colleges;\r\n(4)\tCreating linkages with industry, information/computer science departments at regional universities.\r\nThe ISTLC provides a national model, making resource-challenged programs stronger through collaborative program development and delivery. It provides an effective approach for building coalitions that bring together key stakeholder groups as members of a single learning organization.  The project is a pilot that can be expanded not only to all 32 Tribal Colleges, but also other community colleges around the nation, in particular those located in rural areas.\r\n",
