The acquisition of the TriboScope Nanomechanical Test System will enable us to\r\naddress some of the open issues in the field of nanoscale structural components. Two of\r\nthe open problems include (a) the inconsistent production and fabrication techniques which\r\nlead to varied results for the same nanosystem, (b) the procurement of reliable and\r\nfundamental data banks of durability and material properties, and c) the computational\r\nmodeling of nanostructured materials which utilize realistic material properties. The\r\ntypes of experiments that will be performed on this test system will allow for us to\r\ndirectly address issues (b) and (c). The tests that will be performed include Modulus,\r\nhardness, fracture toughness measurements, and the generation of force vs. displacement\r\ncurves. Nanostructures represent a new field of science that can extend the size, efficiency and\r\ndesign of well-known materials. As this field has progressed, more elaborate structures\r\nhave been generated that require a better understanding and more consistent methodology\r\nfor obtaining reliable material properties.\r\nWith the nation's most successful Dual-Degree Engineering program for African-American\r\nmales, Morehouse College is well positioned to have a significant impact on the production\r\nof engineers of African American lineage by increasing the number and the retention of\r\nstudents in the engineering and applied physics programs. This equipment will not only serve\r\nundergraduates at Morehouse College, but will also serve neighboring undergraduate liberal\r\narts colleges in the AUC. Colleges in the consortium directly impacted by the procurement\r\nof this equipment include Clark Atlanta University, Morris Brown College, and Spelman\r\nCollege, a private liberal arts Historically Black College for African-American females.\r\nStudents from these colleges are not only allowed to cross-register and take classes at\r\nthe neighboring schools, but may also complete research projects. Therefore, the research\r\nopportunities at Morehouse will also have a direct impact on the students at Clark\r\nAtlanta, Morris Brown and Spelman College.\r\n",
