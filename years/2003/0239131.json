 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliable interactive power networks (IPN), with applications ranging from FACTS and distributed power generation to naval ships and telecommunications, constitute one of the pillars of foundation of our socio-economic progress and security. IPN are characterized by hybrid dynamics, nonlinearities, multi-dimensionalities, and multiple time scales. Conventional approaches to modeling, analysis, and control of IPN using smooth averaged models are not always adequate and in many cases yield inaccurate results.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses these inadequacies and has four objectives: (a) develop a theoretical underpinning of IPN to realize a unified hybrid-modeling framework (UHMF); (b) nonlinear analyses of IPN using the UHMF to predict instabilities (leading to failures) due to complex inter- and intra-network interactions, hybrid dynamics, parametric variations, and disturbance propagations; (c) develop robust hybrid controllers (beyond the realm of traditional feedback control) in an optimal and anticipatory framework to stabilize the dynamics of the IPN in the presence of destabilizing influences and identify impending and incipient failures by establishing thresholds for instabilities; and (d) develop efficient and robust algorithms to analyze the dynamics of IPN, validate the predictions of nonlinear analyses and the effectiveness of control using existing off- and on-line simulations on virtual test beds, ultimately leading to experimental verifications on a scaled prototype. \r\n\r\nOn a broader note, the proposed work will promote integration of research and education, dissemination of knowledge for enhanced technical and scientific understanding, focused industry-university collaborations, cross-disciplinary growth, student and faculty involvement at local and national levels, and participation of students from under-represented and minority groups.\r\n",
