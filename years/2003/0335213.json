 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposal is to partially support travel of graduate students who will be attending the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). The conference will be held in Hawaii, in December 2003.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity:  The Conference is the major international meeting sponsored by IEEE, SIAM, and INFORMS.  The conference covers a wide range of topics relevant to theory and practice of systems and control.  Topics include robotics, manufacturing, power systems, process control, measurement and sensing, identification, estimation, fault detection, and intelligent control.  \r\n\r\nBroad Impact of the proposed activity: A number of full time graduate students  presenting papers at CDC will be partially supported.  Travel support for students will be advertised nationwide and women, under-represented minorities, and disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship.  The technical content of the Conference has traditionally been of the highest quality drawing leading scientific researchers from all over the world.  The conference includes invited and contributed technical papers, tutorial sessions, and industrial and publisher exhibits.\r\n",
