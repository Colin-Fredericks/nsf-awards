Students at colleges, universities, and community colleges will be recruited nationwide through a process involving efforts to reach students who would otherwise not have access to a research experience.  The program incorporates activities that will involve participants in the following research directions of the institute: global communications systems, sensor-actuator networks, next-generation product realization systems, societal infrastructure systems, and cross-disciplinary systems education. Through the program students will be able to (1) establish a basis for systems thinking by conducting research and thus understand systems engineering as a discipline; (2) acquire broader and deeper understanding of both the research process and the practice of engineering and how new knowledge is created and communicated; (3) develop multicultural understanding and team competence and become aware of the societal implications of research; and (5) successfully seek admission in a four-year program and/or graduate school.\r\n",
