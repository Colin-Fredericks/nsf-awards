 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked Sensing, Decision, and Actuation\r\n\r\nThe interconnection of sensors, actuators, and controllers \r\nenables local and remote supervision of physical environments.\r\nA fundamental difference between the traditional and the networked control \r\nproblem is that the network introduces unreliable and time-dependent levels\r\nof service (delays, jitter, losses).\r\nIn turn, network vagaries can jeopardize the stability, safety, and \r\nperformance of the controlled units.\r\nThe primary objective of this research is to devise integrated\r\ncontrol and communication algorithms to compensate for the\r\nvagaries of network service.\r\n\r\nSuch control and communication strategies are targeted toward the\r\napplication-layer and their objective is to deal with\r\npacket losses, delays, jitter, and network unreliability.\r\nThis objective necessitates an integrated approach that combines networking \r\n(e.g., network measurement, modeling, and simulation; reliability) with \r\ndecisions based on sensor data (e.g., feedback control).\r\nAlthough strategies have to be adapted to the specific application areas,\r\nthe research addresses a general methodology by drawing from the foundations\r\nof Systems Theory and of Networking.\r\nControl algorithms and communication protocols are evaluated according to a \r\nmethodology that combines analytical characterization, co-simulation, and \r\nprototype construction and validation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research includes teaching, course \r\nand curriculum development, graduate advising, and undergraduate research \r\nexperiences. \r\nAn objective of this work is to expand the presence of groups that are \r\nunder-represented in Engineering and Computer Science.\r\nThe investigators have on-going relationships with industry.\r\nThe results of this research are published and freely disseminated.\r\n",
