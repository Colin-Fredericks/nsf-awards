Bishop  (University of South Africa).  The investigators will collaborate on research for the simulation of binary systems containing: [a] black hole and a star and [b] a supermassive black hole and a star . The USA side will contribute with its expertise on the needed simulations and computational facilities while the South African side its expertise on algebraic manipulation. Additionally, both sides have vast knowledge on the formalism and numerical techniques that will be employed in the project. The goal will be to predict the expected gravitational wave emission produced by these systems. \r\nThese two target systems are prime candidates to produce radiation, of gravitational origin, which highly sensitive detectors could measure (earth-based detectors in system [a], while spaced-based detectors for [b]). The prediction of the expected gravitational waves will be important for their detection and crucial for deciphering the information carried by them. \r\nFurthermore, the activities of this project will give new research opportunities to young researchers in both countries (and in particular to two junior investigators in South Africa at historically disadvantaged institutions). The project will introduce a new generation of scientists to multidisciplinary and collaborative research and enhance the participation of the South African partners in leading edge research in gravitational wave physics. \r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and by the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program, Division of Astronomical Sciences, Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
