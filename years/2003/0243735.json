 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an REU Program focused on \"Cellular Adaptation to Environmental Challenge\".  Cellular systems are perturbed by a wide variety of stimuli including changes in nutrient availability, signals for cellular differentiation as well as interactions with pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.  Faculty mentors conduct research projects in all of these areas using concepts and techniques from the disciplines of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, virology and immunology.  Participants will be able to address questions of great scientific interest as well as have an opportunity to use state-of-the-art technology.  The 10-week program will fund 10 students with a $3,500 stipend as well as a travel and housing allowance.  In addition to performing research in the laboratory of a research mentor, program students will meet regularly to share and discuss research findings.  They will also participate in seminars on a wide variety of research topics and receive career mentoring, training in basic laboratory safety and in the ethical practice of research.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of the Program are: \r\n1)\tTo provide a research experience that increases the students' understanding of the area studied and the practice of scientific research\r\n2)\tTo inform students about the ethical practice of scientific research\r\n3)\tTo prepare undergraduate students to pursue graduate education in biological research\r\n4)\tTo teach students how to write a scientific abstract and deliver a 10-minute research presentation.\r\n\r\nInformation about applying to the program is at http://www.gradbiomed.pitt.edu.  Students accepted into this program will be either rising sophomores or rising juniors in an accredited four-year college or university.  Underrepresented minorities are encouraged to apply as well as those attending colleges and universities with limited access to research facilities.  The overall goal of the program is to increase awareness of biological research as a serious career option and to increase the number of students pursuing graduate education in the sciences.\r\n",
