Caldwell\r\n\r\nCAREER: An Integrated Discovery-Based Genomic Approach to Discerning the Role of Nuclear Positioning Genes in Neurodevelopment\r\n\r\nThe positioning of nuclei within cells is essential for development and is involved in such diverse processes as fertilization, cell division, as well as migration and synaptic activity of neurons.  Dr. Caldwell's laboratory has established a link between genes associated with the cellular cytoskeleton and deficits in neuronal activity, specifically related to proteins implicated in nuclear positioning.  As the complexity of the human brain renders it intractable to detailed molecular characterization, the proposed studies will utilize the powerful attributes of the nematode model organism Caenorhabditis elegans.  This simple animal shares most cellular features commonly associated with human neuronal function (ion channels and neurotransmitters like dopamine and GABA). Dr. Caldwell's group has identified a set of evolutionarily conserved nuclear positioning genes and are performing a comprehensive series of experiments to examine the mechanisms by which genetic factors regulate cytoskeletal establishment of neuronal development and activity.\r\n\r\nResults of the research will have an impact beyond developmental neuroscience into areas of cell biology in general.  This CAREER proposal provides thoughtful integration of  research and educational concepts.  \r\nIts focal point is a discovery-based genomics lab course that incorporates Internet-based bioinformatics exercises within an experimental context.  The education impacts of these studies include the involvement of minority participants, enhancement of research alliances with liberal arts colleges and other universities, cross-disciplinary projects in bioinformatics, and a novel student-edited interdisciplinary on-line science journal designed to foster scientific literacy.  \r\n\r\n",
