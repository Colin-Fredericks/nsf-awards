The policy and\r\npolitical impacts of natural disasters can be immediate, in the form of\r\nfederal disaster relief aid, or long-term, as in changes to long-standing\r\nland use regulations. As a result of Tropical Storm Allison, Houston\r\nsuffered over $5 billion in damages, the loss of 22 lives and an estimated\r\n73,000 homes. Recently, as a result of major flooding in Central Europe, the\r\nGerman city of Dresden, and Prague, in the Czech Republic, experienced\r\nsimilar disasters, the impacts of which are being estimated in the billions\r\nof dollars. The similarity of these events provides a unique research\r\nopportunity to contribute a broader understanding of the role of focusing\r\nevents on policy development, politics, and the general health and well\r\nbeing of society. From a research perspective, we are interested in\r\nunderstanding how focusing events, such as urban flooding, develop and\r\npropagate across scales and influence decision processes in regard to\r\nphysical infrastructure and subsequent changes in policy. The objectives of\r\nthis SGER proposal are two-fold. First, we propose to initiate contact with\r\nsocial and physical scientists in Europe and develop a collaborative\r\nresearch team capable of focusing on the broad topic of public policy change\r\nas a result of urban flooding. Researchers will expand upon personal\r\ncontacts in their respective areas and seek out additional collaborators in\r\nsubstantive research areas within the physical and social sciences, as well\r\nas geographical areas impacted by both recurring and nonrecurring urban\r\nflooding events. In so doing, we will also identify sources of relevant and\r\nreliable data, and to the extent possible, collect baseline hydrologic,\r\necologic, and social field data on the impact of the recent flooding\r\nincidents such as those in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Houston. The end\r\npoint of this phase of the SGER project will be a well-defined, and\r\ncommitted interdisciplinary and cross-national research team. The second\r\nobjective is to integrate the disciplines of political science/public\r\nadministration, hydrology and the geosciences into a strategically sound\r\nlarge scale, multi-year cross-national, collaborative, interdisciplinary\r\nresearch proposal for submission to either multiple NSF programs, or one\r\nmajor cross-cutting NSF initiative. The context for this proposal is\r\ncross-national. The integration of the physical and social sciences also\r\nreflects the current interest from NSF in approaching complex social and\r\nnatural problems through multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
