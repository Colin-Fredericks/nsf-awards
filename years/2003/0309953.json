 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a graph G=(V,E), an orientation O of G is an assignment\r\nof directions to the edges of G. We may require that certain\r\nproperties must be satisfied by O. Varying the requirements,\r\ndifferent orientations can be defined. The orientations with\r\nspecial properties often result in interesting combinatorial\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nRecently, several orientations of planar graphs have been \r\nstudied. They have important and sometimes unexpected applications\r\nin fields such as graph drawing, VLSI layout, computer graphics etc.\r\nThese orientations often lead to elegant algorithms, which either\r\nimprove or simplify previously known algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit: The PI has recently obtained interesting\r\nresults using various orientations. The proposed research extends\r\nthese results. The proposed project will result in novel\r\ncombinatorial concepts and constructions and new algorithmic tools.\r\nThis research will make both theoretical and practical\r\ncontributions. On the theoretical side, several important\r\nopen questions in graph theory and combinatorics are among\r\nthe proposed problems. On the practical side, many problems\r\ndiscussed in the proposal are motivated by applications in\r\ngraph drawing, computer graphics and VLSI layout problems.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts: The results obtained from this research\r\nwill have impacts on practical fields such as graph drawing,\r\ncomputer graphics and VLSI design, by providing better, simpler\r\nand more efficient algorithms. It will also enhance graduate\r\neducation in computer science. The algorithms, concepts and\r\ntechniques developed in this research will be include in a new\r\nadvanced algorithm course.\r\n",
