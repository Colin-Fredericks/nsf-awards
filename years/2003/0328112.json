 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis project addresses critical research needs in the rapidly developing area of catalytic conversion of biorenewables. Organic acids produced via fermentation constitute an important class of renewable resource-derived compounds; they are made in large quantities from biomass and can be converted into a variety of building blocks for pharmaceuticals, foods, polymers, solvents, and other products. The research will characterize organic acid adsorption and hydrogenation on heterogeneous metal catalysts in an aqueous environment.  The reaction and adsorption studies to be conducted with organic acids and combinations of acids with other species will develop a better understanding of binding strengths and reactivities of organic acids and their reaction products on different metal catalysts, thus providing a foundation for ultimately tailoring catalyst properties for hydrogenation of specific organic acid substrates.  Additional aspects of the work will clarify key issues such as the role of water on the catalyst metal, the effect of poisons such as CO, and retention and generation of chirality in the product species.  Further, because hydrogenation and dehydrogenation share chemical pathways, this work has implications for hydrogen generation from biomass as a clean energy source.  From an environmental standpoint, heterogeneous hydrogenation over metal catalysts in water allows easy catalyst separation and reuse, avoids organic solvents, and greatly reduces waste generation in comparison to use of homogeneous catalysts or traditional hydride reagent chemistry.  This \"green\" hydrogenation pathway thus represents a primary class of enabling technologies needed for the \"biomass refinery\" of the future. Finally, this effort supports the larger mission of educating the next generation of scientists, who will be responsible for producing our nation's chemicals and fuels from renewable, sustainable resources.",
