The objective of the work is to assist the National Science Foundation in the planning and implementation of a National Workshop, to chair that Workshop to allow NSF to receive the advice of the external scientific community, and to prepare a report to the Directorate.  The report will be in the form of a plan of action and recommendation that can be used by the Foundation in assessing needs, setting priorities, and arriving at concrete steps to advance knowledge in these sciences and ensure an adequate talent pool of researchers to meet the challenges in social and behavioral science fields.\r\n\r\nThere has been increasing recognition of the value and role of the SBE sciences in the \"family of science\" for addressing the most significant challenges that we face as a nation.  As need and demand for our knowledge increases, we must invest in ensuring that the talent pool and human capacity are both sufficient and prepared to undertake this important work.  NSF has developed a new priority area on Human and Social Dynamics to address these needs.  It is anticipated that this workshop will help advance this initiative.\r\n",
