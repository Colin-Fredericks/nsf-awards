 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employing spontaneous assembly in the formation of targeted nanostructures holds promise as a revolutionary approach to shrinking the dimensions of electronic components down to (as low as) the diameter of the building block (~3nm).  The objective of this particular application is to manipulate the phase behavior of 2D populations of semiconductor nanoparticles in order to form microscopic interconnects between arbitrarily chosen points in a circuit.  This objective will be attained through the successful pursuit of the following aims: (1) To determine the dependence of the phase behavior on the experimental parameters (capping layer thickness and particle diameter), such that the degree to which dipolar interparticle interactions drive the spontaneous organization of these populations will be determined.  (2) To dielectrophoretically induce the formation of microscopic wires of semiconductor nanoparticles between designated points in a simple circuit.  As an outcome of the proposed investigations, we expect to have demonstrated that the experimental parameters can be adjusted so that microscopic interconnects spontaneously form between arbitrarily chosen points in a circuit.  \r\n\r\n The research proposed in this application has the potential to solve the problem of interfacing a self-assembled, microscopic component with macroscopic electronics, thereby allowing for experimental evaluation of the electrical properties of the component.  This characterization will be necessary in order to identify practical tasks to which the component can be fruitfully applied.  It is also expected that determining the dependence of the phase behavior on the experimental parameters will generate quantitative insight into the interparticle potential-insight that will provide further guidance in designing, implementing, and improving methods for assembling targeted structures.\r\n",
