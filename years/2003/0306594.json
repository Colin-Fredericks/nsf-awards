The first is to broaden\r\nthe scope of Mostow rigidity by giving new characterizations of locally\r\nsymmetric spaces of noncompact type. Our proposed methods focus on\r\nexpanding the sharp relationship between volume, entropy and the degree\r\nof maps initiated in its current form by work of Besson, Courtois and\r\nGallot. We then wish to extend weaker forms of this relationship to spaces\r\nadmitting nontrivial maps into nonpositively curved targets. The second\r\ncomponent involves understanding the connection between quasiconformal\r\nstructures and special geometric measures which live on the boundary of\r\nmost Hadamard spaces. The initial steps toward this goal also play an\r\nimportant role in the first component. In the effort to establish these\r\nresults, we aim to significantly enhance our understanding of the\r\ninteraction between the geometry, topology and geodesic dynamics of such\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nBased on a long standing principle, researchers have come to expect that\r\nthe most efficient solutions to analytic problems are often achieved by\r\nthose objects which have the most symmetry.  For instance, the modern\r\nversion of a conjecture by Pappus of Alexandria asserts that the circle is\r\n\"rigid:\" any other curve enclosing a region of the plane with the same area\r\nmust have longer length than the circle. This was finally proved in 1841.\r\nIn higher dimensions, the analogous result turns out to be true for the\r\nspheres of constant positive curvature. We can ask related questions about\r\nnonpositively curved spaces; these have the property that the sum of the\r\nangles of any small triangle does not exceed 180 degrees. We propose to\r\nshow that most nonpositively curved spaces with a sufficient amount of\r\nsymmetry exhibit similar rigid behavior, but of a more intrinsic nature.\r\nMoreover, we expect many nonpositively curved spaces which are not\r\nsymmetric to also exhibit a sort of weak rigidity. From such results, we\r\ncan partly determine the rough shape of many asymmetrical spaces,\r\nregardless of curvature, and even draw some purely algebraic conclusions\r\nrelated to their underlying structure. This naturally leads to dynamical\r\ninformation arising, for instance, from the physical interpretation of\r\nthese objects as phase spaces.\r\n",
