 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperative breeding, in which multiple adults share a nest and care for young born at that nest, is unusual among vertebrates.  Delayed dispersal, a hallmark of cooperative breeding, can result from lack of vacant territories or benefits to offspring that remain at the nest where they were born.  The investigators propose to test these alternatives in a cooperatively breeding mammal, the prairie vole.  They will establish prairie vole populations at high and low densities in field enclosures.  The prediction is that the proportion of juveniles that remain at home and the size of extended family groups will be greater at high density.   In these same populations the investigators also will test predictions regarding potential benefits to offspring that remain at home.  Throughout the field experiment, they will use genetic techniques to determine kinship of group members.  This study will be the first to combine a field experiment manipulating population density with genetic data on kinship and should allow the investigators to examine previously mentioned ideas about delayed dispersal.  The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the ways in which demographic and social factors shape mammalian behavior.  \r\n \r\nThis study will provide opportunities for students to gain first-hand experience in the application of the scientific method.  The investigators also plan to introduce grade school and high school teachers to this research as part of a summer workshop.  \r\n",
