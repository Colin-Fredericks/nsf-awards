The course, \"Industrial Processes and Their Impact on Society,\" utilizes the active learning-civic engagement approach. The major course goals are to forge better university relations/communications with local industry and to provide the community with timely and accurate information on the impact of industrial processes going on in the state of Montana.  The course is based around field trips to five local plants from different sectors of chemical industry.  The goals of the course for student impact include providing students with a fundamental understanding of the chemical and process design principles involved in making an industrial process economically viable, giving students the critical thinking tools needed to understand the impact of a given industry on the surrounding environment, and providing students with a balanced view of how local industry impacts the state economically, socially and environmentally.",
