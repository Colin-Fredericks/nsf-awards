 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to explore the use of \"smart polymers\" as supports for transition metal catalysis.  This work addresses the synthesis of catalysts that operate in an \"active site\" in the same way that enzymes provide outer-sphere structure and functionality to help control the energetics of catalyzed reactions. The emphasis of this research is the design and implementation of a new strategy for maximizing active site homogeneity, while also providing new tools for controlling the molecular architecture and composition of imprinted polymers.  Guiding this research is the hypothesis that copolymerizing dendritic metallomonomers into highly crosslinked organic polymers will lead to active sites wherein the dendritic arms provide a well-defined (and variable) interface between the bulk polymer and the cavity of the active site.\r\n\r\nWith this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Michel R. Gagne.  Professor Gagne will focus his work on the use of new environments for catalytic metals in order to guide their reactivity.  The new methods being developed will permit the creation of new catalysts, which are expected to have an impact on the way in which pharmaceutical companies manufacture drugs, and on the methods used by the chemical industry to produce a variety of important chemical compounds.  \r\n",
