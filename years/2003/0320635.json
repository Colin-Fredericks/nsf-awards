 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Clemson University under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Tomkins for the acquisition of a 96-capillary DNA Sequencer for BAC end sequencing, shotgun sequencing, and EST sequencing; a 48-capillary sequencer with Fragment Analysis Package for High Information Content BAC Fingerprinting (physical mapping); and a high resolution, time of flight mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization sample introduction interface.  The instrumentation will be housed at the Clemson University Genomics Institute (CUGI), which was established in 1997 to perform basic research in genomics, distribute BAC/EST resources to the world genomics community, and provide training programs for students, post-doctoral, and other visiting scientists.\r\n\r\nCUGI is structured to contain four basic working groups. These groups are: 1) BAC/EST Resource Center, 2) DNA Sequencing, 3) Physical Mapping, and 4) Bioinformatics.  The equipment acquired as a result of this grant will provide to our DNA sequencing and physical mapping labs so that our service and training programs to the genomics community can be effectively maintained. Additionally, we will further expand our research, service and training functions by acquiring a key protein analysis tool permitting basic proteomics research and service to the community.\r\n \r\nAs part of this grant, we will be hosting summer workshops in genomics and proteomics that will involve well-defined instructional modules with hands-on lab experience. Education and outreach will be targeted to faculty from minority and smaller teaching colleges throughout the state of South Carolina, High-School Science Teachers, and minority undergraduate students across the state in their summer break between their Junior and Senior year. The outreach will utilize the new equipment upgrades and be coordinated through the DNA Learning Center at Clemson University.\r\n",
