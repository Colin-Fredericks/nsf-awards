The P.I. plans to continue the analysis \r\nand refinement of models of noise; these are important in both\r\nquantum communication and error analysis in quantum computation.  \r\nWork in quantum communication includes a proposal which may resolve\r\nthe long-standing question of whether or not entangled inputs can\r\nenhance the capacity of quantum channels to transmit classical\r\ninformation.   The P.I. also plans to construct new classes of error\r\ncorrecting codes as prototypes for codes which can be designed \r\nto deal with those errors to which a particular implementation \r\nof quantum computation is most vulnerable.  Such codes could\r\nbe combined with other techniques to reduced the overall code\r\nlength.   The P.I. will also consider a random Hamiltonian\r\napproach to the analysis of the efficiency of a proposed scheme\r\nfor adiabatic quantum computation.   Finally, the P.I. plans to\r\ncontinue the study of metrics in information geometry, and their\r\nconnection to measures of purity, relative entropy, and distances\r\nbetween states.\r\n\r\nIt has now been established that quantum particles have the potential\r\nto provide the basis for vastly more powerful computers, and new methods\r\nof secure communication.  Although building quantum computers remains\r\na formidable experimental challenge, the feasibility of several methods\r\nof quantum communication and encryption have already been convincingly\r\ndemonstrated.   However, it is also clear that all practical \r\ninstrumentation is imperfect and subject to noise and errors.\r\nThis is not surprising; dealing with noise has long been an important\r\nfacet of classical communication.   However, quantum information devices\r\nare subject to a much larger and more complex variety of errors arising\r\nfrom noise.   This gives rise to new mathematical challenges.   This\r\nproposal deals with a number of these questions.   Effective methods\r\nof dealing with noise are essential to the success of the nation's\r\nability to exploit the power of quantum theory for next generation of\r\ncomputers and cryptographic protocols.\r\n\r\n  ***************************************************************\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n",
