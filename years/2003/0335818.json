 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for a workshop on the behavior of the coupled land - atmosphere system over the 20th century, in the context of the international Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).  Phase 1 of C4MIP is now underway, and the workshop, to take place in September 2003, is to compare research results through analyzes of the simulations conducted to-date. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will analyze the simulations performed for phase 1, with the following 3 goals:\r\n1. Compare the sensitivities of the coupled atmosphere-terrestrial biosphere models to historical forcing and determine how much of the range in overall sensitivity of the 'future' response can be seen in the historical period.\r\n2. Decompose model sensitivity into (a) climatic responses to CO2 and SST forcing and (b) terrestrial carbon cycle responses to climate and CO2 changes\r\n3. Compare elements of the simulated carbon flux and atmospheric concentration fields with available historical reconstructions.\r\n\r\nBased on the results of Phase 1, a second phase will be outlined at the workshop, in order to build on what has been learned to date. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\nHuman influences on the Earth's carbon cycle, primarily through fossil fuel burning and land use changes, is affecting the world climate.  This project strives to help develop the understanding and predictive modeling capabilities that will help provide sound scientific information on this issue to those who make environmental/energy policy.  This is a potentially large benefit to human societies.",
