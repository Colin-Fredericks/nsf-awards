 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (ECS) WORKSHOP ON WIRELESS\r\nNETWORKED SENSOR SYSTEMS: PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nWireless sensor network technology has expanded from its origins of over a decade ago to now\r\ninclude many new communities in both research and applications. New technology requirements\r\nhave rapidly appeared along with many new applications. For example, whereas early sensors\r\nfocused on seismic and acoustic sensing channels for event detection, the new applications in natural\r\nand urban environmental sensing now require new sensing channels for example, multispectral\r\nimaging for detailed understanding of phenomena and chemical sensing for detection of biological\r\npathogens in water resources. Also, as applications have evolved, the requirements for precision\r\nhave increased as well. Further, new applications may emerge in the future where bounded response\r\ntime and distributed control present their requirements. While these new applications appear, the\r\nlong standing problems of scarce energy resources and unreliable, energy-intensive wireless\r\ncommunication remain as challenges.\r\nA broad set of research can be developed opportunities for addressing these new requirements.\r\nIn particular, the Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) Division of the NSF can contribute\r\nto a vision of joint development of hardware and software architectures that uniformly consider\r\nsensing, signal processing, event detection, computing, and networking. This research can consider\r\nthe unique areas of ECS expertise, for example in the development of jointly optimized hardware\r\nand software architectures, sensor systems, communication systems, and distributed, real-time\r\ncontrol methods.\r\nThis proposal describes an NSF Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) Workshop on\r\nWireless Networked Sensor Systems. This is intended to engage Grantees of the ECS Division as\r\nwell as others to explore the new ECS opportunities, develop a series of new program concepts, and\r\nultimately create new research avenues on urgent ECS problems. The topics of this workshop will\r\ninclude the examples of 1) Decentralized Detection and Control with Wireless Sensor Networks, 2)\r\nWireless Sensor Node and System Energy Barriers and Solution Pathways, 3) Energy-Aware\r\nNetworked Sensor and Instrument Systems, 4) Energy-Aware, Wireless Sensor Specific Hardware\r\nand Software Architectures, and others to be developed.\r\nThe Workshop is proposed to take place over a two-day period in August 2003, and engage at\r\nleast 50 investigators. The Workshop schedule will include brief orientation/discussion periods\r\nalong with breakout sessions that are intended to not only produce guiding summary documents,\r\nbut to also promote the development of this new community.\r\nBroad Societal Impacts: The wireless sensor research area has promising impact in science and\r\nengineering disciplines including natural environmental science and environmental engineering,\r\nindustrial automation, physical security for homeland defense, and healthcare technology. Many\r\nnew challenges are rapidly appearing that must be solved to support the wireless sensor network\r\nvision. This Workshop will provide guidance at many levels for the development of new\r\ninnovations and research pathways that will have broad impact.\r\nBroad Education Impacts: Wireless sensor research has already demonstrated broad impact in\r\neducation through the development of new courses and the direct benefits of engaging\r\nundergraduate and graduate student researchers with inherently multidisciplinary research programs.\r\nThis Workshop will create a set of new such opportunities specifically in the ECS area, thus\r\nbroadening the opportunities for identifying vital undergraduate and graduate student thesis research\r\nobjectives and programs. Workshop results will be immediately valuable for student researchers and\r\ntheir advisors.",
