 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the acquisition of surface analysis equipment for research on metal-ceramic film growth and student training at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. These surface analytical tools will become permanent and scientifically important attachments to our ultra-high vacuum facility for thin film growth. This project is focused on the development of low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) routes to deposit metallic ceramic thin films for use in electronic devices and hard coatings. These compounds are classified as metallic ceramics because they have high melting temperatures, low electrical resistivities, excellent performance as barriers against impurity (metal) diffusion, and high mechanical hardnesses. The cluster of surface analytical tools will be used to analyze the film growth processes by providing powerful insights into the chemical reactions responsible for deposition, as well as the morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the films. The knowledge gained from these in situ analyses will guide our efforts to grow metallic, ceramic, and other thin film materials, and to achieve epitaxial layer growth on suitable substrates. \r\n\r\nOur current research project is the first to successfully produce metal boride thin films with bulk-like properties at low growth temperatures. The new equipment will provide excellent capabilities for improving our scientific understanding and for further developing these low-temperature chemical vapor deposition processes. The instruments will become part of a multi-user facility available for use by undergraduate students, graduate assistants, and post-doctoral scientists. We are engaged in recruiting new students from underrepresented groups and routinely involve students from the classroom in the research project. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
