The project is stimulated by Huffaker's\r\nclassic experiment, which provided the first demonstration of the\r\nmediating role of spatial processes in certain ecological\r\ninteractions.  Huffaker noted that synchronies in the phases of\r\npopulation cycles of localized aggregates within host plants of\r\nherbivorous mites and of the mites that preyed upon them\r\noccasionally spread over an entire area, but that the synchrony\r\ncan be broken by demographic and environmental stochasticity.  He\r\nconjectured that the complementary regularizing mechanisms that\r\ngenerate synchrony, and the complementary stochastic mechanisms\r\nthat generate asynchrony, together generate the complex waves and\r\npatterns seen in these predator-prey interactions in nature.\r\nExisting stochastic patch models have been formulated that\r\nsuccessfully simulate complex, and evidently chaotic,\r\nspatio-temporal patterns that have typically accompanied\r\npersistent dynamics.  Accordingly, such models have difficulty in\r\nproviding reliable predictions of behavior due to the large\r\nvariance seen in replicate data sets.  This substantially limits\r\ntheir practical application to the biological control of crop\r\npests.  In previous work, the investigator formulated a family of\r\ndeterministic models, including an idealized paradigm defining a\r\nclass of reaction-diffusion systems.  He studies two general\r\nissues relating to the analysis and practical applications of the\r\nreaction-diffusion system and related models.  First, he\r\ninvestigates the presence of several distinct families of stable\r\nwaves and spatial patterns of these equations, their\r\ninstabilities and bifurcations, and the presence of exotic\r\nwave-like patterns.  By combined analytical and approximate\r\nmethods, he describes theoretical mechanisms by which such\r\nunstable waves can form the organizing center of spatio-temporal\r\nchaos, while in other regimes, complex but non-chaotic, stable\r\nspatio-temporal patterns appear spontaneously.  A second topic\r\nconcerns the derivation of the model, which is based on\r\nexperiment.  This addresses the manner in which the\r\nreaction-diffusion model simulates stochasticity through\r\npostulated low-density thresholds in the growth rates.  The\r\ninvestigator studies hybrid numerical procedures addressing the\r\ncrucial issue of parameter estimation, which can be problematic\r\nboth for stochastic patch models and for the reaction-diffusion\r\nmodel, but at opposite spatio-temporal scales.  For example, the\r\nlow-density thresholds involve the micro-local dynamics of a\r\nsmall number of individuals, whereas large-scale emigration over\r\nlarge regions is difficult to measure in a laboratory.  However,\r\nsimple stable waves may suggest one instance in which this may be\r\npossible.  The investigator examines this in numerical\r\nsimulations with patch models, which may form the basis for new\r\nand simpler experimental designs that can detect such behavior.\r\nTogether, these two approaches present a unified picture of how\r\n\"dynamic stochasticity\" driven by the presence of certain\r\nunstable waves and spatio-temporal patterns is theoretically\r\nlinked to parameters of population change governing behavior at\r\nthe smallest micro-local scales, and thus the generation of\r\nasynchrony through demographic and environmental stochasticity.\r\n     Plant-eating mites, and the mites that eat them in turn,\r\noften show cycles of growth and decline in numbers that are\r\nclosely related.  Sometimes the populations decline rapidly to\r\nnear-extinction levels.  But in a classic experiment Huffaker and\r\ncolleagues showed that these strongly coupled cycles can be\r\nmoderated by small changes in demographic or geographic factors,\r\nleading to a long-term survival of both species that shows itself\r\nin patterns, in time and space, of the numbers of predator and\r\nprey mites.  Of course, when the prey mite is eating a valuable\r\ncrop, one wants both mite populations to go extinct.  So issues of\r\nhow mite populations vary together are of considerable practical\r\nimportance in the biological control of crop pests.  The economic\r\nimpact of phytophageous species is considerable, and although the\r\nuse of predatory mites as a biological control is widespread in\r\ncertain local agricultures, many agricultural enterprises rely on\r\nchemical pest controls.  Chemical controls provide a short-term\r\nsolution, but have many damaging long-term effects.  However, the\r\nrisks and uncertainties of biological pest control are difficult\r\nto quantify due to their complex and unpredictable patterns of\r\nbehavior.  The investigator's numerical simulations indicate the\r\npresence of many different kinds of chaos, some of which achieve\r\nbetter levels of suppression of both herbivore populations and\r\ncrop damage.  The project explores new theoretical and\r\ncomputational tools that may find practical application in the\r\nbiological control of crop pests and, in other contexts, in\r\ninoculative control of certain exotic species.\r\n",
