 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hunting is important to peasant populations throughout the tropical forests in the Amazon region, yet why peasant households hunt is not well understood.  Past research has focused on the effects of hunting on wildlife populations, or hunting behavior and strategy by indigenous groups, but little is known about why peasant groups in the region hunt.  This dissertation research links theories of the peasant economy within the household and across peasant households in the community with the literature on hunting strategy and behavior by indigenous groups in Amazonia.  The social and symbolic functions of hunting will be studied, for example by analyzing how local men use hunting to socialize their sons and nephews into manhood.  The project will investigate the influence of household organization and decision-making on peasant hunting strategy and behavior, and analyze the effects of inter-household relationships on hunting practices.  The project will investigate how hunting affects other forest based activities and the sustainability of the forest resource base.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This study builds upon the work of a Brazilian NGO, PESACRE, which has worked with the communities in the research site since 1998. In the state of Acre, an area known for its \"forest government\", this study aims to link the importance of hunting in the rural livelihoods of peasant households and communities to wider issues of forest management.  An understanding of the social dynamics of hunting and the use of wild game in the livelihood systems of peasant communities in Amazonia will help conservation and development organizations and the state of Acre and throughout Amazonia in their attempts to provide projects that account for both the cultural and biological diversity of the region.  Further, this project contributes to the education of a young social scientist.  \r\n",
