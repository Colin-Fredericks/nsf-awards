 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProposal Title: PECASE: Single Spin Transistors - Science, Application and Education\r\nInstitution: University of California-Irvine\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal aimed at exploring the spin properties, both from the fundamental physics point of view as well as from their relevance to the recent technologically important area of spintronics. The PI proposes to combine the recent experimental developments of single-electron transistors and magnetic tunnel junctions to fabricate new spin electronics devices, which we call single spin transistors based on the controllability and manipulability of single-electron spins. \r\nThis proposal aims to fabricate and characterize single spin transistors which use the carbon nanotube as the nano-sized island. It will reveal new physical aspects of the quantum states and dynamic behavior of single electron spins in the one dimensional system. This device is based on the proven single electron transistor architecture and processing, with the island weakly coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes to inject and detect polarized spins. These nanoscale hybrid structures will be used to test various theoretically predicted phenomena such as enhanced magnetoresistance, single electron charging effects, conductance oscillations, and spin diffusion. One of the novel features of this effort is to inject fully polarized spins into the one dimensional carbon nanotubes, by spin filtering through the use of a magnetic semiconductor. Ultimately, the localization of a single electron of controlled spin in a highly sensitive nanostructure will enable novel and more versatile spin electronic devices, which so far is being pursued based on the behavior of large numbers of spin-polarized electrons. The proposed research will be critical to extremely high-density magnetic information storage, electron-spin-based quantum computing, magneto-electronic sensors, and perhaps future spin electronic devices and systems yet to be imagined. To continue the education and training of students, graduate students, undergraduates and high school students, especially from the underrepresented groups, will be recruited to participate in the proposed research. This program represents an excellent opportunity for the students (of all levels) involved being educated in the nanoscience. They will work in multidisciplinary areas - physics, materials science, and nanoelectronics, the future trend in science and technology. These highly educated and trained people will become either future educators or the technical backbone of spin based information storage technology, which is already in short supply in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
