 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to discover new transparent conductors for electro-optic applications where light sensors and light emitters are made from materials that are invisible. This program seeks new transparent conductors, and aims to understand their properties. Growth of thin films for use in applications such as transparent thin film transistors is emphasized. Bipolar active transparent devices require both n-type and p-type conductivity, preferably in the same material. This program provides new high mobility wide band gap semiconductors, and aims to understand carrier doping properties.  Traditional oxide systems as well as novel chalcogenide materials will be studied in bulk and thin-film form.  Physical vapor deposition and solution deposition methods will be used to prepare thin films for device fabrication. Device development will include thin film transparent transistors as well as p-i-n and Schottky diodes.   Graduate and undergraduate students receive training in forefront research in a highly interdisciplinary mode in this focused research group of chemists, physicists, and engineers, who also interact with the commercial research sector.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nTransparent conductors may form the basis of a new class of electronics where light sensors and light emitters are made from materials that are invisible.  This would facilitate the realization of invisible circuits on flexible plastics, and three-dimensional screens. Active transparent devices usually require both n-type and p-type conductivity in transparent materials, and preferably in the same material.  Graduate and undergraduate students receive training in forefront research in a highly interdisciplinary mode in this focused research group of chemists, physicists, and engineers. Because these research areas are of high relevance to the commercial research sector, these students are highly competitive in related job markets. This project is co-funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\n",
