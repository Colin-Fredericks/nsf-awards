 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid deterioration of civil infrastructure has created one of the major challenges facing the construction industry. It is vital to the U.S. economy that cost-effective structural systems and materials be explored to extend service life and to improve performance of infrastructure facilities. This project focuses on bridge decks, where conventional reinforced concrete decks have failed to provide adequate service life. Also, current fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) decks are based on two-dimensional (2-D) laminate configuration, which is susceptible to delamination failure especially under fatigue loading. \r\n The main objective of the proposed research is to, for the first time ever, adapt the 3-D weaving process to develop innovative FRP bridge decks. This requires a through understanding of the implications of the weaving process on the structural behavior of bridge decks, making it necessary to carry out tests and to develop reliable analytical tools to predict the behavior of the deck at the micro and macro levels using finite element models. \r\n  While direct economical impact of the proposed research on the society is realized by the low-cost and high-performance FRP deck systems using the new 3-D weaving process, other impacts of the research includes transfer of advanced technology from the textile engineering to the civil engineering arena, encouraging the spirit of interdisciplinary research in developing effective solutions in the more established civil engineering field.\r\n  The work plan has both experimental and analytical components. The experimental work consists of (I) testing of scale models of FRP deck as well as coupon testing of the cell units, and (II) large-scale testing of the prototype of the FRP deck under static and fatigue loading. The analytical work includes finite element modeling of the FRP deck using micro- and macro-models. Once the models are calibrated using the experimental results of Part I, a parametric study will be carried out to optimize the shape and configuration of the deck, upon which the prototype deck will be fabricated and tested.\r\n  Results of this research will include an innovative adaptation of the 3-D weaving process for manufacturing of bridge decks using FRP composites. The results will also include analytical tools and design aids for the proposed deck system, and means of finding the optimal solution for each design application.\r\n",
