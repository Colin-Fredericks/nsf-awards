 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rice blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is a major threat to worldwide food security.  Decades of intense research have turned this organism into the prime model for study of fungal phytopathogenesis.  A high quality draft genome assembly has been produced, offering 7X sequence coverage.  The sequence and its automated annotation are widely used by many fungal researchers and have rapidly advanced M. grisea gene identification.  However, as with any draft sequence, there are missing and interrupted genes, unanchored sequence, and global mis-assemblies.  The whole-genome methods that the M. grisea research community is prepared to adopt require a complete and accurate genome sequence.  The specific objectives of this project are to:  1) Generate a fully finished genome sequence for Magnaporthe grisea.  2) Integrate the genome assembly with existing physical and genetic maps.  3) Generate automated annotation of the M. grisea genome.  4) Provide training, education and outreach opportunities centered on genomic studies of a fungal plant pathogen.  \r\n\r\nThe availability of a finished sequence will enable discovery among researchers working with Magnaporthe as well as with many related pathogenic and non-pathogenic filamentous fungi. Through comparative genomics the Magnaporthe sequence will impact scientists engaged in fungal, genetic, and evolutionary studies, as well as computational biology. The education and outreach activities in this project offers new opportunities for faculty and students from underrepresented groups to engage in fungal genome based research. \r\n",
