 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale power networks are controlled by a small number of regional transmission organizations\r\n(RTO), which collect a vast amount of data on line and try to filter the useful information out of them. One\r\nway to do this filtering is by the use of Level of Detail (LOD) representation, which is an important tool\r\nfor real time rendering of complex geometric environments. This proposal develops a method to utilize\r\nLOD modelling in the efficient monitoring and operation of power networks. The intellectual merit of\r\nthis proposal is in the observation that the LOD representations can not only be used to visualize the power\r\nnetworks but also be applied to their efficient analysis, modeling and optimization. This can be accomplished\r\nby customization of the network reduction based on the specific characteristics of not only the network but\r\nalso the study of interest.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project will include the reduction of transmission costs via more efficient\r\npower exchanges due to the facilitation of transmission relief procedures. Graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents will be trained in one of the critical infrastructure areas. The results of this research will be made\r\navailable on the web, also through papers in journals and conferences. Finally, the integration of the most\r\nrecent technical innovations in computer graphics in the monitoring of nation's energy grid will facilitate\r\nmuch needed technology transfer between these two technical areas.",
