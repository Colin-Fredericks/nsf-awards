Over the years, this series of conferences has attracted notable mathematicians from numerous universities throughout the Southeast, with areas of interest ranging from infinite abelian groups and modules over domains to representation type of categories of modules and categories of subgroups. These\r\nconferences have allowed numerous algebraists from smaller universities to meet, exchange research ideas, and forge institutional partnerships and relationships.  The proposed project encourages increased participation by young mathematicians, by providing travel support for up to fifteen graduate students and recent doctoral recipients to attend this meeting.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of science and engineering (as well as business and economics) on mathematics is generally recognized.  Thus, a steady supply of skilled mathematicians is crucial to maintaining the health of the university system.  Mathematicians, in order to be effective in their professional careers, need to pursue a path of intellectual growth and scholarly activity. A key component of this intellectual activity is the chance to meet regularly with other mathematicians and exchange ideas.  For the last thirty years, the yearly \"Weekend Algebra Conferences\" have provided this opportunity to numerous mathematicians from universities throughout the Southeast.  The proposed project offers travel support to developing mathematicians to attend the next meeting in this series, in the fall of 2003.  By limiting support to students and untenured faculty, the proposed project focuses on nurturing mathematicians early in their careers, thus addressing the long-term research and educational infrastructure of mathematics departments in the Southeast.  Special effort to recruit women and minorities for funding broadens the impact of the proposed project by increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n",
