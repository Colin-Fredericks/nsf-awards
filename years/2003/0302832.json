 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will introduce low-cost virtual reality technology into design and technical graphics classrooms and laboratories, as well as develop instructional materials to enhance course delivery.  Changing market needs and advances in technology, the focus of CAD technology education, and the shift from drafting to design, problem-solving, presentation, and communication points to the critical need to integrate virtual reality tools into the design and technical graphics curricula.  The primary audiences for this project are students and faculty at all levels of design and technical graphics education and CAD technologists in industry.  This project reaches down to inspire the interests of high school students by providing outreach days and virtual reality experiences for students.  The project, in collaboration with Community College partners, will  promote the advancement of their students and engage University students in enhanced learning opportunities that will better prepare them to contribute to the work force.  The resulting instructional materials will be made available to graphics and design educators at other institutions through a project web site and by distributing a CD-ROM.  Results will be disseminated through national conference presentations and publications.  In addition, fifty community colleges will be selected and invited to use the instructional materials developed.",
