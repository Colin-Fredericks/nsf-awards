 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nuclear physics group at California State University, Los Angeles,\r\nstudies nuclear structure of low mass nuclei and the structure of the\r\nneutron and proton. These studies use the high energy electron\r\naccelerator at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, and similar lower\r\nenergy accelerators at other sites. In the present research period we\r\nwill be leading a group to study the nuclear structure of the most\r\ncommon isotope of helium, helium-4. Helium-4 is an excellent laboratory\r\nfor testing theoretical models of how neutrons, protons and exotic\r\nparticles combine to form the nuclear ground state. Helium-4 is also of\r\nparticular interest because about 25% of the visible mass in the\r\nuniverse is bound up in helium-4 nuclei. Understanding this nucleus will\r\n\r\ntell us something significant about a large component of the visible\r\nuniverse, as well as serve as a testing ground for nuclear theories.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate students and graduate students are significantly involved\r\nwith our research. These students participate in the research in\r\nmeaningful ways, working directly with us or in teams. They will do and\r\nhave done data reduction and analysis, contributed to the construction\r\nof experimental equipment for approved experiments, participated in\r\nrunning the experiments, and learned how to use Monte Carlo simulation\r\ntechniques in understanding complex pieces of apparatus.  Our goal is to\r\n\r\nbring students into a research experience as soon as possible in their\r\ncollege careers. This experience serves our students well, either if\r\nthey decide to go on to graduate level research, or to enter industry,\r\nwhere their background in team work to solve complex problems will be an\r\n\r\nadvantage. High School science teachers have also contributed to our\r\nresearch effort by doing data reduction and analysis. We hope to have a\r\nteacher do a Master's thesis in physics using our data.\r\n",
