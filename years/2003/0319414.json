 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the design and performance analysis of a novel photonic/electronic hybrid concept for optical code division multiple access (CDMA). The small business has developed families of matrices and hardware designs whereby these can be implemented as wavelength/time (W/T) matrix codes for high performance optical CDMA networks. Optical CDMA is usually based on photonic encoding and decoding.  There are three functions which may be better executed by an integrated electronic decoder/receiver that complements a photonic encoder: (1) electronic rather than photonic correlation to optimize the signal-to-noise-ratio; (2) programmable compensation for fiber impairments; and (3) signal processing for multi-user interference suppression. This project will design a system concept based on photonic encoding and electronic decoding; carry out design analyses and network simulations; and generate design specifications and R&D recommendations for Phase II.\r\n\r\nA technology applicable to local-area-network (LANs), and metro-area-networks (MANs) and access networks has been developed.  Optical CDMA has traditionally been developed for local area networks  to support multiple concurrent, asynchronous, bursty users; since the late 1990s it has been considered as a viable contender for the emerging applications of metropolitan and access networks. The proposer has developed a technology applicable to either application. This permits supporting a large number of subscribers with relatively simple transmitters and receivers. The proposer is targeting metropolitan, access, and extended private networks.  Another potential application is steganography for Homeland Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
