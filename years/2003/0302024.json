It is the goal of coding theory to find efficient ways to\r\nencode the information so that these errors can be corrected.\r\nAlgebraic coding theory seeks to do this using techniques from areas\r\nsuch as linear algebra, group theory, and algebraic geometry.  This\r\nproject involves four main problems within algebraic coding theory:\r\nthe search for an efficient decoding algorithm for algebraic geometric\r\ncodes over certain rings, the study of exponential sums over certain\r\nrings and their connections to coding theory, the study of codes from\r\na structural standpoint, and the construction of quantum codes in\r\ncharacteristics greater than 2.  Much of this project involves work\r\nthe PI will do with her graduate and postdoctoral students.  In\r\naddition, she will continue her history of being extremely active in\r\nmathematical activities outside her research.  These activities\r\ninclude organizing a week-long summer math camp for high school girls\r\nand a national research conference for undergraduate women\r\nmathematicians.  While previously supported by NSF, the PI was the\r\nundergraduate lecturer at the IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute\r\nMentoring Program, and during the term of the current project, she\r\nwill be the principal lecturer at a \"Reconnect\" workshop for faculty\r\nfrom primarily teaching-focused institutions.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, the problems included in this project are described as\r\nfollows.  In previous work, the PI introduced algebraic geometric\r\ncodes over local Artinian rings and proved several foundational\r\nresults about these codes.  Two portions of this project build on this\r\nprior work.  First, in joint work with R. Koetter, the PI intends to\r\nfind an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.  This algorithm\r\nwill decode with respect to the squared Euclidean and homogeneous\r\nweight measures.  The design of the algorithm will depend both upon\r\nSudan's list decoding algorithm and the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision\r\nversion of Sudan's algorithm.  Second, the PI will build upon her past\r\nwork with exponential sums along curves over rings and their\r\nrelationship to codes.  While her previous work (joint with\r\nJ.-F. Voloch) has focused on Weil exponential sums and their\r\napplications to homogeneous and squared Euclidean weights of algebraic\r\ngeometric codes over local Artinian rings, other types of sums have\r\nproven valuable in the study of codes over finite fields and the PI\r\nwill now study the ring analogues of these other sums and their\r\napplications.  The third area of this project builds on the PI's prior\r\nwork on a structural approach to coding theory.  She previously used\r\nthis approach to revisit the classification of binary self-dual codes,\r\nand in addition to continuing this work, she will look at ternary\r\nself-dual codes as well as additive GF(4)-codes from this point of\r\nview.  The fourth and final main area of this project is that of\r\nquantum algebraic-geometric codes arising from algebraic curves.\r\nTogether with J.-L. Kim and T. Marley, the PI intends to construct\r\ngood algebraic geometric quantum codes in characteristics greater than\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
