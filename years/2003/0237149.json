 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative grant has been awarded to Colorado State University under the direction\r\nof Dr. Mark Simmons; University of Colorado at Boulder under the direction of Drs.\r\nThomas Ranker and Robert Guralnick; University of Northern Colorado under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Neil Snow; and University of Wyoming under the direction of Dr. Ronald\r\nHartman to produce an online distributed database of collections of vascular plants from\r\nthe Southern Rocky Mountain Region (SRMR) and create an online, interactive\r\nidentification key for vascular plants from the SRMR. The region covered by this project\r\nincludes the entire State of Colorado, nine counties from southern Wyoming, and eight\r\ncounties from northcentral New Mexico. The SRMR as defined here is a reasonably\r\ncoherent ecoregion based on many shared geological and biological features, such as a\r\nnumber of mountain chains of Laramide orogeny, and many vascular plant species are\r\nrestricted to this region. The SRMR is characterized by a rich diversity of ecosystems,\r\nranging from semi-arid grasslands to the east, through montane pine, subalpine\r\nspruce-fir forests, and alpine tundra in the center, to canyons and mesas in the west.\r\nUnique wetland and riparian ecosystems exist on the plains, and nutrient-poor streams\r\nand lakes are frequent in the mountains. This broad range of ecosystems fosters a\r\ndiverse flora, and is reflective of strong topographic forcings and steep climatic\r\ngradients. In addition to herbarium specimens at the Colorado State University\r\nHerbarium, the Rocky Mountain Herbarium, the University of Colorado Herbarium, and\r\nthe University of Northern Colorado Herbarium, the distributed database will incorporate\r\nspecimens from the SRMR that have been databased at other regional and national\r\nherbaria.\r\nThe interactive key will be produced using Lucid Professional version 2.1, which is\r\nintended primarily for use online. Each of the approximately 4,000 species treated in\r\nthe key will have associated windows describing its associated names, distribution,\r\nvoucher specimens, and images. For the specimen database, a Federation of\r\nDatabases that communicate with each other will be created. The Federation of\r\nDatabases will be implemented by following the specifications suggested by the Digital\r\nGeneric Information Retrieval group. Georeferencing is crucial for the production of\r\nstatic or dynamic species maps or atlases and for the import of data into Geographic\r\nInformation Systems. All specimens will be georeferenced as part of this project. Each\r\nstep in the process of creating linked databases and the interactive key will be\r\ndocumented. Clear documentation will also be provided for becoming part of the initial\r\ndatabase federation to future investigators.\r\nThe specimen database established by this project will document and locate the\r\nvascular plant diversity that currently exists in this region, and help track the rate and\r\nmagnitude of change in biodiversity patterns caused by urban development over the\r\nnext several decades. It will be useful for discerning areas of high biodiversity,\r\ndetermining the point of introduction and the spread of invasive species, locating\r\nvoucher specimens, and as a coverage in geographic-information-systems applications.\r\nThe educational implications of the proposal will extend the usefulness of this project.\r\n",
