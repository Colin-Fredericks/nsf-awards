 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc. and Texas A&M University are hosting the\r\nInternational Symposium on Molecular Breeding of Forage and Turf, May 18-22, 2003 in\r\nDallas, Texas. This conference will focus exclusively on the theme of cultivar improvement for\r\nforage and turf through the application of conventional plant breeding and molecular methods.\r\n\r\nForages provide the basis for environmentally sustainable production of animal products\r\nthroughout the world, and turf serves an important environmental and service role in society.\r\nThe economic impact of forages and turfgrasses is substantial. Cultivar improvement using\r\nconventional selection techniques has barely kept pace with increased production requirements.\r\nMolecular technologies offer powerful tools to enhance the process of cultivar improvement,\r\nalthough the development of such technology for forage and turf breeding has been slow relative\r\nto other major crops. Reasons for this slower than desired progress include: the complicated\r\nnature of polyploid genetics; the perennial nature of forage and turf crops; and a lack of financial\r\nresources to support applied research.\r\n\r\nThis conference will facilitate the assembly of 250-400 participants from academia and industry,\r\nrepresenting such diverse professional interests as plant breeding, agronomy, ruminant nutrition,\r\nplant genetic resources, intellectual property rights, genomics, transformation, and\r\nbioinformatics. The selected speakers are experts in their respective field, and each has\r\ncommitted to attend. Thus, this conference will provide an otherwise unavailable opportunity for\r\nplant breeders and molecular scientists in the field of forage and turf improvement to come\r\ntogether for the purpose of exchanging information and ideas, learning the latest developments,\r\nand forming multidisciplinary collaborations. It is anticipated that this conference will facilitate\r\nthe advancement of current and future cultivar development in the United States and as well as\r\ndeveloping and developed countries.\r\n\r\nEfforts in conference recruitment will seek to draw critical new thoughts into this field through\r\nthe solicitation of members of historically underrepresented groups, young scientists (including\r\npost-doctoral fellows), and graduate students. The introduction of new ideas to this discipline is\r\nbeneficial and necessary, and the exposure of young scientists to this field will desirably\r\ncontribute to cultivar improvement for forage and turf for decades to come.\r\n\r\nA summary of the conference, including papers from invited speakers and selected oral\r\npresentations, will be compiled in a comprehensive printed proceeding, entitled inMolecular\r\nBreeding of Forage and Turf.ln This proceeding will be published by Kluwer Academic\r\nPublishers. This proceeding will be the principal means used to perpetuate the meeting and its\r\ndiscussions.",
