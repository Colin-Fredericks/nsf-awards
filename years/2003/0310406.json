 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow the PIs to participate in internationally collaborative investigations of boreholes and samples now being drilled by the Unzen Scientific   Drilling   Project (USDP),   Japan. The USDP is part of the International Continental Drilling   Program   (ICDP),   which   seeks   to   use   drilling   as   a   tool   to   advance understanding of fundamental processes of Earth's crust. The goal of the USDP is to understand the   eruptive behavior of Unzen as representative of an   important   class of andesitic arc volcanoes. In the now-completed first phase of the drilling project, flank holes of 750 m   and 1500 m were drilled to the base of  the volcanic edifice in order to obtain   a complete physical and chemical record of   the volcano's   activity.  This proposal aims to continue a one-year pilot project that has shown that the present Unzen magma system, which is characterized by   frequent injection of fractionated mafic magma into a crust-resident   slush   of remarkably constant   composition,   has   persisted for 500,000 years. The intellectual targets for the next phase of the drilling project will be: 1.)   to   understand   how   viscous   magma   behaves mechanically, chemically, and thermally   as   it   approaches Earth.s surface; 2.)   to   determine why   Unzen is   such   an exemplary case of   non-explosive   eruption   of   initially   wet   magma,   and   3.)   to   improve   techniques   to   forecast eruptions   by   providing   direct   subsurface   observations that   inform   interpretation   of   precursory   seismicity, deformation, and degassing. The investigators propose to   use   optical,   SEM,   electron microprobe, XRF,   and LA-ICPMS   techniques to   examine the   samples.   In   particular,   proximal   units   will   be   correlated to   units   encountered in   flank   drilling,   zones of hydrothermal alteration will be mapped, and intrusive features identified. Most importantly, the conduit   that   fed the 1991-1994   eruption   will   be   delineated. In   order to   constrain degassing behavior, special attention   will   be paid   to occurrence of intrusive glass on the margin   of   the   conduit   and residual melt   in   the   central portion.   Comparison   of glassy dome lava with   partially   crystalline conduit   material   (if   residual melt   remains) and with   crystalline conduit material will serve to define the complete crystallization   path   of Unzen magma.   Conduit   width,   textural variations within the conduit related to degassing and cooling, plausible rheologies of the magma and wallrock, and effects of conduit flow and degassing on the   wallrock will   be determined. In terms of broader impacts, the work should   improve the   understanding and predictability of this dangerous type of volcanic activity, which has afflicted not only Shimabara, Japan but   also towns near Pinatubo Volcano in the Philippines and Soufriere Hills Volcano in Montserrat in recent years. The project has attracted much public   interest   in   Japan,   and will likely   do   so   worldwide once drilling   to   the   conduit   has   begun.   Accordingly,   the   USDP   team   plans to make results available to   the   public   in   near-real   time   in   English,   Japanese, and   German over   the Worldwide   Web.   As representatives of the   US   scientific   community   on   the   team,   the   investigators   will   make appropriate   use   of   this opportunity   to   acquaint   their   American colleagues   with   research   opportunities   as   they   arise.   This   will   serve to increase the breadth of   expertise engaged in   the   Unzen enterprise, while   at   the   same   time   acquainting   Americans with the very substantial resources, experience, and ideas of the volcanological community of Japan.",
