 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research is to establish the range of reactions that can be accomplished on a chip-based platform.  First, a protocol for moving known mediated electrochemical reactions to the chips will be developed.  Second, electrochemically cleavable linkers will be developed for connecting molecules to the chips so that individual molecules in the library can be isolated. Third, strategies for spatially confining transition metal catalyzed reactions to specific locations on the chips will be developed.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller in the Department of Chemistry at Washington University. Professor Moeller will focus his research efforts using electrochemistry to build molecular libraries on chips.  The research has broader impact for the pharmaceutical industry and for the agricultural industry.  Further, the project will provide an excellent venue for the training of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n",
