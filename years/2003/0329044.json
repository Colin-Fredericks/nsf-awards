 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collections track project is implementing a sustainable single-source digital collection of international environmental and ecosystem policy documents that facilitates knowledge discovery, supports a \"rich learning environment\" and benefits researchers, teachers, students, diplomats and decision-makers throughout society from global to local levels. Materials for this collection are provided by the Marine Mammal Commission based on their comprehensive five-volume Marine Mammal Commission Compendium of Selected Treaties, International Agreements, and Other Relevant Documents on Marine Resources, Wildlife, and the Environment . Architecture of this digital library is harnessing the exponentially expanding complexity of international documents with automated technology based on the patented Information Management, Retrieval and Display Systems and Associated Methods from EvREsearch LTD. The template for this digital library is the Antarctic Treaty Searchable Database (http://webhost.nvi.net/aspire). To facilitate knowledge discovery \"parent documents\" are broken into \"finite elements\" that are tagged with information about their: (a) unique hierarchal location in the digital library; (b) year of adoption; (c) signatory nations; and (d) regime classification. This increased granularity, with tags inserted directly into the finite element, enables comprehensive database searchability. The search results are displayed in user-defined expandable-collapsible hierarchies. \r\n\r\nAn advisory board is providing oversight and guidance for the digital library: (a) design and implementation; (b) evaluation strategies, including the design of the questionnaire; (c) dissemination strategies, including website links as well as CD-ROM distribution with and without cost-recovery; and (d) management in a manner that fosters long-term sustainability. This project involves collaborations with the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE), Digital Library for Water in the Earth System (DWEL) and American Society of International Law. The digital library is hosted and managed in conjunction with the award-winning website at the Byrd Polar Research Center in a manner that ensures its continuous uninterrupted availability. Dissemination of the digital library involves website links to governmental, non-governmental and academic websites, with a particular focus on the \"Model United Nations\" audience that is represented by more than 30,000 websites on the internet. Additionally, the digital library is distributed from the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Marine Mammal Commission on a CD-ROM that runs automatically without installation. This digital library facilitates knowledge discovery of international environmental and ecosystem policy documents, and provides long-term benefits for education activities, resource management and the basic infrastructure of our society.\r\n",
