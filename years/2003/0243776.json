 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) is a collaboration of\r\nDuke University, North Carolina State University, the University of North\r\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, and other institutions in the North Carolina\r\nTriangle area, which has established a diverse research program in low-energy nuclear\r\nphysics. TUNL has a strong reputation for providing hands-on experimental\r\nresearch experience to graduate and undergraduate students, who are involved\r\nin all aspects of nuclear physics experiments. Research projects are focused\r\non resolving issues in, for example, few-body physics, nuclear-level\r\ndensities, weak interactions and fundamental symmetries, photonuclear\r\nreactions, nuclear astrophysics and radiative-capture reactions.\r\n\r\nThe REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a realistic and\r\nactive research experience through the completion of a self-contained\r\n10-week project and through the understanding of the project's integral\r\ncontribution to the ongoing research program at TUNL. The broad scope of\r\nactivities at TUNL, which involve data collection, data analysis and\r\ninstrumentation development, offers the variety in project selection needed\r\nto productively involve students who have diverse academic and research\r\nbackgrounds, capabilities and interests. To broaden the research experience,\r\na special lecture series has been incorporated into the program to increase\r\nthe students' exposure to current topics in nuclear physics and to share\r\ndetails about the research resources at TUNL. At the end of the summer\r\nprogram, students prepare written and oral presentations that help them to\r\norganize an overview of their research projects.\r\n",
