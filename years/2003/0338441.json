 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support an international workshop to discuss the uncertainties and biases associated with nonlinear soil properties and the effects of uncertainty and bias on modeling dynamic soil response.  The workshop will be held during or before the Spring of 2004 at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) center in Richmond, CA. (peer.berkeley.edu).\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this workshop is the current uncertainties and biases in nonlinear soil-property measurements, and the potential impact of these issues on modeling dynamic soil response during seismic studies.  Conclusions reached by workshop participants will be used to identify whether a need exists for reducing current levels of uncertainty and bias associated with nonlinear soil-property testing, and if the need exists, the types of testing or modeling that will best achieve this reduction.  Approximately 40 geotechnical engineers will participate in the workshop, encompassing representatives from academia, public agencies and private practice.  Notification of the workshop will be via email lists and a workshop website.  After the workshop, the workshop website will contain the presentations and discussion summaries from the workshop.  The website will be maintained by the PEER Lifeline program for a 5-year period to allow quarterly posting of updates to the workshop.\r\n",
