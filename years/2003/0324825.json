 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear\r\nPhysics is to provide the international community of nuclear\r\nscientists with a unique forum in which the most recent developments\r\nand results in this field can be presented, extensively discussed\r\nand criticized.  A prime objective of this conference is to ensure\r\nthat discussions are conducted in a manner that will invite vigorous\r\nand open interactionsbetween scientists and provke new, and\r\nsometimes speculative, ideas for future research Generous time is\r\nallocated for such discussions and the site location and conference\r\nactivities successfully promote their occurrence. \r\n\r\nThe proposed goals require the participation of a signifcant number\r\nof the leaders in this field.  These include both internationall\r\nrecognized senior scientists from around the world and the young and\r\nrising stars.  The participation of younger scientists is essential\r\nto address the future manpowwer needs of this rapidly changing\r\nfield.  Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and\r\ngraduate students have been specially selected for participation in\r\nthis conference and encouraged to present their ideas.  Their\r\nparticipation in this conference provides them with unique and\r\nextensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new\r\nresearch opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the\r\nleadership roles they will assume in the future.\r\n\r\nThe conference will examine various topics of current interest in\r\nnuclear physics, including the role of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\r\nin heavy ion, hadronic electrono/muon, and neutrino physics.\r\n",
