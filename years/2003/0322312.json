Organized by Dr. Jeffrey Dean of the University of Georgia, the institute will involve approximately 30 students and 10 graduate/post-doc researchers from the U.S. and Latin America, and 12 lecturers from the USA, Brazil, Argentina, \r\nVenezuela, Chile and Uruguay. The PASI has two principal goals: 1) educate participants about the state-of-the-art in knowledge discovery as applied to genomic databases; and  \r\n2) improve networking approaches and applications of genomic data mining tools in \r\nagriculture and biosciences research.  Speakers, lecturers and hands-on workshops will emphasize leading edge developments across several fields that impinge on bioinformatics. Discussions will focus on the use of knowledge discovery technologies to elucidate patterns hidden in the vast stores of data being generated by high-throughput genomics techniques. Two case study workshops focused on structural genomic and gene expression databases will be used to demonstrate the application of concepts introduced in the courses. Up-to-date results on the PASI will be made available at http://fungen.botany.uga.edu/Projects/Pine/Pine.htm.   \r\n",
