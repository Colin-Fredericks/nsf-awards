 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is sponsoring a conference that focuses on the impact of the NSF Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Instruction (CCLI) Program. The overall theme of this conference is sharing, promoting, envisioning, and sustaining innovations in STEM undergraduate education. In terms of undergraduate STEM education the conference is designed to a) Broadly advertise important curricular improvements; b) Explore the role that the NSF CCLI Program has had in catalyzing curricular innovation; c) Facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of innovative curriculum ideas; d) Demonstrate effectiveness of curricular innovations; e) Foster interdisciplinary interest in emerging science fields; and, f) Engage the community in discussion of future priorities. \r\n\r\nFour hundred representatives from colleges and universities (including students), professional societies, government, media, foundations, and business are invited to participate. The overall outcome of this participatory conference is for participants to identify actions and strategies that they and others can take to expand and promote undergraduate curricular innovations. Development and implementation of the conference, including evaluation spans a 15-month period. The project evaluation captures actions that participants intend to take immediately after the conference. An online follow-up survey captures actions that participants are taking six months after the conference.  Products include proceedings disseminated in print and online and a short paper on ten ideas and how these ideas can be easily implemented in the undergraduate classroom or laboratory.\r\n",
