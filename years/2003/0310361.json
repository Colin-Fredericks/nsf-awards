 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropology (81) Pedagogical studies consistently show that hands-on data  collection and analysis leads to greater understanding of the methods and logic of science. At the same time, computer-based data acquisition and  analysis systems have grown more accessible for use in classroom instruction. Following recommendations for science education in anthropology (Bender and Smith, \"Teaching Archaeology in the 21rst  Century,\" Society for American Archaeology, 2000), and building on similar  programs at other institutions, this project combines these recent trends by integrating morphometric equipment and exercises into undergraduate instruction. Using these resources, students at all levels of instruction explore shape variation in anatomy and material culture to identify  patterns related to function, structure and development. Morphometric  workstations consisting of computers and associated measurement equipment  allow students to collect, analyze, and present data, improving their  understanding of the scientific process while developing skills in problem solving and professional presentation. The success of the program is being measured using a number of summative, formative, and independent evaluation instruments. Pre- and post-instruction examinations are used to evaluate student understanding and retention of basic principles of science and anthropology, and the SALGains instrument is being used to measure student self-reported learning gains and  satisfaction with the learning environment. The primary goal of this project is to introduce students to central issues in anthropology through the use of contemporary methods of data collection, analysis and presentation.  The broad goals are to contribute to a scientifically literate populace and to produce future generations of competent anthropological professionals.",
