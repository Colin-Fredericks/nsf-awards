The III-VI DMS Ga1-xMnxSe exhibits a strong red emission at 1.804 eV attributed to the Mn. GaSe itself is known for its remarkable nonlinear optical properties and is a promising material for photoelectronic applications. Ga1-xMnxS and In1-xMnxS will be investigated in detail followed by a study of Ga1-xMnxSe, In1-xMnxSe and a survey of Fe and Co based materials. Preliminary non-linear magnetization scaling analysis on Ga1-xMnxS strongly suggests there is a true spin-glass transition at 11 K. This important result would add a whole new class of spin-glass materials and raise interesting questions of the effect of spatial dimensionality on the spin-glass transition in this system. In terms of broader impacts, this project involves mentoring 3 undergraduate students each year. The research group currently includes 1 female and 1 Hispanic student (currently underrepresented groups in physics). This project also allows this undergraduate institution the honor of sharing a state-of-the-art SQUID magnetometer with research groups at two graduate and one undergraduate institutions.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\nThese new layered III-VI Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) systems complement the enormous progress made in systems based on other semiconductor hosts.  The III-VI DMS Ga1-xMnxSe exhibits a strong red emission attributed to the Mn.  GaSe itself is known for its remarkable nonlinear optical properties and is a promising material for photoelectronic applications.  Several III-VI DMS will be investigated to further explore the magnetic properties of this newest class of DMS based on the layered\r\nIII-VI semiconductor hosts.  In terms of broader impacts, this project involves mentoring 3 undergraduate students each year.  The research group currently includes 1 female and 1 Hispanic student (currently\r\nunderrepresented groups in physics).
