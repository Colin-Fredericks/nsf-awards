 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prepreg \r\nmaterial that, while maintaining the advantages of a powder towpreg system, will eliminate the use of high price, finely ground powders.  By generating fine particles in situ using aerosol formation from molten polymers two steps will be eliminated from the manufacturing process -- powder grinding and powder sintering, resulting in greatly reduced cost and complexity of the operation.\r\n\r\nCommercially, composite materials have an ever growing importance in the development of new technologies due to their inherent advantages over conventional materials.  These include better strength-to-weight ratios than most metals, extreme corrosion resistance, and novel processing techniques, which will allow a variety of shapes not achievable by conventional means.  However in many cases, the costs for fiber-reinforced composites is five to ten times higher than that of base metals like steel or aluminum. This project will make the composite  material considerably more cost competitive.\r\n",
