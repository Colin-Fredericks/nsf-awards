 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next 10-15 years, the core and access networks will evolve in different directions.\r\nThe core will evolve toward an all-optical system, while the access network will continue to\r\nexperience a proliferation of technologies and network types, tuned to the economics of specific\r\ndeployments and the requirements of users and applications. In particular, wireless technologies\r\nwill play an increasing role not only for mobile applications but as a cost-competitive substitute\r\nfor fixed wire access networks.\r\n\r\nThe researchers propose to develop a test bed focused on the access network, containing both wired and\r\nwireless components. It will act as a shared-facility test bed for research on connectivity, quality\r\nof service, security, reliability/availability, and network and traffic management for\r\nheterogeneous access networks. The test bed will also serve as a proof-of-concept test bed for\r\nwireless networks that exploit advanced flexible software defined radio devices, steerable\r\nantennas and upper millimeter wave point-to-point links to improve network performance under\r\nresource constraints.\r\n\r\nThere will be two main academic centers of activity (Stevens Institute of Technology, and\r\nUniversity of Colorado), supported by activities at one other institution, (University of Utah).\r\nThere will also be substantial participation from non-academic partners, including technology\r\ncompanies (Vanu, Inc., Lightpointe, and BBN). Use of the test bed by others will be solicited.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The access network is vitally important for service to the end user, yet\r\nfrequently neglected in studies that focus on the high-speed core or the wireless link in isolation.\r\nA test bed in this area will enable collaborative research on ways to exploit and manage multiple\r\nnetworks simultaneously for overall optimization, maintain connectivity as mobile devices roam,\r\nexploit one network to support another, and improve security. In the past networking research\r\nhas focused on layers 3 and higher, while wireless research has primarily looked at layers 1 and\r\n2. A critical aspect of this test bed is that it will support cross-layer integrated experiments all the\r\nway from layer 1 to layer 5, leading to future networks that can exploit physical layer flexibility,\r\napplication awareness, and advanced routing for overall better performance and service.\r\nThe hardware and software deployed in the test bed will be designed for easy modification\r\nand repeatable experiments at all layers. The team building the facility brings deep experience in\r\nthese modifiable systems: Dirk Grunwald (Colorado) with the Click modular router, John Chapin\r\n(Vanu, Inc.) with Vanu Software Radio, Jay Lepreau (Utah) with the Emulab software platform,\r\nCraig Partridge (BBN) with protocol software, and Igor Alexandrov (Stevens) with millimeter\r\nwave bands radio. The effort is led by Paul Kolodzy (Stevens), formerly of the FCC and\r\nDARPA, who brings a wide overview of access network issues.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed test bed will provide a major research facility, bringing\r\ntogether a community from all over the country to focus on the interrelated problems facing\r\naccess networks. In addition, novel educational approaches will be pursued where students will\r\nhave access to multiple advisors with key complementary expertise, and key industrial partners.\r\nA series of high profile workshops will facilitate research agenda setting and community\r\nformation. Tangible products will include widely disseminated research papers and a series of\r\nwhite papers aimed at non-specialists. Finally a series of demonstrations of the test bed will be\r\nconducted for the research and lay communities.\r\n\r\nProgress on the research problems of access networks will reduce the cost and increase the\r\nservice level provided to all users of the Internet, especially those in currently underserved\r\ncommunities. Additionally, devices and techniques that better handle heterogeneous wireless\r\nnetworks will improve the interoperability problems facing public safety and homeland security.",
