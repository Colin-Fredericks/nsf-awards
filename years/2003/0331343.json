Faulk\r\n\r\nThe Pioneers Symposium will explore the question \"What does it take to do Software Engineering research of enduring value?\" Of the many works published in Software Engineering over the past 25 years, relatively few of them remain important today. Those few works that continue to be worth reading have met the test of time, demonstrating lasting value to both researchers and practitioners in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneers' Symposium will provide a forum in which Software Engineering's next generation has the opportunity to learn from some of the field's preeminent contributors what it takes to recognize and to do work that exhibits this kind of lasting value. The Symposium is primarily targeted to graduate students and new faculty beginning their research or careers.  Funding under this proposal will be used to support attendance by students and faculty who, for economic reasons, might otherwise not be able to attend.\r\n",
