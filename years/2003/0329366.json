 "awd_abstract_narration": "The circadian clock is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that allows organisms to\r\ntemporally regulate gene expression and biological function. Organisms at all levels of\r\nbiological complexity, from prokaryotes to humans, temporally organize their cellular\r\nfunctions to allow them to capitalize on the environmental conditions (light, temperature)\r\nat any given time of day. Despite approximately 30 years of study on circadian\r\nphenomena, little is known about the fundamental mechanism of the circadian clock.\r\nHistorically, model systems in circadian biology have been limited to complex eukaryotic\r\norganisms. However, recently it was discovered that the single-celled photosynthetic\r\nprokaryote, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, has a circadian pacemaker comprised of\r\nthe products of at least three genes, kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC. The kai locus is expressed from\r\ntwo promoters, one upstream of kaiA (monocistronic message) and one upstream of kaiB\r\n(dicistronic kaiBC message), that are expressed in the same circadian phase in wild-type\r\ncells. Previous work has shown that KaiA is required for expression from the kaiBC\r\npromoter, and that overexpression of kaiA enhances expression from kaiBC, suggesting\r\nthat KaiA is a positive activator of the kaiBC promoter. KaiC is required for normal\r\nlevels of expression from its own promoter; however, overexpression of kaiC blocks\r\nexpression from kaiBC, suggesting a role in negative autoregulation. Although these data\r\nsuggest that there is transcriptional regulation at the kai locus promoters, there is no\r\ndirect evidence to suggest that KaiA or KaiC directly bind to kai promoters to regulate\r\ntranscription. Pervious work (funded by the NSF Fellowship for Microbial Biology)\r\nidentified a putative negative element within the kaiBC promoter region, whose presence\r\nis required for normal levels of KaiB production within the cyanobacterial cell. Studies\r\nproposed here aim to better define this negative element within the kaiBC promoter\r\nregion, and subsequently identify trans-acting factors involved in kaiBC expression.\r\nThe specific aims proposed here offer many opportunities that will contribute to\r\nthe development of a successful independent research laboratory in the field of\r\ncyanobacterial circadian biology at The University of St. Thomas (a comprehensive\r\nliberal arts co-educational undergraduate university). Results of the experiments proposed\r\nhere should advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which\r\ncyanobacteria tell time by identifying new components required for prokaryotic circadian\r\ntimekeeping, while at the same time offering undergraduate students at The University of\r\nSt. Thomas the opportunity to obtain invaluable training in microbial genetics and\r\nmolecular biology (using the cyanobacterial circadian clock as a model system) by\r\ngetting hands-on experience by directly addressing the questions proposed in this grant.\r\nIn addition, students will have the opportunity to study prokaryotic circadian biology in\r\nlight of mammalian circadian model systems. Dr. Dwight Nelson, Professor, Department\r\nof Biology, The University of St. Thomas, uses mice as a model system to study light\r\ninput into the circadian clock. St. Thomas students will have the opportunity to\r\ninvestigate the scientific question of how organisms tell time utilizing diverse model\r\nsystems. In addition, students will learn the importance of collaborative efforts between\r\nuniversities by working with Professor Susan S. Golden, Texas A&M University, to\r\nannotate the S. elongatus PCC 7942 genome.",
