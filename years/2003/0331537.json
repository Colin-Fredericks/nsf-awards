 "awd_abstract_narration": "California State University Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program, Phase III \r\nnitiated in 1994, the California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation \r\nProgram (CSU-LSAMP) is a comprehensive, statewide program dedicated to increasing the \r\nnumber of students from underrepresented minority groups (URM) graduating from campuses \r\nof the California State University (CSU) with baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, \r\nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The CSU-AMP Alliance includes 47 public \r\npostsecondary institutions: 19 CSU campuses plus 28 California Community Colleges (CCC).  \r\n \r\nWith past NSF support, CSU-LSAMP contributed substantially to broadening participation of \r\nunderrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.  If the annual number of STEM degrees awarded \r\nto URM students had remained at the 1993 pre-CSU-LSAMP baseline of 750, the total number \r\nof degrees awarded between 1994-95 and 2001-02 would have been 6000.  Instead, a total of \r\n11,601 degrees were awarded over the past eight-year period, an increase of 5,601 URM-\r\nSTEM degrees. The potential for CSU-LSAMP to further increase overall participation of URM \r\nstudents in STEM is strengthened by projections for changes in the number and proportion of \r\nURM students graduating from California public high schools.  In Phase III, CSU-LSAMP \r\nproposes to engage approximately 2,000 URM students/year in activities that sustain or further \r\nimprove individual student retention and progression rates achieved during Phase I and Phase \r\nII, and proposes to increase the number of URM-STEM degrees awarded from the 2001-2002 \r\nlevel of 1,485 to 2,528 in 2007-2008.  Hence, the CSU-LSAMP goal is to award over 1,000 \r\nmore STEM baccalaureate degrees to URM students by the end of the project period.   \r\n \r\nSince California Community Colleges enroll approximately 63% of college-going students in \r\nCalifornia, partnership activities that improve transfer rates are critical to achieving the degree \r\nproduction goal.  Therefore, during Phase III, CSU-LSAMP will complete construction of \r\n.bridges. between CSU and CCC partners that facilitate student advancement through this \r\ncritical decision point.  Since many of the strategies initiated in Phase I and Phase II for lower \r\ndivision students have already been institutionalized, CSU-LSAMP will also introduce activities \r\nin Phase III that are designed to enhance graduate school preparedness of upper division \r\nstudents with the goal of improving aggregate student progression to STEM graduate programs.   \r\n \r\nPhase III activities provided by each CSU campus will focus on four common objectives: (1) \r\nincreasing transfer rates of URM students from the community colleges to STEM majors in the \r\nCSU;  (2) enhancing first and second year retention rates and overall academic performance of \r\nURM students in STEM majors to levels comparable to levels for non-URM students; (3) \r\nenhancing performance of URM students in math and science courses; and (4) increasing the \r\nnumber of URM students interested in pursuing graduate study in STEM disciplines, and \r\nenhancing graduate school preparedness of upper division URM-STEM students.  \r\n \r\nThe types of activities that will be offered to support each objective have consistently been \r\nshown to facilitate retention and progression of URM students in STEM, and represent a set of \r\nwell-established .best practices. for accomplishing the objectives. These activities include:  \r\ncourse articulation between CSU and community colleges; individual transfer agreements with \r\ncommunity college students; advising/orientation programs; peer mentoring; faculty mentoring; \r\nintensive summer or academic year programs designed to prepare students to excel in calculus \r\ncourses; supplemental academic year workshops designed to enhance performance in specific \r\nmath and science courses; graduate information workshops; AY or summer internships and \r\nresearch experiences; GRE preparation workshops; participation in scientific and professional \r\nconferences;  interactions with other URM-STEM serving programs; and Interactions with URM-\r\nSTEM serving prog ms at Ph.D. granting institutions.",
