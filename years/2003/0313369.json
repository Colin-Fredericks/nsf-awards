 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple tools will be required to understand the function of the 26,000 genes of the model plant Arabidopsis. Discovering induced or natural variation in DNA sequences of interest greatly facilitates the analysis of each gene. The Arabidopsis TILLING Project (ATP) discovers, sequences and delivers mutations and polymorphisms (natural variations) in target genes ordered by Arabidopsis researchers. For each target locus ATP provides mutations using TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes), a reverse genetics method that discovers induced point mutations in populations of chemically mutagenized individuals. The broad range of mutations possible by chemical mutagenesis can impair a gene with different severity, thus providing an allelic series useful in understanding function. In addition, for each target locus ATP queries 50 standard accessions for natural polymorphisms (Ecotilling). Natural variants will thus be available for phenotypic characterization. The first objective is to TILL and ecotill 180 genes per year. Orders can be entered by the public at the ATP site (http://tilling.fhcrc.org:9366/). The second objective is to provide to undergraduate students an Arabidopsis-based educational tool on genomic research. An education link will be posted at the ATP site and will provide guided opportunities to explore gene function. Deliverables include TILLING lines, mutations and polymorphisms, all available for search and ordering at the TAIR Arabidpsis database site (www.arabidopsis.org, see \"stocks\", \"sequence viewer\" and \"allele/polymorphisms\"). The service provided by ATP will supplement the existing reverse genetics tools by providing an important additional technology, thus facilitating the Arabidopsis 2010 objective to understand the function of each gene. \r\nBroader impact\r\nIn addition to enriching the teaching of the PIs and providing training opportunity for undergraduates at the University of Washington, this project has a specific plan to involve undergradues in 4-year institutions. In collaboration with instructors from four-year universities we are developing exercises for undergraduate teaching in which the relationship of candidate genes to selected phenotypes will be assessed by students using the genotyping and targeted mutations resources of ATP. The genomic resources developed over the past decade in Arabidopsis will be integrated into these exercises. Therefore, ATP will provide a conduit through which undergraduate students in small four-year institutions can participate in postgenomic research.\r\n\r\n",
