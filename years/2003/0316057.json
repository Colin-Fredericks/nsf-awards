 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Nathaniel Finney of the University of California- San Diego will perform research that will provide a simple, sensitive method for detecting triacetone triperoxide  (TATP), an explosive that is the overwhelming favorite of terrorists. TATP is very easy to make, but difficult to detect. Beyond its urgency, the proposal also represents a new approach to detecting explosives in which the oxidizing nature of the explosive is exploited for detection. It is possible that other important explosives such as metal perchlorates could be detected in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professor Nathaniel Finney whose research effort will help detect the single most commonly used explosive used by terrorists. The proposal outlines a novel approach to rapid detection of triacetone peroxide, which is about 80% as powerful as trinitro toluene (TNT) and is unique in many respects. It has extraordinary availability, widespread use, and is difficult to detect. Current methods of detection are limited to sensitive but cumbersome, expensive and slow direct analysis, or less sensitive but cheaper direct analysis. The simplicity of Professor Finney's method will make it an excellent preliminary \"threat/no threat\" screen for TATP on people or in packages and luggage.\r\n",
