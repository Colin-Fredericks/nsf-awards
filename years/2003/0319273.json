The Congress is one of the largest international meetings for entomologists from a broad range of disciplines with 19 subject areas that range from the classification and evolution of insects, evolution of behavior, functional genomics, and both biological and chemical insect control. Funds for travel, accommodation and registration will be distributed through a competitive process to be administered by ESA.\r\n\r\nApplications for the grants will be solicited through Society email notices, the ESA Website and Newsletter, and related societies and list serves. Competition will be open to all applicants who are U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, or foreign citizens working or studying at U.S. institutions; membership in ESA is not a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this grant is to promote young scientists, whose careers will benefit the most from the international exposure. Students and postdoctoral fellows will be given the highest consideration for awards, and awards will be available for all scientific sections within ESA. The Congress will be a great opportunity for maximizing awardees exposure to international researchers and a variety of new research methods and programs. In this time of limited funds at all levels of scientific support, it is especially critical that the ESA seek support to ensure that the next generation of U.S. scientists participates actively in the international entomological community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
