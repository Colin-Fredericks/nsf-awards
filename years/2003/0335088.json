 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed Workshop\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to enhance the cooperation among various control\r\ngroups and high school students of mathematics and science throughout the United States\r\nand the world, to give attention to control and systems ideas and technology, and to\r\nincrease the general awareness of the importance of control and systems technology and\r\nits cross-disciplinary nature among high school teachers and students.\r\nControl and Systems Science occurs in many different disciplines and its applications\r\noccur in a wide variety of technologies. It involves a variety of tasks, such as, modeling,\r\nidentification, simulation, planning, decision-making, and optimization.\r\nSome application areas of control and systems include transportation, manufacturing,\r\ncommunications, processing industries, and financial markets. The basic control systems\r\nscience influences and impacts a diverse range of study, such as, biology, physics,\r\nchemistry, economics, and medicine.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed Workshop:\r\nThe need of modern industry for well-trained systems scientists is growing and changing,\r\ndue to the marketplace pressures and the advances in technology. Future generations of\r\nour students will have to be broadly educated to cope with cross-disciplinary applications\r\nand rapidly changing technology. The backgrounds of our students are changing too.\r\nThey are better prepared to work with modern computing technologies. Thus the time is\r\nripe for major renovations in mathematics and science education in high school. It is\r\nimportant to develop a cross-disciplinary set of examples, demonstrations and laboratory\r\nexercises that illustrate systems and control across the entire spectrum of mathematics\r\nand science. We will share with high school teachers our successful control stories,\r\nexisting tools and experiments. There is much to be gained by the sharing of educational\r\nexperiences and practices.",
