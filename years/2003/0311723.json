A vulnerability exists when a system meets certain\r\nconditions, the precise conditions dictating the nature of the\r\nvulnerability. The classification scheme will be based upon these\r\nconditions. The goal of this research is to: (1) determine\r\nwhether every vulnerability has a unique, minimally-sized set\r\nof such conditions; (2) determine whether vulnerabilities share\r\nthese conditions; and (3) determine whether, for a large enough\r\nset of vulnerabilities, the number of conditions is less than\r\nthe number of vulnerabilities. The methodology will be to\r\nexamine vulnerabilities in open source systems and programs, and\r\ndetermine the exact conditions under which a vulnerability\r\ncan be exploited. The expression of the conditions will be refined\r\niteratively, as more is learned about the conditions needed to\r\nexploit vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this work is that it will lead to a deeper\r\nunderstanding of why vulnerabilities occur in systems, how to\r\ndetect them, and how to prevent them. Its broader impact is that,\r\nif the hypotheses are true, negating conditions on a system could\r\neliminate vulnerabilities not known at the time. Vendors and\r\nsecurity analysts would be able to use the approach we will develop\r\nto test systems for vulnerabilities more readily than the current,\r\nhit-and-miss methods. Finally, this work would provide a\r\nmore rigorous basis for developing and teaching methods of\r\nwriting programs with fewer vulnerabilities than occur now.\r\n",
