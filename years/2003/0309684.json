 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eichinger\r\n0309684\r\nThe working hypothesis of this research is that evaporation at the \r\nearth-atmosphere interface is always maximized, given radiative energy input \r\nin a particular environment. Under the hypothesis, evaporation is uniquely \r\ndetermined as a result of an optimization exercise in terms of surface \r\ntemperature, surface soil moisture and sensible heat flux (a measure of \r\nturbulent transport) given an energy input.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits:\r\n\r\nThe ideas presented here will allow the independent verification of models, \r\nwill lead to improved parameterization of surface hydrology and, more \r\nimportantly, will provide a framework in which the sensitivity of land \r\nevaporation to changes in radiation, earth surface properties etc. could be \r\nevaluated independently of the traditional empirical models. The research \r\nstrategy includes: 1. further theoretical and empirical study to include \r\nthe dependence of long wave radiation on surface temperature; 2. show \r\nthe lack of sensitivity of evaporation to atmospheric moisture; 3. carry \r\nout field work to test the concepts with more appropriate data sets over bare \r\nsoils; 4. investigate the validity of existing evaporation models; 5. initiate the \r\nextension of the concepts to vegetated surfaces.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThis work represents a broad interdisciplinary collaboration between \r\nhydrologists and ecologists with theoretical and experimental expertise. The \r\nwork supports unique experimental infrastructure at the University of Iowa. \r\nUndergraduate students will have the opportunities to do theoretical and field \r\nwork. Several graduate students will get their masters/doctoral degrees based \r\non their work in this proposal. All students will be encouraged and financed \r\nto present findings in professional meetings. All work will be published in \r\nthe refereed literature in a timely manner. This proposal is being submitted \r\nunder the umbrella of the new MIT Earth System Initiative. This research and \r\neducational effort is intended to promote the understanding of the ``body \r\nearth'' in order to define the appropriate science to develop sound \r\nsustainability policies. The Principal Investigator is one of the leaders of \r\nthis initiative, a member of its executive council, and teaches one of the \r\nrequire courses under the initiative's freshman core alternative program: \r\nTerrascope.\r\n",
