The related\r\nvariations in density and rheology have important consequences for mantle\r\ndynamics and mantle mixing. Our main hypothesis is that the formation and\r\nrecycling of oceanic crust can explain a vast proportion of the geochemical\r\nobservations. The central goal of this project is to study the role that\r\ncompositional density plays in preserving geochemical heterogeneity.\r\nAs part of the investigators' hypothesis testing approach they will \r\naddress following questions:\r\n   1) How does the recycling of oceanic crust affect mantle chemistry?\r\n   2) What are the relationships between noble gas and lithophile \r\nisotope ratios?\r\n   3) Is it possible that the large-scale differentiation during Earth's\r\nformation accounts for the presently observed heterogeneity?\r\n     The team will use a combination of geodynamical and geochemical modeling to\r\nanswer these questions. This provides an excellent tool to test conceptual\r\nideas by quantifying the effects of mantle mixing, fractionation,\r\ndifferentiation, and degassing. The approach is based on previously established\r\ncollaboration between Van Keken, Ballentine and Hauri. Previous models will be\r\nimproved by the modeling of oceanic crust formation, incorporation of\r\nlithophile isotopes, and significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution.\r\nVan Keken and a graduate student will be responsible for the model improvements\r\nand dynamical computations, while Hauri and Ballentine will guide the \r\nhypothesis testing approach and aid the geochemical modeling. The collaborative \r\naspects are an essential component of this proposal.\r\n     This project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that are\r\nresponsible for the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. It will aid\r\nin the development of essential dynamical modeling tools and provide\r\ncross-disciplinary integration, international collaboration, and education\r\nof students in quantitative geophysics and geochemistry.\r\n",
