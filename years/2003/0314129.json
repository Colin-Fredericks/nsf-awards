The second objective is to continue the \r\nstudy of advanced WKB methods for one-dimensional Schroedinger \r\noperators, using the tools of harmonic analysis. WKB methods \r\nare a classical part of quantum mechanics, and their main \r\ngoal is to find a good approximation for the wave function of \r\nthe system under certain natural assumptions. This project will \r\npursue the development of new WKB-type techniques, which can be \r\napplied to obtain information about dynamics of a class of \r\nSchroedinger operators.  Extensions to higher dimensions \r\nwill also be sought.   \r\n\r\nThe spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger operators \r\nis the cornerstone of Quantum Mechanics. This theory describes \r\nthe laws which govern behavior of the quantum particles, such \r\nas electrons, atoms and molecules. Much of the fundamental\r\nscientific knowledge about many important physical processes \r\n(such as, for example, chemical reactions or conduction \r\nproperties of various materials) comes from the theory of \r\nSchroedinger operators. This project focuses on the development \r\nof new methods in spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger \r\noperators which may allow a new approach to some long-standing \r\nproblems in Quantum Mechanics. These problems concern, in \r\nparticular, the conductance properties of materials with \r\nimpurities and of quasicrystals, and have direct applications \r\nto modern engineering devices, wave guides and transistors to \r\nname two. The project will also involve development of a modern\r\nmathematical methods curriculum for undergraduate students \r\nmajoring in biology and chemistry. Given rapidly evolving \r\ninterface between mathematics  and these sciences, a new set \r\nof ideas and material needs to be incorporated into such \r\nservice courses. In addition, graduate courses  will be \r\ndeveloped with the main objective to help beginning graduate\r\nstudents make a transition to independent research. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
