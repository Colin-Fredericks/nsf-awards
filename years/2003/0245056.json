 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate a n mber of topics,including:\r\nHard Pion Electroproduction. We will calculate high transverse momentum semi-exclusive\r\npion electroproduction,considering especially the higher twist process where the pions are pro-\r\nduced directly and appear kinematically isolated,but including leading twist (where the pions\r\nare produced by parton fragmentation and appear as part of a jet)and estimates of soft pro-\r\ncesses.The direct and leading twist processes allow data to yield information about the quark\r\nand gluon distributions in the target.Two particular new items are to do electroproduction\r\nrather than photoproduction and to include initial state parton transverse momentum.An ap-\r\nplication is to see if the higher twist process are relevant to data from HERMES,and possibly\r\nHall B data from Je .erson Lab,where there is considerable interest in the result.\r\nDipions and the Polarization of Gluons. HERMES has measured dipions photoproduced\r\nwith polarized photons o .polarized targets,which has given the .rst determination of the po-\r\nlarization of gluons in the proton.The published result depends heavily upon the theoretical\r\nanalysis,in turn heavily based on program packages that are tuned to higher energies.We\r\npropose what we believe is a necessary independent calculation the contributions of the vari-\r\nous processes (photon-gluon fusion,QCD Compton,and vector meson dominance (VMD)),in\r\nparticular to see the sensitivity of the results to di .ering fragmentation models,initial state\r\ntransverse momentum,and di .ering estimates of the VMD contribution.\r\nThe Deuteron Form Factor. The only perturbative QCD calculation of the asymptotic\r\ndeuteron form factor lies well below the data,but strikingly omits the short range wave functions\r\nthat provide for hidden color states.We have recently developed ways to manipulate 6-quark\r\ncluster wave functions that model these components.We propose to calculate the asymptotic\r\nform factor with wave functions including a hidden color component,to see the e .ect of the\r\nhidden color components upon the magnitude of the result.\r\nBringing Perturbative QCD to Lower Momentum Transfers. We will study formal and\r\napplied aspects of relations between the Breit and light-front helicity amplitudes,next-to-leading\r\npower corrections to the high momentum transfer behavior of those amplitudes,and application\r\nof discrete symmetries to light-front amplitudes.The formal results can allow s,for example,to\r\n.nd constraints that approximations to the subdominant helicity amplitudes must obey (which\r\nare not always realized in the literature).More positively,we can se the formal results to guide\r\ninvestigation of how non-leading powers can be parameterized and see,again for example,how\r\nand where the N .(1232)transition may approach the perturbative QCD results.\r\nPhenomenology of Noncommutative Field Theory. Following up on an earlier research\r\npath,we would like to complete the set of Feynman rules for the Lorentz conserving noncom-\r\nmutative .eld theory and .nd the signatures of noncommutative spacetime for a selection of\r\nprocesses in addition to fAfA elastic scattering.Also we would like to consider ways to do Lorentz\r\nconserving noncommutative .eld theory with operator algebras in addition to the contracted\r\nSnyder algebra we have worked out so far.\r\nNSF Review Criteria. Intellectual merit of the proposed activity:Most of the activity is at\r\nthe forefront of modern hadronic physics,and the rest is at the forefront of the phenomenology\r\nof an interesting direction in particle physics.The projects will lead to many publications\r\nin the leading refereed journals.Broader impacts of the proposed activity:The projects will\r\nhelp bridge the gap between hadronic theory and observed phenomena,and lead to greater\r\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of hadronic reactions.They will also train new students,\r\nincluding undergraduates.The PI has had two successful women Ph.D.students,and the\r\npresent project may extend opportunities for women entering the .eld.The PI is regularly at\r\nthe Je .erson Laboratory and bridging the gap between university and national lab as well as\r\nbetween data and theory.",
