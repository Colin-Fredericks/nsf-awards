 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is aimed at analyzing mathematical models for liquid \r\ncrystalline and superconducting materials focusing on the electro-magnetic,\r\nelectromechanical, and electro-optical interactions that take place within\r\nthem.  Mathematical models for superconducting materials to be analyzed\r\nare based on the Ginzburg-Landau energy, and the project will include an\r\ninvestigation of the qualitative behavior of mathematical solutions which \r\nare important for applications such as high-temperature, anisotropic \r\nsuperconducting materials, in the presence of applied electric and magnetic \r\nfields.  Mathematical models for liquid crystals to be analyzed are based on \r\nDe Gennes' models incorporating the Oseen-Frank energy terms as well as\r\nterms accounting for smectic layering (present in chiral materials),\r\nelasticity, and the influence of applied electric and\r\nmagnetic fields.  A hierarchy of problems will be studied incorporating\r\nmore and more complex nonlinear interactions.  Special emphasis will be \r\ngiven to the analysis of scaling up from meso-scale models where the\r\nphysics is described to macro-scale models used in applications.  Techniques\r\nfrom mathematical modeling, partial differential equations, and finite\r\nelasticity will be employed.  \r\n\r\nThe project will result in a better understanding of the responses of\r\nhigh-temperature superconducting materials and liquid crystalline\r\nmaterials to applied magnetic and electric fields based on their microscopic \r\nstructure.  Applications will include the design of appropriate superconductors\r\nfor power transmission and the creation of powerful magnetic fields.  \r\nApplications of the liquid crystal research include the design of smaller, \r\nfaster, and more accurate optical switches, nanoscale electro-mechanical\r\ndevices, and liquid crystal displays.   \r\n \r\n\r\n",
