 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Chemical Society has partnered over the past several years with NSF, EPA, and other federal funding agencies to support an annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference. The topic of this meeting focuses on the design, development, and implementation of chemical processes and products that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances in a way that is both feasible and economically viable.  Green chemistry and engineering are important tools in preventing pollution at the source and in providing solutions to long-term global challenges.\r\nStudent scholarships will be provided by this NSF funding for participation in the 7th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering conference on June 23-26, 2003 at the National Academies in Washington, DC.  The theme of this year's meeting is \"Green Chemistry and Engineering:  Integrating Sustainability, Safety, and Security\":  the role of green chemistry and engineering in achieving a safe, secure, and sustainable chemical industry and society will be emphasized.  Technical and policy experts will discuss green chemistry and engineering in the context of accident prevention, sustainability, and chemical site security.  The conference will feature plenary speakers, expert panelists from industry, government, and academia, and paper/poster presentations. Technical talks will be given in such areas as alternative solvents, catalysis, and benign synthesis and processing.  The environmental, economic, and social benefits of greener technologies will be addressed, particularly as they relate to this year's specific theme.\r\nA diverse group of students from geographical locations across the United States has received scholarships through NSF funding to attend these meetings.  Over 80% of the students have been involved in oral or poster presentations.  Students have an excellent opportunity to learn about the newest research developments in their areas, dialog with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers, and advance their participation in professional societies.\r\n",
