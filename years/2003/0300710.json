 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to address one of the most profound questions in theoretical physics today, that of the microscopic structure of space-time.  The research explores theoretical and observational issues at the interface between known physics and the unknown realm of\r\nquantum gravity.  It draws on lessons and insights from a number of fields of physics, and may in turn contribute to those fields. It thus has significant interdisciplinary aspects, involving the areas of gravitation, quantum field theory in curved spacetime,  nonequilibrium quantum field theory,  cosmology, high energy astrophysics,  atom optics, and condensed matter physics.\r\n\r\nThis research will help guide observational investigations from the origin of structure in the early universe to the gravitational wave emission from distant black holes.  It will probe for the limits of relativity theory and extract new constraints on fundamental physics from the properties of high energy radiation in the universe, and it will develop connections between the physics of ultra-low\r\ntemperature condensed matter and quantum fields in curved spacetime. This research activity is an integral part of the education of  graduate students training them on topics related to gravitation, quantum fields, statistical mechanics and problems of the early universe and black holes. The research results will also be assimilated into undergraduate and graduate teachings in the form of college courses, independent studies, and popular or semi-popular lectures given by the PIs and their associates and students.",
