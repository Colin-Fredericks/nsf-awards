 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unprecedented explosion in the volume of readily accessible data in \r\nrecent years, although highly desirable, comes at a heavy price - it is now \r\nconsiderably more difficult to locate the answer to a specific question, or to \r\nfind patterns and correlations that are central to a phenomenon. The PI's \r\npropose to study general-purpose clustering as a solution to the problem of \r\nlocating relevant information and organizing it in an intelligible way. \r\n\r\nThe proposal falls into two tracks. The first track is to develop measures \r\nand criteria that accurately re the quality of a clustering. The PI's have \r\ninitiated work in this direction, and plan to build a theory of clustering criteria firmly grounded in the intuition of practitioners. \r\n\r\nThe second track is the design of efficient algorithms to find near-optimal \r\nclustering under the right measures. The PI's propose to develop algorithms \r\nbased on the so-called \"spectral methods\" and other techniques. They plan \r\nto make them efficient by the use of random (non-uniform) sampling. The \r\nPI's also plan to implement some of the algorithms and empirically evaluate \r\nthem. \r\n\r\nThe PI's propose to ensure that any positive impact from their research \r\nis maximized by (a) widely disseminating the results via conferences and \r\nalso by inviting other researchers to discuss the ideas, (b) by making the \r\npreliminary implementations of clustering algorithms available.\r\n",
