Colorado Boulder\r\nProposal Number: EIA - 0244168\r\nPI:  Shivakant Mishra\r\nTitle:  REU Site - Research Experience for Undergraduate Students in Cybersecurity\r\n\r\nThis project establishes an REU site focusing on research experiences for undergraduate students in the area of cybersecurity and infrastructure protection.  The site is administered by faculty members and researchers from the Computer Science, Telecommunications, and ATLAS (Alliance for Technology Learning and Society) departments at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Computer Information Sciences Department at the Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL.\r\n\r\nThe REU site involves 10 undergraduate students in cybersecurity-related research for\r\nten weeks during summer. The site has a specified evaluation plan.  The site addresses the current shortage of cybersecurity professionals. The project establishes mechanisms to increase the participation of underrepresented groups via collaboration and active interactions with minority institutions (Florida A&M University, Dillard University, and University of Houston-Downtown) and EPSCOR institutions (University of Nevada at Reno and University of Wyoming at Laramie).\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
