Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to conduct 3 years of internationally cooperative research on a series of exceptionally well-preserved fossil birds from Northwestern China.  The core of this project is a collection of 125 million-year-old fossils belonging to a group of extinct flying birds, the Enantiornithes, which represents one of the most primitive chapters of the evolution of birds. In spite of their significance, these ancient fossils have remained superficially studied and their evolutionary relationships poorly understood.  The purpose of this research grant is to describe the anatomy of these fossils and to use this information to clarify their evolutionary interrelationships. This project will produce knowledge about the early history of birds and the evolutionary transformations that ultimately led to the unique physical characteristics of modern birds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will have a significant impact on the professional development of two junior Chinese scientists, who will conduct 3-month internships at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and will strengthen the cooperation between US and Chinese institutions. In addition, through popular articles and media coverage, the important scientific knowledge contained in these fossils will be conveyed to the public.\r\n",
