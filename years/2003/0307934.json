This research is making improvements in the scientific community's understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior. The group is carrying out tasks which will provide essential information about the sun which could not be obtained without the use of the sun's high-degree pulsations. This research will provide new knowledge of the stratification, thermodynamics, and rotational shear flows in the upper turbulent convective boundary layer and variations of these properties with time.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will have a broad impact in education, in infrastructure support, and in public outreach through the training and support of both a graduate student and an undergraduate student in observational helioseismology. The P.I. has an established track record of training undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and high school students and teachers in solar physics by having the students and teachers join his research group both on the University of Southern California campus and at the Mount Wilson Observatory. He also presents regular public lectures, and serves on the Steering Committee of the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program and has served as a faculty mentor for both African-American and Hispanic students. Other members of the team from the Stanford Solar Physics Group have a major on-going effort in Public Outreach activities. The results from the research will be summarized on the Stanford MDI Website. The research  also facilitates the collaboration of three major universities, the Technical University of Munich, the University of Southern California, and Stanford.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
