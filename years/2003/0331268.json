 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. This symposium on solid state chemistry is entitled The Chemistry of Intermetallics and Zintl Phases. The goal of this ACS meeting is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in advancing  solid-state chemistry areas related to the synthesis, characterization and applications of intermetallic and Zintl phases. The NSF funds will be used to defray the expenses of students, post-docs, and junior faculty attending the symposium.\r\n%%% \r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have a direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by training students to design, synthesize, characterize, and fabricate intermetallic and Zintl compounds as device materials relevant to advancing thermoelectric, magnetic, and electronic technologies.\r\n***  \r\n",
