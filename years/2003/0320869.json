 "awd_abstract_narration": "This major research instrumentation (MRI) grant is submitted within the framework of\r\nthe Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program. The mission of this RUI\r\nsubmission is the establishment of a Centralized Laboratory of Imaging and\r\nMetrology (CLIM) at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The instrumentation\r\nrequested includes a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray\r\n(EDX) capability and a C-Mode Scanning Acoustic Microscope that would greatly\r\nenhance RIT's ability to conduct competitive undergraduate research.\r\nIntellectual Merit: CLIM will build upon RIT's existing strengths in Semiconductor and\r\nMicrosystems fabrication and packaging to bridge the applied research gap between basic\r\nresearch and product commercialization. The impact of the proposed research\r\ninstrumentation will be in the establishment of a strong research base for investigators\r\nand undergraduates. A major component of the investigators vision involves\r\nestablishing the undergraduate research infrastructure required to (i) publish in refereed\r\njournals by undergraduates, (ii) enhance RIT's credibility to funding agencies to secure\r\nfunding for undergraduate research, and (iii) provide a superior environment for\r\nundergraduate education.\r\nVarious examples of research activity enabled by this equipment listed in the Project\r\nDescription section of this proposal include: photonic lightwave integrated circuits\r\nfabrication, wafer bonding, microfluidic package analysis, packaging yield analysis, and\r\nSilicon on Insulator substrate characterization. These diverse efforts share a common\r\nneed to characterize (i) material properties, (ii) process development, and (iii) failure\r\nmechanisms. Nondestructive structural, and chemical analysis and nanometer-scale\r\nimaging capability is fundamental to the success of the proposed research initiatives. The\r\nscanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, and a C-Mode Scanning Acoustic\r\nMicroscope enable imaging, chemical analysis, and structural analysis, respectively.\r\nBroader Impact: In the first year of this program alone, it is estimated that through\r\nprojects, classroom instruction, and research, 150 students will benefit from this\r\ninstrumentation. This equipment will be introduced immediately, as a centerpiece to\r\nseveral classes, which include the following: EMCR 201 (Introduction to Microelectronic\r\nEngineering), EMCR 221 (Introduction to Microlithography), EMCR 350 (IC\r\nTechnology), EMCR 564 (Microlithography Systems), EMCR 643 (Thin Film\r\nProcessing), EMCR 650 (IC Processing Laboratory), EMCR 680/690 (Senior Seminar\r\nResearch), ITFF 455 (Introduction to Surface Mount Electronics Packaging), ITFF 456\r\n(Advanced Concepts in Electronics Packaging), and ITFF 457 (Electronics Packaging\r\nLaboratory).\r\nThe research will be conducted by three faculty from RIT (S. L. Rommel-Microelectronic\r\nEngineering, A.D. Raisanen-Semiconductor Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory, and\r\nS.M. Ramkumar- Manufacturing Mechanical Engineering Technology and Packaging\r\nScience) in the area of materials, process and failure characterization of microsystems\r\ndevelopment and packaging. This project will foster collaboration between device and\r\npackaging researchers at RIT to realize next-generation, high-performance microsystems.",
