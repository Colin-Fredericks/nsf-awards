 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, Connie Stelly, Saundra McGuire, Su-Seng Pang, Gregory Vincent, and Isiah Warner of LSU will lead the establishment of the Louisiana State University Research Scholars Program (LA-STEM).  LA-STEM is a strategically planned, cooperative, comprehensive activity that will put in place at LSU a system that will increase the numbers of minority students - primarily African Americans - who obtain undergraduate degrees in science, engineering, and mathematics, and who go on to graduate degrees in these fields.  The LA-STEM strategy is to (1) identify pre-college (high school) students with high potential for achievement and recruit them for the program; (2) facilitate the development of these students' necessary skills and competencies in addition to their undergraduate education in a STEM discipline that will (3) prepare these students to go on to earn graduate degrees in their STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nModeled after the widely-acclaimed University of Maryland - Baltimore County 'Meyerhoff Scholars Program,' LA-STEM is projected to reach ~ 115 students in the initial five-year period of the activity through a disciplined combination of 'innovative intervention activities' including:\r\nA Summer Bridge Program prior to the freshman fall semester;\r\nAssociation with a faculty mentor upon acceptance into the program;\r\nPeer advising and counseling along with academic program advising and counseling;\r\nMonthly social and informational sessions; \r\nA sustained On-Campus Academic Year Internship/Research Experience beginning the fall semester of the freshman year;\r\nIntensive On- and Off-Campus Summer Internships/Research Experiences;\r\nProfessional Conference Participations and Presentations;\r\nTutoring and Workshops for instruction in essential skills for academic and personal success;\r\nCommunication Skills Instruction that will help to develop a positive self-concept and increased self-confidence;\r\nInstruction in applying Study Skills and Personal Skills for the successful completion of the undergraduate program;\r\nCoaching for the successful Admittance to Graduate Programs across the country through Graduate Preparation Workshops (application and interview process, test preparation, etc.); and \r\nCareer Planning Workshops.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that outcomes of the LA-STEM project will guide further diversification of undergraduate STEM majors.\r\n\r\n",
