 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is reaching a major milestone, its 25th anniversary.  Created in 1977, NEHRP is comprised of four agencies - the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology - that have complementary roles in furthering earthquake research and application in the nation.  This workshop is being organized by the National Academies through its Natural Disasters Roundtable, which provides a venue for researchers and policy makers to discuss key issues related to disaster reduction and preparedness.  The focus of the one- day workshop, which will be held on February 20, 2003, will be on the accomplishments of the multi-agency program since its inception and future challenges.  The workshop will be open to the public, and participants will be drawn from the research and practitioner communities.  A summary of the meeting will be made available to the public through the National Academies web site.",
