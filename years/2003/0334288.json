 "awd_abstract_narration": "0334288  Peirce  CLEANER (Collaborative Large-scale Environmental Analysis Network (EAN) for\r\nEnvironmental Research) discussions proposed during this workshop will address gaps in fundamental scientific knowledge and engineering approaches associated with different networking approaches and geographically large environmental issues within the water, air, and soil domains as well as issues that exist across these domains: sources, engineering controls, multimedia transport and transformation, and effects. Thus the CLEANER approach with its focus on a network (EAN) is justified by the need to address similar environmental issues of broad geographical scale evolving scientific and engineering complexity where current fundamental knowledge and models are lacking and cyberinfrastructural supports are not available. Thus the objectives of this workshop are to: (1) increase the understanding of how CLEANER concepts can be implemented using an EAN in environmentally stressed areas; (2) extend environmental scientific and engineering knowledge within the Neuse Basin case study; and,  (3) contribute to the research, teaching, and mentoring activities of individual participants.\r\nThis workshop will build on the accomplishments of three previous CLEANER workshops. As a group the proposed co-chairs have contributed to these previous workshops in leadership roles, conducted research in the study of water, air, and soil pollution interrelationships and control, and developed and applied new networks and cyberinfrastructures to emerging problem areas: (1) Co-Chair: Prof. Jeff Peirce of Duke University co-hosted NSF CLEANER Workshop III in February 2003 and was a leader of the groundwater breakout session at Workshop 2 in October 2002; (2) Co-Chair: Prof. Ken Reckhow of Duke University and Director of the Water Resources Research Institute at NC State University co-chaired Workshop III; and, (3) Co-Chair: Dr. Tom Prudhomme of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois participated in Workshops II and III and is an expert in networks and cyberinfrastructures and their applications to emerging problem areas.\r\nThe workshop will be organized into three phases of activities: (1) prior to the workshop participants will be provided working papers that discuss different CLEANER approaches as well as water, air and soil quality data from the Neuse River Basin compiled by the Co-Chairs; (2) during the workshop large and small group discussions will be structured around the proposed agenda items and draft reports will be written; and, (3) after the workshop the information will be disseminated to all participants and to NSF. Participants with an understanding of the problems in the Neuse River Basin, networks and cyberinfrastructures, as well as other environmentally stressed regions across the nation have or will be recruited from academe, state and federal research agencies, as well as from NSF with an emphasis on including groups historically underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n",
