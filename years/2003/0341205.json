 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nGiven the increasing importance of Information Technology in enabling leading\r\nbusinesses and supply chains and the rapidly evolving structure of private sector and\r\npublic sector organizations driven by constant innovations in the field of IT, there are\r\ntremendous scope and value for ground-breaking research in various aspects of IT-\r\nenabled logistics and supply chain management. To bring together some of the finest\r\nresearchers in this area to present their perspectives, an international workshop is being\r\nproposed in the IT capital of India, Bangalore, later this year. Thought leaders and\r\naccomplished researchers from across the world will congregate to share their findings,\r\nunearth path-breaking approaches to shared problems and discover common research\r\ninterests in the closely inter-related areas of supply chain management, IT enabled\r\nlogistics, E-business and manufacturing automation. This collective learning process will\r\ndefinitely lead to significant new findings that shall further aid the development and\r\ndeployment of new IT solutions in Industry.\r\nThe workshop will be organized over a period of 2 days with a total of 8 sessions that\r\nshall be dedicated to exploring the frontiers of IT-enabled logistics and supply chain\r\nnetworks. A pre-workshop tutorial on the basics of IT-enabled logistics and supply chain\r\nmanagement will be organized for the benefit of interested workshop participants. A\r\ntotal of 40 prominent speakers will be invited to present their results and share their\r\nperspectives. The total number of participants including speakers will be around 150 (40\r\nspeakers, 40 faculty members from Indian Universities, 30 Industry participants and\r\nabout 40 research students). Some of the companies that are expected to participate in\r\nthis event are i2 Technologies, SAPLabs, Samsung, Motorola, Infosys, Satyam,\r\nMindTree, IBM India Research Labs, and GM India Science Labs.\r\nIn order to achieve the ambitious goals of this workshop, the participation of international\r\nexperts particularly from the US is absolutely essential. In this regard, NSF funding to\r\nprovide partial support for the travel and accommodation of US-based researchers\r\nattending the event will go a long way in making the event a grand success. It is\r\nestimated that support will be required to facilitate the participation of around 10 US-\r\nbased academicians.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed workshop is that it brings together leading\r\nresearchers and industrial thinkers for technical presentation, brainstorming discussions,\r\nindustrial visit, and workshop publication. The speakers will share some of their most\r\nrecent research findings to addresses both the IT and the modeling issues, and this will\r\nhave broad impact on both traditional industries such as automotive, aerospace, apparel,\r\npetrochemicals, etc. and also e-business companies. The outcomes of the Workshop will\r\nbe widely disseminated to scientists and engineers in academia, manufacturing and\r\nservice industries, and the supporting IT industries through Workshop Proceedings and\r\npersonal contact. Visits to leading Indian software houses and research institutes and\r\ntechnical discussions among participants would facilitate a better understanding of India\r\nIT industry by US researchers, and the establishing an international research network will\r\nthen have a far and broad impact on international collaboration between the two\r\ncountries.",
