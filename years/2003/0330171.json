 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop the foundations of a control and optimization science base for sensor networks viewed as complex systems operating in an uncertain and potentially adverse environment. The approach taken is a combination of addressing fundamental research issues while maintaining a focus on a specific target application domain, a manufacturing enterprise, in order to generate concrete, implementable results. The proposed research plan adopts three complementary, interconnected views of a sensor network: as a collection of elements that need to communicate among themselves, as a dynamic system whose control depends on a thorough understanding of element interactions, and as a multi-time scale distributed system that requires a layer of coordination. The analytical and computational challenges involved in this plan will be faced through novel modeling, estimation, and optimization approaches. An important component of the project is the development of an experimental sensor network testbed based on several low-power digital signal processors and microcontrollers. A mobile robot squadron will provide multi-sensor platforms networked with a group of laptop computers serving as the processing nodes of the resulting system. Research results will include new sensors for manufacturing systems, new energy saving protocols for wireless sensor networks, and new modeling and control approaches for complex engineering systems, all validated on this testbed.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the state-of-the-art in all application domains that can benefit from sensor networks, primarily focusing on manufacturing where advances will result in increased energy efficiency, accelerated productivity growth, improved product quality, and enhanced workplace safety and security. Other societal applications include transportation safety and homeland security. On the educational front, plans include multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, creating software modules for educational case studies, and working to reach out to high school students.",
