 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-year exploratory experimental research program to study of a novel high rate combustion synthesis method using well controlled CO-air flames for europium nanophosphors is proposed. The goal is to achieve the following: 1) a high rate synthesis, 2) significant reduction of hydroxyl residual, 3) narrow nanophosphor scale distribution, 4) uniform incorporation of europium ions and 5) control of particle size and fluorescent properties. The novel features embodied in the proposed study to achieve these goals are: a) significant reduction of hydroxyl residual in nanoparticles by using a low OH concentration flame in synthesis, b) narrow particle scale distribution and uniform incorporation of europium ions by the employment of the one-dimensional flame geometry, c) control of nanoparticle size and fluorescent properties by precisely changing the synthesis size residence time and flame temperature and d) the high rate synthesis. The success of the present proposal will provide not only a scale-up, but also high quality and high rate synthesis technology for industry and for development of applications of europium nanophosphors such as in optical devices and biomedicine. Furthermore, the proposal also provides a challenge to educate one graduate and one undergraduate student in the cutting edge research and study of a multidisciplinary research field and provides summer training of one high school student. \r\nThe proposed technique for the synthesis of europium-doped glass nanoparticles comes from different expertise and a new method, and holds significant advantage over existing approaches in terms of scale-up, high-rate and high-quality production.  The key point is to employ OH free CO-air flame. However, the technique is untested.  The combination of the investigators in combustion and materials science brings complementary expertise to this exploratory research project. \r\nThis proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation \"Nanoscale Science and Engineering\". The award is jointly supported through this initiative by the Division of Materials Research within Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems within Engineering.\r\n",
