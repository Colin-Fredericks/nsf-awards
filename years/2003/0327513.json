 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on observing and understanding ocean-climate related processes in the North Pacific Ocean subtropical gyre. The funding will support five years of continued shipboard observations of water properties and currents in the vicinity of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) deep-water Station ALOHA to extend the time-series to 20 years, and to continue the high-quality support of the biogeochemistry research component of HOT. Temperature, salinity and velocity instruments will be placed on a NOAA-funded surface mooring to be deployed at ALOHA to improve our temporal resolution of upper ocean processes. A better spatial context for the time-series using the HOT observations in conjunction with models and basin-scale data analysis products will be developed. The scientific analyses focus on improving the description and understanding of ocean climate variability, and on discerning the associated impacts on ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems. A particular goal is a better understanding of the subduction and entrainment processes in relation to water mass variability observed at ALOHA, including surface layer variations in relation to air-sea interaction. The studies also include investigation of the contributions of high frequency processes such as eddies and tidal mixing to the slower evolution of the water masses within the North Pacific subtropical gyre. The moored upper ocean measurements are essential to all of these objectives.  \r\n\r\nThe measurements and analyses from this project contribute to the objectives of the ongoing US Global Change Research Program and the new Climate Change Science Program, through the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) program and the Carbon Cycle Science program. These programs aim to improve models of ocean variability as part of the coupled climate system. Such improved models will be used for testing ideas about coupled climate variability, for ocean and climate predictability studies, for ocean and climate state assessments, for ocean observing system studies and, ultimately, for forecasts of climate variations. This project will contribute to the development of the ALOHA Observatory, which in turn will be a contribution to the planned US Integrated Ocean Observing System, and helping to develop new technology for sustained ocean observations. The project will contribute to the education of a graduate student and provide training for several undergraduate students working with the project. In addition, the investigator will work with University of Hawaii and Rutgers University colleagues to support K-12 marine science educational efforts. \r\n",
