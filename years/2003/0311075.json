 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is creating a hands-on learning environment that enhances the laboratory experience of students across the engineering curriculum in order to: build self confidence; integrate research advances into the undergraduate curriculum; promote teamwork and communication skills; and broaden the range of teaching styles required to meet the needs of a diverse student population. The project is strengthening the skills needed to design and conduct experiments by integrating laboratory skill development across four engineering departments. The project is utilizing two benchmark software products (LabVIEW and MATLAB), both of which have educational and industrial applications. During the first two years of the curriculum, LabVIEW is being used principally as a data acquisition tool whereas MATLAB is being used for data analysis and visualization. The project is an adaptation of the \"integrated teaching and learning\" program pioneered and developed by the University of Colorado at Boulder. The laboratory experience is focusing on team-oriented, hands-on learning at fully equipped Lab Stations using carefully designed experimental modules. The project is having a positive impact on improving the retention of a more diverse student body by creating more confidence and interest in engineering, promoting interest in research, and providing greater opportunities for interaction of culturally diverse groups.",
