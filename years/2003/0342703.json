 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Microelectronic Engineering Department of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) proposes to undertake a one-year planning project to define and develop new undergraduate MEMs and nanotechnology concentration programs.  The programs will be available to students as an option (concentration) or as a minor within the existing baccalaureate programs. A multidisciplinary planning team will be constituted that will collect information and conduct surveys, using industry leaders, employers and research institutions for important guidance.  With the existing BS program in Microelectronic Engineering as a foundation, the team will seek to assemble a multidisciplinary curriculum that best fits the educational needs of students and the requirements of U.S. employers in the emerging field of MEMs and nanotechnology.  This is an opportunity for a department level reform in the curriculum to equip the students with a knowledge and experience in MEMs and nanotechnology and to expand opportunities for its graduates beyond traditional microelectronics and in technologies requiring integration with microelectronics such as data storage and Microsystems technologies.  It is proposed to develop: (1) 'minor' programs in MEMs and nanotechnology consisting of at least four courses for undergraduate students of Microelectronic Engineering; (2) a nanofabrication course for students of other science and engineering disciplines; (3) creation of nanotechnology/MEMs based multidisciplinary design experience for undergraduates; (4) building of cooperative experience in MEMs and nanotechnology; (5) using co-op evaluations as a means for outcome evaluation and technological advancement of the program; (6) develop outreach activities for minority student recruitment and K-12 education.  The curriculum will emphasize hands-on student access to equipment for laboratory experiments; cross-discipline mentored undergraduate research projects, and will use a combination of existing and newly developed courses from several institute departments or colleges.  Built into the program will be means for evaluating outcomes so that the curriculum, once established, can be updated or adjusted according to the needs of the rapidly emerging field of MEMs and nanotechnology. \r\n",
