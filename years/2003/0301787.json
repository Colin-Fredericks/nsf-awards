 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis research will address the critical problem of movement-induced \r\nvibration that limits the operating speed of Scanning Probe Microscopes \r\n(SPMs). It is noted that SPMs are key enabling tools in the experimental \r\ninvestigation and manipulation of nano scale (and sub-nano scale) phenomena. \r\nHowever, during high-speed operation of SPMs, movement-induced vibration \r\nleads to damage of the sample and/or probe as well as modification of the \r\nsurface properties being investigated. Therefore, current SPM systems are \r\noperated at low speeds; for example, high-resolution SPM systems operate at \r\naround 1/100th of the lowest resonant frequency that excites significant \r\nvibrations in the system. Thus, movement-induced vibration limits the \r\noperating speed of current SPM systems. This work proposes to compensate-for \r\nthe movement-induced vibration and, thereby, to enable high-speed operation \r\nof SPMs with sub-nanometer resolution, and without adverse affects such as \r\nsample and probe damage. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it \r\nwill exploit the extant imaging capability of the SPM to increase the \r\noperating speed. The proposed research consists of following three tasks: \r\n(1) measure effects of dynamics using SPM images; (2) compensate-for the SPM \r\ndynamics; and (3) evaluate increase in operating speed using Scanning \r\nTunneling Microscope (STM). The proposed approach will be used to evaluate \r\nthe maximum speed at which a STM can image standard samples such as carbon \r\natoms in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The proposed \r\nimprovements of SPM, a key-enabling tool, will have a broad impact on \r\nresearch and development in nanosciences and nanotechnologies. The proposed \r\nwork will also build the research and human resource infrastructure needed \r\nto remain competitive in emerging nanotechnology industries.\r\n",
