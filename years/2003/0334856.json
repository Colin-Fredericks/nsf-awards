HPNC proposals are complex documents that include many nuances and requirements.  This workshop will take the participants through the proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing their proposals. This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and research justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget, format and narrative requirements. \r\n\r\nThis workshop, while open to representatives of both minority and non-minority serving institutions, is targeted specifically to minority serving institutions, capitalizing on previous work done to assist this community by Ms. McLean and her associates.  The workshop will be one and one-half days in length and will be facilitated by several experienced individuals.  \r\n",
