 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant for a collaborative research program between the University of Ancona, Ancona, Italy and the University of California at San Diego. The objective of the study is to produce very refined grain size to the nanoscale through severe plastic deformation. The University of Ancona has a grant from the Istituto Nazionale per la Fisica della Materia (INFM) for \"Physical Aspects of Ultrafine Grained Aluminum Alloys,\" and this NSF grant is a mechanism to substantially enhance collaboration by permitting funding that is complementary to the INFM study. A major goal of the INFM study is to use equal channel angular (ECA) pressing of aluminum alloys as a means to produce nanoscale grain size aluminum alloys.  The effort by the US team is directed towards understanding the specific mechanisms by which the severe plastic deformation leads to a refined grain size. The study is expected to alleviate the empiricism involved in the quest to produce very fine-grained alloys of commercial value.  \r\n\r\nThe UCSD group will utilize both the mechanical facilities at UCSD and the University of Ancona. Graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and faculty will participate in exchanges on long-term basis (three months to one year) between these institutions. The collaborative program is very complementary in scope, and will give an opportunity to enhance the research by taking advantage of the international expertise.\r\n\r\nThis NSF project is co-funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the Division of Materials Research (Metals Research) and International Office (Western Europe) as a Cooperative Activity in Materials Research between the NSF and Europe (NSF 02-135). This project is being carried out in collaboration with University of Ancona, Ancona, Italy.\r\n",
