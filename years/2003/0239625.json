Well-known examples of conformations include\r\nnucleation events during phase transition, conformational changes in\r\nmolecules, thermal activated switching of magnetic materials, and\r\nchemical reactions.  The disparity between the execution time of the\r\nconformation event and the waiting time between these events is\r\ntypically so large that it impossible to simulate the dynamics of\r\nthese processes by solving directly the underlying dynamic equations.\r\nThis project is a combined theorical and numerical effort to describe\r\nand simulate these rare conformation changes. The theoretical\r\ndescription of transition pathways in complex systems leads to\r\nchallenging problem in probability and stochastic processes theory\r\nwhich require to go beyond the standard tools of large deviation\r\ntheory and extensions thereof. These new theoretical tools will be\r\ndeveloped so as to naturally lead to efficient algorithms, well-suited\r\nfor the numerical investigation of the transition pathways required in\r\nrealistic complex systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplied mathematics has much to contribute, and much to gain in\r\nunderstanding via a coordinate program of analysis, simulation, and\r\neducation the mechanisms by which rare conformation changes arise in\r\ncomplex systems. Topics to be addressed include: (a) the development\r\nof appropriate theoretical tools for the description of the transition\r\npathways in complex systems; (b) the development of efficient\r\nnumerical algorithms for the identification of these pathways; and,\r\n(c) the development of courses at undergraduate and graduate levels in\r\napplied stochastic methods which will provide the students with the\r\nnecessary background to do research on these topics at the interface\r\nbetween mathematics, computer science, and the natural sciences.\r\nSuccessful pursuit of these issues requires a multidisciplinary\r\neffort, drawing expertise from computational sciences, applied\r\nmathematics, in the multiple fields in the natural sciences which\r\ninvolve complex dynamical systems.  The students and postdoctoral\r\nscientists participating this effort will gain flexibility and\r\nperspective through exposure to these many disciplines.\r\n",
