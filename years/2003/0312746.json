 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project proposes to develop a transaction management technique for a mobile multidatabase management system that takes energy restriction, transaction real-time constraints, and ad-hoc networks into consideration.  This technique is aimed at reducing the overall energy consumption and providing a balance in individual mobile host (MH) energy consumption,  while at the same time reducing the number of transactions that must be aborted due to deadline violations.   It considers both firm real-time and soft real-time transactions, and three modes that an MH can be in: active, doze, and sleep.  It treats time as the most important factor in handling firm transactions while energy as the most important factor in handling soft transactions.  It uses this principle to locate MHs, schedule transactions, and commit/abort transactions.  It handles disconnection and migration by introducing a suspended state into global transactions to ensure that transactions of mobile users whose status is unknown will not be aborted until they obstruct the execution of other transactions.  A prototype will be developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique for real-life applications and to provide guidelines to assist both users and designers.",
