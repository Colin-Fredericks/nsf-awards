MCM materials are being synthesized hydrothermally and functionalized through the incorporation of metals. The structure of the materials is being investigated and optimized through characterizations using SEM-EDAX, BET surface area, XRD, and Mas-NMR, among other techniques. Fundamental data on adsorption equilibria and rates of adsorption are being obtained for these materials using probe biomolecules with a wide range of molecular weights (~250 to 650,000 Da) and sizes (up to ~ 60 angstrom).  A fundamental understanding of the relationships between material properties, solution conditions, and biomolecule characteristics, and selectivity, capacity, rates of adsorption and reversibility is being developed. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the broader impacts, the proposed work represents a new approach to address the need for highly selective separation media for preparative bioseparations. The proposed research will provide new data on the adsorptive interactions of proteins with solid surfaces, and the kinetics of protein adsorption on MCM materials. Fundamental insights obtained from the data are expected to contribute to an improved understanding of the adsorption of proteins. The ability to synthesize adsorbents with a singular pore size and surface characteristics that are susceptible to a wide range of surface modifications is likely result in a versatile new class of preparative adsorbents with selectivities that can be tuned much more closely than is presently possible. The mentoring of graduate students will be educational component.  The potential for developing molecular sieve membranes with aligned pores and surface selectivity could lead to a completely new class of membranes for bioseparations. This project may be useful in both preparative chromatographic and membrane bioseparations applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
