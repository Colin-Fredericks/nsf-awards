 "awd_abstract_narration": "L. Keith Woo, Iowa State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for studies of chemical oxidations mediated by transition metal porphyrin complexes. Oxometalloporphyrins are important active intermediates in several enzymatic processes, particularly the cyctochrome P450 family. Oxometalloporphyrins of the early transition metals, particularly titanium (IV), chromium (IV) and vanadium (IV) can utilize molecular oxygen in oxidations of organic substrates, particularly diols. Woo is focusing on three processes: 1)oxidative cleavage reactions catalyzed by metal oxo complexes, 2) oxygen atom transfer from metal peroxo and alkyl peroxo complexes, and 3) studies on the reactions between NO and peroxo complexes.\r\n\r\nOxidations are critically important both industrially and biochemically, yet the details of many of these reactions are not well-understood.  A thorough comprehension of the chemical steps involved may advance our abilities to optimize these important processes, conserve natural resources and eliminate waste. Through this project, graduate students and undergraduates will be trained in the laboratory and will develop communication and intellectual skills needed to become independent scientists.",
