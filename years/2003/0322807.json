 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates four different applications, which are\r\nrelated through their common need for high-speed computational\r\ncapabilities.  The first project involves the simulation of growing\r\nbacterial biofilms.  The simulation will couple the extended finite\r\nelement method with the level set method in order to capture the\r\ninteraction between the growing biofilm and the surrounding fluid\r\nflow.  The second project will solve a low Mach number model for\r\ndeflagrations in stellar envelopes.  By filtering out sound waves from\r\nthe model, significantly larger time steps can be achieved than are\r\npossible for full hydrodynamical models, thus making long time\r\ncomputations feasible.  The third project will study the role of\r\ndefects in the break-down of ordered structures.  Parallelized\r\nMonte-Carlo and Fourier spectral methods will be employed to\r\ninvestigate defect trajectories in two paradigmatic systems, a\r\nmagnetic system and a dynamical system of coupled oscillators in two\r\ndimensions. They exhibit spatially ordered as well as disordered\r\nstates. The goal is to identify to what extent various statistical\r\nmeasures of the trajectories follow universal power laws. The fourth\r\nproject will use recently developed importance-sampling methods for\r\nsimulating rare events that set the performance of optical fiber\r\ncommunication systems.\r\n\r\nThe impact of these projects will be felt across a broad spectrum of\r\ndisciplines, and will aid in the training and education of several\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral research associates.  In addition\r\nto the scientific areas described above, the training will also\r\ninclude the efficient use of high-performance parallel computing\r\narchitectures.  The study of biofilms will improve our understanding\r\nof quourum sensing organisms, and how to treat them.  Such organisms\r\nare responsible for a number of diseases, including diseases\r\nassociated with cystic fibrosis and deep burn wounds.  The study of\r\ndeflagrations in stellar envelopes will improve our understanding of\r\nthe dynamics of novae of white dwarfs and the nature of X-ray bursts\r\nfrom neutron stars.  Transitions from ordered patterns to disordered\r\nstates are observed in many physical systems undergoing phase\r\ntransitions as well as in dynamical systems like arrays of coupled\r\noscillators, various kinds of fluid flow, and optical systems. Often\r\ndefects in the patterns are striking features of the disordered\r\nstates. The research will elucidate the role the defect dynamics play\r\nin the break-down of the ordered states.  The study of rare events in\r\noptical fiber communication systems will lead to the construction of a\r\nset of simulation tools capable of predicting the performance of\r\nlightwave communication systems.\r\n\r\n",
