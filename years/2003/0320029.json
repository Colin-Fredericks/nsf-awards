 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the feasibility of constructing a semiconductor device that directly and efficiently converts the energy released from radioactive decay directly into electric current. The semiconductor material will be utilized in a unique manner that will result in an innovative electrical technology. Prior efforts using semiconductor materials to accomplish direct radioisotope energy conversion have concentrated on planar geometries as in, for example, solar and photovoltaic cells. The goal of this research is to distribute the radioisotope throughout the specified active volume of a semiconductor in such a manner as to remain nearly proximate to the energy conversion mechanism. The key to achieving high efficiency is to situate the maximum number of radioactive nuclei so that a minimal amount of decay energy is lost before conversion to electric current occurs. \r\n     Commercially, this research will lead to the development of a practical nuclear battery. It is anticipated that this direct energy conversion device would be able to replace chemical batteries in a number of applications. Especially attractive is that candidate radioisotope power sources have half-lives measured in decades so that electric current can be delivered continuously in remote or inaccessible locations. Potentially, acceptance and success in the industrial marketplace will lead to a number of consumer applications.  \r\n\r\n",
