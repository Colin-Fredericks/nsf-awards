 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarship support for 33 students studying engineering or computer science at either a cooperating community college or the university. Fifty percent of the scholarships are being awarded to minority and female students. The students, designated as NSF Scholars, are participating in: Scholars Forums throughout their undergraduate experience; internship experiences between their junior and senior years; and professional society activities. Scholars in their junior year are attending Career Planning Workshops that help them with interviewing techniques, resume design, and job-hunting skills.  Seniors are working with the Employment and Educational Referral Service to search for jobs and investigate graduate school opportunities. Faculty members are serving as mentors to the Scholars and offer encouragement, academic support and advisement.",
