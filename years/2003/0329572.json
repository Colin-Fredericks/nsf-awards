 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent collapses of bridges and buildings due to earthquakes, accidents, and terrorist attacks have highlighted the urgent needs to monitor the condition of the nation's civil infrastructure systems.  However, one of the major obstacles preventing sensor-based monitoring is the lack of reliable, easy-to-install, and cost-effective sensors that are suited for and can be densely deployed on large-scale civil infrastructure systems.  This research focuses on development of a distributed optical fiber accelerometer system recently conceptualized by this PI.  The sensor system represents a novel integration of the moir phenomena and fiber optics to achieve a robust performance in addition to its immunity to EM interference, easy cabling, and multiplexing capability.  All of these, impossible to achieve by the conventional sensors, make the proposed sensor system ideal for applications in civil infrastructure monitoring.  The objective of this research is to investigate whether it is technically feasible to engineer the sensor concept into a high-performance and low-cost multiplexible optical fiber sensor system.  Major research tasks include (1) development of a prototype accelerometer with optimal tradeoff between resolution and bandwidth, (2) development of software that further increases the sensor resolution through innovative measurement and signal processing, and (3) field test in the world largest Three Gorges Power Plant in China, where the conventional sensors are rendered inoperable due to strong  EM interference, high moisture, and huge scale.  The highly interdisciplinary nature and the international collaboration component of this project provide unique educational opportunities to undergraduate and graduate (including underrepresented) students.  This research will advance scientific knowledge in the areas of innovative sensing concepts, signal processing, and field implementation.  The proposed high-performance optical fiber sensors will have a positive impact on the safety and reliability of the nation's civil infrastructure.",
