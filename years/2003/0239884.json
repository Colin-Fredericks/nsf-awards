 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to study the reactivity of sulfurpentafluoride radicals and trifluoromethane anions (Ruppert's reagent) for the preparation of fluoronated organic compounds.  This study involves the elaboration of detailed reaction mechanisms by the use of thermodynamics and kinetics to examine regiochemical and stereochemical issues as they apply to structure-activity relationships in the reaction intermediates.  \r\n\r\nWith this continuing award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. William R. Dolbier, Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida.  Professor Dolbier will focus his work on the construction of commercially feasible methods for the preparation of materials for use in the semiconductor industry.  Methods for safe, economical and environmentally friendly methods for the production of organofluorine compounds will be developed.  The educational activities of the award will include the training of graduate students, post-doctoral associates, visiting scholars and undergraduates at the University of Florida.  \r\n",
