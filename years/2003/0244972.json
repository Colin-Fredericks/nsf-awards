 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neutron is a sub--atomic particle that\r\ncomprises more than half of the matter in the\r\nworld. Within the nuclei of most atoms, the\r\nneutron remains stable, but when freed from the\r\nnucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are thus\r\nan important tool for study of\r\nsub--atomic physics, because the decay and\r\ninteractions of free neutrons reveal the\r\ninteractions of its constituents and decay\r\nproducts. Neutrons also have spin, the quantum\r\nmechanical property of the most fundamental\r\npieces of matter that distinguishes two states called\r\nspin--up and spin--down. Spin is responsible\r\nfor the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example,\r\nin NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the\r\ndecay and interactions of neutrons, and so the\r\ncontrol of neutron spin becomes useful for more\r\ndetailed study of sub--atomic interactions. In\r\nthe proposed research, free neutrons produced by\r\na particle accelerator at Los Alamos National\r\nLaboratory and at the nuclear reactor at NIST\r\nwill be used in experiments that control the\r\nneutron spin to reveal weak interactions and\r\npossible new physics beyond the Standard Model that\r\n  summarizes known elementary\r\nparticle interactions.\r\n\r\nThe neutron spins in a beam of neutron will be manipulated by\r\nselecting predominantly one spin state with a\r\nspin filter based on laser polarized $^3$He. The\r\nneutron spin can be reversed using\r\nmagnetic fields that couple to the nuclear\r\nmagnetic moment. Very precise measurement of the\r\nneutron polarization ({\\it i.e.} the excess\r\nfraction of the selected spin state) and precise\r\nspin reversal are required to mitigate false\r\neffects that may arise. The techniques of\r\n$^3$He polarization, the spin filter, and spin\r\nflipping will be greatly improved as we undertake\r\nthese experiments.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the Los Alamos experiment is\r\nmeasurement of the weak interaction effects on\r\nthe absorption of neutrons by hydrogen. The weak\r\ninteraction\r\nis characterized by absorption and emission of\r\nparticles that have a handedness that correlates\r\nthe spin orientation with the direction of motion.\r\nThis handedness allows observation of the weak\r\ninteraction amidst the much stronger interactions\r\nof neutrons and protons. Definitive characterization of the weak\r\ninteraction between the neutron and proton is\r\ncrucial to fully understanding the forces that\r\nbind the nucleus. The experiment at NIST measures\r\nthe dependence of neutron decays on the spin\r\nstate. In a dedicated detector, neutron decays\r\nare observed by simultaneously detecting the proton and\r\nelectron. The\r\nthird particle emitted, the neutrino, is too elusive to\r\ndetect with high efficiency. A dependence of\r\nthe electron's and proton's relative motion on the neutron spin\r\nstate would reveal interactions that are not\r\nsymmetric under reversal of time, a special\r\nsignature that could reveal new physics beyond\r\nthe Standard Model, physics that may\r\nexplain the origin of matter in the Big Bang. The advanced\r\ntechniques of spin state selection, precision\r\npolarimetry, and spin flipping will be applied to\r\na planned experiment with the objective of precisely\r\nmeasuring the handedness of neutron decays. When\r\ncombined with other neutron decay measurements\r\nthese measurements will also probe physics beyond the\r\nStandard Model.\r\n\r\nThis work probes deep intellectual questions\r\nabout the most fundamental\r\npieces of matter. The aim is to collect data\r\nthat will help complete the picture of elementary\r\nparticles and their interactions. The techniques\r\nhave much broader impact. Laser polarized\r\n$^3$He and $^{129}$Xe used in related experiments\r\nare now used in biomedical research, materials\r\nscience,  and may be applied in advances of\r\nquantum computation. This research is a remarkable\r\ntraining ground for undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents. The technical challenges combined with\r\nthe deep intellectual issues provide motivation\r\nand develop technical skills.  Several undergraduates will\r\ngain research experience working along with graduate students and\r\nsenior researchers. Graduate students emerge\r\nbroadly capable and move on to prepare for\r\nfaculty positions as well as interdisciplinary\r\nresearch. This work has also led to development\r\nof new courses for non--physics majors and to a\r\nset of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets.\r\nThe theme for the public is\r\nthat, in the context of probing fundamental\r\nproblems of physics -- exciting in their own\r\nright, the hardest problems produce the most\r\ninnovative solutions with spin--offs unimaginable\r\nat the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and\r\nprobing the origin of matter all follow from the\r\ncontrol of nuclear magnetism.",
