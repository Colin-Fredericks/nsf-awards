 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the summer REU program at the Danforth Center is simple: to provide an opportunity for a student to mature into a young scientist.  To do this, we have created a program that gives students experience with all aspects of modern scientific research, from design to implementation to reporting, while providing insight into the personal qualities of a good researcher, the steps to take on the road to becoming a scientist, and the broader implications of scientific discovery.  The Danforth Center is an independent, non-profit research institute newly established in St. Louis, Missouri.  It is devoted to fundamental research in plant science leading to discoveries for the benefit of human health and nutrition and agricultural sustainability.  Students in all life science fields, not just those interested in plant science, can benefit from the program.\r\n\r\nThe Danforth Center provides a welcoming atmosphere in a small, friendly institution and at the same time exposes students to a rich research environment because of the wide range of expertise present, including cell biology, molecular biology, structural biology, biochemistry, microbiology, chemistry, computational biology, bioinformatics, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, nematology, and plant pathology.  During the eleven-week summer program, the student will 1) design and conduct a laboratory research project in collaboration with a faculty mentor, present findings in a final symposium, and prepare a written report summarizing the research; 2) learn the application of a wide variety of instrumentation and the latest techniques in life science research; 3) learn about potential career pathways and strategies; 4) discuss the ethical, social, and political issues surrounding current plant science research, including exploring the potential of genetic engineering and challenges for improving agriculture in developing countries through biotechnology.\r\n\r\nStudents interested in applying to the program should visit the web site www.danforthcenter.org/internship.  An application is available for download and information is available on research areas at the Center.  Students will be matched with research areas that best suit their interests and experience.  Students who are members of groups under-represented in the sciences are especially encouraged to apply.\r\n",
