 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, the PI will pursue a broad program of research in State-to-State Reaction Dynamics.  The program consists of three main areas with several subtopics.  These are 1) Photofragmentation, including photodissociation and photoionization dynamics; 2) Hydrogen atom + Hydrogen molecule reaction dynamics.  This includes the investigation of scattering resonances, the development of improved apparatus, the investigation of the geometric phase in chemical reactions, and the study of the effects of vibrational excitation and angular momentum polarization; and 3) Using improved apparatus the impact of vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity will be investigated on small molecules, such as the reaction of chlorine atoms with methane and deuterated methane molecules in mode selected excited states, and studies of the vibrational control of larger molecules such as methyl alcohol and methyl amine and their deuterated variants through their reactions with chlorine atoms.  These projects will be done with the participation of students and postdoctoral research associates.  They will thereby acquire skills and knowledge in a forefront area of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced study or employment in industry, government laboratories or academia.",
