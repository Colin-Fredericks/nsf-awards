The purpose of the workshop is to plan and organize future research in mathematic education by bringing together potential collaborators from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the US.  The US participants will come from Brigham Young University, North Carolina State University, the University of Hawaii, the University of Delaware, and Rutgers.  The foreign researchers will come from the University of Oslo, Arhus University (Denmark), Teacher Training College (Denmark), and the Universities of Lulea, Kristianstad, and Lund (Sweden).  The common research goal of the participants is to design and implement collaborative, cross-cultural research aimed at articulating mechanisms through which educators can develop methods of instruction that take into account the learners' thinking.  The participants will gain from the variety of perspectives by building mutual awareness of important differences, thereby making the most of alternate approaches, distinct traditions, and different educational designs.\r\n",
