 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort addresses two closure problems arising\r\nin fluid systems: the description of turbulent energy transfer\r\nthrough a large number of wave modes, and the determination of the\r\namount of mixing at internal breaking waves in a stratified\r\nenvironment. The methodology proposed includes the asymptotic\r\nreduction of complex partial differential equations to simpler\r\nsystems, the numerical simulation of dynamic equations, the\r\ncritical analysis of physical principles, and the comparison of\r\ntheory and computations with physical laboratory experiments. We\r\nanticipate that the work will yield both physical insights and\r\ninteresting new mathematics.\r\n\r\nTurbulent energy transfer, dissipation and mixing are key\r\nprocesses in fluid dynamical problems ranging from the wind\r\ngeneration of water waves to climate dynamics. In the ocean, for\r\nexample, wind driven ocean waves leads to ocean mixing, ultimately\r\ndetermining the sea--surface temperature, which, in turn, affects\r\natmospheric winds, temperature and humidity. Turbulent wave action\r\nis responsible for the transfer of energy between the very large\r\nscales of storms and the small scales of wind ripples at which\r\ndissipation takes place. In an atmospheric example, mixing by\r\nupward propagating breaking waves plays a significant role in the\r\ndynamical coupling between the lower and the upper layers of the\r\natmosphere. The research proposed here will contribute to the\r\nunderstanding of fundamental physical mechanisms behind these\r\nimportant phenomena, and hence improve our capability to predict\r\nand quantify climate changes. The proposal will also have a strong\r\neducational impact, through the training of graduate students, the\r\ndevelopment of a research seminar for undergraduate students, the\r\nteaching of challenging undergraduate classes, and by having\r\nundergraduate students participate in summer projects focused on\r\nthe research.\r\n",
