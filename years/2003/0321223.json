 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Objective of the Proposed Activity\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to acquire the Polytec PI Micro Scanning Vibrometer (MSV-300)\r\nfor research and educational use at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The Micro\r\nScanning Vibrometer (MSV) is an ideal instrument for mapping the deflections of\r\nMicroelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) structures. Employing state-of-the-art laser\r\ntechnology and a computer software driven data acquisition system, the instrument can measure\r\nacceleration, velocity and displacement of points on tiny vibrating microstructures, and provide\r\nlive 3-D animations of the response mode shapes of the microstructures. The MSV includes two-channel\r\nFFT data acquisition, a fiber-optic vibrometer sensor, microscope adapter, piezo-scanning\r\nsystem, remote control functions and specialized software.\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity\r\nFour laboratories in three engineering departments at UIC are actively involved in sponsored\r\nresearch projects on development of a variety of novel MEMS transducers, many of them in\r\ncollaboration with various departments in the UIC Medical school, that correspond to over\r\n$3.5M in grants (either funded or pending) from various federal agencies including NSF.\r\nExamples of these novel MEMS projects include actuators and microfluidic devices for sub-retinal\r\nprosthesis, medical diagnostic vibro-acoustic sensors, multi-channel neural probes, and\r\nliquid drop actuated micro-mirrors. The feature sizes of these MEMS are on the order of a few\r\nmicrometers and their resonant frequencies are on the order of a few Hertz to several MHz. A\r\nvery important component central to all of these research projects is the identification of system\r\ndynamics, which presents many difficult challenges. Due to the micro scale of these structures,\r\nconventional dynamic characterization methods are not feasible. Coarse frequency evaluations\r\nmay be possible in some cases using certain single-point optical sensors; however, they are not\r\npractical for obtaining detailed mode shape data of the test specimen. Additionally, they are\r\nlimited by bandwidth and resolution. Currently no instruments are available at UIC or nearby\r\ninstitutions to fully characterize the dynamic behavior of MEMS structures in these projects.\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity\r\nThe proposed equipment will significantly impact the quality of research and education, and\r\ndiversity programs at UIC, and also the advancement of local institutions and private companies:\r\nResearch MSV would enable UIC researchers to acquire high quality modal data in MEMS\r\nstructures that is not possible by any other technique, and thus, significantly enhance the quality\r\nof the ongoing and anticipated future research. It would also help catalyze new research activity.\r\nEducation The equipment will be used to offer hands-on instruction in cutting-edge technology\r\nto supplement classroom theory taught in many existing and new courses planned in the areas of\r\ndynamics and MEMS testing at UIC; this will highly enrich the quality of education.\r\nDiversity UIC offers special programs at both the undergraduate and graduate level to attract and\r\nmentor members of underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. The availability of\r\nequipment would further enrich the education of students in these programs.\r\nIndustry The Microfabrication Applications Laboratory at UIC is currently used by over 50\r\nexternal users from several local academic institutions and companies in the greater Chicago\r\narea. Many of the users have expressed interest and need for the proposed MSV. This equipment\r\nwill foster more partnerships with local industry, promote innovation in MEMS/nanotechnology,\r\nand help local businesses to contribute to economic development in the Midwest.",
