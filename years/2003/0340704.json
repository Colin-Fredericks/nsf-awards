 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference is an international meeting that provides a general forum for disseminating the latest developments in biological informatics. The multidisciplinary conferences alternate the venue between North American and non-North American Sites. The overall focus is on real biological problems, not simply theoretical systems. The effort would support students and young scientists at the conference. Biological Informatics is highly international and interdisciplinary. The meeting will present an opportunity for the students to gain experience a variety of venues. ISMB has a peer-reviewed tutorial program to provide exposure on a broad range of topics to the attendees. These tutorials cover everything from statistical analysis to information management pipelines and database interoperability. Awardees are also required to present a poster of their work. The selection of candidates for travel support encourages the diversity of participation of all groups in an emerging interdisciplinary field.",
