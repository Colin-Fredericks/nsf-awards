The\r\nquestions about singular spaces concern elliptic analysis.\r\nThe questions about noncommutative geometry concern local proofs\r\nof the general foliation index theorem.\r\n\r\nAs mathematics and physics have evolved, the concept of space has also\r\nevolved.  Some evident examples from physics are the evolution from\r\nflat space to curved space, and the evolution from the classical phase\r\nspace to the quantum mechanical Hilbert space.  There have also been\r\nreasons intrinsic to mathematics that lead one to extend\r\nthe notion of space. Of course, one does not want to make arbitrary\r\ndefinitions, but one rather wants to consider concepts that arise\r\nnaturally from real problems.\r\nA more recent notion of space falls under the heading of\r\n``noncommutative geometry'', in which a traditional space is\r\nfirst considered to be defined in terms of the functions on it, and then\r\nthe ring of functions is generalized from the commutative case to allow\r\nfor a noncommutative ring of ``functions''.  Noncommutative geometry\r\nis rooted in the branch of geometric analysis called index theory.\r\nSometimes problems about ordinary ``commutative'' spaces, such as\r\nfoliations, can be translated into\r\nproblems about noncommutative spaces and attacked from that angle.\r\nMany of the questions considered in this\r\nproposal have their roots in physics.  Throughout the years there has\r\nbeen much fruitful interaction between mathematics and physics, and\r\nthe proposed work will hopefully contribute to this interaction.\r\nIn particular, questions about positive scalar curvature arise in\r\ngeneral relativity theory, and noncommutative geometry touches on many\r\nareas of modern theoretical physics.\r\n",
