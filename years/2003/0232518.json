 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will lead to the fabrication \r\nprocess of Bismuth Scantanate-Lead Titanate(BiScO3-PbTiO3) ceramics  with  a  textured microstructure  to yield materials  with  very large piezoelectric properties over a broad temperature range. In the case of existing ceramics, the piezoelectric properties are too low for these applications while recently discovered single crystal materials suffer from low Curie temperature and high manufacturing costs.  The objective of this research is to develop textured ceramics from the BiScO3-PbTiO3 system.  These materials have been shown to possess a very high Curie temperature (Tc. >450 C)  and high piezoelectric properties suitable for meeting the needs of emerging sensor, transducer,  and  actuator applications.  The templated grain  growth method will be used as  a means of texturing microstructure to produce polycrystalline  ceramics  with  properties  close  to  those  of  single  crystal.\r\n    \r\nCommercially, piezoelectric ceramics and single crystals are tantalizingly close to enabling a broad range of advanced applications including  vibration  sensors  with  sensitivity  at  the  theoretical  limit,  two-dimensional ultrasound phased arrays for three dimensional volumetric imaging,  and  high authority actuators for smart structures (vibration control and surface morphing).  This program will lead to highly piezoelectrically active material produced at nearly the same cost as existing ceramic compositions. \r\n\r\n",
