 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n This research initiative is to investigate the potential for using\r\nsynchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to measure micro- and meso-\r\nscale strains in concrete materials. This is a collaboration lead\r\nby Tennessee Technological University (TTU). Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the\r\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are partners in the collaboration.\r\nA series of experiments will be conducted to explore the use of synchrotron X-ray and neutron\r\ndiffraction and laser Raman spectroscopy to make measurements of micro-scale strains under\r\nstresses generated mechanically in Portland cement-based materials. Stressors will be applied by\r\nin situ loading and diffraction measurements made to establish the stress states of various\r\ncrystalline phases including calcium hydroxide (CH), unreacted cement phases and aggregate\r\nphases. An attempt will be made to make similar measurements on hydration product phases that\r\nare suitably crystalline including monosulfate and those of the hydrogrossular series (C3AH6 to\r\nC3AS3). Observations of the effect of stressors on the less crystalline hydration products\r\nincluding ettringite and calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) will be made using Raman spectroscopy.\r\nA broad range of mechanical loads up to near failure will be explored. Direct observation of\r\nmechanically induced deformations will also be made using environmental scanning electron\r\nmicroscopy (ESEM) and an in situ load frame.\r\n The proposed development and demonstration of synchrotron-\r\nand neutron-based techniques to quantify meso- and micro-scale stress and strain behavior in\r\nconcrete has broad reaching application-based implications. The results will be useful  to study the impact that chemical modification of the cement\r\nhas on alkali-silica interaction induced stresses,  prediction of cracking, durability\r\nand performance as they relate to interactions such as sulfate, alkali-silica, freeze-thaw and other\r\nenvironmental stressors.\r\n",
