 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comparative approach will be used to assess the evolutionary relationship between aggression\r\nand male size across the nine species of northern swordtail fishes. Dyadic contests and mirror image\r\nstimulation tests will be used to measure aggression levels. The relationship between the mean male size\r\nof each species and the two measures of aggression will be analyzed using the comparative method of\r\nindependent contrasts to determine if male size and aggression have been coevolving. In addition, the\r\nresponse of males to a signal of aggressive intent (vertical bars) will be examined to determine if this\r\nsignal confounds the relationship between aggression and size. This study is important because it will\r\nexamine the role that male-male competition has played in the evolution of male size, while examining\r\nthe possible effects of a signal and phylogeny on aggression.\r\nIn addition to graduate training, undergraduates participate in collection trips to Mexico, project\r\ndesign, data collection and are included as authors on publications for which they have made a substantial\r\nand intellectual contribution. This project also includes international collaboration, with students and\r\nresearchers from both countries benefiting from in-field interactions and dissemination of research at each\r\nothers home universities.",
