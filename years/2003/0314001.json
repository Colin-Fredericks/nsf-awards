Groups can be thought of as the\r\nmathematical abstraction of the common notion of symmetries.  As\r\nsuch they arise in mathematics and natural sciences such as for\r\nexample physics, chemistry, and biology.  The symmetry group of an\r\nobject usually also acts on function spaces that are related to\r\nthe given object.  This is a so-called linear action and in the\r\ncase where the function space is finite dimensional the group\r\nacts as invertible matrices on the space.  Such a realization is\r\ncalled a (matrix-) representation of the group.  In this context\r\none distinguishes two cases, the one where the matrices are\r\nwritten over a field of characteristic 0 such as the complex\r\nnumbers, or the case where the entries are in a finite field.\r\nThis case is particularly interesting since here the\r\nrepresentation theory is tightly connected to the structure of\r\nthe group.  The investigator develops a share package of programs\r\nin the computer algebra system GAP.  This system is free of\r\ncharge, well documented, and widely used.  The theory of\r\nrepresentations in the finite characteristic case is far from\r\nbeing fully understood.  For example, up to now not even all the\r\nirreducible representations for all finite simple groups are\r\nknown.  The share package implements algorithms to help solve\r\nseveral questions concerning the representations of a finite\r\ngroup.  First of all it enables the user to compute the projective\r\nindecomposable representations of a given group or alternatively\r\naccess them via a data base that is provided by the package.\r\nThese representations are of fundamental importance when one is\r\ninterested in getting an overview of all representations of the\r\ngroup.  From the projective indecomposable representations one can\r\nderive an algebra called the basic algebra that has the same\r\nrepresentation theory as the group.  This algebra is much smaller\r\nthan the group algebra itself and hence also has important\r\napplications in computing with representations.  The share package\r\ntherefore also contains functions to compute the basic algebra.\r\nEven though the basic algebra is a very important invariant,\r\nbarely anything is known about it even for specific groups.  The\r\nshare package increases the knowledge about specific groups\r\ntremendously.  Moreover, there is an explicit algorithmic\r\nconnection between representations of a group and that of its\r\nbasic algebra.  The share package incorporates functions that\r\nallow the user to analyze and construct representations using\r\nthis connection.  This is of particular importance in computations\r\nof the cohomology ring or the Ext-algebra of a group.\r\n     A group is a mathematical object that captures notions of\r\narrangement and symmetry -- for example, the different\r\norientations of a square when turned ninety degrees at a time\r\ncomprise a group.  Groups arise in mathematics and natural\r\nsciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology.  Exploiting the\r\ngroup structure often leads to deep insights into problems in\r\nthese areas.  The investigator develops ways to represent and\r\ncomputationally study finite groups.  He implements these methods\r\nin computer software, building on the freely available software\r\nsystem GAP.  The package he develops contains data bases of\r\ncomputed results.  These are accessible to the public via the GAP\r\nsystem and alternatively on the world wide web.  GAP itself is\r\nused in the educational environment and as part of GAP one\r\npossible application of the software package is in the class\r\nroom.  It gives students hands-on experience with representation\r\ntheory free of charge.\r\n\r\n",
