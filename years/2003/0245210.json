 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate several aspects of the\r\nlocalization-delocalization transition in Anderson-type random\r\nSchr\\\"odinger operators. One goal is the development of new\r\nmethods to characterize energy regimes with localized wave\r\nfunctions. The main focus will be on the fractional moment\r\n(or Aizenman-Molchanov) method, which has recently been shown to\r\napply to continuum disordered systems. The PI and his\r\ncollaborators will further increase the applicability of this\r\nmethod and use it to study several open problems such as the\r\nlocalization properties of continuum surface models and the\r\nAnderson model on continuum strips. Another objective is to study\r\nmathematical mechanisms which show existence of\r\nextended states in disordered media. For example, this will be\r\nstudied through one-dimensional random polymers, where an extended\r\nstate at a single energy can lead to significant electron\r\ntransport. The PI and collaborators will also develop perturbation\r\ntheoretic methods to study the high energy spectrum of\r\nmulti-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators with quasi-periodic\r\npotentials, and, in particular, establish the existence of\r\nextended states for this model.\r\n\r\nThe Anderson model is used to describe the conductivity properties\r\nof disordered media. This includes crystals with imbedded or\r\nsubstitutional impurities, alloys, amorphous media, the effects of\r\nlattice fluctuations at high temperature, and quasi crystals. The\r\ncentral goal is to understand the effects of disorder on electron\r\ntransport and therefore to distinguish between conductors and\r\ninsulators. The phenomena which are observed are not restricted to\r\nquantum mechanical waves, but extend to the propagation of\r\nacoustic, electro-magnetic and elastic waves in disordered media.\r\nApplications in engineering include the study of random\r\nimperfections in quantum wave guides, photonic crystals, and\r\nanomalous transport in quasi crystals. The PI's research is aimed\r\nat finding mathematically rigorous justifications of the Anderson\r\ntransition, stipulating that disordered media can undergo a phase\r\ntransition from insulator to conductor at sufficiently high\r\nenergy.",
