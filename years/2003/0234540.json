Minsky\r\n\r\nThe proposer is co-organizing a workshop at the Newton Institute in\r\nCambridge, UK, on the subject of ``Spaces of Kleinian groups and\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds'', for the summer of 2003.  The 4-week\r\nworkshop, including a 1-week conference, will bring together\r\nresearchers active on a number of foundational topics in the field:\r\nrelationships between the analytic, combinatorial and geometric\r\nstructure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds; topology of deformation spaces\r\nand the arrangement of their components; classification of hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds by asymptotic invariants; complex projective structures;\r\nconvex hull boundaries; cone manifolds, orbifolds and knot groups; the\r\ncombinatorial structure of Teichmuller spaces, mapping class groups,\r\nand spaces of curves on surfaces.  Recent years have seen substantial\r\nprogress on longstanding foundational conjectures such as the\r\nBers/Sullivan/Thurston Density Conjecture, Ahlfors' Measure\r\nConjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture and Marden's\r\nTameness Conjecture.  The time is therefore ripe for a conference on\r\nthese topics.\r\n\r\nIn the study of low-dimensional geometry, topology and dynamics, there\r\nis a remarkable depth of interconnection between fields of\r\nmathematics. Henri Poincare, who studied both celestial dynamics and\r\ncomplex analysis (among many other things), observed in the 19th\r\ncentury that the standard round sphere, the setting of classical\r\nanalysis and geometry, functioned also as a \"horizon at infinity\" for\r\nan exotic non-Euclidean geometry that we now call Hyperbolic\r\nSpace. Dynamical properties of transformations of the sphere translate\r\nto geometric properties of rigid motions of this space, and give rise\r\nto families of symmetric tilings whose structure we can study by\r\ngeometric and topological methods.  The properties of these tilings,\r\nand the way in which they change when the tilings are varied through\r\nfamilies (or \"parameter spaces\"), are still linked to some of the\r\nmotivating questions about physical systems of which Poincare was\r\naware a hundred years ago. Issues such as classification of systems,\r\nmapping out regions of stability and instability, deformation and\r\nbifurcation of families of systems, and probabilistic properties such\r\nas ergodicity, all have significance in both pure and applied\r\nmathematics. In the setting of hyperbolic geometry, recent years have\r\nseen significant progress on these issues, with both theoretical\r\nadvances and computational approaches playing a role. This conference\r\nwill bring together leading researchers in this area and promising\r\nyoung mathematicians, to disseminate recent advances and continue work\r\non open problems.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
