 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will design and\r\nbuild the `Region 2' tracking chambers for the Qweak experiment at \r\nJefferson Lab.  This experiment will make a high precision measurement \r\nat very low momentum transfer of the proton's weak charge, which is its \r\ncoupling to the neutral Z boson.  A high precision value of the weak\r\nmixing angle at low momentum transfer will be extracted, thus providing\r\na sensitive test of the predicted energy scale dependence of this quantity\r\nin the electroweak standard model.  A failure to observe this expected\r\nbehavior could provide evidence for physics beyond the presently accepted\r\nStandard Model.  There are many candidate extensions to the Standard Model\r\nthat would generate observable effects in this experiment.\r\n\r\n  The Region 2 wire chambers are an essential component of the particle\r\ntracking system, which is needed in order to precisely measure the\r\nkinematics of the elastically scattered electrons, as well as for\r\ncritical studies of experimental backgrounds.  The chambers will consist\r\nof two sets of 50 cm x 50 cm horizontal drift chambers.  Each drift \r\nchamber will have a total of 6 planes of wires.  The expected resolution\r\nwill be about 200 microns, providing an angular resolution of < 1 mrad.\r\n\r\n  The Region 2 drift chambers will provide quality educational experiences\r\nfor both graduate and undergraduate students.  The timescale of the \r\nproject is well matched to the typical timescale of a graduate student's \r\ntime in graduate school, so the student will get to participate in all \r\nhardware and software phases of the project.  The tasks needed to \r\ncomplete the project include design and construction of the chambers, the \r\nfront-end electronics, and the gas handling system, testing of the finished \r\nproduct, implementation in the Qweak experiment, and data analysis and tracking\r\ncode development when the experiment takes data.  We expect to involve\r\ntwo graduate students and at least two undergraduate students in this\r\neffort, under the supervision of the faculty and senior research staff\r\nat Virginia Tech.\r\n",
