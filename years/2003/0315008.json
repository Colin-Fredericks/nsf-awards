 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sperm-female coevolution: mechanisms, models and theoretical implications.\r\n\r\nRecent work has demonstrated that the shapes of sperm and of the female\r\nreproductive tract evolve in concert.  This pattern is attributable to a\r\nprocess known as female \"sperm choice,\" with female reproductive\r\ntract characteristics producing a bias in patterns of paternity when\r\nfemales mate with multiple males, such as biasing fertilization in favor of\r\nlonger sperm.  Research proposed here will investigate (1) physiological\r\nmechanisms of female sperm choice, (2) possible benefits to\r\nfemales of having the ability to \"discriminate\" among sperm variants, (3)\r\ncosts and benefits to males of variation in traits that contribute to\r\nfertilization success, and (4) implications of producing few,\r\nlarge sperm for sex difference theory.\r\n\r\nDisparity between the sexes in the size of their sex cells is believed to\r\nbe the cornerstone of all sex differences (e.g., body size, aggressiveness,\r\nornamentation).  However, contrary to popular belief, males of all species\r\ndo not produce many tiny sperm.  In fact, sperm cells are the most diverse\r\ncell type:  in nearly all animal groups, they evolve in size, shape, and\r\nstructure so rapidly that even closely related species can usually be\r\ndiscriminated by their sperm.  Because having the correct species-specific\r\nsperm structure is pivotal for successful reproduction, sperm divergence\r\nmay function as an \"engine of speciation.\"  Understanding the causes of\r\nsperm evolution is thus important to our understanding of the biological\r\nbasis of sex differences and of the process of speciation.\r\n",
