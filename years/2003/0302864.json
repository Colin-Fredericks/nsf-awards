 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virtual Tutor for E-Learning Assessment and Feedback addresses the twin challenges facing distance education when used as a tool for educating the technicians of a high tech workforce.  The first challenge is the need for a hands-on laboratory experience to adequately train technicians.  The second challenge is the fact that the teacher is remote in space and/or time.  BrainFrame, a new intelligent tutoring system (ITS) software package developed by Stottler Henke Associates, will be adapted to automate the assessment and feedback component of the experiential exercises.  The ITS reduces the need for immediate access to a live instructor.  This tool will be embedded in the competency based virtual experiential exercises.  The 'smart help' of an intelligent tutor will enable the student to get help when needed without having to wait for a response to the course instructor at any time of the day or night.  Both assessment capability and feedback are incorporated in the Intelligent Tutor software and model.  Research indicates that learners using a virtual tutor compete favorably with classroom-based instruction.  The disciplinary focus of the exercises is topics in common between Controls Technology and Manufacturing Technology curricula.  The primary activity is the development of competency based experiential exercises for a virtual educational environment.  The primary audience is the distance education student of a two-year terminal degree program.  Additionally, there are many process plants located far from educational institutions whose employees and prospective employees could greatly benefit from a distance-education program leading to a technical degree.",
