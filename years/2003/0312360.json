 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yorke\r\n     A genome (the DNA in a cell) can be represented by a\r\nsequence of letters called \"bases.\"  A large genome can consist\r\nof billions of bases.  Chemical techniques allow scientists to\r\nread only a few hundred bases at a time.  The whole genome shotgun\r\n(WGS) assembly technique creates a draft of the sequence of a\r\nwhole genome by selecting such short fragments at random from the\r\ngenome, determining the sequence of the fragments, and then\r\ncomputationally re-assembling millions of these fragments.  Two\r\nfragments are said to \"overlap\" if it is plausible that they come\r\nfrom the same part of the genome, based on a comparison of their\r\nsequences.  The goal of this project is to focus efforts on\r\nproducing an extremely robust set of overlaps, using a\r\ncombination of sophisticated error-correction techniques, as well\r\nas \"localizing\" fragments to validate overlaps by ensuring that\r\nboth fragments come from the same vicinity of the genome.\r\nSeveral issues complicate the determination of which pairs of\r\nfragments overlap.  First, most genomes contain many \"repeat\r\nregions,\" i.e., two or more almost identical copies of long\r\nstretches of sequence.  Thus, two fragments that do not actually\r\noverlap may look like they do.  Second, the random sampling\r\ntechnique results in many base errors --- bases can be mis-read\r\nor missed entirely.  These errors, combined with the fact that\r\nrepeat regions usually differ slightly, make it very difficult to\r\ndistinguish a spurious overlap from a true overlap in which one\r\nor both fragments contain read errors.  Thus, if extreme care is\r\nnot taken, it is easy to use a spurious overlap and thereby\r\nmistakenly connect distant parts of the genome.  Preliminary\r\nresults in collaboration with Celera Genomics, the Baylor College\r\nof Medicine, and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have\r\ndemonstrated that the investigator's current techniques can\r\nalready produce more sequence at higher quality.  The goal is\r\nimprove these techniques and make them widely available.\r\n     The determination and interpretation of genetic information\r\nis one of the great challenges of the twenty-first century.  The\r\ngenome, i.e., all the DNA in a cell, is the molecular basis of\r\ndiversity and the cornerstone of genetic information.  Draft\r\ngenomes have been obtained for human, mouse, and some insects,\r\nfish, plants, and bacteria.  This is a start, but a full\r\nunderstanding of biological processes cannot be had by studying\r\nthe genomes of only a handful of species.  The federal government\r\nis spending about 100 million dollars per year generating\r\nsequence data.  Millions of small pieces of a genome are sampled\r\nfrom the genome.  The second stage is called \"assembly,\" when\r\nthese pieces are re-assembled on a computer like a giant jigsaw\r\npuzzle.  The puzzle is complicated by two facts: first, many of\r\nthe puzzle pieces have small errors that make them mis-fit\r\nagainst pieces that they SHOULD fit with; and second, many pieces\r\nthat should NOT go together actually fit together quite well.\r\nThis makes it extremely difficult to correctly assemble a genome.\r\nThere are two ways to decrease the ambiguities: first, one could\r\ngenerate more pieces.  However, each new piece costs about $2,\r\nand one would need to generate millions of new pieces to have a\r\nsignificant effect on assembly quality.  The investigators use a\r\nsecond route.  They attempt to squeeze as much information out of\r\nthe existing pieces as possible.  The latter route is\r\nsubstantially cheaper, and there is still much room for\r\nimprovement here over existing techniques.  The investigators are\r\nusing sophisticated mathematics to help discern with extreme\r\nprecision those pairs of pieces that do, and those that do not,\r\nfit together.  Preliminary results of the investigators -- in\r\ncollaboration with several large sequencing centers -- have\r\ndemonstrated that using their techniques to \"pre-process\" the\r\npieces can produce more of the genome, with fewer errors.  This\r\nproject aims at extending these ideas further and making them\r\nfreely accessible to all investigators.  The impact on the federal\r\ngenome (biotechnology) projects is potentially great.\r\n\r\n",
