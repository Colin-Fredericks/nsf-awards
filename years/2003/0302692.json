The PI and co-PI's postulate a multivariate model and 14 specific hypotheses around which their proposed research project is based.  Their general proposition is that many antecedent factors that have the potential to influence career retention operate through professional identification.  In terms of women and racial minorities, the researchers propose to determine which and/or if antecedent factors are experienced differently by members of these groups and how these differences influence attachment to the profession.  The antecedent factors they will study include:  (1) motivation for choosing the IT profession; (2) socialization into the IT profession; (3) self-efficacy regarding a career in IT; (4) experiences in the IT workplace; and (5) congruence of professional and other valued identities. \r\n\r\nThe researchers plan to use the cooperation of a number of employers of IT workers to identify and contact a panel of respondents in a program of original data collection.  They will develop a data collection instrument  that will be used to create longitudinal records on individuals at 3 time periods.\r\n",
