 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional design approaches that treat the processor node, network, and\r\nsensor/actuator subsystems as distinctly independent components do not\r\napply well to the domain of sensor webs.  This is a result of sensor web\r\nsystems being comprised of hundreds of thousands of small, autonomous\r\ndevices that dynamically engage or disengage in the generation of data.  \r\nNodes within these systems are deployed in an ad-hoc fashion, with no\r\na-priori knowledge of network and sensor/actuator connectivity.   \r\n\r\nThese new requirements call for a new machine model that more closely\r\nsupports the sensor webs unique operational and behavioral requirements.  \r\nThis research focuses on a holistic system-centric approach that\r\ndefines such a new integrated communications/computation machine model for\r\nsensor web nodes. The new machine model is expressed in terms of a Meta\r\ninstruction set architecture (ISA).  This Meta ISA defines primitive\r\nsystem operations, such as domain selections, data reduction, and\r\nbroadcast across ad hoc networks of nodes, much like the ISA of a CPU\r\ndefining the CPU's primitive operations.  The Meta ISA enables consistent\r\nand reliable system level operation for dynamically changing numbers and\r\nlocations of sensors, and supports multimode data fusion.   The Meta ISA\r\nexplicitly supports attribute based naming, which enables the dynamic\r\ncreation of unique knowledge domains across unknown numbers of\r\nheterogeneous sensor types.  A new routing protocol has is studied as an integral part of the integrated computation/communication model.   The protocol is active in\r\nissuing and decoding Meta instructions throughout the sensor\r\nweb and has been designed specifically to support attribute-based naming\r\nand formation of knowledge domains across large ad hoc webs. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project includes the development of an educational focus area in the engineering of computer-based systems.  Courses include embedded and real-time systems, sensor webs, run time software for embedded systems, and distributed systems.  The project is achieving impact for both graduate and undergraduate students by integrating the research agenda and results into the classroom, and focusing collaborative activities.  Software tools and hardware platforms developed in this project will enhance student laboratories for experimentation and projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
