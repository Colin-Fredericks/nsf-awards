 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the synthesis of new electrocatalysts from metallomacrocycles by the catalyzed pyrolysis of the complexes in mesoporous materials. It is anticipated that the approach will give rise to novel nanoparticulate carbon supported metals, which will be initially implemented in the advanced anode electrocatalysis of direct methanol oxidation fuel cells (DMFC) and in cathode electrochemistry as oxygen reduction catalysts. Thermal decomposition of these compounds is expected to result in atomic or small cluster metal active sites supported by and bound to nitrogeneous nanotube materials. Work proposed will consist of synthesizing the subject electrocatalysts followed by their electrochemical performance evaluation under representative proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell conditions for oxygen electroreduction and direct methanol oxidation.\r\n\r\nPotential customers for these technology include automotive companies.  In additon, application to stationary power sources is also possible.  Consequently, electric power utilities would find interest in the proposed technology as well as power for commercial and industrial installations.\r\n",
