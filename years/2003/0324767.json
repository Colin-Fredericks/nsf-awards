The general philosophy of the SRC is to present and promote cutting-edge research and new directions in statistics, as well as to foster discussion of current and future issues in statistical education and training. For many participants this conference provides an entry into new research topics. Young statisticians are thus afforded a broad view of current activity in the discipline in a relatively short time frame and small conference setting. The SRC in 2003 is a special and timely conference with the theme of \"Statistics in Genetics, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics\". As these areas are presently of high interest across many disciplines, it is expected that many fruitful collaborations will result among participants. Invited sessions will include statistical genetics, microarrays, genomics, gene networks, proteomic networks, as well as case studies and academic training programs. An opening session will provide background to relevant biological and statistical issues. A Contributed Poster session will highlight junior researchers, including graduate students. The conference website is http://www.stat.uga.edu/SRCOS/2003/src. The SRC will be small, approximately 60-80 participants, which will allow much interaction for the three working days of the conference.\r\n",
