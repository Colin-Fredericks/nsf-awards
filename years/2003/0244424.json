 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-funded LIGO instruments are rapidly approaching their design sensitivity goals.  At the same time, NASA is rapidly moving forward with research and development on the space-based antenna LISA, with the goal of a launch around 2010.  This award will support Hughes' work in gravitational-wave astrophysics and astronomy, looking to the time when detections are routine and these detectors can truly be regarded as observatories.  This award will support work in aspects of radiation reaction, gravitational-wave generation, black hole parameter measurement, neutron star disruption, and stellar collapse relevant to gravitational wave detection.  \r\n\r\nThe research supported by this award is very timely in light of the rapid progress that LIGO has recently made, and the explosion of interest in NASA's LISA mission.  The PI regularly speaks to broad scientific audiences on the promise of gravitational-wave science and its impending importance for astronomical studies.  The travel funds in this award will make it possible to continue this outreach, as well as making it possible to reach out more broadly to the interested public.  The award will also support graduate and undergraduate students.  Scientists trained in gravitational-wave astronomy typically develop a broad range of skills, making them valuable members of the scientific community.",
