Many cycle-sharing systems have been developed and have\r\ndelivered orders of magnitude improvement in available resources.\r\nNevertheless they are limited in their performance or capability.\r\nFurthermore, other forms of resource sharing and coordination\r\nare needed to achieve truly distributed access to scientific infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is contribute to the national science and\r\ntechnology infrastructure by developing enabling technologies for\r\nvirtual laboratories open to researchers from all disciplines. This\r\ninfrastructure will leverage resources in peer-to-peer computing and\r\nprogramming languages to deliver an alternative architectural model\r\nfor resource sharing over wide area networks. The self-organizing\r\naspects of peer-to-peer networks promise to eliminate much of the\r\ndifficulty required to configure and maintain a large-scale globally\r\ndistributed computing and control system, and decentralization removes the\r\npotential bottleneck and single point of failure of centralized\r\nservice nodes.  This project's contributions will be to provide\r\nabstractions for Peer-to-peer Computing based on extensions to the\r\nobject-oriented programming model and to develop a Peer-to-peer\r\nInfrastructure which extends the current peer-to-peer networks\r\ndeveloped for routing and data-centric applications.\r\n\r\nThis project will work collaborativey with the DARPA Program\r\nComposition for Embedded Systems (PCES) initiative to apply \r\nthe proposed resource-balancing techniques developed in this project\r\nto sensor networks and distributed real-time systems of national importance.\r\n\r\nThe educational impact of the proposed research includes integration\r\nof advanced distributed systems research into both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate curricula, and outreach activities that involve high schools\r\nstudents into active participation in Internet-scale computing.\r\n",
