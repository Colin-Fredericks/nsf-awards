 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grants have been awarded to Drs. Lee Krumholz, Cecelia Brown, Thomas Dewers, Mostafa Elshahed and Bruce Roe at the University of Oklahoma and Drs. Stefan Sievert and Kai-Uwe Hinrichs at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Massachusetts) to establish a Microbial Observatory for the characterization of novel anaerobic microorganisms from Zodletone spring, an oxygen-depleted sulfide spring in Southwestern Oklahoma. This spring is a unique environment that provides a habitat for a range of unusual and interesting microorganisms, most of which have not yet been cultured.  The overall goal of the proposed study is to determine the different kinds of microorganisms that inhabit the spring, study how these different microorganisms interact together and obtain cultured cells for more detailed studies.  These scientists will focus on understanding the physiological function and ecological roles that these microorganisms fulfill in their natural environment.  To achieve these goals, they will first identify members of the spring microbial community via sequencing of specific genes that are typically used to determine evolutionary relationships among microorganisms, or to indicate a specific metabolic function.  Secondly, they will focus on novel groups of microorganisms encountered at the site.  Large fragments of the genome of these microorganisms will be sequenced and genes identified to determine the nutritional and ecological characteristics of microorganisms from the spring.  The architecture of the microbial community will be studied using a combination of molecular methods and microscopy to provide a three dimensional picture of microbial populations.  Based on the data obtained from gene sequences, they will attempt to cultivate many of these so far uncultured microorganisms and perform an in-depth analysis of the metabolic capabilities of individuals under controlled growth conditions.  \r\n\tThroughout the project, scientists at the University of Oklahoma will engage in educational activities with the public schools in the rural area surrounding the sulfur spring (Kiowa and Caddo Counties) and in Norman, OK.  They will provide hands-on activities to develop and promote scientific reasoning and critical thinking skills in high school and middle school students.\r\n        The project will provide a clear picture of the diversity of life in a very interesting environment. Zodletone spring lies on the land surface, yet because of the chemistry of the water, it is devoid of atmospheric oxygen.  This situation is extremely rare in current times yet was common in ancient (Archean) geological ages. Therefore, much of the data produced could be extrapolated to understand microbial life in these ancient times and the impact of microorganisms in shaping the earth's geological history. \r\n\r\n",
