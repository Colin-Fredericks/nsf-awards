 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kansas EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Award focuses on living systems to leverage existing research strengths in ecology, genetics, and biochemistry.  Two new thrust areas are targeted: one at the interface of ecology and genetics and the other in the emerging field of lipid profiling (lipidomics).  The University of Kansas (KU), Kansas State University (KSU), and Wichita State University (WSU) will participate.  The first new area focuses on functional genomic approaches to study organismal response to environmental change, and builds on the new emphasis on developmental genetics and genomics at KU and KSU.  Kansas EPSCoR will expand existing and launch new interdisciplinary projects, recruit new faculty members focusing on ecological genomics, hire bioinformatics specialists to develop methods to mesh gene expression and ecological data, and develop a training program in ecological genomics.  The second new area involves the establishment of a lipidomics research center for systematic studies of the role of lipids and lipid composition of membranes in living systems.  Researchers in plant, animal, and microbial sciences at KSU, KU, WSU, and other institutions will use the center's capability.  Enhancements in the bioinformatics infrastructure will assist in the development of the two thrust areas.    \r\n\r\nFaculty hires in ecological genomics will complement existing expertise in the state.  In conjunction with the research infrastructure enhancement, Kansas EPSCoR plans a range of education and outreach activities, from elementary school to postdoctoral and early career faculty training.  In collaboration with Emporia State University, Kansas EPSCoR will help to plan and implement conferences and workshops for young women considering careers in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM).  Haskell Indian Nations University will place students in summer research programs at KSU, KU, and WSU, with the support of Kansas EPSCoR.  Additional collaborations are planned with community colleges and the McNair program.  Kansas EPSCoR will support graduate research assistants, post-doctoral fellows, and early career faculty in living systems research.  Finally, a series of symposia, seminars, and workshops will build an integrated education and research program in ecological genomics and lipidomics.\r\n",
