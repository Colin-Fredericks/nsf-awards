 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) In recent years, computer and information security issues have become increasingly significant for business, industry, and government, leading to an immediate need for increased computer security education through undergraduate level computer science curricula. This project meets this need through four objectives: first, by developing a sophisticated heterogeneous computer and information security laboratory; second, by adapting and developing computer and information security curriculum (stand-alone courses in computing/network security and applied cryptography, as well as individual and separate course modules) to better train students in computer security; third, by using this laboratory and curriculum as the foundation for a formal application by UW-Eau Claire to become a Center for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education, as certified by the National Security\r\nAgency; and fourth, by accomplishing the three objectives above by making optimal use of existing departmental, university, and private resources. These objectives are accomplished at UW-Eau Claire through the adaptation and further development of a laboratory model and curriculum previously implemented at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). \r\n",
