These include different workshops for school administrators and teachers preparing them to support student research and venues for students to present the results of their research.  Perhaps even more importantly it will provide an alternative path for assessment of districts' STEM educational goals.  The 25 years of Utica College's support and programming of student research activities will provide a rich background for assessment of the effectiveness of student learning in science, mathematics and technology through such activities.",
