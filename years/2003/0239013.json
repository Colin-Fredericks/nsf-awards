 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThe mission of this CAREER program is (1) the creation of \r\nelectrode structures that enhance the reactivity and stability of \r\nenzyme bioelectrocatalysts as implemented in high power-density \r\nbiofuel cells, and (2) the integration of these and other fuel-cell \r\ndevices into a broad spectrum of education and outreach to promote \r\nconcepts of engineering product design and new energy systems in \r\ncommunities, schools, and universities.\r\n\tBiocatalytic fuel cell technology has the potential to \r\nprovide electrical power in conditions where conventional fuel cell \r\nand battery technologies fail.  While key characteristics of redox \r\nenzymes, including selectivity and room temperature activity can be \r\nexploited in, for example, physiologically implantable fuel cells, \r\nimplementation of current biofuel cells is hindered by low catalytic \r\nactivity and low stability of biocatalytic electrodes.  This program \r\naddresses both of these issues. \r\n\tThe model system to be studied is an oxygen-reducing \r\nelectrode comprised of porous carbon coated with a crosslinked \r\nelectrostatic adduct of laccase, an oxygen-reducing enzyme, and an \r\nelectron-conducting redox polymer hydrogel.  Engineering the porous \r\nsupport and its interface with the mediator/enzyme hydrogel to \r\nmaximize gel distribution will improve enzyme utilization and \r\nincrease current density.  Support structures with porosities near \r\n95% and fiber diameter of order 1 micron or less, consisting of \r\ncarbon nanotubes or electrospun carbon nanofibers, will be evaluated \r\nfor impact on catalytic activity of the enzyme-hydrogel adduct. \r\nGas-diffusion electrodes will be developed which take advantage of \r\nhigh-rate oxygen mass transfer in the gas phase to further increase \r\nelectrode catalytic activity.  The issue of stability will be \r\naddressed by encapsulation of the biocatalysts in porous silica or \r\nother metal oxide by means of sol-gel, aerogel, and wet gel \r\nprocessing.  Through-film electron mediation will be enabled using \r\ncarbon nanotubes and redox polymer mediators.\r\n\tSuccessful introduction of fuel cells to the marketplace \r\ndepends on an available workforce of qualified scientists and \r\nengineers, and the acceptance of fuel cells by energy consumers. \r\nMoreover, the chemical engineering discipline as a whole is currently \r\nundergoing a transition from process-oriented design to design of \r\nchemical products, of which fuel cells are an excellent example. \r\nThis CAREER program addresses these needs through educational \r\nactivities emphasizing new energy systems and engineering product \r\ndesign.  Educational programs will include (a) A community-based, \r\nhands-on after school program in Energy Systems for disadvantaged \r\nhigh-school students; (b) An enhanced introductory Chemical \r\nEngineering course for first-year engineering students presenting the \r\nconcepts of product design through reverse-engineering and team-based \r\ndesign projects; (c) An advanced Electrochemical Energy Systems \r\ncourse for graduates and senior undergraduates; (d) Immersive \r\nresearch training for secondary, undergraduate, and graduate \r\nstudents. \r\n\tThis program advances the knowledge and understanding of \r\nbiofuel cell design while promoting training and learning of chemical \r\nproduct engineering in the context of energy systems.",
