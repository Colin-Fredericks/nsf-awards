 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bertram\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues study the behavior of\r\ninsulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells.  These cells display a\r\nwide range of complex dynamics that are best understood with the\r\naid of mathematical modeling and analysis.  The investigator has\r\nrecently developed a new mathematical model for beta-cells that\r\npostulates an intracellular calcium subspace compartment located\r\nbetween the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane.  This\r\nmodel is based on recent data from a collaborating lab, and is\r\nbeing further developed as new experiments are performed.  One\r\ndirection of development involves the investigation of complex\r\nelectrical bursting patterns that are often observed in\r\npancreatic islets and isolated beta-cells.  The investigator\r\ndetermines, through mathematical modeling, whether these complex\r\nrhythms are due to oscillations in glycolysis -- that is, whether\r\nthe coexistence of a membrane-driven bursting oscillator and an\r\nendogenous glycolytic oscillator is consistent with the published\r\ndata, and with data from collaborating labs.  One key question\r\nthat is addressed is whether these oscillators involving\r\nglycolytic rhythms can be synchronized by electrical coupling.\r\nThis is a necessary condition since beta-cells are electrically\r\ncoupled in islets.  Finally, the effects of stochasticity through\r\nchannel noise are investigated in both single-cell and islet\r\nmodels.  Channel noise is evident in the electrical patterns of\r\nsingle beta-cells, and suppression of this noise through\r\nelecrical coupling may play a key role in the more regular and\r\nslower bursting patterns observed in islets.\r\n     The study of pancreatic islets, composed of beta-cells, is\r\nimportant for a number of reasons.  From a clinical viewpoint,\r\nthey are key players in normal glucose homeostasis.  Because\r\nbeta-cells are the only cells in the body that make and secrete\r\ninsulin, their malfunction leads to type II or late-onset\r\ndiabetes, the most prevalent form of the disease.  To understand\r\nwhat makes the cells malfunction, one must first understand their\r\nnormal functioning, which is the primary aim of this work.  From a\r\nbiological viewpoint, beta-cells are of great interest as the\r\nfocal point of a number of biochemical and cellular processes.\r\nThey are similar in many ways to neurons, but have more complex\r\nbiochemical regulatory mechanisms.  Thus, information gained from\r\nthe study of beta-cells largely transfers over to neurons, as\r\nwell as other secretory cells.  Finally, from a mathematical\r\nviewpoint, beta-cells display rich dynamics that can only truly\r\nbe understood with the aid of mathematics.  Modeling and anlysis\r\nof beta-cells has led to new mathematics, most of which can and\r\nis being applied to the study of other bursting nerve and\r\nendocrine cells.  The investigator involves graduate and\r\nundergraduate students in the project, providing them with\r\nresearch opportunities at the important interface between\r\nbiological and mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\n",
