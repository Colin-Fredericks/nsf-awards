The workshop will investigate building secure software, including topics such as software risk managment, programming languages and platforms, auditing software, design for security, security flaws, and testing for security.  The workshop will also investigate application security, including topics such as sandboxing code, protection against malicious code, locking down executables, monitoring programs as they run, enforcing software use policy with technology, and dealing with extensible systems.",
