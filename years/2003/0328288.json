 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the paradoxical position Arab Americans hold in relation to race/ethnic paradigms in the U.S., the group constitutes a strategic research site to the study of contemporary immigration and the social construction of race/ethnicity.  While Arab Americans are classified as white in the US census and other official forms, very little is known about how members of the group relate to whiteness as both an identity and a social position. The purpose of this study is to explore racial/ethnic identity among a group of Arab immigrants who occupy a specific economic position as small business entrepreneurs in Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan.  The study will explore the immigration and employment experiences of members of the group and describe the factors that are associated with entrepreneurship as a career trajectory.  It seeks to describe the ways in which Arab immigrant entrepreneurs define their race/ethnic identity in relation to the US system of racial categorization and a white/black dyad. It will also attempt to delineate whether and how business location - Detroit's inner city versus Dearborn's ethnic enclave - and gender shape racial/ethnic identity. We will employ a qualitative research design relying on participant observation and in-depth interviews with male and female business owners.  Dearborn and Detroit provide an ideal site to carry out a study of this nature given that Arab immigrants are structurally incorporated into the two locations in two distinct forms: as middleman minorities in the predominantly African American city of Detroit and as owners of ethnic businesses in a viable ethnic enclave in Dearborn.  The broader impact of this study lies in its potential to contribute to the expansion of theoretical frameworks on immigrant entrepreneurship and ethnic economies, to contribute to the literature on immigration and race/ethnic identity construction and to the literature on whiteness, and to offer an alternative narrative about the experiences of Arab immigrants in the US, a group that is currently the subject of much attention.\r\n\r\n",
