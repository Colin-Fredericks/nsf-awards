 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical issue for t e development of future network and distributed system technologies is the availabil-\r\nity of testbed infrastructure for conducting research.Availability as three components.First,it requires\r\nthat testbeds provide a set of diverse and modern networking resources in realistic scenarios:environments\r\nthat include PCs,(potentially mobile)wireless and sensor nodes,commercial-quality switches and routers,\r\nand modern network interconnects.Second,availability requires software to e .ectively manage the use of\r\nthese resources:this requires providing \"hardware level\" access to experimenters,through a uni .ed and re-\r\nmotely accessible user interface,in a manner that also ensures security both inside and outside experimental\r\nenvironments.Third,availability requires infrastructure for experiment manipulation,monitoring,measure-\r\nment,and validation:e.g.,the ability to inject network tra .c and faults,the ability to obtain precise data\r\nfrom experiments,and the assurance that the testbed is an accurate model of the real world.\r\n\r\nThe work described in this proposal is to build on the University of Utah 's Netbed to address the three\r\naspects of availability described above.The 165,000 line Netbed software system is e .ectively an operating\r\nsystem for experiments in distributed systems and networking.The bulk of its code is independent of\r\nthe network 's actual mec anisms,so it presents a common interface to experimenters across a variety of\r\nmec anisms,including real networks,emulated networks in a cluster,and simulated networks.Netbed 's\r\nsupport for ybrid experimentation allows .exible combinations of real code,abstracted tra .c generation,\r\nsynthetic network environments,and real networks.Emulab Netbed 's primary resource,is an extremely\r\nsuccessful 170-node,time-and space-shared automated cluster testbed that as been in 24/7 production use\r\nfor several years.Netbed is currently being used by 440 researchers,from 50 institutions,for over 80 projects.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will provide deliverables in four areas.First,the existing Emulab cluster and its\r\ninterconnect will be enlarged and modernized.Emulab will grow to provide continuing service to the public,\r\nincluding user support.The complementary Utah and Wisconsin facilities (WAIL)will be linked,allowing\r\nresource allocation and co-scheduling across them.This will provide a seamless transition from simulation,\r\nthrough emulation on PC-based routers,to large-scale testing on real routers.Second,Netbed will be\r\nextended to control,as transparently to users as possible,many additional kinds of network devices and\r\ndeployments.Netbed will provide four di .erent platforms of wireless,sensor,and mobile devices,ranging\r\nfrom a .xed array of wireless nodes (a \"tabletop\" environment)to an actual set of mobile devices deployed\r\non a campus scale.The Netbed facilities will also be generalized with the addition of \"hard\" devices -\r\nIP routers,layer 1 switches,optical devices,Intel IXPs,and nodes deployed in the wide-area - as well\r\nas new \"soft\" devices suc as virtual nodes and links to enable experiments at 1 - 2 orders of magnitude\r\ngreater scale.Third,the Netbed system,speci .cally the Emulab cluster,will be \"hardened\"  so that,when\r\ndeployed,it can safely quarantine malicious code while still being remotely accessible to researchers.The\r\nenhanced Emulab will be able to serve as a testbed for most network security researc and evaluation,suc\r\nas worm containment,IP traceback,intrusion detection,and counter measures for denial-of-service (DoS),\r\nand distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)attacks.Support for researc in these areas will require Emulab to\r\nsupport osts running Microsoft Windows.Fourth,new software will provide a comprehensive system for\r\nrealistic network tra .c generation,network tra .c measurements,and a measurement arc ive.A wide area\r\nnetwork monitoring system and measurement archive will provide important data to Netbed researchers and\r\nthe community at large.It will also serve as the primary source of data from whic we can validate our\r\nmodeling and test e .orts.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the creation of new technologies for networking and\r\ndistributed system experimentation.This work will develop new techniques for integrating widely varied\r\nresources,both actual and simulated,both hardware and software,within a single and uni .ed experimental\r\nframework.This work will be realized in an expanded Emulab cluster,whic will continue to be available to\r\nresearchers,and it will also be realized in Netbed 's software that can be used by other institutions that wish\r\nto run their own testbeds - separately,or in cooperation with Netbed.This ties directly to the broader\r\nimpacts of the proposed work.The creation and delivery of an expanded Emulab,as well as the software\r\ncapable of managing similar testbeds,will result in new testbeds and new testbed capabilities being made\r\navailable to researchers worldwide.This will directly advance the development of future systems,as well as\r\nthe teac ing and training of students and computing professionals.",
