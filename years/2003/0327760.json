NSF financial support will cover the costs of annual visits by the US investigator and his students to the United Kingdom to implement the joint research. The investigators propose to develop a new framework for logic program analysis.  The research focuses on (1) designing, implementing and evaluating backward logic program analyses and (2) developing program analyses that provide useful information in program debugging and compilation.  The US principal investigator and his British colleague have worked together previously on backward analyses for logic programs.  In continuing their efforts, they propose to demonstrate the framework's applicability to new programming environments. \r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to the collaboration expertise in the fields of logic programming and semantic-based program manipulation.  This is complemented by Dr. King's expertise in theoretical computer science, in particular programming language research. Their findings will help improve software development environments for logic programming. \r\n",
