 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our overall objective in this Major Instrumentation proposal is to acquire a unique Scanning Hall Probe Microscope (SHPM). This instrument has exceptional magnetic field imaging and sensing capabilities and has a number of important advantages:\r\n1. It is non-invasive, as the probe itself is non-magnetic.\r\n2. It measures magnetic field directly rather than field derivatives (as in MFM).\r\n3. Its sensitivity at low temperatures is already compatible to the best micro-SQUIDs.\r\n4. It has scanning capabilities and (in contrast to a micro-SQUID) can operate in large external magnetic fields. In collaboration with the Microscope manufacturer, NanoMagnetics Instruments, we will further develop SHPM sensitivity, ultimately allowing single electron spin detection. In particular we propose to do measurements of a single spin in a quantum dot. The implementation of this stage will result in a truly unique instrument with outstanding reaching capabilities.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\nThis work, if successful, will establish the new basis for nanofabrication of unique\r\nnanostructures with potential application in intelligent characterization of molecules and manipulation of single charges. The acquisition and development of SHPM will allow the faculty from several different departments at WSU (Physics, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering) to integrate the multidisciplinary research and student training. To compliment the research programs the PI and the Co-PIs will use SHPM in the development of a pilot program to introduce a Senior Research Project at WSU as a required part of the curriculum. The instrument will also help broaden the participation of undergraduate in the current NSF- funded IGERT and REU programs and will also be indispensable in the graduate interdisciplinary course, Materials and Characterization Techniques and of a new graduate course \"Magnetism, Magnetic Devices and Nanotechnology\".\r\n",
