 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biotechnology Institute, through its Minority and Indigenous Fellows program will conduct a conference for 40 minority and indigenous students and faculty (Fellows) and their mentors preceding the 2003 Biotechnology Industry Organization's annual international convention in Washington, DC.  The program is designed to broaden the information base of research students who are unfamiliar with industry practices, so that they are better prepared to make important career decisions. Faculty Fellows have opportunities to interface with industry colleagues to become better prepared to advise their students and to create greater opportunities for their students in terms of internships and collaborations.  The two-day conference provides a deeper grounding in new and emerging technologies, industrial entrepreneurship, and curriculum development in biotechnology, and related sciences.  Fellows are provided with insights into the practical aspects of biotechnology business, such as the process of drug and device development, staging of companies, organizational features, R&D drivers, future prospects, impacts of new technologies, regulatory issues, transitioning to commercialization, and product cycling.  The Biotechnology Institute is committed to increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in biotechnology and related scientific fields. This year, the Institute is expanding the scope of the program to include a core of researchers from the biotechnology industry who will make a one-year commitment to act as mentors and participate with their Fellow at the two-day conference and at the BIO Convention. The  mentorship provides a rich resource of contacts and opportunities for faculty and  student Fellows.\r\n\r\n",
