 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract.\r\n\r\n\"Laminations, foliations and flows in 3-manifolds\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEssential laminations and Reebless foliations are \r\na basic and fundamental tool in the study of 3-manifolds. \r\nTheir use yields deep results concerning 3-manifold topology\r\nand they are also related to the geometrization conjecture\r\nfor 3-manifolds. One goal is to analyse the existence\r\nquestion for laminations in 3-manifolds, particulary for\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds. The PI has recently shown there\r\nare infinitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds which do not \r\nadmit essential laminations. A natural question is how \r\ncommon are essential laminations. The project will \r\ninvestigate Dehn surgery on torus bundles over the circle\r\nand general surface bundles and also special types of\r\nlaminations/foliations. The project will also consider\r\nmore general structures, such as loosesse laminations and\r\nwhich properties they have. Another part of the project is\r\nto understand the geometric behavior of foliations and\r\ntransverse pseudo-Anosov flows in hyperbolic 3-manifolds \r\n- which is a very large class of manifolds. The focus will \r\nbe on the large scale geometric behavior in the universal \r\ncover, which is fundamental for such manifolds. An important \r\nquestion is whether such flows are quasigeodesic - this is \r\ntrue in certain cases by previous work of the PI and Lee \r\nMosher. One goal is to use the quasigeodesic property for \r\nthe flows to derive information about the asymptotic behavior \r\nof the foliation transverse to the flow. This is specially\r\npromising in the case of general finite depth foliations.\r\nAnother goal is to connect these properties with the universal\r\ncircle of the foliation - establishing a link between the global \r\nstructure of the  foliation and the global geometry of the\r\nuniversal cover. Another project is to study properties of\r\nlimit sets of leaves of foliations in hyperbolic manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe project aims to better understand 3-manifolds.\r\n3-manifolds are widely used in the sciences: for example\r\nknots and their properties are very relevant to DNA\r\nresearch. 3-manifolds are also used to get mappings of the\r\nbrain and in other visualization techniques. Understanding\r\n3-manifolds can lead to progres in these other areas.\r\nThe project focuses on laminations and foliations, which\r\nare an essential and currently extremely dynamic area in\r\nlow dimensional topology. The proposed projects will have \r\nan effect on some main research directions in the area.\r\nOne important goal is to attract students and postdoctoral \r\nresearchers in this exciting area.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
