The topics include meteorological hazards such as hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, tornadoes, fires, droughts; geological hazards, including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions; hydrological and marine hazards, for example tsunamis, storm surges, floods, sea-level rise, and marine biological hazards; and technological hazards, including air and water pollution. The participants supported by this award include key persons as well as junior members of the U.S. natural hazards research community. Their participation at this symposium is critical for fostering cooperative research efforts. Research in natural hazards, and in particular tsunami research, has become increasingly international in its focus. Strong international cooperation is necessary since tsunamis, for example, can affect not only the region near the source but also distant regions through propagation across oceans.\r\nFindings from this symposium will be disseminated to U.S. researchers in natural hazards.",
