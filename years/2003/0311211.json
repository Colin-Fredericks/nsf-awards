 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) The broad, pedagogical objective of this project is to enhance student learning of environmental systems by introducing modern, sophisticated instrumentation into discovery-based exercises at all levels of the curriculum. A DX-320 ion chromatograph (IC) is being purchased and installed at DePauw.  NSF-supported projects at Calvin College, Coe College, Bates College, and other small, undergraduate schools are the models being adapted.  The successful methods and materials developed at these institutions are being adapted and implemented into introductory and advanced courses in Geology, and supporting student research in Geology, Chemistry, and Biology.  The IC is also being used in the newly introduced Environmental Geoscience major. The goals of this project are 1) to improve non-science majors' understanding of environmental systems and to increase the science literacy of all students, 2) to train environmental geoscience majors in the use of standard analytical instrumentation, 3) to develop critical thinking skills about instrumentation and data analysis at all levels of the curriculum, 4) to increase the diversity of research projects available to students, and 5) to support teaching and student research projects in other science departments. The effectiveness of the IC and its impact on enhancing student understanding of environmental systems is being determined using quantitative and qualitative assessment techniques. The materials and exercises developed during this project are being made available for global distribution through the DePauw's web site, student presentations at regional and national meetings, and publication in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n",
