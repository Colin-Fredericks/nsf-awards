 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from an EPSCoR state, involving interdisciplinary research in nanotechnology, nanodevices, materials science, chemistry, biomedical engineering, and related fields, aims at acquiring a high resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The project investigates the properties of nanostructural materials and devices in an experimental setting. TEM will be used, among other research, to obtain images of membrane surface features with atomic resolution permitting the characterization of physical and chemical properties of a membrane surface in order to develop more efficient water treatment membranes and will also be used to study corrosion behavior for the study of long-terms behavior of steels under stress. The infrastructure will support projects such as:\r\n\tNanostructural Materials and Devices,\r\n\tColloidal Membrane Fouling,\r\n\tMaterials Interface and Nanomaterials Research,\r\n\tLong-Term Stability Rock and Steel Sets - Corrosion Aspects,\r\n\tHydrogen and Nitrogen Interactions of Zr2Fe Hydrides,\r\n\tImaging and Solidification Interfaces, \r\n\tTotal Synthesis of Benzenoid Nanostructures,\r\n\tSensitized Microstructures During Aging in Alloy 22 for Nuclear Waste Package Containers,\r\n\tMicro / Nano Polymer Gels,\r\n\tGrain Growth Study of Metal Oxide Nanomaterials for Catalysts Applications, and\r\n\tNanostructures Ti3SiC2/SiC composites obtained by Field-Assisted Combustion Synthesis.\r\nEducational activities with graduate and undergraduate students, including three courses utilizing the microscope for training and teaching, are planned. Moreover, research collaboration with the private sector is envisioned.\r\n",
