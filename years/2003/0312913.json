 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a program on nanostructured organic-inorganic hybrid material from AB diblock and ABC triblock copolymers, the PI proposes research in one of the most promising and rapidly emerging research areas in materials science.  Two areas of research are described.  First, studies on bicontinous cubic hybrid phases are proposed which involve the formation of magnetic crystalline moieties within confined environments.  THis mimics a strategy of living organisms to build skeletal parts through formation of polycrystalline assemblies inside self-assembled matrices.  The work will elucidate fundamental questions about the stability of fascinating bicontinous cubic morphologies in organic-inorganic hybrids.  If successful, this part has the potential to lead to novel mesoporous materials for the efficient separation of proteins.  The targeted materials would have large, easily accessible pores and supoerparamagnetic nanoparticles embedded in the walls combining size exclusion and magnetic interactions for separation.  Second, the PI wants to explore how the polymer chemistry of AB diblock and ABC triblock copolymers can be exploited to exert unprecedented structure control on the molecular as well as the mesoscopic length scale of organic-inorganic hybrids.  If successful, this part of the proposed project could lead to more benign chemistries towards nanostructured silica-type materials that mimic natural systems (e.g., neutral pH and ambient temperatures).  It also has the potential to lead to dramatically improved morphology control that currently can not be obtained in top-down approaches.  For example, if similar morphologies as observed in linear ABC triblock copolymers could be realized, unique bulk mechanical properties are expected.  Furthermore, an expansion of the \"tool-box\" of nano-objects with controlled shap, size, and composition towards rings or helices could be achieved.  Both have potential impact on the field of nanotechnology.  The proposed program builds on the progress made over the last two and a half years in the PI's laboratory.  A particular strength of this proposal derives from the continuation of very fruitful interactions with several individuals at Cornell and abroad (Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research Mainz, Germany) that have outstanding reputation in their field.  The proposed research program is highly interdisciplinary.  It is positioned at the interface of two traditional areas of materials research, namely, polymer science and ceramics science.  It will thus provide student training and learning both in the fields of polymers science and solid state chemistry while simultaneously advancing discovery and understanding in the emerging field of nano-structured organic-inorganic hybrid materials.  Furthermore, the work is balanced between synthesis, characterization, and property studies so that the students will gain knowledge in a broad spectrum of techniques including anionic polymerization, sol-gel processing, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and solid-state NMR.  The project allows effective use of the infrastructure provided at Cornell, including work on a novel energy filtering electron microscope (EFTEM) enabling elemental mapping and at Cornell's High Energy synchrotron Source (CHESS) for high resolution x-ray studies.                                                                                                                                                          In parallel to the research program the PI proposes in collaboration with the Educational Program Office of Cornell's Center for Materials Research (CCMR) to expand the multifaceted outreach program that has been constructed over the past two and a half yeats in his group.  Cornell is situated in one of the poorest and least developed regions of the US posing a particular responsibility to Cornell faculty to help educate the public in Cornell' region and beyond in issues related to the science and engineering of materials.  The program will include components of training and development of human resources including the participation of underrepresented groups (training of postdoctoral researchers and students, in volvement of undergraduates, teacher programs, K-12 programs), efforts to enhance the infrastructure for research and education through facilities and instrumentation, and industrial outreach.",
