 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Rodney L. Honeycutt and Ms. April D. Harlin at Texas A&M University to examine worldwide patterns of genetic variation of the dusky dolphin.  This small and acrobatic dolphin occurs in deep waters off the coasts of the south island of New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Peru.  Genetic information in the form of DNA sequences will be used to estimate levels of genetic variation within each geographic region as well as to compare overall levels of divergence between regions.  The primary goal of the study is to reconstruct the genetic history of this widely distributed, yet highly subdivided, marine mammal in an effort to reconstruct events responsible for its current distribution and overall levels of genetic variation.  Furthermore, information from the dusky dolphin will be compared to related species occurring either in South America or other regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe research supported by this project has broader scientific merit and impact.  Unlike similar studies, this research pertains to an ecologically versatile and broadly distributed dolphin species, and the genetic information collected will represent the most thorough assessment of any small-bodied marine mammal.  In New Zealand dusky dolphins are the focus of an ecotourism industry of economic importance.  Genetic information from this species will be useful for developing conservation strategies in all parts of the species' range.  The proposed research also has a strong international component that will foster collaboration with scientists from several countries including Peru.  Additionally, activities supported by this grant will contribute to the career development and scientific training of underrepresented groups of graduate and undergraduate students.  Because dolphins are of general interest to the public, results from this research can be used for informal science education through the use multiple media sources and activities associated with K-12 education at the investigators'",
