 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over six months, the University of Texas at San Antonio will bring a team of high school mathematics and science teachers together with college and university mathematics and science teachers to align curricula. The objectives of the three-day seminar are: (1) to identify difficult topics in algebra and physics and design strategies to ensure mastery by all students; (2) to establish the foundation for an ongoing dialogue between K-12 and higher education; (3) to engage the broader business community in the articulation of the needs for science, mathematics, and technology skills for the future economic development of the city region; and (4) to develop a community campaign to encourage higher standards in mathematics, science, and technology.\r\n\r\nThis proposed activity will directly impact the entire 9 area San Antonio school districts and indirectly impact other urban school districts in Texas.  This effort is based on a documented need for providing curriculum alignment of high school math and science courses with college level courses.  This project focuses on aligning high school Algebra II with college algebra and developing strategies for teaching high school physics.  \r\n",
