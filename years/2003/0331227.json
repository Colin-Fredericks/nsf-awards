This grant designs laboratory exercises and a student research project that are based on seismograms recorded by a simple, inexpensive AS1 seismograph and on earthquake information available on the Internet from global monitoring of earthquakes. These learning experiences invite students into the world of scientific research by inquiry-based learning through investigation of what is recorded by seismographs.\r\n\r\nThe primary intellectual merit of this activity involves the revision and refinement of our work to date on developing authentic science experiences that engage students in solving real-world scientific problems. Working with partners in the Boston College Lynch School of Education, two Boston public high schools, and one middle school, we develop laboratory investigations to support student-centered research projects based on the AS1 seismograph. During the two years of this project, we are working closely with three target schools (two high schools, and one middle) in the Boston area, and the entire undergraduate elementary teacher population in the Lynch School of Education, as well as our undergraduate geoscience majors. At a minimum this involves approximately three high school science teachers and their students (about 400 students), 110 undergraduate elementary teachers, three middle school teachers and their students (about 300), and 20 undergraduate geoscience majors. However, through our outreach and dissemination components we are in a position to impact a much larger population.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work involves engagement of underrepresented minority populations in the doing of real hands-on science. Further, this work serves as a testing ground where we develop scientific activities that can be used in all high and middle schools in the state of Massachusetts. We are continuing the development of a series of authentic science laboratory exercises associated with our first-year introductory geophysics course for majors, to develop a student research project, and to extend these laboratory exercises and research project to two other populations: an undergraduate science course for prospective teachers in the Lynch School of Education, and two inner-city high schools (Brighton High School and Odyssey High School), and a middle school (South Middle School in Waltham, MA). These activities are based on seismograms recorded by the AS1 seismograph and on earthquake data available on the Internet.",
