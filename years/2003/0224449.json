Information grids and web portals for use of CAD tools are also enabled by the infrastructure for dissemination of collaborative research results and data, and for digital government services. From the availability of the portals and grid-computing resources benefits are expected in brain-machine interfaces, biologically-inspired nanocomputing, auction-based computing, distributed knowledge applications, medical imaging and data archiving, light-scattering spectroscopy, and mixed non-linear optimization. Collaborations include the Sigmicro microarchitecture center, NETCARE and the Purdue-hosted Nanohub (enabling users to run tools for computer architecture and parallel computing, and nanoelectrnics). The project impacts some minority serving institutions such as Chicago State and Florida A& M Universities and enables a testbed for a transnational digital government projects involving Carnegie Mellon University, University of Belize, University of Colorado, University of Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra of the Dominican Republic.\r\n",
