 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Phase  I  project  will develop  a  novel process  capable  of  high-volume  production  of  monodisperse  nanoparticles  of  arbitrary  metallic composition. Such highly-controlled materials are desired as components for engineered nanostructures. The  current  standard  precipitate  or  aerosol  processes  for  metal  nanoparticle  formation  are  limited  in available materials,  the  particle  size  distribution,  or  productivity.    In this  project an  adaptation  to  jetting processes  will be used  to enable  formation  of metal  nanojets  and  nanoparticles.  Because  this  is  entirely  a  physical process, it is expected to be able to be adapted to any metal alloy. second  The specific tasks  of the project will inolve survey   of possible approaches, analyzing the proposed process, and preparing the preliminary design of the key parts of a prototype apparatus.  The  objective  is  a  system  capable  of  the  precise  formation  of  nanojets  and  monosize nanoparticles at rates greater than one gram per second.\r\n     Commerically, there  are  many  possible  long-term applications  for  metal  nanoparticles.  Nanoelectronics and high-density data storage are two appealing examples.  The established markets for the technology described with the most initial opportunity relevant to this proposal appear to be in the following  fields:  solid  propellants,  explosives,  and  catalysts.    Monodisperse  nanoparticles  will  allow \r\nmechanical packing into ordered array structures for filtration.  The high surface area of nanoparticles enables  their  use  as  substrates  for  catalysis  of  chemical  reactions.    While  supported  by  these  initial markets, further innovation in many other markets and derivative technologies (such as oxide ceramic nanoparticles, and nano-patterning devices) will be developed from this new technology. This  technology  offers  a  means  of  producing  significant  quantities  of  monodisperse  nano-spheres  at  commodity  prices. It  also  enables  further  significant  innovations  in  nanoscale  fabrication, materials and processing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
