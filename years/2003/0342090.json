 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of two meetings to generate a robust annotation for nearly all of the genes of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome will be held at the Joint Genome Institute located in Walnut Creek, California. The work is to be initiated in October,2003, at a meeting of a group of domestic and international investigators and is to be completed during a second meeting (with only domestic participants) in March, 2004. The meetings also have other objectives: 1) to provide principal investigators, students, and post-doctoral fellows with training in the use of the genome browser and cDNA information; 2) to define changes and new features to be incorporated into the C. reinhardtii sequence and microarray databases; 3) to provide information for determining the usefulness of the different types of gene models available; 4) to summarize progress being made with respect to closing all sequence gaps along the genome; 5)to bring leaders of the community together to discuss the nature of the genome, and give students the opportunity to meet and interact with many of the top-level scientists in the field; and 6)to allow investigators to draft an outline of a manuscript describing the C. reinhardtii genome and to determine strategies to disseminate the information, making it readily accessible to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThese meetings will enable Chlamydomonas researchers to synthesize and organize the wealth of information generated about this model organism, and to determine what is necessary to optimize its usefulness to the scientific community, and thus to all of society, in the future. \r\n",
