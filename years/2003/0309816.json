 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project jump-starts an active learning approach to the computer science curriculum at Augsburg College by developing learning experiences involving the existing virtual reality laboratory. A newly designed upper division computer graphics/VR course moves CS majors from the comfort of the traditional lecture-based course to an experience that requires them to think on their feet, critically and quantitatively. At the other end of the curriculum, a module on graphics/VR is developed for the introductory course. How the active involvement will appeal to students who tend not to thrive in the traditional lecture-based classroom is tested and effects of this approach on retention documented. Undergraduate research projects, including developing a virtual data structures package and a virtual robotic environment paves the way for a wide range of undergraduate VR projects in the future. Intellectual merit lies in the research, particularly the development of the robotics environment. However, the emphasis of the project is pedagogical. The results on how this approach to teaching affects students of different learning styles make a useful contribution. Building on the department's existing strong minority recruitment program, the broader impact of increased retention of students from underrepresented groups who often have learning styles, which clash with a computer scientist's teaching style, is significant. Prof. Roger Webster of Millersville University, who uses a well-equipped VR lab in his undergraduate courses, is consultant on the project. Prof. George Bebis of University of Nevada, Reno is outside evaluator. This project is adapting model courses from a number of sources the most significant one is the Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality course developed by Professor Roger Webster at Millersville University in Pennsylvania.",
