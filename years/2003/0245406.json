The generating\r\nfunctions can be viewed as arithmetic analogues of theta functions\r\nand can be use to define arithmetic analogues of the classical\r\ntheta correspondence, now taking certain types of modular forms to\r\nelements of arithmetic Chow groups. One application is to prove a\r\nversion of the celebrated Gross-Zagier formula without base change\r\nthe L-function.   It is also hoped that one may\r\nultimately obtain information about higher dimensional analogues\r\nof the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer\r\nconjecture. Another part of the project is to use arithmetic of\r\ngenus two curves to study cryptography, which has very practical\r\napplication in electronic communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the later part of the 20th century significant advances were made \r\nin developing a `number theoretic' geometry, in which an additional \r\ndimension is added to carry information involving the interaction \r\nbetween the geometry and prime numbers. To a point on such a \r\nspace, one can attach a number call its height, which is a measure \r\nof its `arithmetic complexity'. More generally, heights can be defined \r\nfor higher dimensional objects, curves on surfaces, for example. The \r\npresent project studies combinatorial relations among such heights, \r\nwhich reflect hidden structure carried by the spaces of `number\r\ntheoretic' geometry. One of the most important part in electronic\r\ncommunication such as credit card processing is security, which is\r\ndone by means of cryptography. Since late 80's, it is found that\r\nnumber theory can be applied to obtain highly secure cryptographic\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
