 "awd_abstract_narration": "RF transceivers are one of the most critical parts of the high-speed wireless networks. Their silicon implementation will expedite global deployment of the wireless networks due to its low cost. For this reason, design of silicon RF transceivers has been a dynamic field of research past years. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the silicon technology, the research endeavor significantly advanced the state-of-the-art. Looking back on this past advance and anticipating the further advancement, it is deemed necessary now to address the fundamental limits and their underlying physical mechanisms in the silicon RF transceiver design, with which the proposed research is concerned. This research on statistical and soliton electronics, involving both theory and experiment, is ultimately aimed at leveraging the physical understanding to cutting-edge circuit innovations.\r\n\r\nStatistical electronics spans circuit design and statistical physics to tackle noise problems in RF receivers. Harnessing stochastic physics for innovative circuit design, the proposed research will focus on a novel phase noise self-quenching effect and its application to low noise oscillator design. On a fundamental level, the PI will undertake research on thermodynamics of oscillators and data converters. The research also includes application of stochastic resonance to design of wireless transceivers, where noise will play a constructive role.\r\n\r\nSoliton electronics concerned with overcoming speed limitations is an interdisciplinary investigation in the borderline of nonlinear science and circuit engineering. Soliton electronics utilizes pulse squeezing and soliton propagation in nonlinear transmission lines (NLTL) to generate and control ultra sharp pulses. The specific objectives consist of the NLTL characterization and design of NLTL-based self-sustained ultra sharp pulse generators.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research lies in providing understanding of the fundamental difficulties facing the continued expansion of the wireless networks. The proposed research will also add a new dimension to the integrated transceiver design, and high-speed electronics in general. The research is expected to broadly impact scientific instrumentation requiring ultra sensitivity such as LIGO.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator plans to train undergraduate and graduate students at interdisciplinary work in the area of statistical electronics and soliton electronics. The aim is to educate students to view progress in science and engineering from a broader perspective, appreciating the relationships across the disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
