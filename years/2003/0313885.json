 "awd_abstract_narration": "CITADEL provides an intellectual high ground for the education, training, practical application of information security and assurance. CITADEL trains students to become leaders, not merely practitioners, in the increasingly important field of information assurance and security. It also provides faculty enhanced opportunities to work with the best students and researchers at government agencies. CITADEL coordinates the efforts of New Mexico Techs CAE/IAE, Information Technology Program, the Computer Science Department, and NMT's ICASA (Institute for Complex Additive Systems Analysis) division. Each scholar's program will include the following: a customized course sequence to match the scholar's area of interest and research in information assurance and security; a research project and advisor in a research relevant area described; his or her personal supervisory committee (including research advisor); travel to a conference  to present research results; travel to summer SFS workshop (accompanied by both PIs); individualized placement in an OPM approved internship position; individualized placement in an OPM approved service position; professional skill development workshops and support; mentoring, including regular interaction with both PIs. To support information assurance and security in the CITADEL program, faculty have committed to providing the following expertise for research and advising: Adaptive Control and Dynamic Systems; Agent-based Financial System Modeling & Simulation; Applications of Soft Computing; Applied Mathematics; Non-financial Risk Modeling & Analysis; Complex Additive Systems Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis; Complex Systems; Conceptual Modeling; Cryptography; Ethical Issues; Financial Systems; Information Systems; Mathematical Programming; Network Security and Performance; Parallel and High Performance Computing; Software Integrity; Well-posedness and Sensitivity Analysis.",
