 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences Graduate Program (PCSP), a joint program from the School of Pharmacy and Department of Chemistry in the College of the Pacific at the University of Pacific in Stockton, California, is placing eight Project Fellows (graduate students) each year in grades 7-12 classrooms within San Joaquin County, California. Project partners include the San Joaquin County Office of Education, and retired scientists from UC Berkeley's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. Project objectives are 1) to enhance science lessons and labs with standards based inquiry approach provided by targeted teachers and Project Fellows, and 2) to complete a yearlong research investigation matched to grade level state science standards which involves students and is conceived, led and carried out through a collaboration between teachers, Project Fellows, master teachers, retired scientists, and faculty mentors (TEAM Science). TEAM Science combines excellence in teaching, an emphasis on inquiry and experimentation, and the important benefits of retired scientist and university faculty mentoring.  Eight teams recruited for each year of the project consist of two elementary grades 7-8 teachers, two 9-12 teachers, one retired research scientist, one Project Fellow, and one master teacher or university faculty mentor. Teachers recruited for the teams are a combination of non-, partial or newly credentialed teachers and experienced credentialed teachers. Each member of the eight teams participates in the following activities according to their role: 1) presentations on inquiry teaching and its application, and support for its implementation, 2) networking, ongoing support and coaching for Project Fellows and collaborating teachers and faculty, and 3) training in the research process which is enhanced through interaction with the retired research scientists including a final research project presentation at a university research symposium. Project participants are exposed to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification process, science careers, cutting edge content presentations; inquiry based teaching, and specific strategies for English language learners.  The teams represent a unique collaboration that brings together a blending of content and pedagogy expertise, teacher professional development leadership and school district involvement. Team meetings and training sessions during the summer and throughout the year target the building of a community of learners to enhance science content expertise and pedagogy for teachers and achievement for students with the assistance of graduate students, master teachers, retired scientists and faculty mentors.\r\n\r\nProject title:  Teaching, Experimentation and Mentoring in Science\r\nInstitution:  University of the Pacific\r\nPI/Co-PI: James Blankenship, Patrick Jones, Judi Wilson\r\nPartner School Districts:  San Joaquin County, Lincoln Unified, Linden Unified, Stockton Unified, Ripon Unified, Tracy Unified, Manteca Unified, Galt unified\r\nFunding: $ 1,466,807 total for 3 years\r\nNumber of fellows/year: 8 graduate\r\nSetting:  urban, rural, suburban\r\nTarget audience: 7-12\r\nNSF supported disciplines involved: biology, chemistry\r\n\r\n",
