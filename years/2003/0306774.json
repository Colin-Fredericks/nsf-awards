 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0306774\r\nOliver Dasbach\r\n\r\nIt became an important question in low dimensional topology whether one \r\ncan use finite type invariants of knots and homology 3-spheres to get\r\nmore insights into classical problems like the determination of the \r\nhyperbolic volume or the Property P quest. One of the goals of this \r\nresearch project is to apply and extend ideas and methods which are \r\nused in the theory of 3-manifold invariants, mainly quantum invariants \r\nfor knots and homology spheres, towards progress in the Property P quest. \r\nFurthermore, these methods are combined with tools coming from the \r\ntheory of Legendrian and Transversal knots. The aim is to get \r\ncombinatorial obstructions, that are structurally new, ensuring \r\nProperty P for a knot. In turn, tools that are natural from \r\na more classical topological point of view are applied to the study of \r\nquantum invariants.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been a huge step in the history of mankind to realize that the\r\nearth has the shape of a sphere, i.e. the surface of a ball, rather than \r\nit being a disk. Another possibility, for example, would have been that \r\nthe earth has the shape of the surface of a doughnut. Surfaces are\r\n2-dimensional objects, called 2-manifolds. One dimension higher, \r\none has to deal with similar problems. The understanding of how our \r\n3-dimensional universe could look like is much less developed. The \r\naim of three-dimensional topology is to study and classify the \r\npossibilities how the whole universe might be shaped. \r\nOne way to generate these, infinitely many, possible 3-manifolds is \r\nthrough knotted circles. One gets a new 3-manifold by taking out a small\r\nneighborhood of a knot in a 3-manifold and inserting it in a\r\ndifferent way. The problem remains, how to distinguish two different \r\n3-manifolds that arise that way. The work in this proposal studies \r\nthe effect that combinatorial and geometric properties of the knot have \r\non the structure of the resulting 3-manifold. Topology has been \r\nshown to be a natural and very fruitful source for applications \r\nin fields outside of mathematics. For example, knot theory has \r\napplications in the study of DNA functions, in cryptography and in the \r\ndevelopment of models for quantum computing.",
