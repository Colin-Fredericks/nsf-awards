 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAR-0320806\r\nKent\r\n\r\nSupport of the proposal will enable us to acquire a new electron microprobe for Oregon State University.  The primary analytical mission of the electron microprobe is to produce images and small scale chemical analyses of solid materials, including minerals, glasses, metals, bone, ceramics and many others.  Its greatest contribution to those diverse fields of endeavor is that combination of compositional and spatial information at the micron scale.  This new instrument will replace an instrument that has been the center of a university facility established 15 years ago to provide analytical services to the university and to provide a link to the local industrial community.  The facility management plan is designed to provide access to the widest number of people under the conditions that allow each of them to efficiently produce high quality data.  This aspect of the facility will be aided by a remote operation station at Portland State University (PSU).  A workstation plus control panel will be installed at the Department of Geology at PSU and linked by high speed internet connection to the microprobe at Oregon State in Corvallis.  This remote station will be used for teaching and research at PSU as well as for the development of additional links with the industrial community in the Portland area.  Maintenance of the main part of the electron microprobe (housed in Corvallis), sample change and monitoring of standards will be done by staff at OSU.  \r\n",
