 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate nanoscale magnetism and spintronics, in particular, systems of controlled self-assembled nanostructures. The objective is to investigate and solve outstanding physics problems that are both basic and essential to applications. We will develop a reliable fabrication process leading to excellent self-assembled nanostructures. We will explore magnetotransport in embedded nanocrystals lattices, in particular, the properties of magnetoresistance (MR) and extraordinary Hall effect (EHE). These systems may offer enhanced magnetotransport properties. The subject of magnetic interactions will be studied with the purposes of engineering magnetic switching fields and achieving large MR and EHE at low magnetic fields. These projects will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of properties of nanoscale magnetic systems. Nanoscale spintronics is important to the future competitiveness of the semiconductor industry in the United States. Our project will support graduate students. We will continue to recruit undergraduates and high school students to experience the wonder of the small world.\r\n%%%\r\nWe propose to investigate magnets and quantum spin dependent phenemena in nanometer sized magnets assembled in arrays through self-assembly processes and embedded in metals.  In these new systems, many physical properties defy interpretations using traditional theoritical understanding.  Our research is designed to foster better understanding of the physics involved and to develop a reliable fabrication process leading to excellent self-assembled nanostructures.  The electrical properties of these embedded nanocrystals such as magnetoresistance (MR) and extraordinary Hall effect (EHE) will be measured. These systems are likely to offer enhanced magnetotransport properties. The research will benefit the high-tech industries to overcome roadblocks, which impede the advancement toward smaller, thinner, faster, and cost-effective devices. Our project will support graduate students. We will continue to recruit undergraduates and high school students to experience the wonder of the small world. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
