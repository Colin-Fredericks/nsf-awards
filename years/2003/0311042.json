 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project adapts and extends the NSF-developed teacher enhancement materials, Operation Primary Physical Science (OPPS, ESI-9453926: http://www.phys.lsu.edu/dept/opps), for use in a physical science course for preservice elementary teachers.   The project uses the OPPS model and materials to develop curriculum that addresses physical science content, pedagogical knowledge, and skills to learn science.  This is accomplished through correlation of the OPPS material with reading activities using college-level physical science textbooks, incorporation of mathematical connections in support of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Principles and Standards, incorporation of content area reading strategies to strengthen comprehension of science materials, and incorporation of WWW and data collection and analysis technologies.  The project develops, tests, and assesses the impact of these materials locally.  It also serves to revamp our elementary pre-service science course moving it more effectively toward an activity-based course that helps teachers experience rather than merely hear about how science is taught.\r\n\r\nThis project provides information on the utility and transferability of excellent teacher enhancement materials to teacher preparation.  Insight into the incorporation of life-long learning strategies (i.e., content area reading) into the teaching and learning experience of preservice teachers is also gained.  Research indicates that incorporation of reading strategies facilitate comprehension in underrepresented groups in K-12.  The project provides a test at the college level.  Information from the project provides a starting point for similar innovations in other college science courses.   Information from the project is disseminated via a web site, and presentations at national meetings.",
