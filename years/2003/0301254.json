 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports, in part, a workshop jointly sponsored by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Intelligence Community that is designed to identify basic scientific opportunities that will significantly impact key technologies required for the U.S. to deal effectively with future terrorist threats.  This workshop will involve mathematical and physical scientists from academia, industry, and government laboratories, and will be held over a two and one-half day period.  Participants are being identified according to expertise in the five research focus areas of (1) energy sources, (2) sensors and detectors, (3) image reconstruction and analysis, (4) optical spectroscopies, and (5) mathematical techniques.  The outcome of this workshop is expected to be a report detailing the opportunities for scientific research that can positively impact on intelligence technology capabilities necessary for the detection and deterrence of future threats to national security both at home and abroad, along with a suggested timeline for their development.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activity are twofold.  Firstly, a list of key opportunities for scientific research and technology development to enhance the capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community will result, and secondly, a cadre of mathematical and physical scientists well informed in the current challenges and needs of the U.S Intelligence Community will be developed.  Both impacts are critical for the U.S. Intelligence Community to maintain the technological capability required for ensuring the nation's security. \r\n",
