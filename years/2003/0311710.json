 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase-Directed Architecture Optimization and Simulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA program's execution typically exhibits time-varying behavior, where architecture resources needed to obtain peak performance for the application can vary significantly over time.  We have found that this time-varying behavior has a repetitive pattern for most applications, which allows a program's execution to be broken up into phases, and we can then tailor a program's execution to each phase.\r\n\r\nThis proposal concentrates on developing efficient run-time architectures to capture and predict phase information. We will examine creating phase tracking and prediction architectures for power and energy architecture optimizations as well as to perform hardware code specialization based on phases for trace cache optimizations. Energy consumption can potentially be saved by dynamically re-partitioning many components in a processor (e.g., caches, issue and decode width, branch predictors) on an application specific basis, or selectively using different implementations of these components based upon the phase behavior seen in an application.  In addition, trace cache compiler optimizations will be performed for different phases to exploit phase-based behavior.\r\n\r\nFor broader impact, our phase-classification algorithms will allow researchers to efficiently identify, classify, and predict phase-based behavior in programs and use this information to guide their phase-based hardware, compiler, and operating system research.\r\n\r\n",
