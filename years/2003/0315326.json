 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the purchase of a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer. The instrument satisfies the current need for a versatile magnetometer that will be used by four groups within the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science (CEMS). The instrument will be employed in an array of projects including magnetic characterization of novel magnetic thin films and heterostructures, magnetic semiconductors, molecular solids, and magnetic nanostructures. This research is on structures that incorporate magnetic materials of many types, from organic magnets to conventional semiconductor and ferromagnetic metals, in a variety of configurations (magnetic semiconductor nanoparticles, single crystals and thin film heterostructures). It is this kind of engineering, where magnetic materials are incorporated into novel device structures, which has been so successful in terms of yielding useful magnetic devices such as Giant MagnetoResistance (GMR) multilayers, spin-valves, tunnel junction based Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) and integrated magnetic metal/semiconductor structures. The intention here is to acquire a workhorse instrument that elevates magnetic characterization capabilities to the level of the materials fabrication and characterization expertise at CEMS, while simultaneously strengthening teaching and education in this area. This is essential to the challenging work of developing materials for spin-electronic devices of the future. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed work lies primarily in the education and training of students in the interdisciplinary field of magnetic materials, an area in which the basic experimental skills are highly sought-after in many fields. These researchers will be from both Chemical Engineering and Materials Science programs at the undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate levels. In particular, undergraduate students will become actively involved with the research by taking advantage of the UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program) and REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) programs. \r\n\r\n",
