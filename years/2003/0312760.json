Goodrich\r\n\r\nThe project is directed at a subject area of critical importance to society--methods for efficiently maintaining the security of computations and computational resources, including the networks that communicate vital data. In addition, the work involves an important educational mission to integrate cyber-security algorithms into the undergraduate computer science curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on developing efficient algorithms for performing trusted computations in a networked environment.  Themes to be investigated include:\r\n\r\n* Authenticated data structures and algorithms: The project places special emphasis on methods for authenticating the results of data structures and algorithms, even when those computations are performed by an untrusted third party on behalf of a trusted source.\r\n\r\n* Audited algorithms: The project will explore a new computational framework in which computations are performed by a community of untrusted users, but this computation is checked by an external auditor with limited computational resources.\r\n\r\n* Democratic Trust Assurance: The project is also directed at infrastructures for a community of peers who want to establish trust within their group.  Specific interest is in solutions that are practical and potentially applicable to grid computing, while allowing for multiple clients and servers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
