 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will hold a 3-day workshop in the spring of 2004 of about 30 participants to focus on quantification of N2 production via biological denitrification.  The objectives of this workshop will be: (1) to evaluate the state of our knowledge of denitrification rates in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (2) to compare methodologies that have been adopted by different scientific disciplines, with the expectation that collaborations across disciplines could yield methodological advances; and (3) to chart out the current weaknesses and the actions needed to address those weaknesses for an improved global assessment of where, when, and how much reactive N is converted to N2 in the biosphere.  Two important considerations will be superimposed over a matrix of ecosystem types and methodological approaches: (1) What are the appropriate scales over which N2 production can and should be measured?; and (2) How can models be integrated with the measurements to improve mechanistic understanding of the processes and permit estimation of fluxes at larger spatial scales, longer temporal scales, and across a range of forecasted scenarios?  The results of the workshop will be published as one or more synthesis papers in a peer reviewed journal. \r\n \r\nThe boarder impacts of this activity include an effort to direct scientific understanding of the N cycle toward finding solutions to society's concerns about eutrophication of the biosphere.  The workshop is being organized as an integral part of the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), a joint project of SCOPE and IGBP.  The overall goal of the INI is to optimize nitrogen's role in sustainable food and energy production, while minimizing negative effects on human health and the environment.  Hence, this workshop is part of an effort that has board implications for society by contributing knowledge to future management the global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security and environmental quality.",
