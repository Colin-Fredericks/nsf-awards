 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  With increased interest in nanoscale phenomena has arisen a need to understand how to synthesize and assemble the building blocks of nanoscale materials.  There is much information on the synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials, such as semiconductor or magnetic nanoparticles, and there is much information on the synthesis of organic macromolecules that exhibit nanoscale features, such as block copolymer microphase separation domains.  A significant challenge now is to create new nanosized building blocks that merge the useful optical and magnetic properties of inorganic nanomaterials with the versatile functionality, reactivity, self-assembly, and mechanical properties of organic nanomaterials.  The objective of the proposed research is the synthesis of polymer / nanoparticle building blocks that could be used to assemble more complex materials.  The specific aims of this proposal are (1) to develop initiator attachment strategies that are applicable to nanoparticles with photoluminescent and magnetic properties, such as CdSe and g-Fe2O3; (2) to further the science of brush synthesis including an in depth look at the polymerization of acrylates from nanoparticle initiators and the grafting of block copolymers from nanoparticle surfaces; and (3) to develop methods to graft reactive monomers from nanoparticle surfaces which can then be used to assemble patterns of nanoparticles on complementary functionalized surfaces or to build complex assemblies of nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  This research will contribute to knowledge about how to prepare and assemble matter on the nanometer scale.  Polymer layers will be grown from the exterior of nanoparticles that exhibit interesting magnetic and optical properties, and then the chemical functionality of the polymer will be used to interact the nanoparticles selectively with patterned surfaces and with other nanoparticles.  Such syntheses and assembly processes could be used as tools to construct devices with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to microns.  The resulting materials could also be used as components of biological and chemical sensors, materials for flexible and energy efficient displays, or magnetic resonance and optical imaging agents.\r\n\r\nThis research project will provide training and career advancement for graduate and undergraduate students in the important areas of polymer science and nanoscience, and the students will gain important research skills.  The PI and student participants in this project will also work to promote learning about polymer / materials science at the high school level through involvement in the COSMOS Program at UC Davis.  During one of the summers of the project period, the PI will design and teach a short course entitled \"Polymers and Everyday Things\" to be offered to the participating high school students.  Participating graduate students will help out with some of the laboratory exercises and field trips.  It is hoped that an early, stimulating experience with polymer / materials science will encourage more students to pursue studying science (and materials science) when they attend college.\r\n",
