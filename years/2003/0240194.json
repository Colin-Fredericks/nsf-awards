 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator project is focused on investigations of the electrodynamics of high-Tc superconductors in high magnetic fields using infrared (IR) spectroscopy.  Through the use of systematic spectroscopic measurements, in a challenging parameter space involving high magnetic fields, low temperature, IR frequencies, it is expected that some of the long-standing issues in the area of high-Tc superconductivity will be resolved.  Proposed measurements will focus on the examination of the vortex state in high-Tc materials, emergence of the electronic transport across the boundary of the insulator-superconductor transition as well as on the investigations of the normal state response in the regime where superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic field.  The integration of research and education within a challenging experimental project will aid the preparation of highly skilled personnel with expertise in the area at the merger of condensed matter physics, optics and materials science. Training of graduates will tremendously benefit from the use of national facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe origin of high-Tc superconductivity in the copper oxides is one of the central unsolved problems in contemporary physics. The search for the high-Tc mechanism involves a large fraction of the condensed matter community and has already led to entirely new concepts in condensed matter science. New initiatives described in this proposal will significantly advance our present understanding of the high-Tc phenomenon by way of addressing critically important questions. Specifically, the proposed program is aimed at detailed investigations of the electrodynamics of high-Tc superconductors in the previously unexplored parameter space involving high magnetic fields, low temperatures and infrared frequency range.  The research activities will naturally merge the boundaries of condensed matter physics, optics and material science. This particular combination has been identified as \"critical enabler\" of future technology that \"promises to have a pervasive impact on life in the 21st century\" in a recent report of the National Research Council. This challenging research program will serve as a unique training ground for graduate students.  NSF funding will broaden participation of groups currently underrepresented in graduate education. \r\n",
