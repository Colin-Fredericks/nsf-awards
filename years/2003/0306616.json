Jones\r\n\r\nMany problems in \"higher dimensional\" topology have been reformulated \r\nin terms of one or more of the following theories: homotopy theory; \r\nalgebraic K-theory; surgery L-theory; stable pseudoisotopy theory.\r\nIn an effort to better understand the latter three theories, Jones \r\n(in collaboration with F.T. Farrell) has formulated an \"Isomorphism \r\nConjecture\" for each of these three theories.  For example, the \r\nIsomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory gives a simple recipe \r\nfor computing the algebraic K-groups for the integral group ring of \r\na group G in terms of the algebraic K-groups for the integral group \r\nrings of all the infracyclic subgroups of G.  (A group is \"infracyclic\" \r\nif it is a finite extension of a cyclic group.)  Quite a bit is know \r\nabout the algebraic K-groups for integral group rings of infracyclic \r\ngroups; so the truth of the preceeding conjecture would help considerably \r\nin understanding the algebraic K-theory of all integral group rings.  \r\nAs part of this proposal, Jones intends to continue working towards \r\nverifying the Isomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory of the integral \r\ngroup ring of G, under the condition that the group G acts properly, \r\ndiscontinuously by isometries on a complete, Riemannian manifold which \r\nhas non-positive sectional curvature values everywhere.\r\n\r\nMathematicians study the structure of spaces by trying to find the \r\n\"genetic code\" for each space. The \"genetic code\" for a space usually \r\ncomes in the form of an algebraic gadget associated to the space; \r\ntypically there is a simple recipe for constructing the algebraic gadget \r\nfrom the space.  The hope is that two spaces having equal or congruent \r\n\"genetic codes\" should be equal or congruent as spaces.  One of the first \r\nalgebraic gadgets to be associated to a space is called the \"fundamental \r\ngroup\" of the space.  The French mathematician Henri Poincare introduced \r\nthis idea about a 100 years ago. The fundamental group of a space is \r\ncertainly an important ingredient in its  \"genetic code\", but there are \r\nexamples of many different spaces which have the same fundamental group; \r\nin these cases the fundamental group is not a complete \"genetic code\" for \r\nthe space.  About 50 years ago the mathematician Armand Borel (of the \r\nInstitute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.) conjectured that for an \r\nimportant class of spaces (called \"aspherical spaces\") the fundamental group \r\ndoes give the complete \"genetic code\" for the space; that is, two aspherical \r\nspaces with the same fundamental group are forced to be the same space.  Jones \r\nhas made some progress towards proving Borel's Conjecture, and will continue his \r\nwork in that direction.\r\n",
