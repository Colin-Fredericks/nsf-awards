 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project presents a new, creative approach to address student understanding of related material in different courses through the use of a multi-semester interwoven project to reinforce basic STEM material critical to solving engineering problems.  A strong laboratory component with multimedia and hands-on application of STEM material will reinforce theoretical concepts. \r\nThrough the use of a common problem for dynamic systems that spans across several courses (basic math skills, laboratory measurement and model development to predict dynamic system response), students are better equipped to solve a real dynamic system problem which requires the use of many STEM tools.  A strong laboratory component measuring a real system using a web-based data acquisition system requires the students to \"think outside the box\" and apply theoretical concepts through practical hands-on learning.  An open ended project forces the students to take ownership of learning material which integrates several themes and underlying STEM material promoting a life-long, self-learning process. \r\n \r\nThis interwoven project contains basic core STEM material that is easily transferable to all engineering disciplines as well as other institutions.    Since the project will \r\nresult  in  educational  material  online,  geographic,  ethnic  and  gender  barriers  will  be  overcome and will allow for universal access to the material.   This multi-semester, interwoven project concept with an online experiment is the salient feature of this program; integration of STEM material is accomplished in a relevant, meaningful way for student comprehension and retention. \r\n\r\n",
