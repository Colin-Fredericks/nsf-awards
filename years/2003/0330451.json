Also, this research will investigate the utility of this powerful and simple patterning technique for the fabrication of antibody microarray sensors for the sensitive detection of multiple biological agents.  The tunable biomolecules proposed here extends on ideas from nature, but toward entirely new objectives.  The protein-protein recognition exhibited by stimuli-responsive elastin biopolymers is tailored specifically into tunable hydrophobic interactions, which is exploited as a non-covalent method to reversibly immobilize biomolecules in a functionally active orientation directly to an array surface.  The end result is a simple and reversible patterning technique for micorarray sensor fabrication by thermally addressing a patterned hydrophobic surface template.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are several-fold.  This research will combine the multidisciplinary expertise of the PIs to develop a potentially reliable and economical technique for the fabrication of reversible microarray sensors.  The use of elastin biopolymer for immobilization has significant advantages over existing covalent coupling because regeneration of the immobilization pattern is possible simply by modulating the solution environments.  If successful, this technology will find applications in a variety of enzyme or antibodies arrays as well as the fabrication of DNA and protein microarrays for genomic analyses.  The proposed research involves the intersection of principles and methods of molecular genetics, protein engineering, material research, and process engineering.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers participating in this research will gain an integrated perspective of the important interfaces and synergies connecting biochemistry, modern genetics, and process engineering. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
