 "awd_abstract_narration": "We consider theoretical and numerical studies of two inverse problems:\r\n(a) Low frequency electromagnetic inversion, where we seek unknown\r\ncoefficients (electrical conductivity/permittivity) in elliptic\r\nsystems of equations, inside a bounded domain, given the Neumann to\r\nDirichlet map at the boundary. We explore the use of variational\r\nprinciples in the solution of such problems.  In particular, we wish\r\nto develop new, variational reconstruction algorithms and to study\r\nresolution limits (distinguishability). In numerical inversion, having\r\na proper discretization is paramount.  We propose a finite difference\r\ndiscretization of the problem, on optimal grids.  We have demonstrated\r\nthat optimal grids give stable and efficient inversion algorithms, in\r\none dimensional (Sturm-Liouville) problems.  We wish to study further\r\nthe optimal grids and to extend them to higher dimensions.  \r\n(b) Inverse scattering in random media, where we wish to image the\r\nreflectivity of targets buried in clutter, which we model as a random\r\nmedium. We are interested in remote sensing regimes, with significant\r\nmultipathing (multiscattering) of the waves, by the inhomogeneities in\r\nclutter.  The proposed work starts with a close look at wave \r\npropagation in random media and it strives to develop statistically\r\nstable imaging algorithms, which give reliable images, independent of\r\none's lack of knowledge of the details of the clutter.\r\n\r\nWe consider theoretical and numerical studies of two inverse problems:\r\n(a) The first problem considers the recovery of properties such as the\r\nelectrical conductivity and permittivity of a body, given measurements\r\nof electric currents and voltages, or the electric and magnetic fields, \r\nat the surface of the body. Because different materials display different \r\nelectrical properties, these problems are important whenever we wish to \r\ninfer the internal structure of a body, by gathering data at its periphery.  \r\nExamples of applications are: (1) In medicine: for detection of pulmonary \r\nemboli, monitoring of heart function and blood flow, detection of breast \r\ntumors, etc. (2) In environmental sciences: for detection of leaks in \r\nunderground tanks, monitoring of underground flows, etc. (3) Nondestructive \r\ntesting of materials: detection of corrosion, cracks and voids in metals,\r\netc. Our research focuses on using state of the art variational techniques \r\nand optimal grids (parametrizations), to obtain efficient and reliable \r\nrecoveries of the unknown electrical properties inside the body.  \r\n(b) The second problem considers the detection and imaging of targets\r\nin clutter, via active arrays of antennas (transducers) which send\r\nprobing signals in the medium and record the scattered echoes. Imaging\r\nin clutter is not well understood, so far, but it has important\r\napplications in ultrasound imaging, land or shallow water mine\r\ndetection, ground or foliage penetrating radar, etc.  Our approach to\r\nimaging in clutter is based on knowledge of wave propagation in random\r\nmedia and it considers the development of statistically stable imaging\r\nalgorithms, which give reliable results, independent of one's\r\nuncertainty of the clutter.",
