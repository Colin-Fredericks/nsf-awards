 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2003 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols will be held November 4 in Atlanta, Georgia. This conference is one of the top conferences in the networking field, and the only one that focuses specifically on aspects of communication protocols -- one of the most important topics in networking today. Funds are requested to support approximately 10 graduate (PhD) students to attend ICNP, with the goal of increasing opportunities for future researchers to make contacts and interact with those doing cutting-edge research. The target \"market\" for this support is students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference, but who nevertheless should benefit from doing so--especially students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: students who receive awards will benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from seeing research presentations that relate to their own research, or may inspire them to try a new direction.  The research community and society benefit from the resulting improvement of students in the pipeline, and everybody benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference.",
