 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a formal framework of algorithms and techniques for traffic grooming to exploit recent advances in optical network technology. The results from these activities will be a suite of traffic grooming algorithms with formally verified properties, which can be flexibly and efficiently applied within a variety of optical network and cost models, and which will address both the off-line and on-line versions of the problem.  In contrast to the recent work on traffic grooming techniques that was in the context of SONET/SDH rings, with the development of generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) technology (also referred to as multiprotocol lambda switching, MPLambdaS, when switching is based on wavelengths), this project will particularly focus on optical WDM networks with a general topology. Consequently, a new problem arises in which the objective is to groom a set of MPLS traffic streams into lightpaths for transport over an MPLS network of a general topology so as to minimize the overall network cost. There are many unanswered questions yet to resolve in this field. Specific objectives include the refinement of optical routing models to incorporate traffic grooming, and the evaluation of trade-offs between decreased wavelength requirements and increased hardware costs in optical networks. Furthermore, this project will develop optimal or near-optimal traffic grooming strategies for elemental topologies under a number of cost models, and it will also study the grooming in general topologies by decomposition into or synthesis from elemental topology building blocks. It is widely expected that the results of this work will benefit the high-speed backbones of tomorrow's network and information infrastructure will consist of networks utilizing hybrid optical and electronic switching to enable high-performance MPLS transport.",
