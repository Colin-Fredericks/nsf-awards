 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Americas Program provides supports for this US-Brazil Digital Library Joint Project Development Symposium organized by Drs. Johann van Reenen and Ramiro Jordan of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Mauro S. Miskulin of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).  The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Brazilian International Conference on Information Policies in Digital Libraries at UNICAMP, in Campinas, Sao Paulo and reflects a collaboration among the Ibero-American Science and Technology Education Consortium (ISTEC), UNICAMP, FAPESP, BIRIME, UNESP, and USP.  Two sessions will be devoted to developing joint research projects.  The workshop will also focus on underutilized intellectual property residing in theses and dissertations at the region's universities.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is similar to US-Europe digital libraries workshops that have been held for many years.  These gatherings make it possible for researchers in various countries to share their digital library tools and to learn about each other's work.  This workshop creates an opportunity for US and Latin-American digital-library researchers to learn from each other and develop joint initiatives with computer scientists and other academic and industrial researchers.  The proceedings will be available on at least two Internet web sites, resulting in broad dissemination.  The synergy created by having computer scientists, engineers, and librarians interact in this workshop is likely to lead to novel and creative collaborations between Latin American and US researchers.\r\n",
