 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems with symmetries arise frequently in applications. Such systems exhibit behavior\r\nthat is not typical of nonsymmetric systems. Even though this behavior may be more complex\r\nthan expected techniques from equivariant bifurcation theory permit one to analyze its\r\norigin and properties. However, in many applications the presence of symmetry is an\r\nidealization. It is important therefore to understand which aspects of the dynamics of the\r\nsymmetric system are robust with respect to small symmetry-breaking imperfections. In many\r\ncases the loss of both discrete and continuous symmetries introduces global bifurcations\r\ninto the dynamics and hence the possibility of chaotic time-dependence. This project\r\nproposes a study of such symmetry-breaking perturbations in several important classes of\r\nsystems arising incontinuum mechanics (fluid flow, chemically reacting systems etc) with\r\nemphasis on identifying robust behavior both near threshold of a primary instability and\r\nfurther away from it. The former gives rise to low-dimensional systems with broken\r\nsymmetry via center manifold reduction, while the latter require a study of partial\r\ndifferential equations. Special emphasis is placed on understanding the effects of\r\nbreaking both reflection symmetry and translation invariance (both separately and\r\nsimultaneously). Phenomena arising from the breaking of time-translation invariance due to\r\nparametric forcing and the loss of Galilean invariance will also be studied. The goal of\r\nthe project is to gain a deep understanding of the limitations on the applicability of\r\nidealized models and to provide a description of the type of behavior that is typical of\r\n''nearly-symmetric'' systems.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at understanding the basic principles behind robust behavior. For\r\nexample, understanding the effects of broken reflection symmetry is essential when\r\nstudying the effects of a small inclination of an apparatus to the horizontal, and the\r\neffects of through-flow or rotation on transitions from one state to another. Problems of\r\nthis type arise in microscopic situations (thin films on horizontal or inclined\r\nsubstrates) in geophysics (for example in oceanography) and everywhere in between.\r\nSimilarly, understanding the trapping of wavelike disturbances by spatial inhomogemeities\r\nis of importance not only in catalysis where the inhomogeneities may be on atomic scale,\r\nand in the trapping of weather patterns by topography.",
