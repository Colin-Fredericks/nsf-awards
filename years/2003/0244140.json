The program director is Albert Lee assisted by co-PI, Jeanice Thomas.  Five technical divisions at NIST will be involved: Biotechnology, Process Measurements, Surface and Microanalysis Science, Physical and Chemical Properties,  Process Measurements.  Nine staff scientists from these divisions will supervise the students.  Five students will be supported during the summer for 10-12 weeks of research.  Research projects will focus on various areas in chemistry, chemical engineering, and biotechnology such as synthesis, analysis, spectroscopy, bioinformatics, chromatography, and microscopy.  The program will have weekly seminar meetings.  A symposium and student presentation of their work will conclude the program.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
