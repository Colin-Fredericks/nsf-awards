 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: SCREMS\r\n\r\n    This grant will enable the Mathematical Sciences Department at WPI to\r\npurchase a high end, multiprocessor shared memory computer in support ofa variety of cutting edge research projects in the applied mathematical sciences and statistics. Major thrust areas of this research program include: the modeling and simulation of atmospheric turbulence, combinatorial investigations in cryptography, nonlinear partial differential equations and the development of smart materials. In addition, this platform will support research in biomathematics (stenosis of arteries), applied statistics (disease control), and emergent areas such as financial mathematics. Progress in many\r\nof these important research projects will not be possible without the aid of the powerful computing environment provided through this grant.\r\n\r\nExpected results from these research projects will have an impact on a\r\nwide range of problems in science and engineering. Contributions\r\nwill be made to the national security, national defense, the manufacture of durable products and structures, health care, epidemiology and financial forecasting. Furthermore this machine will provide a highly interactive teaching and research platform. Its presence will contribute to the preparation and training of a new cadre of undergraduates, M.S. and Ph.D students. On each of these three educational levels, this machine will enable us to enrich and stimulate the scientific education and growth of our students.\r\nFinally, this machine will also make a modest contribution to K-12 education through WPI's \"summer camps\" for high school students in science and engineering.\r\n",
