 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for a two-day symposium to explore future metals research to be held in Charlotte, NC from March 14 to March 18, 2004 in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of The Metallurgical Society of America. The symposium will feature invited speakers who will present their views and divers opportunities for research in metals. Panel discussions will sharpen the research opportunities that exist in the field of \r\nmetals and identify promising areas of interdisciplinary opportunities. The intellectual merit of the symposium will consist of formulating new promising avenues of metals research. Its venue will guarantee that the ideas to be formulated will be widely disseminated thereby ensuring a broad impact of the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe symposium is believed to result in a road map of the expected new trends in this important field of metals research. The plan is to have invited talks by recent MET CAREER grantees followed by open discussions by both invitees and participants; the symposium is open to public in attendance at the TMS meeting. The final outcome of the symposium is planned to be published in the Journal of Metals and to create a web page. Funds are geared towards supporting travel and meeting registration for young researchers from diversified groups.",
