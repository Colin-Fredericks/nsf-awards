 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal has two parts. The main message of the first part is that for\r\nthose Gorenstein singularities whose link is a rational homology sphere the\r\nwork of Artin and Laufer on rational, respectively  on minimally elliptic\r\nsingularities can be continued. The optimism is partly based on the author's\r\nwork on Gorenstein elliptic singularities. For hypersurface singularities\r\nwith rational homology sphere links the proposal addresses an even stronger\r\nconjecture: the link determines the embedded topological type (in particular,\r\nall homological package derived from the Milnor fibration), all the\r\nequivariant Hodge numbers  (in particular, the geometric genus), and the\r\nmultiplicity (in particular, it predicts an even sharper property than\r\nZariski's Conjecture). The second part is concentrated on a recent conjecture\r\nof L.I. Nicolaescu and the author  which states that a certain Seiberg-Witten\r\ninvariant of a rational homology sphere link can serve as an ``optimal\r\ntopological upper bound'' for  the geometric genus; and in the Q-Gorenstein\r\ncase, it determines it. In fact, for a smoothing of a Gorenstein singularity\r\nit predicts that the signature of the Milnor fiber equals $-8$ times this\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariant. This conjecture generalizes an earlier conjecture\r\nof Neumann and Wahl  which connects, in the presence of a smoothing,\r\nthe Casson invariant of the link and the signature of the Milnor fiber,\r\nprovided that the link is an integer homology sphere.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the (analytic) singularity theory is to generalize\r\nthe topological and analytical invariants of smooth analytic manifolds.\r\nA local singularity, in fact, is the zero set of some analytic functions\r\nFrom topological point of view, a local surface singularity is described\r\nby its link which is a 3--manifold (i.e. it is a cone over its link).\r\nOn the other hand, it has many analytic invariants codifying interesting\r\nproperties of the defining functions. The aim of the proposal is to connect\r\nthese invariants. The final goal is  a ``lifting property'' which guarantees\r\nthat many analytic invariants can be read already at the topological  level.\r\nThe main topological ingredient is the recent Seiberg-Witten invariant.\r\nThe proposal combines techniques of algebraic geometry with topology\r\nand sophisticated  combinatorial properties of some graphs.\r\n",
