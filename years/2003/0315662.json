 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the development of a radio frequency-scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for research and education in nanostructures at Boston University. The radio frequency-STM (rf-STM) has the potential to emerge as one of the most central tools in nanotechnology. Broadband (ultra-fast) operation will be accomplished by integrating a radio frequency tank circuit to the STM tunnel junction. A commercial STM system will be acquired and modified to allow integration with microfabricated tips, radio frequency circuitry and electronics. With its superb spatial and temporal resolution, the rf-STM will have broad impacts in numerous experimental fields of technological and fundamental importance. Among the experimental systems where the rf-STM might enable breakthroughs are nano-scale mechanical systems, nano-scale electronic systems, superconducting systems and spin systems (using the technique of spin polarized STM). The new system will enable time resolved studies of defect and adsorbate motion on surfaces.\r\n\r\nSeveral students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in the principles, construction and operation of the radio frequency-STM. Upon completion, the rf-STM will be used in studies of particularly interesting problems in nano-scale structures, thereby enabling important education in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The developed rf-STM will be made available to interested research groups at Boston University and the Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the National Security Agency to take advantage of the collaborative environments in these institutions. This project initiates collaboration between a government laboratory with superb facilities, the Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the National Security Agency, and Boston University. \r\n\r\n",
