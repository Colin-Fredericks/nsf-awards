 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is the development of algorithmic \r\nmethods for design verification. Today's rapid development of complex and \r\nsafety-critical systems requires reliable verification methods.  Formal \r\nverification is the study of algorithms and structures applicable to the \r\nverification of hardware and software designs.  It combines theoretical \r\nand experimental aspects.  In the last few years, this area has seen a \r\ndramatic expansion of activities.  Verification tools are incorporated \r\ninto industrial development of new designs, forming an active and exciting \r\narea of research where theory and practice stimulate each other. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this poject is the application of the\r\nautomata-theoretic approach to design verification, which uses the theory\r\nof automata as a unifying paradigm for design specification,\r\nverification, and synthesis.  The automata-theoretic\r\nperspective considers the relationships between designs and their\r\nspecifications as relationships between languages. By translating\r\ndesign and logical specifications to automata, questions about\r\nprograms and their specifications can be reduced to questions about\r\nautomata. More specifically, questions such as satisfiability of\r\nspecifications and correctness of designs with respect to their\r\nspecifications can be reduced to questions such as non-emptiness and\r\ncontainment of automata.  The automata-theoretic approach separates \r\nthe logical and the combinatorial aspects of reasoning about systems. \r\nThe translation of specifications to automata handles the logic and shifts \r\nall the combinatorial difficulties to automata-theoretic problems, \r\nyielding clean and asymptotically optimal algorithms. \r\nFurthermore, automata are very helpful for implementing\r\ntemporal-logic based verification methods, and are the key to \r\ntechniques such as on-the-fly verification\r\nthat help coping with the ``state-explosion'' problem.\r\nAutomata-theoretic methods have been implemented in both \r\nacademic and industrial automated-verification tools.\r\n\r\nMany questions in the theory of automata on infinite objects are still\r\nopen, and more fruitful applications of automata theory in design\r\nverification are possible. This projects aims at solving several\r\nautomata-theoretic problems with clear application to design\r\nverification, and at develoing automata-based verification methodologies.\r\nThe broad impact of this project is the contribution to the\r\nefforts of developing and improving formal verification methods,\r\nconstituting an additional step toward formal verification of\r\nindustrial real-life designs.\r\n",
