 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Anchorage Museum Association, in collaboration and partnership with the Yup'ik Calista Elders Council, will work in one year to plan exhibits, educational programs and a web site for a traveling exhibition of 19th century Yup'ik technology.  The exhibit will combine masterworks from the Berlin Ethnographic Museum with Yup'ik technology from the Smithsonian Institution and present them in ways that will allow Native and non-Native visitors to gain new under-standings of Yup'ik technology from the Yup'ik point of view.  The planning process will bring together with Yup'ik elders, scientists and museum professionals for a series of planning meetings, demonstrations of Yup'ik technology and workshops on raw materials and traditional manufacturing techniques, culminating in a exhibit development workshop integrating front-end evaluation, learning goals and design parameters, and formative evaluation planning.\r\n",
