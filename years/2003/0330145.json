 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary: Development and Testing of Practical Algorithms for Online Interpretation of Sensor Data through Wavelet Decomposition\r\n \r\nProposal # 0330145\r\n \r\nRecent growth in sensor technology and its applications have made it easy to gather abundance of data. Unfortunately, the data collection rate via sensors usually far exceeds our current ability to process them. A remedy to this bottleneck situation is the development of effective and online implementable statistical algorithms for data interpretation. Furthermore, continued miniaturization of the sensors have significantly increased the sophistication of the sensor fabrication technology which itself is heavily dependent on sensors. Thus, both ends of the sensor technology (fabrication and data interpretation) stand to gain from this research. \r\n \r\nThe funding granted would allow us to 1) develop theoretical analysis needed to assess the effectiveness of online multiresolution algorithms in interpreting sensor data, and construct efficient univariate and multivariate online algorithms, 2) test online algorithms on sensor data collected from a nanoscale fabrication process, and 3) develop a new Wavelet-EWMA feedback control strategy using  online sensor data analysis algorithms. Our strategy for objective #1 is to first build a mathematical model for the multiresolution data analysis scheme in order to assess performance measures such as false alarm rate, and average run length.  Our testing strategy is an elaborate one. We will collect a variety of sensor data from the test bed that relate to a number of outstanding operational issues.  With each of these data sets, we will not only test the performances of the algorithms, but also use the test results to provide answers to the above issues. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the mathematical analysis developed by this research would provide a strong foundation for  performance assessment of wavelet based online multiscale algorithms. This science base would lead to the development of online and practically viable algorithms for sensor data analysis. Transfer of knowledge discovered through the proposed research into technological innovations will be enhanced through our collaborations with the semiconductor industry. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
