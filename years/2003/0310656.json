 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and analyze numerical methods\r\nfor parabolic stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE's)\r\ndriven by non-Gaussian noise. As a first step, work will focus on the\r\nstochastic heat equation in one dimension, with an additive noise term\r\ngiven by a Poisson random measure.  The research will proceed along\r\ntwo paths that will be developed in parallel: mathematical analysis\r\nand numerical experimentation. These techniques will be used in order\r\nto study the application of both finite difference methods (including\r\nthe explicit and fully implicit Euler methods and the Crank-Nicholson\r\nmethod) and finite element methods. Once the analysis of the heat\r\nequation is complete, it will be generalized to quasi-linear second\r\norder SPDE's with non-Gaussian noise.  After the analysis of the\r\none-dimensional case is complete, equations in many spatial dimensions\r\nwill be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nStochastic partial differential equations (SPDE's) are used to model\r\nmany phenomena in the natural and social sciences. SPDE's are applied\r\nin a wide variety of applications in oceanography, neurophysiology,\r\nquantum physics, economics, and the physics of porous media (as\r\napplied, for example, in the geology of oil extraction).  The purpose\r\nof this research is to develop and analyze techniques for the\r\nsimulation of such equations where the randomness assumes the form of\r\na series of discrete \"shocks\" (as is often the case in scientific\r\napplications).  The development of the mathematics, computer\r\nalgorithms and software for the analysis and simulation SPDE's will\r\nhave a broad impact on the fields mentioned above, since simulation and\r\nnumerical solution are an important part of the application of any \r\nstochastic model in science and engineering.  Most current models using\r\nSPDE's make use of continuous, \"Gaussian\" noise.  This is not\r\nnecessarily due to the suitability of such a specification, but rather\r\nto its ease of application and implementation (and wider familiarity\r\namong scientists and engineers). The study of SPDE's driven by noise\r\nterms that are not Gaussian, and methods for their numerical solution\r\nin particular, will make an important new tool available to\r\nresearchers in many disciplines.",
