The primary objectives of the SBGDP are to 1) offer professional development workshops for middle- and high-school teachers from schools associated with San Jose State University's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) Program; 2) to provide summer enrichment activities in the geosciences for underrepresented middle- and high-school students in the MESA program; 3) to involve selected college students in research projects partner.  Undergraduates will be recruited from San Jose City College and National Hispanic University as well as from San Jose State University to enhance regional collaboration.\r\n\r\nIn the student-research component, students will work under the direct supervision of a faculty member of the SJSU Geology Department on a field-based study of the geology, geomorphology, or neotectonics of key areas in the southern San Francisco Bay region.  Students will present their findings at Open House events hosted by the U. S. Geological Survey and at a section meeting of the Geological Society of America.   The project will be evaluated by faculty and students from SJSU's College of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
