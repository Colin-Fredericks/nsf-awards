 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brilliantly colored phycobiliproteins absorb most of the light which drives cyanobacterial photosynthesis.  These phycobiliproteins interact with colorless linker polypeptides to form an antenna, the phycobilisome.   The cyanobacterium, Fremyella diplosiphon, can sense the color of the available light and responds by regulating the synthesis of two differently colored phycobiliproteins, phycoerythrin (PE) and  phycocyanin (PC2).   PE predominates in green light, and PC2 in red light.   This chromatic adaptation maximizes light absorption for photosynthesis.   Genes for most of the phycobilisome polypeptides from F. diplosiphon have been cloned and sequenced.   In our laboratory tools have been developed for the genetic analysis of chromatic adaptation in F. diplosiphon.   Using these genetic tools an activator, CpeR, has been identified which is required for the synthesis of PE and which is encoded with the PE-associated linker polypeptides, CpeC, D and E in an operon, cpeCDESTR.   It has been proposed that the concentration of CpeR determines the rate of PE synthesis.  Mutation either in cpeS or in cpeT markedly decreases the PE level in the cell.   Genetic evidence suggests that CpeS strongly enhances the action of CpeR in green light but not in red light.   The primary goal of this project is to discover the roles of CpeR, CpeS and CpeT, and thereby resolve the long standing question of how the synthesis of PE is coordinated with the synthesis of its associated linker polypeptides.   Undergraduate students and masters degree students, with close supervision by the principal investigator, will directly experience the demands and satisfactions of biochemical research on a fundamental phenomenon which is genetically tractable.  The acquisition and use of a molecular imager will encourage students to apply digital ideas to biochemistry.",
