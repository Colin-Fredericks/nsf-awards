 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference on Thin Film and Crystal Growth Mechanisms will be held at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts, June 22-27, 2003. The conference will cover liquid-phase crystal growth, vapor-phase crystal growth, thin film deposition, materials chemistry, and surface physics research. The conference aims to promote strong interactions between these disciplines and emphasizes understanding of fundamental chemical and physical processes involved in novel methods for the growth of nanostructures.\r\nThe program is organized around invited speakers, discussion leaders, a chair, and vice-chair; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled. Special efforts have been made to recruit a diverse group of participants, including foreign and American scientists, younger and older researchers, and industrial, national laboratory and academic researchers. Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad community of researchers addressing crystal growth from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to assess critical research necessary to further basic understanding. \r\nThe conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in crystal growth. Topics include: Heteroepitaxy and Quantum Dots, Control of Nucleation and Morphology, Macromolecular Crystallization, Molecular-level Dynamics of Crystal Surfaces, Thin Films, and Surface Nanostructures. The conference provides opportunity to assess the field and future directions, and to establish new ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.\r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of crystal growth research issues at the macro through the nanoscale level along with current assessments of important developments will be of significant value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic materials in computing, data processing, and communications. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students.\t \r\n***\r\n",
