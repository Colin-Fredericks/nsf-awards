The proposed duration of this research is 3 years.  The project will result in tools allowing systematic quantification of the systematic and random uncertainties in different RR products over a broad range of spatiotemporal scales.  This research will include both the reflectivity-based and polarimetry-based RR estimates.  The analyses will be based on unique ground reference (GR) facilities that have become available recently.  Four major tasks in this project are summarized below: Preparing an empirical basis for the analyses.  Large sample of accurate GR data from a super-dense raingauge network will be collected and augmented with data from the Little Washita Micronet and the Oklahoma Mesonet.  Corresponding radar reflectivity and polarimetric radar data will be acquired and used to generate different RR products. Developing methods for statistical filtering of GR uncertainties.  They are necessary for quantitative evaluation of RR estimates based on single-gauge GR.  Using the accurate GR, we will test the methods and assess their accuracy for different situations.  Analyzing and modeling of the RR uncertainty structure.  We will develop an empirically based model of statistical-functional relations between RR estimates, the true rainfall, and the uncertainties.  We will study scale dependences in the model.  Developing systematic methodology for verification of RR products.  We will study the meaning and importance of different performance measures from the perspective of RR applications.  The performance measures will be completed with their confidence bounds.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of this project are summarized below:   It will advance understanding of the physical meaning and practical value of radar rainfall.  This will promote development of improved rainfall measurement techniques.   The large sample of multiscale raingauge data and different RR products will constitute a unique high-quality scientific data-set that we will make available for the whole community through our ftp-site.  Quantitative information about the radar rainfall uncertainties can be assimilated into the hydrological and precipitation forecasting models.  This will improve reliability of the forecasts.\r\nGraduate students will directly participate in this research and in broad publicizing of its results.  This project will be a substantial part of their education.\r\n\r\n",
