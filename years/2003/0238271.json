 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent times much has been said about how, once deployed, networks\r\nof devices with wireless communication capabilities will affect the way\r\nwe work, learn, interact, organize, get entertained, fight wars, and\r\nrecover from disasters.  This interest in wireless networks has led to\r\na fair amount of research activity in the areas of mobile and ad-hoc\r\nnetworking, addressing both systems and theory issues.  However, not\r\nmuch research work has been done on fundamental information theoretic\r\nconcepts related to wireless *sensor* networks, i.e., networks of tiny,\r\nlow power, unreliable devices equipped with very limited sensing and\r\ncommunication capabilities, and embedded in the environment.  This\r\nproject is primarily about the study of fundamental performance limits\r\nfor large-scale wireless sensor networks.  Specifically, there are\r\nthree problems, deeply intertwined with each other, and very relevant\r\nin practice, on which we concentrate our efforts:\r\n\r\n  - Source Coding problems, dealing with the design and performance\r\nanalysis of codes and signal processing algorithms for the random fields\r\ngenerated by sensor nodes.\r\n\r\n  - Routing problems, dealing with design and performance analysis of\r\nprotocols and signal processing algorithms for moving sensor data *within*\r\nthe network.\r\n\r\n  - Reachback Communication problems, dealing with the design and\r\nperformance analysis of codes and signal processing algorithms for moving\r\nsensor data *out* of the network.\r\n\r\nThe solution to problems of source coding, routing, and reachback\r\ncommunication in sensor networks requires a \"marriage\" of networking\r\nand communication theoretic concepts.  This presents an interesting\r\nopportunity for innovation in education, since networking is typically\r\nregarded as a \"pure CS\" topic, whereas communication theory is typically\r\nregarded as a \"pure EE\" topic.  All of my educational and outreach\r\nactivities (undergraduate and graduate course development, lab development,\r\nundergraduate textbook development, service to community) are designed\r\naround the general goal of providing a solid theoretical basis to our\r\nstudents in networking and communications, as well as the more specific\r\ngoal of highlighting the interplay between these concepts in the context\r\nof wireless sensor networks.\r\n",
