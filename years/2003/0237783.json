Such antennas and arrays will be needed for use in wireless microsensors for pathogen and bio-agent detection, in E-911 (emergency 911) integrated ultra-thin, lightweight, mobile phones for location identification, and in wearable, ultra-thin, multi-functional wireless devices for the police, firemen, and ambulance personnel to ensure enhanced  \"homeland  security.\"   Flexible, ultra-thin, packaged antennas will also play an important role in the development of miniature, ultra-thin GPS (global positioning system) and RFID  (radio frequency identification device) modules for implantation under the skin of the terminally ill (Alzheimer patient) and the disabled to pinpoint their locations and monitor their condition.  \r\n\r\nCurrent state of the art in antenna  research does not address the  challenges associated with  flexible,  ultra-thin,  packaged  design  which  include  narrow  bandwidth (due to reduced thickness), degradation in pattern and polarization  (due  to  proximity  to metals  and  displays), and  loss  in  gain (due to proximity to lossy materials).  Fundamental research is required to understand the basic properties of a wide variety of antenna configurations both prior to and after packaging/embedding in order to target and address issues such as, design for broader bandwidth, higher gain, optimum pattern coverage, and good axial ratio (for circularly polarized antennas). To  realize these goals, a variety of antenna configurations including non-traditional resonant and non-resonant slots, ultra-thin patches, and PIFAs (planar inverted-F antennas) will be fabricated and studied primarily on flexible substrates (thin-film flexible polymers and liquid crystal polymers (LCPs))  both  prior  to  and  after  packaging/embedding.  Antennas  will  also  be investigated on uniquely modified printed circuit boards to significantly reduce thickness without sacrificing performance.   Novel, ultra-thin, circularly polarized antennas will be explored for operation in E-911 integrated mobile phones, in  wearable devices, and in implanted GPS and RFID  modules.  Antennas  will  be  studied  using  full-wave  electromagnetic  simulation  prior  to fabrication. Upon fabrication they will be characterized for input impedance, pattern, and gain.  \r\n\r\nThis research will bring forth fundamental advances in knowledge  and  innovation on miniature, ultra-thin, packaged antennas and arrays for future generation wireless devices, which will  directly  benefit  the  U.S.  economy.  The  findings  of  this  research  will  be  disseminated through seminars given in local libraries, articles published in technical and non-technical literature, web-based databases, CD-ROMs, and through conference presentations. The proposed project will significantly enhance capabilities for research in microwave engineering at the University  of  South  Carolina  (USC) and provide the basic infrastructure required to obtain future competitive federal grants and to educate and train qualified microwave engineers. The major thrusts of the educational component of this proposal for the next several years will include the development of (1) a senior-year undergraduate/graduate level microwave engineering laboratory  course, (2) a  graduate course on microwave active and passive circuit design, and (3) the reorganization of a graduate course on \"Antennas and Radiation\" to make it equally suitable for undergraduates. This project will actively involve  undergraduates, high-school students, and middle and high school teachers, female and underrepresented minorities by making their research experiences exciting, fun, and rewarding.  \r\n\r\n",
