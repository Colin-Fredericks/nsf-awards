Many of the\r\nconnections between topology and contact geometry are mediated by\r\nLegendrian knots (these are knots that are tangent to a contact\r\nstructure), thus the first main theme of the proposed research is\r\nLegendrian knots. As part of this proposal the general structure\r\nof Legendrian knots will be studied. The expected outcome will be\r\nvarious classification results for certainLegendrian knots and contact\r\nstructures; and, moreover, a betterunderstanding of Legendrian surgery\r\n(an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian \r\nknots in higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology.\r\nThere is very little known about contactstructures, or Legendrian knots,\r\nin dimensions above three. By investigating  Legendrian knots in these \r\ndimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just\r\nas the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact\r\nstructures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the \r\nconnection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few\r\nyears ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. Here work with\r\nGhrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, \r\nclosed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic\r\ninstability from the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads\r\ninto the study of energy minimization for fluid flows and relations between\r\ncontact and Riemannian geometry.\r\n\r\nContact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries \r\nago,in the study of geometric optics and partial differential equations.\r\nThrough the centuries contactstructures have touched on many diverse areas\r\nof mathematics and physics,including classical mechanics and thermodynamics.\r\nIn everyday life oneencounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel \r\nparking a car,using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play \r\nof light ina glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of \r\ntheir work to this subject  but only in the last decade or two has it moved\r\ninto the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance is due to the recent\r\nremarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and\r\nbeautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of\r\nall this recent work is the intimate connections between contact\r\nstructures and topology in dimension three. Thus by studying this abstract\r\nnotion of a contact structure one can learn many subtle things about the\r\nuniverse in which we live. For example, the study of contact geometry\r\nhas recently lead to some unexpected advances in our understanding of\r\nthe flow of idealized fluids. The Principal Investigator will explore\r\nconnections between contact structures and topology in all (odd)\r\ndimensions, continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics)\r\nvia contact geometry and analyze intriguing new conjectures concerning\r\nstring theory and contact geometry. The Principal Investigator will\r\nalso engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and\r\nencouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory\r\nand survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact\r\ngeometry to a wider audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
