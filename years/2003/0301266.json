 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. John M. Papanikolas of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will investigate the connection between the molecular architecture of a material and its functional properties, emphasizing systems that harvest energy from light and transfer that energy to other materials.  The project targets hierarchical structures that exhibit increasing structural and functional complexity, namely monomer structures that are attached to polymer chains to form functional substructures, which in turn are combined to form larger nanosystems.  The focus is on monomers that are Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridil complexes.  Ultrafast spectroscopy and computer simulation will be used to study excited state energy transport and charge carrier conduction.  The goal is to identify the photophysical factors that dictate performance in processes such as solar energy conversion, LED devices, and optical limiters.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to our understanding of complex systems while promoting teaching, training, and learning in the context of a research program.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research.  They will acquire technical knowledge and skills, while at the same time experience the planning and successful execution of experiments, as well as becoming attuned to the larger context within which the work is carried out.  As part of an outreach program Prof. Papanikolas will develop science workshops for elementary school students and include undergraduate students interested in science education in the development of these workshops.\r\n",
