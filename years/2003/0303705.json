 "awd_abstract_narration": "This low-temperature condensed matter physics research is focused on fundamental quantum properties of matter that can be probed using the simple and well-characterized system of electrons confined to a two-dimensional geometry.  Two- and lower-dimensional electron systems manifest some of the most fundamental many-body quantum physics of strongly correlated electrons, including the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and the associated one-dimensional chiral edge states, and the single particle tunneling phenomena in zero-dimensional quantum dots and antidots.  The quantum-coherent properties of the collective ground states of two-dimensional electrons and the size-quantized systems of few electrons, their excitations, chiral edge state dynamics, and the quantum phase transitions will be studied experimentally via techniques of tunneling and resonant single-particle tunneling.  The results are of great interest in the formulation and confirmation of advanced quantum theory.  The experimental techniques developed in the study of the semiconductor nanostructured samples can have an impact on technology via realization of new electronic devices whose fabrication and operation is based on similar materials and techniques.  This research includes collaborations with materials scientists and electrical engineers in sample preparation and with theorists in analysis of experimental results.  This cutting-edge research involves training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, who will be excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government and education.\r\n\r\nThis work is focused on fundamental quantum properties of the simple and well-characterized systems of interacting electrons in fabricated semiconductor structures.  Two- and lower-dimensional electron systems manifest some of the most fundamental quantum physics such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects and the associated one-dimensional edge channels, the single particle tunneling phenomena in zero-dimensional quantum dots and antidots.  The quantum-coherent properties of the low-dimensional electrons and the size-quantized systems of few electrons will be studied experimentally at very low temperatures and very high magnetic fields. The results are of great interest in the formulation and confirmation of advanced quantum theory.  In addition, this study can have impact on technology via realization of new electronic semiconductor nanostructured devices whose fabrication and operation is based on similar materials and techniques.  The quantum antidot physics may form a basis of novel quantum computing devices.  This research involves collaborations with materials scientists and electrical engineers in sample preparation and with theorists in analysis of experimental results.  Students in this program are excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government and education. The PI teaches undergraduate classes, his research activity is vital in bringing real-world science and modern technology into classroom.",
