 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in Minority Group Demography at the University of Texas at Austin. The Sociology Department and the interdisciplinary Population Research Center will host the REU.  For ten weeks each summer, eight students will be exposed to demography via course work, seminars, and hands-on research apprenticeships with faculty. In addition, they will write scholarly papers, present their work in colloquia and conferences, and participate in professionalization workshops. Students may be affiliated with projects ranging from race/ethnic infant mortality differentials, to the experiences of women of color in the labor market, to the performance differentials among college students by ascribed statuses like ethnicity and gender. An Ethics seminar will introduce professional ethics as an explicit part of the curriculum and professional socialization efforts. \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences. \r\n",
