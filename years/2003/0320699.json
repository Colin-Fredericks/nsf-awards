 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for a shared Viscoelastic Characterization Facility (VCF) for the characterization of viscoelastic properties of soft materials at the University of Pennsylvania. The VCF has research studying materials ranging from synthetic gels and colloids to biological tissues and carbon nanotubes. The VCF will characterize soft materials by rheologic methods that assist in determining their response to mechanical deformation. The nature of viscoelastic characterization (or the field of rheology) is such that no single instrument can measure the different geometries and extent of deformation that are appropriate for desired experimental systems. Accordingly, this grant covers five instruments to span a range wide enough to be useful to the maximum number of researchers. Specifically, two complex instruments will be developed by groups with specialized needs and expertise: 1) A customized version of the ThermoHaake Rheoscope Imaging Rheometer - to be built in collaboration with MRSEC faculty that requires single molecule imaging within polymer networks. The current version of the Rheoscope will be modified to mount on a Zeiss inverted microscope with image deconvolution capability. 2) A Bohlin C-VOR-200 Rheometer modified with transparent sample housing to interface with existing scattering facilities, such as a dynamic light scattering system, allowing more powerful capabilities to relate molecular structures to macroscopic properties than possible with existing instruments. Three other instruments will serve a broad range of users whose needs are met by commercial instruments. These instruments will differ in types of samples for which they are best suited (e.g. solid versus fluid), the type of deformation they apply, the temperature range over which they operate, and the volume required for measurement.\r\n\r\nThe equipment will be integrated into existing courses in the Bioengineering and Physics Departments to train both undergraduate and graduate students and will be used in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Program to train additional undergraduates and provide outreach to underrepresented minorities. The management plan for the facility provides additional plans for training and outreach to both underrepresented students and industry. The VCF would also impact other communities at PENN, as seen in the range of investigators involved in this proposal which include 22 groups in 12 departments within the Schools of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences, Medicine, and the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n",
