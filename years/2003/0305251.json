Keating of the National University of Ireland/ Maynooth. The objective of the workshop is to bring together thirty-five scientists, technologists, K-12 educators and students working with remote experimentation and virtual experiences in education.   The themes of the workshop are:  (1)  Innovative Applications of Remote Experimentation; (2)  Virtual Experience of Remote Locations or Environments, (3)  Curriculum Development and (4)  Support for Grades K-12 Educators.  The participants will also participate in brainstorming strategy sessions to develop a roadmap for a long-term collaborative network.  The workshop builds on the expertise gained from the U.S.-Ireland Virtual Telescopes in Education that offers U.S. and Irish classrooms remote access to telescopes.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will lay the groundwork for a digital library of remote experimentation and virtual experience education projects and resources. \r\n",
