The testbed will be connected to major international science grids and thus \r\nprovide a rich environment for hands-on learning and experimentation.  The laboratory \r\nwill be populated with one PC for every two students. \r\n \r\nThe target audience consists of young researchers and practitioners (from technical \r\nindustries, research laboratories, and academic environments) who have recently \r\nstarted (or are about to start) working on grid computing projects. \r\n \r\nThe school will have a broad impact because it will prepare a substantial number of \r\nresearchers to engage in grid projects, both building and deploying grid infrastructure \r\nand using it for applications.  The students who have applied for admission are engaged \r\nin grid projects for a wide variety of application areas, including astronomy, biology, \r\nchemistry, earth science, medicine, and physics.  There are also students who are \r\ninvolved in projects that are conducting research on grid middleware and on network \r\ntechnologies for grids.   As a result, this school will seed many projects with people who \r\nhave gained a good understanding of grid technologies. \r\n \r\n",
