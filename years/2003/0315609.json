 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the acquisition of a high frequency measurement system for magnetic nanostructure research and student training at New York University. This new system will be used to study the dynamics of magnetic nanostructures and to train students in advanced magnetic materials measurement techniques. Microwave radiation will be applied to magnetic nanostructures, with the aim of probing these systems at the natural frequencies of their dynamics, such as the frequency of quantum tunneling of magnetization and magnetic relaxation phenomena. This measurement system will also be used with miniaturized high sensitivity Hall-effect magnetometers, so that sample magnetization can be monitored during the application of radiation, allowing unique experimental studies of the magnetic properties of materials. It will greatly enhance interdisciplinary projects focused on understanding the quantum properties of chemically synthesized nanometer-sized magnets. Understanding the properties of magnetic nanostructures is a major scientific challenge with important implications for the miniaturization of magnetic storage technology. \r\n\r\nThe equipment will significantly enhance the research and educational opportunities at New York University and the research capabilities available to a multi-university interdisciplinary scientific collaboration. Physics and chemistry graduate students will use this instrument in their thesis research. Undergraduates and high school students will also participate in the characterization of magnetic nanostructures at this advanced experimental facility\r\n",
