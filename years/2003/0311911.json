 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceniceros\r\n     The investigator and collaborators develop two classes of\r\nmodern, hybrid numerical methods to study fluid-structure\r\ninteraction for multi-phase flows in two and three dimensions.\r\nThe hybrid computational methodologies merge two sets of usually\r\ndisjoint approaches, front capturing (both through the level set\r\nmethod and through phase field based models) and front tracking\r\n(immersed boundary setting) on one hand, and moving meshes and\r\nadaptive mesh refinements on the other, to produce an efficient\r\nmethod that exploits the best features of each individual\r\napproach.  In addition, controlled adaptive front-tracking in\r\nconcert with a leading small-scales semi-implicit time\r\ndiscretization is used to overcome the long-standing time\r\nstepping problem (stiffness) associated with interfacial tension.\r\nThe blending of all these ingredients produces fully adaptive\r\nand non-stiff hybrid methods for capturing accurately small-scale\r\neffects, high interfacial deformations, and flow-structure\r\ninteraction in multi-phase and complex flows.\r\n     The understanding of how flow-structure interaction\r\ninfluences the macroscopic behavior of multi-phase flows is of\r\nboth fundamental and practical significance.  Surfactants,\r\nviscoelastic fibers, fluid interfaces, and polymeric\r\nmicrostructures and nanostructures can radically change the\r\nbehavior of a flow and ultimately determine the properties of\r\ncomplex soft matter formulations.  The methodologies are an\r\nimportant tool to study flow-structure interaction for a wide\r\nvariety of problems of direct interest to nanotechnology, the\r\nsoft materials industry, and to some biomedical applications.  The\r\nproject also serves an important education goal:  the\r\ninterdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
