 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central to the concepts of quantum information (QI), communication and computation is the idea of quantum entanglement.  An important task for the QI field is to develop the ability to control and transmit an unknown quantum state from one system to another and to create entanglement between separate quantum systems, particularly for the case where the second system is at some distant location. Most current quantum information network schemes rely on coupling quantum information flow through photonic channels while using massive particle systems for quantum information storage and manipulation.  Recently, a great deal of attention has turned to a new possibility: the use of continuous, collective quantum variables for quantum information applications.  An atomic entanglement scheme based on this concept has the attractive feature that continuous variable entanglement is realized in a vapor of many millions of atoms using simple set-ups using only coherent laser light generated from simple diode lasers.  The research project supported by this award is based on such a scheme, the entanglement of spins of ground-state neutral atoms.  The work is dedicated to studying various fundamental aspects of the entanglement process and its application to problems such as entangled wavelength multiplexing.\r\n \r\nAs optical and electronic systems are miniaturized to smaller and smaller scales, it is natural that quantum mechanics will become an essential feature of information engineering. Hence, studies of quantum systems must be an integral part of the national goal of developing tools for nanoscience information technologies. \r\n",
