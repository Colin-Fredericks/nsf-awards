 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nDMS 0307166- H Bercovici (Indiana Univ)\r\n\r\nThe proposer plans to study free harmonic analysis in the sense of determining regularity properties of free convolutions; free convolutions of measures \r\nseem to exhibit greater regularity than their classical counterparts.  He also plans to investigate limit distributions of free processes, particularly \r\nthose arising in the mutliplicative theory.  The proposer also will look at \r\nrelated problems in operator theory, particularly at the behavior of \r\neigenvalues of sums of selfadjoint elements of a von Neumann algebra, and the \r\nrelationship of these questions with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.  \r\nOther problems in operator theory will include the classification of families \r\nof isometries on a Hilbert space.\r\n\r\nThe research in this proposal is aimed first of all at increasing the \r\nunderstanding of questions arising in current work in the fields of operator \r\nalgebras and operator theory.  The proposer has in the past investigated connections between operators and control theory, and the results in his \r\nproposed work may again have connections with more applied areas.  \r\nIn particular, some of the proposed interpolation problems arose from \r\nquestions in control theory, and free probability theory does have \r\nconnections with physics.  The proposer will involve graduate students in his \r\nwork, thus continuing to contribute to the training of a new generation of \r\nmathematicians.  He will also participate in the training of postdoctoral \r\nassociates, thus contributing to a successful VIGRE program at Indiana \r\nUniversity.\r\n",
