 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. John Wiens of the State University of New York at Stony Brook to study the evolutionary history of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes).  With more than 7,700 species, squamates are the second largest group of vertebrates after birds.  Many critical questions in squamate evolution remain unresolved, such as identification of the most primitive lineage of squamates, the origin of snakes, and the relationships of venomous snakes to other snake lineages.  An international team of eight investigators from diverse institutions (Brigham Young University, Field Museum of Natural History, San Diego State University, State University of New York-Stony Brook, University of Adelaide, University of Texas-Austin, and Yale University) will collaborate to resolve squamate relationships.  Anatomical data from living and fossil forms will be combined with DNA sequences from 50 genes for 142 representative squamate species.  Anatomical data will be obtained using traditional methods and new high resolution X-ray scanning techniques.  DNA data will be generated by incorporating new tools and databases from recent vertebrate genome projects.  Computer modeling will be used to determine how data from molecular and fossil studies can best be combined to reconstruct evolutionary trees.  Wiens will help generate sequence data, anatomical data, and the web-site, and will be solely responsible for computer modeling.\r\n\r\nSquamates are an important model system in biology, and understanding their evolutionary history is critical for a complete picture of vertebrate evolution and ecology.  Venomous snakes pose an important threat to human safety in many parts of the world, and identification is critical for effective treatment. An innovative web-site will allow snakebite victims and medical workers to identify the venomous snakes in their area.  Postdoctoral researchers and students will be involved in nearly every aspect of the project, and thus the training of many future biologists and educators will be supported.\r\n",
