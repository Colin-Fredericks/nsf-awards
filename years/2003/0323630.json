 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, creating a wireless research test-bed and integrating the existing wired distributed computing facilities and multimedia lab, enables research to be tried out in a wireless environment. Current research projects are in areas of adaptive power aware hierarchical routing schemes, fault-tolerant authentication, dynamic resource allocation, and design and evaluation of push-pull delivery of video data in mobile/wireless networks, and robust mobile agents. The facility, including a number of mobile nodes (some mobile robot nodes), will allow exploration and enhancement to the existing research, initially focused on wired and distributed computing, on a wireless platform. Because some of the assumptions made in a wired distributed system, such as negligible loss of information, rate of error, fault tolerance, and available resources, are no longer valid, algorithms that look robust in a fixed network distributed environment, behave totally different on a wireless platform. The project aims at evaluating, studying, and experimenting with prototypes and analytical results on the new platform to understand the parameters that can affect the efficiency and design of those algorithms in terms of power, bandwidth utilization, communication, storage cost, latency, and delays in a wireless medium. Specifically, the infrastructure supports the following projects:\r\n\tAdaptive Routing Protocols,\r\n\tFault Tolerance and Secure Authentication,\r\n\tRobust Mobile Agents, and\r\n\tEfficient Transfer of Multimedia Data in Mobile Networks.\r\nThe first project looks into adaptive power efficient routing schemes for the next generation wireless networks, power control and efficient routing for self organizing wireless sensor networks, hierarchical routing algorithms, data dissemination and aggregation. The second features virtual agent modeling, hierarchical authentication of the mobile base stations, and replicated mobile agents. The third looks at operation in the presence of faults; and the last, at design evaluation of push-pull delivery of video data in mobile/wireless networks and dynamic resource allocation to support mobility in wireless multimedia systems.\r\n\r\nNew courses are being proposed and developed in two departments by the PIs, including Mobile and Sensor Data Management, High Speed Networks, MEMS and Wireless Sensor Networks, Wireless Communication Systems, Distributed Systems, Computer Security, and Advanced Computing. The new facilities will also be used for doctoral, masters, and senior undergraduates. The students will complement their projects on wireless and sensor network infrastructure getting hands-on experience. The project also explores homeland security and commercial applications. In a military environment the work explores hierarchical mobile architecture with movable base stations.\r\n",
