 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the operations of the Plant Ontology Consortium (POC).  The goals of the POC are to develop a common set of controlled vocabulary terms to describe anatomic and developmental stage terms in both experimental and agronomically important plants.  We have begun with Arabidopsis and cereals, and will later extend this ontology to encompass legumes, Solanaceae, and other families.  Concurrently, we are applying these terms to the task of describing the genes and mutants that are contained within the plant-specific databases maintained by the participating institutions, thereby simultaneously refining the ontologies, and providing points of reference with which to compare the genes and mutants across these species.\r\nThe broader impact of this project is that it provides a framework of plant development to allow researchers to make meaningful cross-database queries across the various species-specific resources in order to discover patterns of similarities and dissimilarities involved in plant development. For example, researchers will be able to obtain a definitive list of genes whose action affects plant stem development.  The interaction between research communities will be facilitated by a \"Rosetta stone\" that bridges their historical differences in terminology.  This will allow the fruits of research in one plant species to be more easily used in the study of other species, leading to a greater understanding of plant biology.  This in turn will aid in the creation of new varieties of crop plants to meet the food needs of an ever-growing world population, to the development of pharmaceuticals to treat human disease, and the creation of new classes of herbicides, pesticides and biological control measure to counter the growing impact of resistant weeds and pests on world-wide agriculture.\r\n\r\nDeliverables\r\nDeliverables from this project include: (a) an ontology describing plant anatomy; (b) an ontology describing plant developmental stages;  (c) a web site that stores plant ontology associations to strains, mutants and genes from multiple participant databases; (d) a series of users group meetings that provide education and outreach opportunities.\r\n",
