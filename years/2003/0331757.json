 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe international Advanced Robotics Project (IARP) is an international organization,\r\nconsisting of fourteen countries and the European Union, devoted to monitoring and\r\npromoting robotics related technology and utilization. The United States helped to\r\nformulate this organization and has been an active member participating in technology\r\nevaluations, workshops, and joint study missions. Participation involves US technical\r\nexperts traveling to various functions, and interacting with their colleagues to discuss\r\nongoing research and developing technology relating to intelligent machines. This grant\r\nprovides the mechanism to insure that the selection process and procedure for selecting\r\nparticipants is fair, efficient, organizationally viable.\r\nOBJECTIVES AND METHODS TO BE EMPLOYED\r\nSince the IARP meetings are generally technology specific, the selection of US\r\nparticipants must not only reflect the person's expertise but also his or hers ability to\r\ncommunicate and interact with other participants. The selection process will be\r\nperformed by an ad hoc committee drawn from the IEEE, Robotics and Automation\r\nSociety. The traveler will receive reimbursement for expense but an honorarium will\r\nonly be provided in exceptional circumstances. This rule also applies to attendance at the\r\nIARP, Joint Coordinating Forum (JCF) which is the management, planning, and policy\r\nplanning body. The representatives of member and observer countries attend this meeting\r\nin one of the host countries. A detailed description of the host country's robotics program\r\nis an essential part of the agenda.\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT OF THE PROPOSAL ACTIVITY\r\nSince NSF is the US representative to the IARP it is necessary to seek the best, and\r\nmost appropriate researchers to contribute to the intellectual output of the meetings. This\r\nis a difficult and challenging task because the subjects under discussion at the Workshops\r\nand the JCF require participation by a variety of individuals who are knowledgeable of\r\nthe specific technology. Their intellectual contribution is critical to the success of the\r\nevent and the ability of the outcome to advance the technology. In the past, contributors\r\nhave made excellent contributions, but a need now exists to help NSF to select new\r\npeople in a fair minded and knowledgeable manner. The Robotics and Automation\r\nSociety, representing 6000 members, is a logical choice to perform this selection by using\r\nsenior, experienced, and knowledgeable decision makers.\r\nBROADER IMPACT RESULTING FROM PROPOSED ACTIVITY\r\nThe technical areas that the IARP deals with include medical robotics, personal\r\nrobotics, undersea robotic vehicles, and others having a direct societal impact. Recently\r\nnew Working Groups have been formed to consider safety and security technology and\r\nother applications that are central to society needs. The quality of the United States\r\nparticipation is essential to enhancing these Working Groups so that their deliberations\r\nand results will help to promote the advanced concepts needed for success. The impact of\r\nthis contribution cannot be underestimated.",
