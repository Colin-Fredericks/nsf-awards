 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Richard Van Duyne and colleagues from the Chemistry Department at Northwestern University will develop a new optical nanoprobe scanning tunneling microscope for nanoscale science and engineering research and education.  They will design, develop, apply and bring to the marketplace a new class of ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV-STM) that combines the extraordinary spatial resolution of the STM with the unparalleled sensitivity and broad system applicability of advanced optical spectroscopic techniques.  They will integrate high sensitivity, chemical information-rich optical spectroscopic methods with STM in such a way that sub-nanometer spatial resolution is preserved.  In particular, they will use the ultra-sensitive methods of electron beam-excited, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectroscopy, dark-field photon-excited LSPR spectroscopy, and various surface-enhanced spectroscopies.  \r\n\r\nThe development of the optical nanoprobe STM will enhance the education experiences at Northwestern University as it is incorporated into a number of courses.  In addition, through the development of network control hardware/software, other educational institutions will have access.  The principal investigators will collaborate with an industrial partner to ensure the transition of this instrument to the commercial sector.  \r\n",
