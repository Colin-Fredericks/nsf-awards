Partners in GAEMP include: Southern University Baton Rouge, Southern University New Orleans, Dillard University, Xavier University, Grambling State University, University of Houston Downtown, Jackson State University, Texas Southern University, and University of Texas San Antonio. Seven of the universities are Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and two are Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The program targets junior-year degree candidates (16 students/year) in chemistry, physics, life science, or environmental sciences and provides an advanced, content-rich, field and research-oriented introduction to geoscience during a six-week summer course. The course is offered four times during the period of NSF funding thus having a direct impact on a total of 64 undergraduates. After the summer course and during their senior year, the students undertake an individual research project to conduct in their home institution with support from LSU faculty and their local mentor.  The participants are given an opportunity to learn about geoscience career opportunities in government, industry, and academia and to present their research results. The special mentoring approach emphasizes individual and collaborative development of academic skills and guides the students in applying for admission to graduate school through a structured, highly personal program. GAEMP will support four students in an M.S. program and two to obtain a Ph.D. Other students will be encouraged to seek admission to graduate programs in geoscience at other universities. \r\n\r\n",
