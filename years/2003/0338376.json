The list of research projects in this grant includes (1)\r\nDisorder and Quantum Critical Phenomena, (2) High Temperature Superconductivity and\r\n(3) Nonequilibrium phenomena in highly correlated systems.  The class of problems here\r\nis frequently referred to as non-Fermi liquid effects.  They lie beyond the edge of\r\nunderstanding of electrons in metals offered by Landau's Fermi liquid theory.  The\r\nanomalies beyond the Fermi liquid theory include the large number of\r\nthermodynamic/calorimetric results in rare-earth alloys, which are believed to be near a \r\nquantum critical point due to disorder.  There are related effects in materials relevant for\r\nhigh-density magnetic memories and in relaxor ferroelectrics.  There are nonequilibrium\r\neffects such as the high temperature resistivity of high Tc copper oxides.  The projects\r\ninvolve analytical and numerical approaches along with close contact with relevant\r\nexperimental work.\r\n%%%\r\nThe theoretical work supported in this grant comes from two themes in current research on materials.  There are certain anomalies in the properties of electrons in metals, which\r\nApparently lie outside the conventional paradigm, referred to as the Landau's theory of\r\nmetals.  They are caused by the presence of substantial disorder and or extreme\r\nenvironmental such as pressure, magnetic field or temperature.  The work here is\r\nfundamental and far-reaching in that it may require development of sophisticated, new\r\nmathematical tools and at the same time it is motivated by a need to understand materials\r\nwhich are important for high density magnetic memories or materials which use their\r\nferroelectric properties for memory applications.  This work will be carried out in close\r\ncontact with experimentalists and will make use of both analytical and numerical\r\ntechniques, as may be necessary.\r\n***  \r\n",
