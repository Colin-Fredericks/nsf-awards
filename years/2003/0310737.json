 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  An aging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument is being upgraded to permit incorporation of NMR techniques into a wide range of chemistry courses.  The economical conversion of an old continuous wave instrument to a Fourier transform instrument allows not only routine access for students, but also allows students to perform sophisticated measurements that replicate methods usually limited to liquid helium cooled systems.  Implementation begins with the first semester of the curricular sequence.  A set of learning objectives has been identified, appropriate to the level of each course using the instrument, and instructional activities are being adapted from various educational resources to meet these goals. While the most intensive use will involve students enrolled in Organic Chemistry, a new laboratory course, Synthesis and Characterization, is being developed for chemistry majors to master advanced topics in spectroscopy.  The target populations for the project are biology, biochemistry and\r\nchemistry majors, plus students preparing for teaching careers in chemistry or biology at\r\nthe high school level. Another group of future teachers affected by the plan are those in\r\nelementary education with a science concentration. The societal impact of this\r\nacquisition will thus extend beyond the training of traditional students in an essential\r\ntechnology of modern chemistry.\r\n\r\n",
