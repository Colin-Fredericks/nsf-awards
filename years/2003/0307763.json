 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET New York) is producing twelve new programs for the third season of Cyberchase, the first national math series for children in over a decade.  The daily, half-hour programs currently are viewed by over 1.5 million viewers for each broadcast.  The associated website has had over 140 million page views.  Summative evaluation of previous seasons has determined that Cyberchase increases children's positive attitudes about mathematics as well as their content comprehension and confidence in their problem-solving skills.  In the third season the content of Cyberchase will be enriched by the addition of more complex mathematics concepts.  Grouped by their related NCTM standard, these include:\r\n\r\nNumber & Operations:  Percent, Zero, Mixed Number Fractions, Factoring\r\nGeometry:  Circles, Perspective, Tessellations, Navigation: Angles and Distance\r\nAlgebra:  Body Math (Ratio & Proportion); Mathematical Modeling\r\nData Analysis and Probability:  Experimental Probability, Stem & Leaf Plots\r\nReasoning & Proof:  Reasoning\r\nRepresentation:  Drawing to Scale\r\n\r\nDuring the third season WNET also will upgrade the web site to offer more math challenges to frequent visitors and will create math games with varying levels of complexity and challenge to provide more learning opportunities and to bring children back online more often.  In addition, WNET will intensify the project outreach to key constituencies through an integrated campaign of community outreach, materials and promotion.\r\n",
