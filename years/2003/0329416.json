 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Biocomplexity in the Environment - Materials Use: Science, Engineering and Society (MUSES) project brings together researchers from three countries and seven disciplines to create models and evaluate new materials aimed at reducing the environmental impact of concrete used in large civil infrastructures. Global production of concrete drives huge flows of material between natural and human systems. The shear magnitude of this material flow, which exceeds 12 billion tons each year, causes significant societal impacts. For example, concrete-based infrastructure projects require major investments of public capital, trigger enormous greenhouse gas emissions from cement production, and lead to construction-related traffic congestion resulting in pollution and lost productivity. Developments of new materials to supplement or replace concrete to improve the performance characteristics typically do not address the broad economic, environmental, and social consequences. This project will address this shortcoming by developing a novel framework for sustainable design that integrates microstructure tailoring with life cycle analysis. The project explores engineered cementitious composites (ECC) both from a technical design standpoint and from the health, economics, and policy perspectives. \r\n     The project includes micro-scale research on the development of ECC, macro-scale application of ECC to bridge decks, roadways, and pipes, incorporation of recycled materials, measurement of life-cycle impacts, and investigation at different geographic scopes. This work encompasses multi-disciplinary perspectives including civil and materials engineering, geology, environmental health sciences, industrial ecology, environmental economics, and public policy. Among the issues to be explored are the impacts of sourcing alternatives (superquarries vs. smaller mines) and location of infrastructure projects (urban vs. rural, and U.S. vs. China). Given the inherent design complexity, researchers will incorporate uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their quantitative models to ensure that results are sufficiently robust to support effective decision-making in the adoption of new materials. The University of Michigan team will collaborate with researchers at the Tohoku University in Japan, who will investigate the use of CO2 hardening process on the ECC mixes; researchers at Tsinghua University in China who will use the life cycle model to assess sustainability performance of infrastructure systems in China, and Stanford University. Educational outreach will be facilitated through a web-based educational resource compendium, as well as through a series of workshops involving the global partners. It is expected that this MUSES research will have a significant impact on materials use in large, civil infrastructures and will provide tools that will accelerate the adoption of new materials and material substitutions that lower the environmental impact over their whole life cycle.\r\n\r\n",
