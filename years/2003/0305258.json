 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peer-to-peer networks are distributed systems without any central\r\nauthority that are used for efficient management and location of\r\nshared resources.  Unlike traditional client-server architectures,\r\nwhich concentrate load on a small number of server machines,\r\npeer-to-peer systems provide inherent scalability by distributing the\r\ncost of maintaining the system across its participants.  At the same\r\ntime, peer-to-peer systems create new challenges for efficient and\r\nrobust implementation, as they are built from untrusted and unreliable\r\ncomponents and can provide survivability only as an emergent property\r\nof the system as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe project studies applications of large-scale distributed data\r\nstructures to peer-to-peer systems, with an emphasis on efficiency,\r\nscalability, fault-tolerance, and recovery.  Major goals of the\r\nproject include (a) design and implementation of mechanisms for\r\noptimal trade-offs between use of the network and use of local\r\nstorage; (b) design and implementation of mechanisms for very fast\r\nconstruction of large-scale distributed data structures; and (c) use\r\nof data structures providing ``range queries,'' in which the data\r\nstructure finds nearest matches to a desired object instead of just\r\nexact matches, to support versioning, replication, and approximate\r\nmatching.\r\n",
