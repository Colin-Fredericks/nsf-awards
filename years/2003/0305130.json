This generic framework is a very natural approach to many\r\nimportant questions of differential geometry. Some typical cases are those\r\nof contact structures fillable by symplectic forms, complex geometry and\r\nCauchy-Riemann boundary, Einstein geometry and conformal infinity. It is\r\ninteresting to study how deformation theory of the boundary induces\r\ndeformations of a filling. This problem is often related to some positive\r\nfrequency condition, which is of particular interest for physicists. This\r\nwill be used to study singular Yang-Mills connections of (a conjectural)\r\nDonaldson theory on Calabi-Yau 3-manifolds. More generally, we look at the\r\npicture of a moduli space on the manifold which projects on a\r\ncorresponding moduli space defined on the boundary. Whenever it can be\r\nshown that the projection has a finite nonzero degree in some sense, we\r\nobtain a powerfull tool to prove the existence of fillings. Another way to\r\ntackle the questions of existence is to develop gluing theorems between\r\nmoduli spaces. Some applications of gluing for Seiberg-Witten equations\r\nare already being developped thus giving new perspectives on contact\r\ngeometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA physical theory is defined by a configuration space, together with\r\nobjects (for example a metric) verifying particular equations.\r\nThe state of a physical system is constrained  by its configuration on\r\nthe  boundary of the space, or, at infinity. Therefore, it is a\r\nnatural question to ask wether a theory is rich or empty: is it\r\npossible to find a physical system with a given behavior on the\r\nboundary, and if so, do we have many solutions? In other words is the\r\nsystem soft or rigid? Beyond the physical flavor, this approach, known\r\nas a field theory, has deep implications in mathematics. First, it is\r\nrequired to elaborate original tools in analysis, called moduli space\r\ntheories,  that have their own beauty. Secondly, the method relates\r\nvery different problems. To illustrate that, we mention the following\r\nsituation: we consider a 3-dimensional space (it could be the\r\n3-dimensional sphere) bounding a 4-dimensional space (like the ball\r\ninside the sphere). Then, we look at knots on the boundary (they could\r\nbe  strands of DNA). These knots can be thought of as the boundary of\r\na surface lying into the 4-dimensional space. Then, it can be shown\r\nthat there is a subtle relation between the knot theory in dimension 3\r\nand the theory of surfaces lying in a 4-dimensional space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
