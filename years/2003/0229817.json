 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Geographic Television requests $1,121,583 (35%) of a total project budget of $3,192,249, to  produce a documentary series in 13 half-hour and one hour-long special, \"Facing the Wild:  The Crittercam Chronicles,\" with associated informal science education materials and programs.  This project will feature the natural histories of some of the Earth's most enigmatic and charismatic marine species, highlight the groundbreaking technology employed to study these extraordinary creatures and celebrate the scientists who devote their lives to understanding marine creatures.  The project's goals include:  to educate audiences about the vital importance of the world's oceans to the health of the planet; to celebrate the ingenuity of novel technology developed for science and exploration; to illustrate that many tantalizing mysteries remain yet unsolved and a great deal of exciting science and exploration has yet to be done; to provide viewers with scientific role models and help motivate them to pursue careers in science.  Employing cutting-edge remote imaging tools, including \"crittercam\", and National Geographic's trademark storytelling, Facing the Wild's strong conservation message is designed to appeal to a national and global audience.  A robust web site, virtual teacher workshops and Student Ocean Conferences will augment the impact of the series.\r\n",
