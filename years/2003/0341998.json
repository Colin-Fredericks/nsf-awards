 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaboration between the Engineering and Education programs at Hope College will be established through this planning grant.  The collaboration will develop a model course to provide an element of engineering in the education of pre-service teachers and a model summer workshop for in-service teachers.  Through the planning grant, a case study of this established course will be conducted using the principles of learning and the recommendations outlined in the National Research Council's: \"How People Learn\" and the .Standards for Technological Literacy,. established by the International Technology Education.  The course examines the scientific principles underlying modern consumer technological devices and features hands-on laboratory projects such as taking apart a car engine and building a speaker and amplifier.  Distinguishing features of this course are study of a representative sample of familiar technological devices, construction by students of working devices, and writing assignments on technological topics.",
