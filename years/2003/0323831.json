 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIlisagvik College of Barrow, Alaska is the lead college in the Consortium for Alaska Native \r\nHigher Education, Inc. (CANHE), a group of six developing tribally-controlled colleges which \r\nwere established because Alaska Natives have not achieved proportionate success in higher \r\neducation despite years of effort by mainstream institutions.  Alaska Natives are particularly \r\npoorly represented in STEM programs and in related professions. Research resulting from a \r\nTCUP planning grant in 2002 that clarified the extent of the problem, and lessons learned from \r\nthe Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative, form the basis for CANHE.s .Strategic Plan for Tribal \r\nColleges in Alaska.. CANHE institutions will implement the plan, which includes special efforts \r\nin STEM fields, including this .Mending the Net. project.  \r\n \r\nThe project.s intellectual merit has two fronts.  First, there are new certificate and degree \r\nprograms which incorporate STEM field learning into training that meets the needs of natural \r\nresource development industries. That this learning, for three of the four CANHE institutions, \r\nexplicitly blends indigenous knowledge with western science to gain a two-perspectives \r\nunderstanding of the natural environment, makes the project interesting. That the training \r\nqualifies Alaska Natives for needed employment in economically viable technical industries, \r\nmakes the project both practical and critical.  Second, the project uses regional differences as a \r\nstrength. The .one size fits all. approach of most colleges and universities fails to employ \r\ndifferent instructional techniques pertaining to STEM fields appropriate to each region.   \r\n.Mending the Net. introduces placed-based STEM programs.  Ilisagvik College, for instance, \r\napplies local people.s knowledge of the Arctic in an applied science program leading to \r\nemployment in land management and wildlife biology.   The Interior Athabascan Tribal College \r\nprogram, on the other hand, includes Native knowledge of the boreal forestry. \r\n \r\nThe project.s broadest impacts include that because the grant recipient and other CANHE \r\nmembers are tribally-controlled institutions, almost all students involved are Native \r\nAmerican/Alaska Natives . vastly underrepresented ion STEM fields.  CANHE is a statewide \r\norganization with connecting networks to Alaska.s 100,000+ Native peoples. Two of the \r\nprograms coordinate closely with school districts and will develop program templates for \r\nCANHE-district collaborations in other regions.  A third program partners with the University of \r\nAlaska and includes faculty development trainings that can be replicated throughout the UA \r\nSystem by the three UA Affiliate Members of CANHE.  On the industry side, the Bristol Bay \r\nNative Association program expands the infrastructure for web-based course delivery to villages \r\nin preparation for internships and possible employment with VECO, Inc., a primary contractor \r\non the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. \r\n \r\nSome project results, like new academic programs and their curricula, will be available on CDs \r\nand the web.  Others, like .best practices. in STEM teaching and learning for Native students, \r\nwill be shared through conference presentations of Native and other educators.  Yet other results, \r\nlike the availability of STEM-trained Native interns in wildlife biology, forestry and fisheries, \r\nwill be widely publicized, and discussed at industry-related conferences and in the halls of \r\ncollaborating organizations like the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium.",
