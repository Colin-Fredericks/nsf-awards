The program will be structured to enable participants' flexibility in applying their intellectual interests to a variety of different research topics. Students will be a part of teams. A team will consist of four undergraduates conducting research under the guidance of a faculty mentor, a graduate student, and an advanced undergraduate student familiar with the faculty member's research. The research conducted will be in the field of the faculty member's own area of interest and expertise. The program is specifically design to improve the number of female students choosing graduate study in preparation for a career in research in a field of science or engineering. The program will recruit junior-level and senior-level students majoring in the physical sciences or engineering and build on a previously funded NSF Award (NSF Grant No. 0120786), \"Research Internships in Science and Engineering (RISE)\" designed to create supportive research teams of primarily female students to address the national need to increase participation of students from population groups underrepresented in research fields in science and engineering.\r\n",
