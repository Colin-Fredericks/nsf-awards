A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of STEM education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities from receiving a high quality education. Through technical assistance workshops, conferences and internships, QEM has been successful in providing students and faculty with the necessary tools required to be competitive in securing federal program support for research, research-training and science education projects. \r\n\r\nBuilding upon the success of its internship programs for undergraduate students, QEM will develop and implement an internship for STEM doctoral students and faculty at minority-serving institutions to participate in research and educational activities at NSF-sponsored Science and Technology Centers (STCs).  Besides providing a rich atmosphere for encouraging future scientists and engineers, STCs conduct innovative, world-class research of national importance, that promise to contribute to the Nation's competitive potential through discovery and education. The QEM-STC internship will offer a significant number of under-represented students and faculty the opportunity to participate in STC-based research. Consequently broadening the participation of all citizens, and enhancing diversity within NSF's programs in regards to the Foundation's strategic goal of People, Tools, and Ideas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
