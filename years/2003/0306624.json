 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to extend the study of non-commutative \r\ndifferential geometry of deformation quantization algebras, and to apply it \r\nto symplectic geometry. A deformation quantization is a new multiplication \r\nlaw on an algebra of function on a manifold which depends on a formal \r\nparameter. When the value of the parameter is zero, then this product \r\nbecomes the usual product of functions. All such deformation quantizations \r\nwere classified by Kontsevich. The simplest examples of them arise from \r\nalgebras of differential operators on manifolds. In our previous work, we \r\ncomputed for all deformed algebras basic invariants of non-commutative \r\ndifferential geometry (Hochschild and cyclic homology, etc.). We applied \r\nthese results to prove generalized Atiyah-Singer index theorems. Our main \r\ntool was what we call non-commutative differential calculus, which is an \r\nextension of classical algebraic constructions with forms and multi-vectors \r\nto non-commutative setting. The new project is aimed at developing both \r\nnon-commutative geometry and algebra of deformation quantization, in \r\nparticular a theory of modules over deformation quantization rings, and at \r\napplying them to symplectic geometry, in particular to the Fukaya theory of \r\nLagrangian intersections and to mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this project is to develop what we call non-commutative \r\ndifferential calculus. By this we mean an extension of the clasical \r\nmulti-variable calculus to the case when the variables no longer commute, \r\ni.e. when the value of the product is no longer independent of the order of \r\nfactors. Such situations arise very naturally in mathematics and physics; in \r\nquantum mechanics, the non-commutativity expresses mathematically the \r\nuncertainty principle of Heisenberg. We intend to apply the non-commutative \r\ncalculus to so called deformation quantization, a geometric setup very much \r\nmotivated by quantum mechanics. Our previous work in this direction yielded \r\nnew proofs and generalizations of classical theorems about solutions of \r\npartial differential equations; our new project aims at applications to \r\ngeometric questions of mathematical physics, such as string theory, mirror \r\nsymmetry, and Lagrangian intersections.\r\n\r\n",
