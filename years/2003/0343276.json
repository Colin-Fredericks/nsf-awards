 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to organize the International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing, which is the 16th consecutive year that the PIs are organizing the workshop.  The workshop covers all aspects of languages, compiler techniques, run-time environments, and architectures for parallel and high-performance computing. Since 1988, the annual LCPC workshops have provided a forum for leading researchers and practitioners to present their latest work and to exchange ideas about future directions.\r\n\r\nThe papers published in the proceedings of the workshop have been widely cited  over the years and many of them have represented the first public presentation of innovative ideas. The participation is truly international with speakers from the US, Japan and Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile the workshop covers many topics, the emphasis has always been software, e.g., compilers, languages, run-time systems, performance evaluation for parallel systems.  Moreover, LCPC has also been an occasion for graduate students to meet more senior researchers in this informal setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
