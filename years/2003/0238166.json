 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to create low cost,high performance communication systems in the future will be chal-\r\nlenged by the high cost of developing new interface circuits that are suited to their needs.These\r\ninterface circuits serve as the intermediary between real world signals,which are analog in nature,\r\nand the digital processing engines at the core of the system.Current interface circuits are primarily\r\nanalog in their implementation,which makes their performance highly sensitive to manufacturing\r\nvariations in the process they are fabricated in,and to noise generated by digital circuits that\r\noperate on the same chip.The impact of this sensitivity is that interface circuits must be custom\r\ndesigned for the process they are implemented in,cannot be easily integrated with their adjoining\r\ndigital processor,and are often very restricted in their ability to serve a wide variety of applica-\r\ntions.The resulting lack of portability of these circuits leads to high development costs since they\r\ngenerally must be redesigned from scratch for new systems.\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to develop new interface circuit architectures that can be\r\nleveraged over a wide variety of fabrication processes and applications,and thereby dramatically\r\nreduce the cost of their implementation in future communication applications.This goal will be\r\nachieved by replacing a signi .cant portion of the analog circuitry in the interface with digital\r\ncircuits that realize the required functionality through signal processing techniques that will be\r\ndeveloped as part of this e .ort.This implementation philosophy will lead to dramatically di .erent\r\ninterface architectures than in use today,and will provide new insights into the tradeo .s between\r\nusing analog versus digital circuitry for given function and performance requirements.\r\nNew simulation models and software tools will be developed to facilitate the process of exploring\r\nnew system architectures and their accompanying circuits.The simulation modeling e .ort will\r\nbe focused on obtaining accurate behavioral level descriptions of analog components in digital\r\ncircuit simulators,which will allow straightforward evaluation of the impact of di .erent signal\r\nprocessing algorithms on the overall system performance.The software development e .ort will be\r\ndirected toward better integrating system level and transistor level simulation tools,and providing\r\nestimation of the impact of extrinsic factors such as substrate noise.\r\nA new educational course will be developed at MIT that passes on the knowledge and tools ac-\r\nquired in this research program.The class will teach high speed circuit techniques for both analog\r\nand digital components.System level concepts will be explored through a combination of mathe-\r\nmatical analysis and interactive numerical simulation using the custom models and software tools.\r\nIt will examine the impact of circuit limitations on system performance,and explore ways of iter-\r\nating between circuit and system designs to achieve the best overall system performance.Through\r\nMIT 's OpenCourseWare initiative,the course materials and software will be made available to\r\nother universities as well as industry.Dissemination of the course through the OpenCourseWare\r\nprogram will allow students and industry designers from a variety of ethnic,economic,and geo-\r\ngraphic backgrounds to have access to state of the art techniques and tools for interface circuit\r\ndesign.",
