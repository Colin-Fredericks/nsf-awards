Specifically, the objectives of the proposed research are:\r\n1)To develop the enabling technology for the optical generation of millimeter-wave (MMW) signals (up to  ) using self pulsing in multi-section gain- and loss-coupled DFB lasers.  \r\n2)To demonstrate high-bit-rate (up to  ) all-optical clock recovery.\r\n3)To realize all-optical regeneration/format conversion of both amplitude and phase of optical signals for future high-bit-rate long-distance optical transport.\r\n4)To design, build and optimize MMW fiber-optic links for both uplinks and down links, which can be used to simplify the architecture of base stations for future broadband wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal manifests in that the proposed activity will advance the knowledge base and the technology base for optical communications in several fronts. It will lead to a 160 Gb/s clock recovery technology for future 50Tb/s per fiber transmission systems.  Using optical injection locking in combination with self pulsation to realize MMW fiber-optic uplinks for antenna remoting can potentially circumvent limitations that prevented insertion of optical technology for transmission of MMW signals.  For the first time, we introduce the concept of simultaneous amplitude and phase regeneration of carrier-suppressed return-to-zero (CSRZ) signals.  As optical transport technologies explore new modulation formats that manipulate both amplitude and phase, such optical regeneration techniques not only are intellectually stimulating and challenging but also have practical applications.  Fundamentally, this is an important first step as this naturally leads to the question of whether optical technologies can be used to regenerate both amplitude and phase for other modulation formats. \r\n\r\nThe proposed activity has broader impacts on the optical communications community and the society.  When successfully carried out, the proposed research will result in a technology option for building fiber-optic backbones for future 60 GHz broadband wireless networks.  This technology will further enable advance in next generation optical transport and networking at 40 Gb/s and above.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
