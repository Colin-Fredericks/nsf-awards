 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of current directions in dialog research, specifically to assess the current state of the art in the area of dialogue processing and to identify key themes and directions that are driving research in the field.  Progress in research often relies on a common infrastructure that includes tools and corpora, evaluation techniques, as well as some consensus on effective research paradigms.  Thus one of the outcomes of the workshop will be a set of recommendations for developing and supporting infrastructure and encouraging sharable research paradigms and evaluation methodologies. The motivation to hold a workshop at this time is the need to establish the role of dialog as a core element in human-human and human-computer communication and to identify the resources that are needed to support research in the area.",
