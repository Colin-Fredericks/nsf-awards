 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: A Unified Approach to Analyze Vibration of Rotating Flexible Structures\r\nRotating machines appear everywhere in our daily life. They could range from high-tech\r\napplications (e.g., jet engines) to ordinary household appliances (e.g., washing machines). For\r\nthe past decade, rapid technology advances in various industries call for more accurate vibration\r\nanalysis for rotating machines. For example, high-speed, high-density hard disk drives (HDD)\r\nrequire accurate geometric design of rotors and housings to meet stringent vibration specs.\r\nThe purpose of this project is to develop a unified approach to analyze vibration of rotating\r\nmachines with arbitrary geometry, complexity, and axisymmetry of the rotors and the stators.\r\nThe proposed research consists of three parts. The first part is mathematical development of the\r\nunified approach integrating finite element analysis and gyroscopic effects. The second part is to\r\nverify the unified formulation experimentally for axisymmetric and asymmetric rotors. The third\r\npart is to extend the unified formulation to systems that employ multiple rotating components,\r\nsuch as multi-stage turbines and network storage devices hosting dozens of HDD.\r\nThis research is novel and revolutionary, because it applies to rotating machines with\r\narbitrary geometry and complexity. For the society, this research will help many industries\r\nproduce faster and quieter rotating machines with higher reliability and efficiency. Also, this\r\nresearch will enhance education through an informal intern program, an effective technology\r\ntransfer through industrial short courses, active participation of underrepresented students, and\r\nimproved research infrastructure (e.g., disclosure of software tools, patents, and test facilities).",
