However, as our dependence on these technologies has grown, there have also been an increasing number of threats to this same technology, and to the information and processing managed by it.  The conference to be supported by this proposal will seek to identify \"grand challenges\" in the areas of information security and information assurance, or more broadly in Cyber Trust.  The conference is one of a series of conferences on grand research challenges in computer science and engineering that began in June 2002 with the \"Grand Research Challenges in Information Systems\" conference. A broad range of viewpoints will be included at the conference, which will product a report laying out a dynamic research agenda that will lead to substantive progress in IS/IA.  The agenda is expected to be of value not only to agencies and companies wishing to establish a long-term research agenda, but to the research and academic communities to help seed new projects.",
