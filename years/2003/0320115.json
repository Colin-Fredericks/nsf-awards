 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will work to develop the concept that ultra-high performance Nd: YVO4 laser crystals can be grown via a commercially viable hydrothermal processes. Recently, Nd: YVO4 crystal growth program using proprietary hydrothermal growth methods has been developed.  Preliminary results indicate that low defect Nd: YVO4 can be grown in aqueous base at ~ 500 microC. These crystals appear to have greatly superior optical properties. Hydrothermal Nd: YVO4 crystals will enable the development of new, higher efficiency, higher performance, lower cost diode pumped solid state lasers that emit at 1064, 532, 355, 266, and 190nm. In this Phase I program, two novel hydrothermal synthetic pathways to the production of single crystal, Nd: YVO4, will be developed and optimized at a scaleable and commercially viable hydrothermal growth process for the production of mm-scale crystals.  The optical properties of these crystals will be characterized and a comparison will be made against similar commercially available optical materials.  \r\n\r\nThe market for Nd: YVO4 in 2002 was estimated to range from $6-$10 MM. It is almost ideal for DPSS lasers, and Nd: YVO4 is rapidly becoming the material of choice for DPSS laser manufacturers.   The growth of this material is projected to be $16-$21 MM by 2005, and thereafter at 25% annually.  Hydrothermal Nd: YVO4 crystals will be used to make higher efficiency, higher performance, lower cost diode pumped solid state lasers; these lasers will emit at 1064, 532, and 355, 266, and 190 nm.  Because of the advantages and benefits of hydrothermal Nd: YVO4 crystals, the material will rapidly displace existing Nd: YVO4 crystals in most, if not all, diode pumped solid-state laser applications. \r\n",
