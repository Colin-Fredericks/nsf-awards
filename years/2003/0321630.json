 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to  develop advanced contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging diagnostics. In Phase I dramatically improved contrast agents based on carbon nanospheres were demonstrated. The researchers discovered this new class of molecules called Trimetaspheres, which involve three Gadolinium metal ions encapsulated in a fullerene molecule. They are more than 50 times better in terms of relaxivity than the currently available contrast agents and safer, because the metal ions cannot escape the carbon cage.  In the Phase II project full-scale production of the Gadolinium Trimetaspheres will be accomplished at the kilogram level to satisfy the market demand. These Trimetaspheres will be developed into future high field contrast agents and functionalization will be pursued to make the Trimetaspheres more soluble and biocompatible for various medical applications including cell targeting.  Following this, the Trimetaspheres will be characterized and evaluated for R1 MRI contrast agents for both high and low magnetic fields.  Subsequently Trimetaspheres will be developed for R2 MRI agents for high magnetic field applications. \r\n\r\nCommercially, Trimetaspheres have proven potential in the $1.5 billion market of MRI contrast agents. Trimetaspheres dramatically improve patient care and lower medical costs by improving existing MRI diagnostics and providing new contrast agents that allow diagnoses in cases where there is no current method. The technology developed in this project has immediate applications in current MRI measurements and satisfies requirements for future high field strength MRI instruments.  Improved contrast agents increase the likelihood of accurate diagnosis, and ultimately reduce the treatment cost. There are many instances where a MRI scan is not prescribed because no contrast agent exists.  For example within the brain, Trimetaspheres can pass the blood-brain barrier and are small enough to fit inside the smaller regions of blood vessels.  In addition, Trimetaspheres will lead to applications in other diagnostic equipment (x-ray, PET), and have advantages as a therapeutic delivering radiation upon targeted biodistribution. \r\n",
