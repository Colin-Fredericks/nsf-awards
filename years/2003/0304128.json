Process fluids will be seeded with nanoscopic (10-20 nm) magnetic particles suspended in a fluid phase to form magnetic fluids. Control of the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles will attained by manipulation of the direction and strength of the applied magnetic fields. Non-magnetic biological entities suspended in such a fluid would be subjected to magnetophoretic forces under a magnetic field gradient, and their migration rates will be determined by their size and morphology, which will permit separations based on density, size, and perhaps charge. In a related approach, magnetic beads will be aligned in an arroy of columns, and this array can serve as an effective sieving medium for the electrophoretic resolution of DNA fragments.\r\n\r\nThe project is being funded by two programs within CTS: \r\nParticulate and Multiphase Processes and Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics\r\n",
