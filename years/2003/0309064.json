Surface water sinks in the North Atlantic and flows southward to mix with other sources of deep water in what is known as the global conveyor belt. This deep water flow erodes sediment and ultimately deposits it in large drift deposits. These deposits record the history of deep water formation, which in large part reflects changes in the earth's climate.\r\n\r\nThe present project will undertake a detailed study of the seismic architecture of two large drift deposits in the North Atlantic. Specific aspects of the project are to obtain seismic reflection data with which  to interpret the early history of drift formation and to examine modern processes that shape and modify the drift deposits. These data will provide critical new information on these drifts and will also be used in planning future drilling to sample drift sediments directly. This is a cooperative study involving  investigators at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Rutgers University, and Middlebury College.  Field data will be acquired on a cruise of the RV Knorr in mid-2002.\r\n",
