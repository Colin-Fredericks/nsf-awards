Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (CZF) provides a\r\nstandard set theoretical framework for the development of constructive\r\nmathematics in the style of Errett Bishop. One of the hallmarks of\r\nconstructive set theory is that it possesses a canonical\r\ninterpretation in Martin-Lof's intuitionistic type theory which is\r\nconsidered to be the most acceptable foundational framework of ideas\r\nthat make precise the constructive approach to mathematics. The\r\ninterpretation employs the Curry-Howard `propositions as types' idea\r\nin that the axioms of constructive set theory get interpreted as\r\nprovable propositions.  There are central questions that have guided\r\nresearchers in classical Cantorian set theory over the last 50\r\nyears. The objective of the research to be undertaken is to pursue\r\nsimilarly central questions for constructive set theory. Roughly\r\nspeaking, these are questions addressing the independence of\r\nset-theoretic principles (via realizability notions and forcing over\r\nKripke models), the role of large set axioms, and the formalization of\r\nmathematics within such a framework. The method of forcing featured\r\nprominently in Cohen's famous independence results regarding the axiom\r\nof choice and the continuum hypothesis. In a similar vein, forcing\r\nmethods germane to the intuitionistic context, as well as\r\nrealizability structures, will be employed to tackle problems of\r\nindependence on the basis of CZF. The theory of large cardinals has\r\ndominated research in classical set theory for the last 40 years. In\r\nthe context of intuitionistic set theories large cardinal axioms have\r\nto be replaced by large set axioms. A central part of the proposed\r\nresearch will be concerned with studying notions of largeness couched\r\nin terms of elementary embeddings. It is hoped that this project will\r\nalso shed light on the role of large cardinals in devising strong\r\nordinal representation systems in the area of proof theory called\r\nordinal analysis.\r\n\r\nConstructive mathematics distinguishes itself from its traditional\r\ncounterpart, classical mathematics, by insisting that proofs of\r\nexistential theorems in mathematics respect constructive existence:\r\nthat an existential claim must afford means for constructing an\r\ninstance of it. The foundations of a systematic approach to\r\nconstructive mathematics, known as intuitionism, were laid in\r\nBrouwer's response to the foundational crisis in mathematics at the\r\nbeginning of the 20th century.  Nowadays, in computer science,\r\nconstructive formal systems based on type theory, or on the\r\nCurry-Howard isomorphism have become increasingly widespread for\r\nprogram development and language design. The concepts of program and\r\nconstructive proof are connected in a deep way. Via this connection\r\nproofs are used to support the development of reliable software\r\nsystems.  The axioms of so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory provide\r\nan accepted framework for formalizing classical mathematics whereas\r\nConstructive Set Theory (briefly CST) is a universal framework for\r\ndeveloping mathematics from a constructive viewpoint.  This project is\r\nmotivated by the desire to answer central questions regarding CST,\r\nquestions that have shaped the research activity in classical\r\nCantorian set theory for more than half a century. The work is\r\nexpected to substantially enhance our understanding of models of\r\nconstructive set theory and thereby enlarge the realm of\r\nconstructivism.\r\n",
