 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract for \"SENSORS: Collaborative Research: Self-configuring In Situ\r\nWireless Sensor Networks For Prescribed Fire Management\":\r\n\r\nWireless sensor networks offer exciting new technology with the\r\npotential to revolutionize the critical process of fire management in\r\nforests and public lands.  At present, wildland fire management is\r\nlimited by the coarse granularity of the collected weather data\r\nreceived through the portable belt weather kits worn by firefighters\r\nor through the sparsely scattered remote weather stations placed in\r\nforests.  Since weather is the most critical factor affecting fire\r\nbehavior and firefighter safety, then the deployment of fire weather\r\nsensor networks offers the prospect of fine-granularity weather data\r\nthat can vastly improve decision-making and safety in the fire management\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on solving the research challenges in designing,\r\ndeploying, and testing a self-configuring wireless fire weather sensor\r\nnetwork to support fire management in prescribed fire burns.\r\nReliability, energy efficiency, and connectivity in rugged terrain and\r\ntree cover pose key challenges.  Human interface requirements like\r\nreal-time access, localization, and dynamic reprogramming of sensor\r\nnodes add complexity to the problem.  Specific research objectives\r\ninclude: design and evaluation of self-configuring wireless systems\r\nthat are low maintenance, adaptive and automatically self-organizing\r\nin terms of their network routing; analysis of fault tolerant\r\ntechniques like multipath routing to facilitate persistent firefighter\r\naccess to in situ sensor readings in rugged terrain; testing of\r\nsustained low power operation through transmit power control,\r\ntime-synchronized duty cycles, and energy harvesting techniques such\r\nas solar power; and development of software that supports remote\r\ndynamic reprogramming of in situ sensor nodes.  The deployment and\r\ntesting sequence progresses from a series of laboratory and on-campus\r\nexperiments to a prescribed fire at a partner experimental forest.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this research project in terms of broader societal impact\r\ninclude the improvement of decision-making and safety in the\r\nmanagement of prescribed wildland fires, the development of tools to\r\nenable real-time fire monitoring in rugged terrain, the generation of\r\nscientific datasets to improve forecasting of wildland fire behavior,\r\nthe integration of research results into the curricula of university\r\ncourses, and increased public understanding of fire behavior in\r\nwildlands through the release of research results via the Web.  This\r\nresearch effort arises from a partnership between the University of\r\nColorado at Boulder and the University of Montana.  The group's\r\ncollective expertise in computer science, electrical engineering,\r\nforestry, and fire intelligence promotes the spirit of collaborative,\r\nmultidisciplinary research in a real-world setting, enhancing the\r\ncreativity of students and faculty alike.",
