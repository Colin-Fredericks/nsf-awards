 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to investigate middleware technologies for ubiquitous computing, and under a partnership with HP Labs, extend those technologies to support interactive applications on the grid. The following research contributions are expected:\r\n\r\n* Develop attribute-based naming and discovery of resources;\r\n* Develop novel techniques for higher-level data fusion leading to synthesis of resources where applicable;\r\n* Develop novel techniques for recovering from failures (both real and perceived performance);\r\n* Develop novel resource allocation strategies that take into account a variety of parameters including time-varying load on participating resources, dynamic user demands, and location information; and\r\n* Undertake detailed scalability studies of the proposed techniques in the context of ubiquitous computing applications.\r\n\r\nA concrete deliverable beyond these research nuggets will be the incorporation of this middleware technology into standard grid computing infrastructure such as the Globus toolkit in partnership with HP labs.\r\n\r\nThe location-aware middleware will be demonstrated in two ways: campus-based outdoor activity support based on the Georgia Tech campus and the Aware Home, a unique laboratory for the investigation of ubiquitous computing in a domestic setting.\r\n\r\nThe work has broad impact and intellectual merit with respect to its potential for adoption and use via Globus integration and industry partnership.\r\n",
