Miller\r\n\r\nProfessor Hesselholt, working with Ib Madsen and Thomas Geisser, has\r\nmade deep advances in understanding the cyclotomic trace spaces\r\nassociated to a ring.  These spaces were invented to describing the\r\ndiffeomorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds, and Hesselholt's\r\nwork is a significant step in that program. Central to Hesselholt's\r\nwork is a connection he descovered between the cyclotomic trace spaces\r\nand the de Rham-Witt complex of p-adic arithmetic algebraic\r\ngeometry. This has led to a generalization of the de Rham-Witt complex\r\nto a mixed characteristic situation, where it is related to the sheaf\r\nof p-adic vanishing cycles. This relationship further suggests the\r\nexistence of a motivic theory behind the cyclotomic trace\r\nspaces. Under the support of this grant, Hesselholt will pursue this\r\nstriking relationship between p-adic arithmetic algebraic geometry and\r\nthe computations in topology relevant to understanding diffeomorphism\r\ngroups.  Professor Hopkins, working with Matthew Ando and Charles Rezk\r\nhas recently uncovered a new approach to congruences between modular\r\nforms using algebraic topology, which he plans to pursue with an eye\r\non several open problems in the area.  In another collaborative\r\neffort, Professors Hopkins, Dan Freed and Constantin Teleman\r\ndiscovered a topological expression for the Verlinde algebra--an\r\nalgebraic structure arising in mathematical physics and in the theory\r\nof representations of loop groups.  The three of them plan to explore\r\nthis connection more deeply, with the long term ambition of\r\ndiscovering the topological sources of topological quantum field\r\ntheories.  Hopkins will also continue his work with Isadore Singer on\r\ntheir theory of ``differential function spaces,'' which offers a\r\nrefinement of algebraic topology especially suited for meeting the\r\ndemands of mathematical physics.  Professor Miller will continue his\r\nwork on Landweber exact and elliptic cohomology theories, his work\r\nwith Bill Dwyer on topological Hochschild homology and the geometry of\r\nfree loop spaces, and his study of the homotopy theory of algebraic\r\nstructures arising in knot theory and the modern theory of Hopf\r\nalgebras.\r\n\r\nThe field of algebraic topology arose in the late 19th century as\r\nmathematicians noticed deep similarities between very different\r\nlooking areas of research.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the\r\nbasic theory of algebraic topology was in place, and it was being used\r\nto explain, codify and reveal many qualitative aspects of geometry.\r\nDuring the next hundred years algebraic topology advanced at an\r\namazing pace, and by now it seems as if every branch of contemporary\r\nmathematics draws on some form of algebraic topology when undertaking\r\nto articulate its qualitative aspects.  The algebraic topology group\r\nat MIT runs a large and diverse program emphasizing the many\r\nconnections between algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, geometry,\r\nand mathematical physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
