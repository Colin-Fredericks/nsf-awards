 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop the initial component of a cognitive structure for a robotic scrub technician in the operating room. The scrub technician will maintain a tray of instruments, handing an instrument to the surgeon when requested and retrieving the instrument when the surgeon is finished with it. The opportunity is to reduce hospital personnel costs and alleviate a critical nursing shortage problem. The problem is to provide the robot with situational awareness comparable to an experienced human scrub technician, particularly in the ability to anticipate the surgeon's next request. The objective of the project is to determine the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and statistical techniques to provide this ability. The research method will compare selected techniques for time series prediction and classification, using data sets from actual surgeries. The candidate techniques will include first to third order Markov methods, N-sequence matching, neural networks and fuzzy set based inference. The end product is expected to be a prediction engine that will enable the clinical version of the robot to perform as well or better than an experienced human scrub technician. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and instrumentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
