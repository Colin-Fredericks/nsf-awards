 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is providing scholarships to academically qualified but financially disadvantaged students in aeronautically oriented engineering technology majors with emphasis on supporting students from underrepresented groups. Scholarships are being provided to students in both two- and four-year technology degree programs.  The project involves active faculty-student mentoring and an internship program with local industries to improve student retention and graduation. Students attend a seminar series especially designed for the scholarship recipients. All scholarship awardees also participate in a culminating research project under the direction of their mentor. The results of each project are presented to a panel of faculty members. As they approach graduation, students are provided with employment placement assistance, a service that is considered lifelong.",
