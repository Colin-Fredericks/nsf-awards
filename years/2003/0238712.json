 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career (CAREER) development plan presents a novel approach that integrates mechanics, materials and manufacturing concepts to optimize the superplastic forming (SPF) process and advance its industrial utilization.  The principal research goals of this project are:  (1) to improve the current predictive capabilities of material deformation and failure during SPF and (2) to devise optimum forming practices to increase production rate.  To achieve the first research goal, accurate multiaxial and microstructure-based constitutive models of deformation and failure will be developed and incorporated into a general purpose FE code.  The modeling framework will be based on large viscoplastic deformation with a microstructure-based overstress function, a dynamic anisotropic yield surface, and internal variables.  The models will be calibrated and validated using detailed mechanical tests, including multiaxial experiments, and advanced microstructural characterization techniques in collaboration with a National laboratory.  The second research goal will be achieved by developing optimum forming pressure profiles that can reduce the forming time and maintain the integrity of the formed part, and by refining the initial microstructure of the superplastic sheet using friction stir processing (FSP).  The research will also include a detailed post SPF analysis, an issue that has been neglected in previous SPF studies.  The outcome is a comprehensive methodology, which involves experimental procedures, analytical and numerical models that can be used to optimize SPF of various superplastic alloys.  The focus of this project will be on commercial magnesium alloys because of their unique properties and the recent increased interest in Mg alloys, especially from the automotive industries.\r\n\r\nThe education plan in this CAREER project outlines efforts to:  (1) expose young children to the exciting possibilities of the engineering profession and inspire their imagination and curiosity;  (2) help freshmen engineering students learn more about engineering disciplines and help improve retention rate; (3) encourage engineering students to be involved in the activities mentioned in 1 and 2, and ensure that student involvement includes all facets of the student population including female and minority students; and, (4) introduce modern undergraduate and graduate courses which meet the new ABET requirements, in particular, the need to integrate advances in mechanics and materials into manufacturing.  The educational component will have a direct impact on the welfare of the State by investing in the youth and strengthening and promoting the only children's museum in the State.  The CAREER development program includes a management plan to ensure achieving the objectives.  It involves an advisory committee consisting of multidisciplinary individuals to offer technical advice, facilitate dissemination of the results and ensure exposure of the findings.  The success of the research activities will advance the widespread industrial utilization of SPF.  This will have a positive impact on society and will lead to cheaper, safer and environmentally friendly products.\r\n\r\n",
