 "awd_abstract_narration": "A smooth real-valued function f on a complex manifold X\r\nis said to be strongly q-convex if its Levi form L(f)\r\nhas at most q-1 nonpositive eigenvalues at each point.\r\nThe manifold X is called strongly q-convex if X admits\r\nan exhaustion function which is strongly q-convex on the\r\ncomplement of some compact subset K (X is q-complete\r\nif one may take K to be empty). There are also well-known\r\nnotions of q-convexity for complex spaces. If g is a Hermitian\r\nmetric on X, then f is of class SP(g,q) if the trace of\r\nthe restriction of L(f) to any complex vector subspace of\r\ndimension q in the tangent space at any point in X\r\nis positive. Such functions are strongly q-convex. The principal\r\ninvestigator and  Mohan Ramachandran have applied such functions to\r\nobtain results concerning the Levi problem and the structure of\r\ncomplete Kaehler manifolds. They have also developed and applied\r\nanalogous classes on complex spaces. The principal investigator\r\nplans to apply such functions to extend some results for Kaehler\r\nmanifolds to singular Kaehler spaces and to study q-convexity\r\nproperties of coverings; in particular, covering spaces of\r\n(quasi)projective varieties. Some or all of the proposed work\r\nwill probably involve collaboration with Michael Fraboni, Cezar\r\nJoita, or Mohan Ramachandran.\r\n\r\n    Complex spaces (in particular, Stein spaces and projective\r\nvarieties), are the fundamental objects of study in several\r\ncomplex variables and algebraic geometry.  The notion of\r\nq-convexity is one of the many useful generalizations\r\nof geometric convexity (for example, a region in the plane is\r\ngeometrically convex if any line segment connecting two points\r\nin the region lies entirely within the region). The convexity\r\nproperties of a complex space (for example, a covering space\r\nof a projective variety) are intimately connected with\r\nthe space's holomorphic function theory and geometry.\r\nHolomorphic functions on complex spaces (for example, on regions\r\nin the complex number plane) are the natural analogues of\r\ndifferentiable functions on the real number line from differential\r\ncalculus.  Thus the study of convexity properties is\r\nan essential element in the study of complex spaces.\r\nMoreover, notions of convexity (like those of symmetry) appear in\r\nalmost every field of mathematics, science, and engineering.\r\nHence the study of convexity properties of complex spaces\r\nprovides further evidence of the importance of convexity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
