 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research over the past century has shown that where earthworms are abundant, they significantly influence soil processes critical to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Recent interest has focused on impacts of invasive, exotic earthworms on soil processes, particularly in temperate regions. Dramatic effects of introduced earthworms on soil organic matter dynamics have been reported in a number of cases. The focus of nearly all of this work has been on a few species of exotic earthworms which have achieved wide distributions and now dominate the soil fauna in many ecosystems. Such effects have rarely been reported from invasions of ecosystems inhabited by native earthworm assemblages, particularly where soils are undisturbed. Objectives of this proposed work are to address the following questions:\r\n1) Do native earthworm species maintain exclusivity or dominance over exotic earthworm species in undisturbed, native ecosystems? \r\n2) Are the impacts of exotic earthworm species on soil processes reduced in the presence of native earthworm species in their native ecosystems? \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This work will promote training of a post-doctoral associate, a graduate student and several undergraduate students. Collaborations with regional and national museums will be developed to foster any new biological collections and to promote biodiversity information.\r\n",
