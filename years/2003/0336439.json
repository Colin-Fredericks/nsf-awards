 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the needs for a synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics\r\nand intelligent computer communication and control in the design and manufacture of products\r\nand processes, a new International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM) was\r\njointly approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and the American\r\nSociety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1997. Since its first inception in 1997 in Tokyo, the\r\nIEEE/ASME AIM Conference has been held biennial, rotating the host country among Japan\r\n(AIM'97), the United States (AIM'99), Europe (AIM'01), and, in the future, other Asian Pacific-Rim\r\nnations as well. The conference has been co-sponsored by the IEEE Industrial Electronics\r\nSociety (IES), the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), and the ASME Dynamic\r\nSystems and Control Division (DSCD).\r\nThe great practical significance of the conference theme has made past three AIM conferences a\r\nsuccess and the conference has been expanded significantly  from predominantly Asians\r\nparticipants in AIM'97 in Tokyo to a good representation of US scientists and engineers in\r\nAIM'99 in Atlanta, and the European participants in AIM'01 in Como, Italy. This year, the\r\nconference will be held in Kobe, Japan, in July 20-24, 2003. The conference will provide a\r\nunique venue where researchers, engineers and industrial exhibitors from the globe who are\r\ninterested in advancing the state-of-the-art of mechatronics gather and discuss effective ways to\r\nadvance mechatronics as an emerging engineering technology and a new discipline in the 21st\r\ncentury. In order to achieve the conference goal of bring together researchers from the globe in\r\nthe fields of mechanical engineering (ME) and electrical engineering and computer science\r\n(EECS), partial funding is requested from the National Science Foundation to assist US\r\nresearchers to contribute and present papers in the AIM'03. It is expected that such a partial\r\nsupport will not only encourage the active participation of US researchers in the conference to\r\npromote global collaborations, but also advance the US mechatronics education and research in a\r\nlong run due to the following unique features of the conference: (i) the host country, Japan, has\r\nbeen excelling in Mechatronics, (ii) the conference will draw worldwide participation from 26\r\ncountries based on the accepted papers, (iii) an innovative format of interactive sessions will be\r\ndeveloped the first time in demonstrating various real mechatronics systems, and (iv)unique\r\nindustrial visits have been arranged by the Japanese organizers for conference participants in\r\nshowing the practical applications of the discipline.",
