Instruments supported here include (1) a digital side-scan sonar system and (2) a sub-bottom profiling system, together with appropriate processing and analysis software and computer hardware.  The instruments will be used in several ongoing research projects, and they will be integrated into the courses in the Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies curriculum, using both the University's small research vessel and planned continuation of ongoing collaborations with NOAA on the R/V Ferrel through the Sea Grant Program.  A major thrust of CCU's program is integration of research and education, including a recent AIRE award from NSF, and these instruments support extension of that effort in marine sciences, enabling research projects by undergraduate students at this predominantly-undergraduate campus, as well as students in the new Master of Science program in Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies.  The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. \r\n***\r\n",
