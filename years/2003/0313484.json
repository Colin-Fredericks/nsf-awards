 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since it is widely expected that hydrocarbon resources will be in short supply in the near future, it is vital that researchers develop chemical processes and chemical products based on alternative renewable feedstocks such as carbohydrates.  This research will focus on fundamental scientific catalysis research for the conversion of biorenewable resources to valuable chemical intermediates.  The reactivity of supported Ru-Cu bimetallic catalysts will be investigated for the conversion of glucose and sorbitol to oxygenated chemicals such as polyols (ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, butandiol).  Kinetic measurements, in situ catalyst characterization, and theoretical quantum chemical calculations of reaction pathways will be performed. This work is an extremely important direction for future catalysis research.  The researcher is well recognized for prior work on bimetallic catalysts and has already made important contributions in this area.  The prospects for successful kinetic measurements and EXAFS experiments are very high.  Other aspects of the research involving infrared spectroscopy will be challenging. Collaborative interactions involving theoretical calculations are well within the expected capability for the researchers at the University of Virginia.  An excellent program involving under-represented minorities is also already in existence and there has been a solid level of accomplishment in educating graduate and undergraduate students.  Dissemination of the research results through publications, workshops, and annual meetings is an important part of the proposed work.",
