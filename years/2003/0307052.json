The goal\r\nof this program is to use both recent and proposed multi-wavelength observations of the central\r\n200 pc of the Galaxy to put together a more complete picture of the interstellar processes in this\r\nphysically-extreme region. In particular, she will (1) elucidate the complex physical arrangement\r\nand associations of stellar and interstellar components in the Galactic Center using a combination\r\nof high-resolution, atomic hydrogen absorption data from the Very Large Array and existing multi-\r\nwavelength datasets. (2) Secondly, she will investigate the relationship of the magnetic field in\r\nthe Galactic Center to the diffuse interstellar components (e.g. ionized, molecular and very hot\r\ngas) and the role it plays in the transport of energy out of the nucleus using existing and future\r\nradio polarimetric and X-ray datasets. Comparisons between the magnetized and other interstellar\r\ncomponents are crucial to determining the physical processes at work in this environment. The\r\nlevel of detail that can be observed in the central few hundred parsecs of the Galaxy vastly\r\nexceeds the resolution with which one can probe the nuclear regions of other galaxies. Ultimately,\r\nthis type of investigation of the violent processes occurring in our own Galactic Center will provide\r\ninsight as to the nature of violent processes occurring in the nuclear regions of other galaxies.\r\n\r\nAs a key aspect of the research program, Dr. Lang will be working with the Women\r\nin Science and Engineering (WISE) program at the University of Iowa to involve traditionally\r\nunder-represented female physics and astronomy students (both undergraduate and graduate) in\r\nan active research collaboration. In addition to carrying out the proposed observations and analysis\r\nof Galactic Center data, Dr. Lang and her students will create a web-based, multi-wavelength\r\nGalactic Center resource for members of the scientific community, teachers of all levels, and the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
