 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will further the investigation of two innovative technologies for characterizing fractures in rock masses. The first technology involves image-processing algorithms for the extraction of 3D fracture properties from fracture traces in digital images.  The second technology involves the use of laser-scanners to extract the 3D properties of exposed fracture surfaces. The two technologies complement each other well and there are situations where the characterization of fracturing is best analyzed with one or the other or both technologies. The first objective of the Phase II research is to continue to improve the two technologies, and to integrate all the various algorithms into a single user-friendly software tool. The second objective is to thoroughly evaluate sources of error in both technologies through synthetic and field studies, and to develop a set of recommended field procedures and equipment for various applications to optimize the techniques and minimize errors. The third objective is to develop relationships with potential customers for the software and also groups interested in collaborating on software development and validation. Once a beta version of the software is developed, this software will be provided to some customers for validation and assessment.\r\n\r\nWithin the broad scope of the rock engineering market, four distinct market segments have been identified for this innovation.  Each market segment has a separate end-use application: mining, geotechnical, petroleum, and environment.  Market research and letters of support from various market participants have demonstrated that a market need exists for automation of tasks currently performed manually by rock engineering professionals.\r\n",
