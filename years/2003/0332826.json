 "awd_abstract_narration": "As information technology has become more widespread, it is now increasingly\r\npossible for decision makers, such as CEOs and legislators, to obtain advice from\r\na variety of experts with di!ering areas of expertise. Conventional wisdom suggests\r\nthat, as a result, the decision maker will reach better decisions. This, however, ignores\r\nthe fact that experts may withhold or distort information in the hope of influencing\r\nthe decision in a direction favorable to them. Thus, a decision maker needs to consider\r\nhow the structure of communication -- the conversation --affects how informative is\r\nthe advice received from experts. This project investigates how the structure of\r\ncommunication a!ects the quality of decisions.\r\nThe first part of the project concerns conversations between an uninformed deci-\r\nsion maker and an informed expert. When the expert sends a written report, unac-\r\ncompanied by any dialogue, this results in substantial information loss. A face-to-face\r\nmeeting between a decision maker and an expert, however, leads to an improvement\r\nin the informativeness of expert advice--even though the decision maker is completely\r\nuninformed. Both the decision maker and the expert benefit from the conversation.\r\nThis leads us to examine the following questions: How much information can be cred-\r\nibly transmitted in a face-to-face meeting? Is it possible to induce the expert to fully\r\ndisclose his information?\r\nIn many situations, the decision maker himself may be knowledgeable about some\r\naspects of the decision. As an example, an entrepreneur may have detailed knowl-\r\nedge about the growth prospects of his product, but still require financial expertise in\r\ntaking his company public. The second part of the project concerns communication\r\nin such situations--where both the decision maker and the expert have some rele-\r\nvant information. Once again, the structure of communication can critically affect\r\nthe amount of information exchanged. For instance, there are many circumstances\r\nwhere back-and-forth communication does not lead to information gains--even if the\r\ndecision maker is informed--and we identify these circumstances. This leads us to\r\nask the following questions: Is the situation improved by adding more rounds of com-\r\nmunication? Is a face-to-face meeting superior to a back-and-forth exchange, such as\r\nvia E-mail?\r\nThe third part concerns situations where decisions are multi-faceted and informa-\r\ntion is dispersed among many \"specialist\" experts. For instance, a piece of legislation\r\nmay impact both employment and the environment. Different lobbying groups are\r\nlikely to possess expertise in each of these areas. We study whether providing experts\r\nwith an opportunity to communicate with one another improves the informativeness\r\nof their advice. Is the situation improved if the decision maker also participates? Is\r\nthe situation improved if there is overlap in the experts' specialized knowledge?\r\n",
