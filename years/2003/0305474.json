 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: The long-term goal of this project is to study holomorphic\r\nmappings and real submanifolds arising in complex analysis and\r\nholomorphic dynamical systems. A large part of the PI's proposed\r\nresearch has its roots in Birkhoff's fixed point theorem, the KAM\r\n(Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theory, and the Siegel-Bruno-Yoccoz\r\ntheory.  On the other hand, new research obtained by the method of\r\ncomplex analysis will give new insights into the classical\r\narea-preserving maps and reversible maps, and reversible or\r\nHamiltonian systems. The PI's proposed research involves several\r\nproblems in connection with real analytic surfaces in\r\ntwo-dimensional complex space, formally linearizable reversible or\r\narea-preserving real analytic maps, and singular Levi-flat\r\nhypersurfaces in the complex projective space. \r\n\r\nThe differential equations concerning the motion of N mass points, \r\na model of the solar system,in the three-dimensional space attracting \r\neach other according to the Newton's law form a Hamiltonian system.\r\nThe reversibility of a dynamical system could just be the time-symmetry \r\nthat is important in practical matters.  The periodic orbits of certain \r\narea-preserving mappings correspond to the periodic motion in the \r\nHamiltonian system of the restricted three-body problem, and such  study\r\nof the existence of such periodic orbits goes back at least to work of \r\nPoincar\\'e and Birkhoff on the celestial mechanics about a century ago. \r\nThe PI's work aims to understand the existence of periodic orbits in such \r\nHamiltonian or time-symmetric systems, both over the real numbers and \r\nover the complex numbers.The PI is active in undergraduate teaching, and\r\nhas also organized a graduate student seminar dealing with his research area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
