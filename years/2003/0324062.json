 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over a four-year period 108 scholarships are being awarding to academically talented, but financially disadvantaged students majoring in computer science related programs and engineering technologies.  One-year Scholarships are awarded to cohorts of eighteen freshman students in years one, two and three.  Provided academic and financial eligibility is maintained these students will be awarded a second one-year scholarship enabling them to complete their two-year courses of study leading to an Associates degree.\r\n\r\nProject goals include:\r\n1) Increasing the participation of low-income, academically talented students in CSEMS careers, especially those of underrepresented groups.\r\n2) Retaining these students to degree completion by providing a comprehensive student support system consisting of counselors, faculty, tutors as needed, and consultants from industry, as well as opportunities outside the classroom to enhance their learning.\r\n3) Creating new partnerships and strengthening existing ones with business and industry and K-12 institutions to assist in recruitment, retention, and employment.\r\n",
