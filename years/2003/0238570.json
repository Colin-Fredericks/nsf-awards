 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software reliability is one of the most important problems in computer\r\nscience.  A single operating system error can crash the machine.  A single\r\nsecurity hole can compromise the integrity of the entire system or, as\r\nsoftware and its errors is replicated, the integrity of entire networks.\r\nThis research focuses on practical techniques to effectively find large\r\nnumbers of such software errors.  Initial results are promising: the\r\napproach has found hundreds of security holes and thousands of serious\r\nerrors in the Linux operating system, as well as in large commercial\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThe research centers on using static analysis to find errors in source\r\ncode. It uses two main techniques: (1) metacompilation (MC) to check\r\ncorrectness rules (such as ``a call to the lock() function must be paired\r\nwith a call to unlock()'') and (2) belief analysis to infer such rules\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nMetacompilation uses programmer-written, system-specific static checkers\r\nto find software bugs.  Because these extensions can be written by\r\nsystem implementors themselves, they can take into account the ad hoc\r\n(sometimes bizarre) semantics of a system.  Because they are compiler\r\nbased, they also get the benefits of automatic static analysis.\r\n\r\nBelief analysis: A major obstacle to finding program errors in a real\r\nsystem is knowing what correctness rules the system must obey. These\r\nrules are often undocumented or specified in an ad hoc manner.\r\nBelief analysis automatically infers such checking information from\r\nthe source code itself, rather than the programmer, thereby avoiding\r\nthe need for a priori knowledge of system rules.  It works by analyzing\r\nsource code to infer what programmers believe to be true and checking\r\nthese beliefs for contradictions.  For example, if a call to ``lock()''\r\nis paired with a call to ``unlock()'' 1000 times and not paired once,\r\nthis is a good indication that the code believes these calls must be\r\npaired, and that the single deviation is an error.\r\n\r\nThe research will also involve an educational component.  The most\r\nsignificant feature will be heavily involving undergraduates in research.\r\nEmpirically, doing so helps them think creatively, independently, as\r\nwell as pushing them to go much deeper than a typical class.\r\n",
