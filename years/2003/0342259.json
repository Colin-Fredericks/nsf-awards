 "awd_abstract_narration": "The term \\emph{peer-to-peer}(P2P) came to the force very publicly\r\n with the rise and fall of Napster.\r\nAlthough there are prior systems in this evolutionary phase of distributed computing,\r\n P2P system first emerges as a significant social and technical phenomenon right after the\r\n deployment of Napster.\r\nCurrently most of popular P2P systems are  aiming at the file sharing applications,\r\n where files are stored at some end-users' machines rather than at a central\r\n server in the traditional client/server model.\r\n\r\nWireless ad hoc networking is just a special case of P2P networking, where\r\n no infrastructure or celluar networking is needed for communication.\r\nRecent years saw a great amount of research \r\n in wireless ad hoc networks. These\r\nworks involve a number of theoretical aspects of computer science, including\r\napproximation algorithms, computational geometry, combinatorics, distributed\r\nalgorithms. However, there are still many challenges in wireless ad hoc\r\nnetworks. Due to the limited capability of processing power, storage, and\r\nenergy supply,  many conventional algorithms are too complicated to be\r\nimplemented in a wireless ad hoc networks. Some other algorithms did not take\r\nadvantage of the geometry nature of the wireless networks. Additionally, most\r\nof the currently developed algorithms for wireless networks assumed a precise\r\nposition of each wireless node, which is impossible practically. Majority of\r\nthe algorithms developed in this area also assume all nodes have uniform\r\ntransmission range. These algorithms will likely fail when nodes have\r\ndisparity transmission ranges.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the wireless ad hoc networks requires efficient distributed\r\nalgorithms with low computation complexity and low communication complexity.\r\nThese algorithms are expected to take advantage of the geometry nature of the\r\nwireless ad hoc networks. Several fundamental questions should be answered:\r\ncan we improve the performance of traditional distributed algorithms under\r\nwireless ad hoc networks? Does the position information of wireless nodes make\r\ndifference in algorithms' performance?\r\n\r\nWe propose to organize a workshop to solicit the recent research efforts on\r\naddressing these challenges. Specific topics include but are not limited to\r\nthe following issues:\r\nDeployment for Connectivity,\r\nDeployment for Coverage, \r\n Throughput,\r\nMobility,\r\nChannel Assignment,\r\nPower/Topology Control,\r\nLocalized Routing,\r\nCooperation Enforcement and Mechanism Design,\r\nSecurity.\r\n\r\nA number of junior faculty and graduate students from both domestic and\r\ninternational have been actively working on addressing some of these\r\nchallenges. They will be the main component of potential attendees of this workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is intended to bring together researchers in mobile computing and\r\ndistributed algorithms to foster cooperation. It is intended to be a lively\r\nmeeting, covering many of the algorithmic and discrete aspects of this field\r\ngoing from operations research to radio engineering problems. It aims, in\r\nparticular, at fostering the cooperation among practitioners and theoreticians\r\nof the field. We plan to hold this workshop on June 2nd, 2004 at Chicago,\r\nIllinois. Workshop papers will be published in workshop proceedings and\r\nselected papers will be published in a special issue of a journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy organizing the workshop on the theoretic aspects of wireless ad hoc networks\r\n that addresses the a number of challenge and fundamental problems.\r\nThe potential attendees of the workshop will be junior faculty and senir PhD students\r\n who had been actively working in the theoretic aspects of wireless ad hoc networks.\r\nThus, a successful workshop will initiate more junior faculty and PhD students\r\n in the research of this area.\r\nOur own experiences in working with PhD students has been excellent.\r\nOur currently supported Ph.D. students have already\r\n contributed to considerable number of papers published in major theoretical\r\n and/or networking conferences.\r\nExposure to this workshop organized by National Science Foundation will \r\n increase their productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the proposed research activities involve  theoretical understanding\r\n and solving of practical questions from wireless networking,\r\n the proposed workshop will foster collaborations with faculties \r\n from other discipline,\r\n some researchers from industry to verify the developed theoretical methods in a\r\n more practical settings to see its practical performance.\r\nAdditionally, since ad hoc networks support applications\r\n related to disaster relief, public event coordination, and military and \r\n law enforcement operations,\r\n the proposed research has vast societal impact.\r\n",
