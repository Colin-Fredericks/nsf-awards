 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of our project is to help engineering students become global engineers by learning to define and solve problems in the context of differing cultural and national perspectives. Another goal has been to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two different approaches to student learning. Our project accomplishes these goals by developing and evaluating twelve multimedia-learning modules under the general title, \"Engineering Cultures.\" Our first objective has been to complete final versions of eight prototype modules and develop four additional modules. Each module includes 3-5 multimedia lessons (45-60 minutes each) on CDs, a one-hour multimedia Introduction to Engineering Cultures, an accompanying reader, a user's manual for students and instructors, sample quiz and exam questions for instructors, and a web database of supporting materials, including interviews with engineers from different countries. Our second objective is to evaluate the intellectual content of each module with the assistance of 24-30 content experts. Our final objective is to evaluate and compare student learning in semester-length multimedia and classroom versions of Engineering Cultures at each of two schools. Demo versions of the multimedia modules will be disseminated to engineering educators at engineering education conferences and via an upcoming ASEE national project on dissemination of best education practices. We expect Prentice Hall to serve as national and international distributor for the finished products.",
