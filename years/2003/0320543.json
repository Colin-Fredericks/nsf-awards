 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Ball State University under the direction of Dr. Derron Bishop to purchase a confocal microscope. This instrument will be used to address a wide variety of biological questions that require the ability to reconstruct biological tissues in three-dimensional space or localize proteins within thick tissue specimens. The addition of a confocal microscope to an existing scanning and transmission electron microscope is also part of a broader effort to establish a high-resolution imaging facility available to investigators throughout the campus and nearby undergraduate institutions. This device will be the only one of its kind in the region and will serve as a critical component in enhancing the research and education opportunities of the diverse student body at Ball State University. \r\n\r\nBy permitting optical access to tissues previously inaccessible, the confocal microscope will augment existing research projects spanning the biology, medical education, and physiology-health science departments within the university. The instrument will be used to: 1) understand cellular mechanisms underlying rewiring of the developing nervous system; 2) localize proteins that regulate the development of the mouse embryo; 3) elucidate molecular mechanisms of synapse formation; 4) determine functional roles for annulate lamellae and their interaction with endoplasmic reticulum; 5) understand neuroimmune interactions in the digestive system. Undergraduate and master's level graduate students will have access to the instrument not only through investigator-sponsored research, but also as part of independent research projects in a newly revised course focusing on electron and confocal microscopic imaging. Other students will have access to the confocal microscope through individual research projects in cell culture techniques and developmental biology courses. \r\n\r\nConfocal microscopy will be demonstrated to local high school students who routinely visit the imaging facility as a means of promoting science and research at a pivotal time in their  education. Because the instrument will be available to nearby undergraduate institutions, scientific collaboration between diverse interdisciplinary researchers will be encouraged.",
