 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  At Delta State University we are creating and developing a regional cooperative NMR facility by adapting and implementing a system developed at Rider University. This facility serves our institution, Coahoma Community College, Mississippi Delta Community College and the wider community in the region.  Our overarching goal is to incorporate modern 1-D and 2-D FT-NMR spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate chemistry curricula at DSU, CCC and MDCC. To achieve our goal, we are adapting a series of experiments primarily from the Journal Of Chem. Education into different chemistry courses. These experiments introduce students to varied applications of NMR and provide them the opportunity to prepare their own samples as well as collect and process NMR data. The subject matter is first introduced in the general chemistry curriculum and students subsequently gain hands-on experience through spectroscopic identification of molecules in the organic chemistry sequence.  Experiments in this sequence provide exposure to 2-D techniques and opportunities to collect and interpret data from 1-H and 13-C spectra acquired of compounds prepared in self-designed syntheses. In upper level courses and undergraduate research students perform experiments that highlight more advanced applications of FT-NMR. A longer-term goal of our project is to develop a database of student-acquired NMR data from experiments performed in the labs and to compile an accompanying laboratory manual. This should allow instructors located at institutions without access to an NMR to download raw student data from the database and process the data at their desktop. This virtual NMR allows smaller institutions the ability to provide students with real data that they have to process in a manner commonly found in large chemical research laboratories without having to buy a spectrometer.\t\t",
