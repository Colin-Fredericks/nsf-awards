 "awd_abstract_narration": "Free boundary problems arising in shock reflection have been solved for regular shock\r\nreflection in a model equation; the method will be extended to a larger set of equations and\r\nother types of shock reflection. Solving a prototype problem for the gas dynamics equations\r\nis in sight. Other two-dimensional Riemann problems, such as reflection of rarefaction waves\r\nat the sonic line, will be considered. A different free boundary problem, with connections to\r\nnew kinds of singularities, occurs in this case. By constrast with shock reflection problems,\r\nin which the complicated behavior occurred in the subsonic region and was analysed using\r\nHolder estimates for degenerate elliptic equations, the interaction of rarefaction waves with\r\nthe sonic boundary involves study of degenerate hyperbolic eigenvalue problems.\r\n\r\nThe PI has had success, particularly with women graduate students and postdoctoral\r\nvisitors, in introducing beginning researchers to her areas in conservation laws, and in helping\r\nto expand their career horizons. It is planned to mentor two postdocs (at least one, already\r\nselected, is a woman), including encouraging their teaching and professional development in\r\nways such as writing proposals, refereeing papers, and participating in conferences.\r\nIn addition, the second research topic is strongly interdisciplinary, and the PI's work has\r\naroused some positive interest in the multifluid science community. The PI and co-workers\r\nwill attend and make presentations at engineering conferences, write articles for journals on\r\nmultiphase flow to explain the results, and organize sessions at conferences to bring together\r\nmathematical, computational and experimental researchers in multifluid science.\r\n\r\n",
