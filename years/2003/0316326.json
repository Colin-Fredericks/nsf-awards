 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this long-term study is to contribute to our understanding of processes that regulate atmospheric carbon and energy balance. This goal is being accomplished by measuring carbon gas fluxes and ecosystem level responses to climatic changes that control these fluxes. The project will extend a long-term data set of methane gas and carbon dioxide measurements in a northern peatland  (New Hampshire) to quantify carbon dynamics and the controls on the carbon cycle. Peatlands are the most significant natural source of methane to the atmosphere, and the trace gas dynamics of peatlands are an important component in the radiation balance of the atmosphere. Over the next 5 years, measurements of methane and carbon dioxide will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in weather variability between years correlates with measurable changes in the carbon gas flux from a natural peatland. Data sets using the same sampling techniques at the same sites over long periods of time provide the only way to assess how ecosystems respond to climate variability. This study will have broader impacts for basic science, by contributing to the development and testing of models that will be used to investigate how climate change and ecosystem processes interact. The project also has a significant training component, with support for graduate and undergraduate students. Significantly, the latter comprise female undergraduates from Mt. Holyoke College, providing them with a rigorous research experience.",
