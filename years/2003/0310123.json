Thirty leading mathematics educators representing these three major professional societies, as well as eight MAA committees, are jointly identifying the challenges that must be overcome and the strategies to do so. These include influencing the mathematics community, developing faculty training efforts, enlisting the support of other disciplines and business, industry, and government for the effort, and influencing state agencies that dictate general education requirements.",
