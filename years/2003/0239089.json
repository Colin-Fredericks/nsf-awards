 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\tThis proposal was funded under the auspices of the Coastal Ocean Processes Program (CoOP) in response to the \"Buoyancy-Driven Transport Processes\" announcement of opportunity (NSF 02-059). This announcement called for proposals investigating processes that control buoyancy-driven systems influenced by freshwater inflows.\r\n\tThis proposal focuses on the highly productive Eastern Boundary Columbia river plume. This plume is sufficiently large to be of regional importance, yet small enough to allow determination of dominant processes affecting river plumes, and to facilitate rate comparisons with regions outside the plume The proposed study will integrate results from the nearby wind-driven CoOP study, as well as with those from nearby GLOBEC and ECOHAB projects to provide definitive new information on alteration of rates of biogeochemical processes by the unique stratification, turbidity, mixing environment and nutrients of a river plume. Moreover, because the Columbia River provides no significant terrigneous nitrate to the plume in the growing season, this study allows plume-endemic processes to be isolated and hence process results can be directly applied to other plumes. Results can also be contrasted with more eutrophic, buoyancy-influenced coastal areas.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will address three hypotheses: \r\n-\tDuring upwelling the growth rate of phytoplankton within the plume exceeds that in nearby areas outside the plume being fueled by the same upwelling macronutrients. \r\n-\tThe plume enhances cross-margin transport of plankton and nutrients. \r\n-\tPlume-specific nutrients (Fe and SiO4) alter and enhance productivity on nearby shelves. \r\n\r\nThe proposed strategy is to compare production rates within the plume and outside the plume, on the more productive shelf to the north of the river mouth (Washington) and the less productive shelf to the south (Oregon). Results from this study address important question as to why a shelf with weaker upwelling winds is more highly productive than a shelf with stronger winds.\r\n",
