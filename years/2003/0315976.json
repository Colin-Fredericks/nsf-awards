 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are seeking financial support for the Eleventh International Conference on Narrow Gap Semiconductors (NGS-11), which will be held in Buffalo, New York, June 16 - 20, 2003 on the campus of the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York (SUNY). Specifically, we would like to request $3,500 to support student attendance at NGS-11. We will strongly encourage the participation of talented young students from under-represented groups such as women, minorities, and the disabled.\r\n\r\nThe United States has not hosted a NGS Conference since 1995 and it will be very good to bring back this major international conference to this country to expose our researchers to frontier research in this area. Previous NGS Conferences were held in Dallas, U.S.A. (1970), Nice, France (1973), Warsaw, Poland (1977), Linz, Austria (1981), Gaithersburg, U.S.A. (1989), Southampton, U.K. (1992), Santa Fe, U.S.A. (1995), Shanghai, China (1997), Berlin, Germany (1999), and Kanazawa, Japan (2001).\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together experts to discuss recent advances and discoveries in the science and technology of narrow gap semiconductors and low frequency excitations in semiconductors.  Materials systems of primary interest are: 6.1 A III-V semiconductors (InAs, GaSb, AlSb and their alloys), InSb-based alloys and heterostructures (e.g., InSb, InAlSb, InAsSb), ferromagnetic narrow-gap III-V semiconductors (e.g., InMnAs, GaMnSb), II-VI narrow-gap semiconductors (e.g., HgCdTe), II-VI/III-V heterostructures such as CdMnSe/InAs, lead salt (IV-VI) materials and heterostructures (e.g., PbSe, PbTe, PbSe/PbEuSe, PbTe/PbEuTe).\r\n\r\nIn addition to crystal growth/fabrication methods and studies, the program will also cover a broad range of physical phenomena and device applications, including: spin-related effects, infrared sources/detectors, gigahertz and terahertz phenomena and devices, hybrid structures combining semiconductors with superconductors or ferromagnetic metals, mesoscopic phenomena, hot carrier transport, quantum Hall effect, intersubband transitions, and Landau level spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\nThe Organizing and Program Committee consists of members who have strong on-going research programs on narrow gap semiconductors. Invited speakers will include many of the best researchers in this field, both from fundamental and applied research areas, including experimentalists and theorists. In addition, Prof. Emmanuel I. Rashba (University at Buffalo, SUNY) and Prof. Herbert Kroemer (University of California, Santa Barbara), two distinguished physicists in this area, have agreed to give the plenary talks of the Conference.\r\n\r\nDuring this five-day conference, we plan to have about 15 invited talks and 60 contributed talks as well as approximately 100 posters. We anticipate approximately 200 participants. There will be no parallel sessions. The Conference does not have any time overlap with other conferences devoted to similar topics, and we expect that all the key speakers will be able to come. The requested funding of $3,500 will be used entirely for supporting student participants: partial transportation for selected graduate students. We plan to select seven students with an average support of $500 per student. The students' reports will be included in the final report.\r\n",
