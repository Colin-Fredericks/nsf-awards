 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-assembly is the process by which simple objects \r\nspontaneously assemble into complexes. \r\nIt is expected to ultimately become \r\nan important technology at the level of atoms and\r\nmolecules.  The development of researches in programmable\r\nself-assembly is reaching the stage that we have\r\nto understand it mathematically in order\r\nto take full advantage of this new tool.\r\nThe goal of this research is to study \r\nthe computational aspects of self-assembly. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project includes: \r\n(1) Solving concrete problems in the Tile Assembly Model,\r\nincluding but not limited to\r\nfinding an approximation algorithm for the Minimum\r\nTile Set Problem (MTSP)\r\nand characterizing the shape languages.\r\n(2) Exploring different modelings of self-assembly, which\r\nwill give a more accurate abstraction of \r\nthe experimental results and will reflect the massive parallelism \r\nin molecular/DNA computing.\r\n(3) Studying the connections between \r\nthe algorithmic self-assembly and the classical theory\r\nof computation, especially the communication theory\r\nand the resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project will integrate teaching activity \r\ninto the research of self-assembly.\r\nThe PI will offer  graduate level courses in \r\nmolecular computing and closely-related fields such as \r\nbioinformatics, and introduce the research\r\nto undergraduate and graduate students in general theory courses.\r\nThis project will adopt the active learning techniques in teaching.\r\nIt is expected that the project will contribute to understanding\r\nthe engineering power of self-assembly, and to disseminating\r\nthe current research information to students as well.\r\n",
