 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a model curriculum based on existing programs at Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College by integrating new technologies such as Geographical Information System (GIS), Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), Global Positioning System (GPS) and computer aided problem solving into civil engineering technology. The curriculum is being designed as a certificate program and can be later modified to become an associate degree program. It is providing model course contents, examples, assignments, lab activities and fieldwork.\r\nThe impact of this project includes the dissemination and adoption of the curriculum by any community college or high school in the nation. To facilitate the information dissemination, workshops are being organized to train teachers who want to use this curriculum and the contents of the curriculum are being published through both printed media and electronic media including booklets, website and CDs and through conference presentations. The curriculum is being first evaluated by a panel of experts from the industry, universities, ASCE and ACSM, and then implemented at Evergreen Valley College and Santa Rosa Junior College and eventually disseminated through the country. The project is a collaborative effort among industry, education institutions and government agencies. The project has so far secured support from Trimble (the main GPS vendor), ESRI (the largest maker of GIS software), Bentley (the main civil engineering CAD vendor), Autodesk (the main CAD vendor), Santa Clara Valley Water District, HMH Engineering, Caltran, Santa Clara County, regional high schools, Santa Rosa Junior College, California State University at Fresno and San Jose Sate University.\r\n",
