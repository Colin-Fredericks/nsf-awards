CEA- CREST's mission is threefold: (1) to increase the numbers of minority citizens embarking on careers in the environmental sciences; (2) to conduct innovative, multidisciplinary environmental research; and (3) to provide a technical and personnel resource for the many academic, governmental, and industry environmental programs of the Southwestern United States. \r\n\r\nUnder the unifying theme of spatially structured dynamics, CEA-CREST will expand partnerships with major national research centers, enhance graduate degree programs helping still greater numbers of CEA-CREST graduates to enter doctoral programs, and ultimately elevate a coalition of CEA-CREST research teams to national competitiveness. To provide more educational opportunities for the diverse pool of CEA-CREST Student Fellows, the Center will revise an existing interdisciplinary Master's program and couple it with an initiative to establish a joint doctoral degree between California State University, Los Angeles and partner institutions. \r\n\r\nCenter research components include: Marine Population Dynamics; Ecosystem Carbon Flux; Genetics and Evolution of Marine Populations; Biogeochemical Cycling in Watersheds; and, Hydrology of Arid Lands.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThe Center's five research components outline plans for an impressive series of discoveries at various stages of realization. Established components led by senior investigators will disseminate significant research findings within the context of their expanding partnerships. Newer components led by young investigators will receive support to ensure that their very promising projects reach fruition.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\nCEA-CREST presents a vision of a fully integrated science community in which minority faculty and students lead significant intellectual enterprises. The vision inspires the efforts of other Minority Serving Institutions and encourages the allegiance of majority research universities in the causes of educational and environmental justice.\r\n",
