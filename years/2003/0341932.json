 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Broadcasting is developing a two-hour prime time PBS television special on complementary advances in particle physics and cosmology.  The program will present the dramatic recent history of the two disciplines, striking discoveries in both fields, and the cutting-edge research under way today.  The format of the programs will be modeled on Michael Riordan's book, \"The Hunting of the Quark,\" which presented a rich, personal story of working scientists with their struggles and their successes. \r\n\r\nThe following activities are among those that will be conducted during the planning phase:\r\n\r\n1.\tDevelop strategic partnerships among the principal research institutions and organizations involved in physics/astronomy education\r\n2.\tDevelop detailed treatments of the television programs\r\n3.\tResearch sources for program graphics with universities, national laboratories, and other research institutions\r\n4.\tMeet with the advisory board\r\n5.\tProduce a video sampler from taped interviews of selected scientists\r\n\r\nKey staff with include: Richard Hudson, Director of Science Production at KTCA-TV; Les Guthman, Executive Producer and Vice President of Outside Television for S2 Media; and Michael Riordan, physicist, science historian, and author.  Advisors for the project are:  Donna Cox, National Center for Supercomputing Applications and School of Art and Design, University of Illinois; Peter Galison, Department of History of Science, Harvard University; Leon Lederman, Director Emeritus, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory; Dennis Overbye, science writer; Randal Ruchti, Department of Physics, University of Notre Dame; George Smoot, Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley; and Michael Turner, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Chicago. \r\n\r\n",
