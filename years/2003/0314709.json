 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes research on the synthesis of conjugated organic materials, making use of newly discovered carbon-carbon bond-forming processes, which are based on (1) the couplings of alkynes with zirconium, and (2) nucleophilic aromatic substitutions involving fluorinated arenes. Using these synthetic methods, several new types of conjugated materials will be generated, including materials designed to have high electron affinities and operate as efficient electron-transporting (n-type) materials. The n-type materials developed in this program will be incorporated into field effect transistors and light-emitting devices, and the performances of these devices will be evaluated. Other structures to be targeted are expected to be highly emissive and therefore of use in light-emitting devices. Finally, synthetic routes to macromolecular and oligomeric species that combine p- and n-type segments will be explored. The solid-state structures and mesophases of such materials will be studied in detail, and specific examples will be investigated as components in new solar cell devices.\r\n \r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor T. Don Tilley, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California - Berkeley, is studying new approaches to electronic materials based on conjugated oligomers and polymers. In recent years, the electronics industry has made significant contributions to the economy and our standard of living. These developments have been fueled by the design and discovery of new materials that allow breakthroughs in the fabrication of electronic devices. Conjugated oligomers and polymers have attracted considerable interest for their potential to replace inorganic components in electronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs) and photovoltaic cells. Much of this interest stems from the wide range of properties that are potentially accessible and the available opportunities for tuning these properties via synthetic manipulation of the organic material's structure. Recently, this field gained considerable momentum with the realization of practical devices based on such \"plastic\" materials. Commercial applications have now emerged, and conducting organic materials are expected to play an expanding role in future technologies. The pace of this progress will be heavily influenced by the development of new organic materials with useful electronic properties. The proposed research is well suited for the training of young scientists, providing them with a good overview of important issues in science and technology and helping them to develop a broad set of technical skills and promote innovation and creativity.",
