 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n This proposal is for the acquisition of 1) a hydraulic structural testing system, 2) a modular loading steel frame,\r\n3) a post-tensioning system, 4) load cells, and 5) miscellaneous tools. The instrumentation will provide South Dakota with\r\nmuch needed opportunities in research, outreach, and education. A host of emerging technologies and\r\ndesign philosophies can be researched and developed using the new testing facility at SDSU. For\r\nexample, strength and fatigue of high performance concrete prestressed girders, performance-based\r\ndesign of structures, and behavior of flared bridge columns under biaxial bending are some of the\r\nresearch topics that can be initiated in the immediate future. Availability of research support will enable\r\nSouth Dakota to attract and support qualified graduate students and to provide training and research\r\nexperience to undergraduate students.\r\n. If equipped, the Lohr Structures Laboratory will be a unique testing facility of its kind and capacity in the state of South Dakota and some neighboring\r\nstates. The goal is to establish an excellent structures testing facility that will be used for research,\r\neducation, and outreach activities. The main objectives are to : 1) enable researchers at SDSU to\r\nconduct research in their field of expertise, 2) enhance the competitiveness of researchers at SDSU to\r\npursue national research projects, 3) establish collaborative research projects with SDSM&T and out-of-state\r\ninstitutions , 4) meet the research needs of regional government agencies and private industry,\r\n5) provide research experience to graduate and undergraduate students at SDSU, and 6) enrich the\r\nlearning experience of students by using experimental simulation.\r\n The Laboratory can also be used effectively in outreach activities by providing experimental demonstrations and\r\nhands-on workshops. Integrating research and teaching will also have positive influence on\r\nundergraduate education. The Lohr Structures Laboratory can be used effectively in the instruction of\r\nCEE 311 (Structural Material Laboratory) and other design courses that incorporate experimental\r\nsimulation. Potential sponsors for research and educational activities include Federal Highway\r\nAdministration, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, state departments of transportation,\r\nand local and national private industries.\r\n",
