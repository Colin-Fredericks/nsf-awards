July 4, 2003, \r\nat the Pacific Convention Plaza, Yokohama, Japan.  The expected attendance, based on \r\nthe experience of recent ISIT.s, is 750.850 technical delegates from more than 25 \r\ncountries. About one-third of these attendees are expected to be graduate students, and \r\nmany more will be recent graduates and new assistant professors.  \r\n \r\nThis proposal requests support for the travel expenses of ISIT participants from the U.S.  \r\nThese participants would be individuals whose papers have been selected for presentation \r\nat the Symposium, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel \r\nsupport. The total amount requested is $30,000, based on a total of 20- 30 grants of \r\n$1000-$1500 each. \r\n",
