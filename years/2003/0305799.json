 "awd_abstract_narration": "Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Interdisciplinary Informatics are sponsored jointly by the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Biological Sciences (BIO) to encourage research and training that cross the traditional disciplinary boundaries between them. These fellowships provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational activities in biology and informatics to a wide range of recent doctoral recipients (biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and others).  It is expected that the Fellows trained through these fellowships will play an important role in training the future workforce. Postdoctoral research and training in informatics will permit junior scientists trained in biology, mathematical, chemical, and physical sciences to play key roles in developing new quantitative tools and methods that will advance informatics in biology and other fields.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Incorporating structural data into a computational model of goldfish neurons.\" Automated morphometry of goldfish velocity storage neural integrator neurons will be performed, and morphologically faithful compartmental cable equation models developed using existing software packages.  Using such models, an active membrane, coarsely compartmented model for this neuron will be built.  Coupling the coarsely-compartmented models will allow a multiple neuron network model.\r\n",
