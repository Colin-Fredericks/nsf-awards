The IMS is the annual meeting of the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE). The IMS is also the major international conference in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless communications. In 2003, the IMS will be held in Philadelphia, PA, USA from June 8 to June 13.\r\n\r\nEach year, the MTT-S promotes student education and research in microwave theory and techniques through a number of mechanisms. One of the most important mechanisms is the Student Paper Competition at the IMS. This selective program brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical audience but also to a group of judges. The program helps develop the students' technical acumen as well as their communication skills. It also helps introduce them to the international technical community and helps to build a community of students\r\nwho will lead the next generation of microwave professionals.\r\n\r\nThe IMS provides financial support of various forms but does not reimburse travel expenses. Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.\r\n",
