 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 16th University Conference on Glass Science will be held on August 13-15, 2003 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180-3590, USA. The theme of the Conference is glasses for high technology. Structure, processing and properties of glasses used for various high technologies, including information technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology, will be covered. Examples of topics are silica and high silica glasses; glasses for liquid crystal displays, plasma displays and memory disks; amorphous thin films; chemical and mechanical polishing; radiation effect and densification; water in glass, diffusion, and relaxation; glasses for biological applications; structural analysis, ionic conduction and relaxation.\r\n\r\nGlass has been important in many different fields. In addition to traditional fields such as production of windows and bottles, it has been playing the key role in the development of optical fibers, liquid crystal displays and thin amorphous film dielectrics for electronic devices. Glass science can lead to understanding and improvement of these materials. Glasses are also used in biotechnology. For example, many biological procedures are conducted in glass (in vitro). It is important for the biotechnology field to clarify the role of glass surface interactions with biological substances. In the proposed University Conference on Glass Science, a variety of topics related to glasses used in the high technology fields will be discussed.\r\n",
