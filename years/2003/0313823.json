 "awd_abstract_narration": "A rapid decrease in fertility and the increase in life expectancy observed in Asia over the last several decades are expected to lead to problems associated with aging populations.  With these demographic changes, as in many other parts of the world, planners are concerned over the future of family care of the elderly.  Assuming that the traditional co-residence has been providing a safety net for the elderly, continuation of co-residence is often expected and encouraged.  This dissertation project will focus on the determinants of living arrangements of the elderly in Bangkok, Thailand, and examine the relationship between the living arrangements and well being of the elderly with a special attention to the characteristics of their children.  In combination with ethnographic methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews, a questionnaire schedule designed to better follow the life history of respondents will be utilized to collect data from a large number of representative subjects.  The project will make a contribution to the scientific community as an attempt to collect representative data in a more culturally sensitive way and with a close connection to the history of each respondent.  Such data help us to better analyze and understand the problems of aging societies.\r\n\tBroader Impacts: Given the social, economic, and political impacts of population aging, the project will contribute to providing culturally meaningful baseline data for the Thai government and related agencies to better prepare for the coming aging society.  Beyond Thai society, the study will also serve as comparative reference information for other countries expected to face the similar aging problems in near future.\r\n",
