 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assist in the development of an \r\ninnovative method for effective and low cost destruction and removal of hazardous air \r\npollutants (HAPs), specifically Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds (HVOCs), \r\nusing non-thermal plasma generated in microwave discharges.  In the non-thermal \r\ntechnique described in this proposal, the non-equilibrium properties of the plasma are \r\nfully exploited.  These plasmas can produce energetic electrons (typical energies of 1-10 \r\neV), which effectively lead to the creation of free radicals without the necessity of adding \r\nthe enthalpy associated with very high gas temperatures.  Therefore, from the chemical \r\npoint of view, destruction reaction rates normally associated with temperatures of 10,000 \r\nto 100,000 K can be realized with the gas near ambient temperature.  The proposed \r\ntechnique utilizes the dissociation and ionization of the background gases to produce \r\nradicals that, in turn, destroy and decompose the toxic and hazardous compounds.  The \r\ninput energy of the system is directed mostly to the production of the desired density of \r\nradicals which react preferentially with the HVOCs that are often present in very small \r\nconcentrations in the exhaust gas.   \r\n \r\nThe proposed technology will meet a growing need in the semiconductor industry, and \r\nother HVOC sources for a simple and cost-effective method for the removal of hazardous \r\ncompounds from the flue gas.  The new method is likely to be successful due to its \r\nsimplicity and the ease with which the gas-cleanup unit can be retrofitted to the existing \r\ncombustion systems.  \r\n",
