 "awd_abstract_narration": "This individual investigator award will support a project directed toward fabrication and analysis of novel bulk and multilayer magnetoelectric (ME) composites consisting of ferrites and lead zirconate titanate.  The electromagnetic coupling in the composites is mediated by mechanical stress. The focus of the research will be on the origin of giant ME interactions.  The research will involve the following tasks.  (i) Synthesis of bulk, bilayers and multilayers by traditional sintering, hot pressing and microwave sintering.  The objective is to obtain composites with wide variations in of structural and mechanical parameters at the interface.  (ii) Measurements of low frequency giant ME effects, theoretical analysis, and estimation of interface coupling.   (iii) Studies on microwave ME effects, at ferromagnetic resonance (9-10 GHz) for ferrites. The planned studies are of fundamental and technological importance.  Anticipated impacts include research experience for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students and collaboration with European scientists and industry (Delphi Corporation).  The layered materials are potential candidates for use as magnetoelectric memory devices, smart sensors and actuators.  There are also possibilities for a new class of electrically controlled microwave magnetic signal processing devices and magnetically controlled piezoelectric devices.\r\n\r\nThis individual investigator award supports a research project involving the preparation and analysis of materials that are capable of converting magnetic fields to electric fields.  Materials of interest are composites consisting of ferrites that respond to magnetic fields and lead zirconate titanate that respond to electric fields.  The ferrite deforms in a magnetic field and the deformation in turn produces electricity in the titanate.  Both bulk and layered samples will be prepared.  A variety of processing techniques, including microwave heating, will be used to prepare samples with the best field conversion efficiency.  Sample properties will be studied over a wide frequency range.  Anticipated impacts of the research include the following.  (i) Hands-on research experience for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  (ii) Collaboration with European scientists on theoretical aspects of the research.  (iii) New materials for use as multifunctional smart sensors and transducers in communication and defense related systems.  (iv) Collaboration with Delphi Automotive Systems on the use of the composites for applications in automotive industry.  \r\n",
