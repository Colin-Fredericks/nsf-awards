More recently, two of the meetings were held at the University of Louisville and California State University at San Bernardino.  The main purpose of these meetings was to enable mathematicians and students in the vicinity of the universities where the meetings were held to interact with each other and with mathematicians and students from outside the region.  The meetings also afforded mathematicians in the fields the opportunity to present recent mathematical research. \r\n\r\nThe success of these conferences has increased with each passing year, and we have recently averaged around 20 to 40 participants from other institutions at each meeting.  Of course, we always have participation by about 30 local university faculty and graduate students.  The meetings are relaxed and informal, include hour lectures by leading experts, plus many contributed talks.  Time is also available for discussion and initiation (or continuation) of collaborative research. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current grant will enable us to continue this series for another three years.  The planned schedule is to hold three meetings at Auburn\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n1. Miniconference on Real Analysis, March 28-29, 2003.  \r\n\r\n   Highlighted Topics: Gauge integrals and fractal measures, Applications of set theory to topology and real analysis, Continuous restrictions to compact sets, plus other topics.  See \r\n\r\n\t   http://www.auburn.edu/~brownj4/~RAmini03.html\r\n\r\nfor additional information.\r\n\r\n2. Miniconference on Harmonic Analysis, 2003-2004 Academic Year\r\n\r\n3. Miniconference on Harmonic and Real Analysis, 2004-2005 Academic Year\r\n\r\nTo view the history of the entire series, including listings of Invited\r\nSpeakers, schedules, and some pictures, visit the web pages\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.auburn.edu/~desougs/haminis.html\r\nand\r\n\thttp://www.auburn.edu/~brownj4/raminis.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
