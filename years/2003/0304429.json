This award supports exploratory interdisciplinary research on nanostructures and developing new real-space algorithms for electronic structure calculations. The PI is in the Computer Science Department in an undergraduate institution. Theoretical and computational research will focus on the structural and electronic properties of nanotubes, nanowires, and other nanomaterials that are of fundamental interest and may have impact on future electronic device technologies. The PI will perform exploratory research to determine the feasibility of a new linear scaling real-space finite-element-based  electronic-structure algorithm. This exploratory research activity helps to position the PI to involve undergraduate students in research activities and to plan a future computational physics curriculum.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a Nanoscale Exploratory Research award made on a proposal received in response to NSE, NSF-02-148.
