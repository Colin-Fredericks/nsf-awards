Surface vibrational spectroscopies in combination with work function measurement, electron spectroscopy, and temperature programmed desorption methods are used to examine the interfaces between low work function metals and organic polymers and small molecules.  Interfaces in organic heterojunctions are also being examined.  Studies of emersion are also being carried out, in order to understand the processes of surface wetting and electrowetting in electrochemical devices.  Information obtained from these studies is useful in the design of electronic materials processing protocols and for the design of photonic and electronic devices. \r\n\r\nProfessor Pemberton and her coworkers at the University of Arizona have developed an effective combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical tools to examine the structure and properties of interfaces in electrochemical and electronic devices.  Interfaces between reactive metals and organic layers, between organic layers of different composition, and at the emersed metal-electrolyte junction are being examined.  The results of these studies are useful for the design and processing of microelectronic materials and systems.  \r\n",
