 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2003 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Coatings and Films will focus of response-driven polymeric films and coatings, and will be chaired by Dr. Marek Urban. The conference will be held in Colby-Sawyer Academy, July 13-18, 2003. The theme of the conference, Stimuli-Responsive Polymeric Films, will encompass the following areas of polymer science: Frontiers in Polymer Synthesis, Flow and Rheology, Film Formation, Frontiers in Photo-Polymerization, Waterborne Coatings, Functionalized Polymeric Coatings, Corrosion and Barrier Properties, and Surfaces and Interfaces. Each session will consists of 2-3 presentations on the most current discoveries. Specific topics will include Modeling and Prediction of Coatings Properties through the Use of Artificial Neural Networks, Electrodeposition of Adhering Polymer Films: a Route to Multifunctional Surfaces, Novel Proton Exchange Membrane Dispersion Coatings for Electroactive Catalysts, Less Utilized Reactions in Polyurethane Chemistry, Functional Polyurethane Surfaces, The Flow of Binary Polymeric Fluids Through Patterned Microchannels, How to Control the Rheology of Mixed Polyelectrolyte Fluids Through the Polyanion/Polycation Ratio, Photophysical Techniques for Studying Latex Film Formation, Adhesion and Friction between Polymer Films, Coatings Prepared from Suspensions of Latex and Functional Inorganic Particles, Photopolymerization of Thin Polymer Films, Initiators and Catalysts for Rapid Formation of Coatings, Quest for an Ambient Cure Thermoset Latex Crosslinked with a Cycloaliphatic Epoxide, Pigment Distribution and Characterization of Waterborne Coatings, Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Copolymer Emulsions, Why Don't Barnacles Stick to Silicones?, The Weathering of Paints Made with Thermoplastic Resins, Using an EIS Corrosion Sensor to Monitor Coating Degradation, Flake-Filled Barrier Materials, Coatings for Automotive Plastics: Characterization of Interfacial Properties and Mechanism of Adhesion, Study of Mechanical and Tribological Properties of Polymeric Films and Coatings in Micro and Nano-Scale w/Nano-Indenter and Scanning Probe Microscope. \r\n\r\nThis NSF award is directed to help with travel expanses of junior faculty, postdoctoral associates, or senior graduate students who are interested in pursuing science carriers.   \r\n",
