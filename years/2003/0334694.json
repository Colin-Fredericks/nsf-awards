DLC has been considered for use in medical devices due to its exceptional mechanical, tribological and chemical properties. Inflammatory reactions, fibrinogen absorption, and platelet adhesion are reduced or eliminated, as DLC is a form of pure carbon. Attention has until now only focused on developing DLC as a structural biomaterial.  DLC composites have been created in past work that contained biologically functional nanocrystals using pulsed laser deposition (PLD).  In order to achieve optimal biocompatibility, biofunctional metal species were chosen for specific purposes.  For example, in order to convey antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to the DLC surface, silver nanocrystals were incorporated into the deposit.  The DLC-silver\r\nnanocomposite has been extensively studied by the PI.  The exploratory research is based on the hypothesis that mesoporous DLC can be created using pulsed laser deposition. Processing parameters will be optimized to create a DLC film with a continuous grid of 5-10 nm sized pores.  These films will have an increased lifetime as compared with current artificial organ membranes, all of which are polymer-based. The specific goals of this research are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To process novel mesoporous diamondlike carbon structures\r\n2. To characterize the interfacial properties of mesoporous DLC nanocomposites \r\n     using STEM-Z microscopy, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, and mechanical   \r\n     testing (including nanoindentation, wear, and adhesion)\r\n3. To determine the biocompatibility: Cytotoxicity and thrombogenicity.\r\n\r\nThis mesoporous morphology is not only important for use in artificial organs; implanatable artificial kidneys and implantable biosensors may also benefit from surfaces with similar morphologies. These studies will yield a general assessment of material properties and can be used to support future device development. This exploratory research is intended to determine the feasibility of various pore processing techniques.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this exploratory research are incorporation of concepts from research into the graduate biomaterials course at Georgia Tech.  Also, outreach to underrepresented minorities regarding job and educational opportunities in nanostructured biomaterials research has been undertaken by the PI.  The research could be helpful in developing specialized medical devices such as sensors or purifiers.\r\n\r\n",
