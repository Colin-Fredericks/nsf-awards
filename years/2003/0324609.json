 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2003/2004 Florida Special Year Program in Mathematics, in applied mathematics, is in the area of multiscale analysis and applications. Four conferences will be held:\r\n\r\n    1. Conference on mathematical methods in imaging and vision.\r\n    2. Conference on multiscale optimization methods and applications.\r\n    3. Conference on computational methods in multiscale analysis and applications.\r\n    4. Student workshop.\r\n\r\nThe three conferences are organized by the Mathematics Department in collaboration with Computer and Information Science and Engineering, Industrial Systems and Engineering, Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering, and industry.  These conferences highlight recent mathematical innovations, including\r\n\r\n(a) variational, probabilistic, statistical, and geometric methods in image analysis and vision,\r\n(b) pattern recognition and statistical classification in image analysis,\r\n(c) multilevel and multiple scale methods in optimization,\r\n(d) multigrid and homogenization methods for partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nThe conferences include both junior and senior researchers and student participants.  The student workshop, organized by the UF SIAM Chapter, provides an opportunity for graduate students to play a principal role in organizing a conference and in presenting their ongoing thesis research to an audience composed of their peers.\r\n\r\nThe conferences held during the 2003/2004 Mathematics Special Year Program:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.ufl.edu/special03/\r\n\r\nwould have broad impact in the sciences, engineering, and industry. The conferences will broaden the educational experience and career options of the participating students, and will give graduate students a broader perspective of their research field.  The mathematical technology presented at the imaging conference is important for medical diagnostics where high accuracy is needed for determining appropriate medications and dosages. The technology can also be applied in other domains like computational physics, computer and information science and engineering, and finance. The optimization conference showcases recent computational methodologies having applications to scheduling, optimal control of manufacturing processes, the design of faster and more reliable computer chips, parallel computing techniques for solving difficult scientific problems, and many other areas. The conference on multigrid and asymptotic analysis focuses on recent numerical methods that are used in many fields including oil exploration where acoustic signals are used to detect structure beneath the surface of the earth, nondestructive testing of materials, where external measurements of electric fields are used to detect imperfections beneath the surface of the material, and medical modeling used in the design and development of new diagnostic sensors.",
