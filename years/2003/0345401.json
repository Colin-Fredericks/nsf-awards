The organizers are Dr. Hassan El-Shall, Engineering Research Center for Particles Science and Technology at the University of Florida and Dr. Nagui Abdel-Khalek, Department of Mineral Evaluation and Processing, the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Center, Helwan, Egypt.  The workshop is to address the fundamental science and technology issues related to treatment and resource recovery of industrial waste, to discuss state of the art of waste treatment and utilization technologies and related research in both countries with specific emphasis on waste from the metals industry, to identify approaches to be taken to understand and adapt new technologies for minimizing waste and recovery of resources from wastes produced in the metals manufacturing industries, and to stimulate cooperative research in the field of waste treatment and utilization, between scientists and engineers in the United States and Egypt.\r\n\r\nScope: This project enables US and Egyptian scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area that is important to both countries, and to identify potential collaborative research of mutual benefit.  Dr. El-Shall is active in research in metal processing as the deputy director for research at the NSF-supported Particle Engineering Research Center at the University of Florida, and has worked extensively with the CMRDI in Egypt.  The CMRDI is Egypt's premier materials research center.  The cooperative research resulting from workshop could lead to economic developments involving the private sectors in Egypt and US.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities.  \r\n",
