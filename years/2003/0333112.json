 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important class of bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) exists that contain very large genomes (~500 Kbp), which are as big or bigger than the smallest genomes of prokaryotic organisms. Preliminary analysis of the first phage of this class to be sequenced (phage G) reveals many surprises and some clues as to what genes are carried by these large viruses. In a collaborative effort among Dr. Roger Hendrix (P.I.), Dr. Graham Hatfull and Dr. Jeffrey Lawrence (all of the University of Pittsburgh), six new large phage genomes will be sequenced and analyzed. This research will provide important insights into the diversity, evolution, and origins of viruses and their role in the evolution of their hosts. Furthermore, the genomic sequences of these large phages will provide clues as to the determinants of genome size and fluidity, and challenge the traditional view that genes belong either to viruses or to hosts. Phage genome sequences and their annotation will be made available to the scientific community through a dedicated web server, along with custom databases of bacteriophage genome sequences, and will be useful resources for the community of bacteriophage biologists. Phage genomics also offers excellent educational opportunities for undergraduate students, integrating a variety of disciplines such as microbiology, ecology, evolution, genetics, genomics, gene expression, virology, computational biology and bioinformatics.\r\n\r\n",
