 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research advances the capabilities for performing thermal measurements at small scales, which in turn, facilitates the design, development, and production of devices and systems for commercial and government applications based on micro- and nanotechnologies.  Micro- and nanosystems are enabling innumerable exciting and beneficial applications for society; however, many challenges are created by miniaturization including thermal measurement at small scales, below 100 microns.  The development of alternative and easy to use thermal metrology methods is necessary for the design, development, and optimization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).  The temperature sensors are based on the thermomechanical response of a structure when heated so that it thermal expands differently than the underlying substrate.  Since only optical access is needed to make the measurement, this temperature-sensing scheme can be used in harsh environments, e.g. high temperatures, where electrical signals can no longer be obtained.  Additionally, these microsensors will be used to study fundamental issues of microscale energy transport such as the amount of convection and radiation at small scales.  This research program will train students in fabrication and characterization skills needed in micro- and nanotechnology industries, and the results will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community and public.  The award is funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.\r\n\r\n",
