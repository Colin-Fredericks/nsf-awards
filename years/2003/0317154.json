 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Professors Luc Jaeger at University of California- Santa Barbara will work to further the science and technology of fabricating novel nano- devices using ribonucleic acids (RNA) as a material. This project relates to RNA tectonics, a concept that refers to the fabrication of RNA self-assembling architectures and nano-devices with novel properties by taking advantage of the knowledge of motifs, folding and assembly rules governing the three-dimensional shape of complex natural RNA molecules. Like organic chemistry that allows an infinite number of molecules to be build with the same subset of synthons, RNA tectonics open the way to the design of an infinite number of RNA supra and macromolecules by judiciously using known RNA motifs and modules. General principles of RNA tectonics will be explored and applied to the design of smart, programmable 2D RNA arrays for generating templates with desirable topography for bottom-up fabrication of nano-electronic devices. It is anticipated that RNA is a suitable material for building electronic systems over large areas on the sub-10 nm scale. \r\n\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences supports Professor Luc Jaeger who will collaborate with scientists in leading European laboratories to pursue various strategies for immobilization of RNA arrays on a surface, and investigate electronic properties of the decorated materials. Besides establishing RNA tectonics as a new field for the supra-molecular chemist, Professor Jaeger will investigate a new route to device RNA based technology with strong potential in micro and nano-electronics, a key economic sector of significance to all leading world economies. This multidisciplinary project will offer the possibility of fruitful exchange between US and European laboratories and will contribute to training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at the interfaces between supra-molecular chemistry, biochemistry, nano-engineering, material and physical sciences.\r\n",
