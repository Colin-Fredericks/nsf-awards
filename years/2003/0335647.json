 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid changes in the understanding of food as well as other biological systems continue to be one of the major reasons for putting this meeting together. Critical needs and new objectives arising from the food industry continually challenge present and future research directions of the food processing engineering field and areas continually surge and develop. Many important, progressive, and technological changes are advancing and there is no other forum but the Conference of Food Engineering (CoFE) that combines engineering fundamentals with basic principles of food science with such an integrating approach. The Institute of Food Technology (IFT) emphasis is on food ingredients and formulation, not on engineering aspects of food processing. The American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) deals primarily with post harvest processes. CoFE 2003 is being convened by different food engineers from several U.S. universities and key food industries to address the numerous and rapid transformations taking place that will outline future research directions in the food engineering field.\r\n\r\n",
