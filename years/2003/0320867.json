 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the department of Electrical Engineering at Tuskegee University, the PI and three students\r\n(two graduates and one undergraduate) are conducting research in the area of Smart Control\r\nSystems. The following two projects are underway: robust optimal control using a recurrent\r\ndynamic neural network, and compensation of global feedback linearization control of nonlinear\r\nsystems using neural networks. However, these research activities are confined to theoretical\r\ninvestigations and applications to computer simulated system models using Matlab/Simulink\r\nsoftware from the MathWorks Inc. No physical plants and corresponding real-time\r\nimplementation software are currently available to test the smart control algorithms and refine\r\nthem.\r\nThe requested instrumentation to be acquired includes the ACE1103PX4CLP prototyping\r\nsystem from dSPACE Inc., which contains powerful hardware and comprehensive software tools\r\nfor development of real-time control systems. In order to apply the dSPACE products to actual\r\nplants, we are in addition requesting the acquisition of the following electromechanical\r\napparatuses from ECP, a leading manufacturer of mechanisms for research in control: the\r\nRectilinear Mass/Spring/Damper (ECP Model 210), the Industrial Plant Emulator (ECP Model\r\n220), the Inverted Pendulum (ECP Model 505), the Magnetic Levitator (ECP Model 730), and\r\nthe Control Moment Gyroscope (ECP Model 750).\r\nThe acquired instrumentation will contribute to greatly advancing the above-listed research\r\nprojects by providing the possibility of implementing the current Matlab/Simulink codes and\r\nmodels of the neural controllers on dSPACE hardware, and testing them in real-time as applied\r\nto actual electromechanical apparatuses, as well as checking the robustness of the neural\r\ncontrollers in the presence of noise and disturbances. The feedback obtained from the actual\r\nimplementation of the various neural algorithms will contribute to significantly evaluating,\r\nrefining, and improving the smart controllers design.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal resides in the fact that, if funded, the smart control\r\nresearch at Tuskegee University would be greatly enhanced, which in turn would affect the\r\nglobal research community in the area of artificial intelligence and control, since several journal\r\nand conference publications have resulted thus far from this research, and more would result\r\nwith higher quality if the instrumentation is acquired.\r\nBroader impacts of the requested instrumentation include introduction of a new graduate\r\ncourse in Advanced Control Design at Tuskegee University, which is an HBCU committed to the\r\nhigh quality education of African-American students. Moreover, the acquired equipment will\r\nboost the research level and researchers motivation and learning experience and contribute to\r\nattracting new graduate students to Tuskegee University that are interested in the area of smart\r\ncontrol systems. The development of this area that is expected to occur due to the requested\r\ninstrumentation will have the additional impact of attracting research funding from industry and\r\ngovernment agencies. Furthermore, the experience that students will have with dSPACE\r\nproducts will be very beneficial for their future career, since these products are used in major\r\nindustries worldwide. Finally the acquired equipment will encourage the multidisciplinary trend\r\nin the College of Architecture, Engineering, and Physical Sciences at Tuskegee University by\r\nbeing made equally available to the faculty and students of the Aerospace, Chemical, Electrical,\r\nand Mechanical Engineering departments, which all offer courses in control systems.",
