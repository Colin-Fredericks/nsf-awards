Yan\r\nProposal Number: DMS- 0300205\r\nInstitution: Texas A& M University \r\n\r\nAbstract for CombinaTexas: A Combinatorics Conference for the South-Central U.S.\r\n\r\nThe Departments of Mathematics at Texas A\\&M University and Southwest Texas State University will host annual combinatorics conferences in March or April of the years 2003-2005, as part of the CombinaTexas series initiated in 2000. CombinaTexas has served as an important meeting place for the expanding group of researchers in combinatorics in the South-Central United States. CombinaTexas'03, to be held at Southwest Texas State University on April 5-6, 2003, will focus on Graph Theory \r\nand its Applications. The program is built around seven one-hour talks delivered by internationally recognized researchers on topics including Computational Graph Theory, Topological Graph Theory, Random Graphs; and their applications to Algorithms, Geometry, and Number Theory. There will also be short communications, poster sessions and social events to encourage communication and collaboration among participants. To be consistent with the goal of building research infrastructure, the target audience is advanced graduate students and junior faculty. The 2004 and 2005 conferences will be formatted similarly; the 2004 conference will focus on Algebraic Combinatorics and Algorithms, and the 2005 conference will focus on Probabilistic Methods and Combinatorial Number Theory.\r\n\r\nThe recent progress in graph drawing, random graphs, and computer-aided microchip design has been dramatic. Continuing research in graph theory and its applications will contribute advances in internet modeling, algorithm design, and bioinfomatics; each area is of independent and intense interest. The CombinaTexas series has become a major regional research and educational activity in the above areas, which is welcomed \r\nand supported by its participants and beneficiaries.  CombinaTexas will continue to broaden and diversify participation and to enhance the infrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
