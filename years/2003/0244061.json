Research topics will include research about engineering properties of recycled materials in earth work; hydraulics and mitigation of low-head dams to reduce drowning; thermal resistance of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced beams; and means to reduce life-threatening failure of large highway culverts. Student teams will work as principal investigators with outside clients to define the problem and define a work scope that will then be completed by that team. Deliverables include preparation of a publishable work. A short course, \"Engineering Forensic Research\", will be taught to student participants and will include topics such as ethics, conducting research, and forensic studies. The program will work on crucial research to reduce failures and loss of life with the focus on work that is generally under funded or underrepresented in the current university research setting. The research undertaken by student participants has the potential for immediate impact on the engineering of real systems, and students will gain a unique opportunity to see the role of engineering research as it relates to issues of concern for U.S. homeland security. Students will learn fundamental research and engineering ethics while discovering and experiencing engineering research. Recruitment will be nationwide with a focus on attracting students from population groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering.",
