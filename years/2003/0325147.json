 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to request funds from the National Science Foundation in partial\r\nsupport of the forthcoming Block Island Workshop on Cooperative Control which is scheduled to\r\ntake place on June 10 and 11, 2003 at the Spring House Hotel on Block Island, Rhode Island.\r\nThe primary objective of this workshop is to bring together a small number of individuals from\r\nsuch fields as animal biology, robotics, automatic control, communications and sensor networks,\r\nartificial intelligence, dynamical systems, algorithms, etc. with interests in group coordination and\r\ncooperative control  not primarily to present their current work, but rather to delineate common\r\nground and to identify fundamental unresolved problems in the rapidly evolving, cross-disciplinary\r\nfield of cooperative control of natural and man-made groups.\r\nIntellectual Merit: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding on the one\r\nhand, how various animal aggregations such as fish schools, bird ocks, deer herds, etc. coordinate\r\ntheir collective motions to perform useful tasks and on the other, how groups of mobile autonomous\r\nagents such as AUV schools, UAV ocks, etc., might be instructed to cooperate in a similar man-ner.\r\nIn ecology and evolutionary biology, for example, it is of great interest to understand how\r\nnatural groupings coordinate themselves and move so awlessly, often without an apparent leader\r\nor any form of centralized control. What kinds of signaling must they use? What role if any,\r\ndoes the physical medium, environmental context, currents, vortices, or other local environmental\r\ndisturbances play in this process? Are there universal principles of coordinated group motion and\r\nif so what might they be? Could such principles be used in a robotic context to help enable a large\r\ngroup of autonomously functioning vehicles in the air, on land or sea or underwater, to collectively\r\naccomplish, in a safe and coordinated manner, useful tasks such as distributed, adaptive scientific\r\ndata gathering, search and rescue, and reconnaissance? In broad terms, these are the questions to\r\nwhich this workshop is addressed.\r\nBroader Impacts: This workshop will advance discovery and understanding while promoting\r\nteaching, training and learning by including student participation at the workshop. The work-shop\r\nwill broaden participation of under-represented groups by encouraging such individuals to\r\nactively participate in the workshop. Without question, this highly interdisciplinary meeting\r\nwill enhance infrastructure for research and education by significantly increasing the potential for\r\ncross-disciplinary research among participants and between parent institutions. The workshop will\r\nbroaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding by means of a published\r\nproceedings and well as by consequential presentations and publications to a wide semi-technical\r\ncommunity.",
