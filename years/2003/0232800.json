 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed at homeland security and will determine the feasibility of developing a computerized tool for airport security checkpoint baggage screening that will assist baggage screeners in x-ray image inspection and which will provide networked electronic communications among security checkpoint personnel.  Current baggage screening methods at airport security checkpoints are essentially manual systems that take little advantage of today's computerized technologies, electronic communications, and data networks.  The proposed system introduces networked database capabilities to the airport enabling security personnel to analyze and correlate real time and/or historical data on passengers and their baggage throughout the airport and will significantly improve the airport's ability to run smoothly while enhancing safety.  With post 9/11 diminishing of consumer confidence, our nation's airports are in search of ways to make the air travel experience as streamlined as possible, so that the day-to-day economics of travel are profitable, and, at the same time, to make the entire system safer thus protecting lives, their investments, and promoting a national grassroots level perception of safety that enhances our lives, our consumer confidence, our economy, and our willingness to travel.\r\n\r\nAs a software product with a hardware platform that interfaces with existing and new hardware systems being utilized to meet security needs at airports, the proposed technology promises to offer a relatively low cost way to introduce significant improvements to the situation.  This technology brings screeners a communications infrastructure to build on each other's knowledge and expertise, and with the addition of such an infrastructure platform to daily processes, to be constantly evaluated on their statistical accuracy.  This will improve their performance while also speeding the process of luggage searchers, and thus improve security.  The proposed computerized inspection system can be utilized in any of the nations' 429 commercial service airports either directly or through relationships with security consultants and hardware manufacturers.  Similarly the technology can be used advantageously in international markets as well.\r\n",
