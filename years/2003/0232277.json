 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel functional \r\nnanostructure for detection/identification of biological warfare agents (BWA). A new  class  of \r\nfluorescence-amplified nano-assembly (FLAN) is proposed for real-time,  selective,  and  ultra-\r\nsensitive BWAs  and  toxins  assays.  The  basic concept of this technology is to mimic the cell \r\nmembrane under certain organisms and toxins initially attack. Living cells quickly recognize and \r\nselectively respond towards invasion. The FLAN using three key elements for target detection: 1) \r\nmolecular recognition, 2) fluorescence transduction, and 3) fluorescence  amplification,  to \r\nprovide simple and direct fluorescent  assay.  The molecular receptors recognize the BWA; \r\nthe binding causes a change in the local ternary structure, and which  leads  to  an  amplified \r\nfluorescent  structure  that can be quantified optically. The synthetic nanostructures exhibit \r\nbioactivities and high stability. The BWA-FLAN receptor binding is a rapid one-step reaction; it \r\ndoes not require complicate separation and washing steps, labeled fluorophore, or visualization \r\nreagents.  \r\n \r\nDuring the Phase I project, the investigator will design and synthesize functional nanostructures with BWA-\r\nspecific  receptors, develop FLAN molecular assembly, develop fluorescence sensing system, \r\ncharacterize,  test,  and  evaluate  its  technical  merits.  Highly  selective  and  sensitive  molecular \r\nrecognition is important throughout biology, biotechnology, and clinical diagnostics. \r\n \r\nCOMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS \r\n \r\nHomeland and civilian defense applications include medical diagnostic of pathogens and diseases \r\nas  well  as  non-medical  contamination  avoidance sensors for biological terrorism agents. The \r\nproposed nanostructure-based assays could be easily adapted to targets of interest to the medical \r\ncommunity,  environmental  and  agricultural  testing, and food industry and used in conjunction \r\nwith the portable reader for diagnostics in clinical or hospital setting.",
