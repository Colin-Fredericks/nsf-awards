 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snce the 1970s, economic geography has witnessed theoretical orthodoxies and methodological conventions persistently exposed to searching critique and reevaluation.  While this restlessness has contributed to the dynamism of the field, it has presented particular challenges for young researchers who have had to chart courses through a shifting terrain of theoretical, methodological, and substantive concerns without succumbing to faddishness.  Furthermore, codification of methodological practice in economic geography generally has lagged that found in other disciplines and subfields.  The need for enhanced research training in economic geography has been highlighted at a number of recent meetings.  In response to these issues, economic geographers in the U.S. and other nations have developed plans to conduct a series of summer institutes in economic geography, with an inaugural meeting to be held in Madison, Wisconsin, in July 2003.  The summer institute will provide an opportunity for participants to investigate theoretical and methodological issues in economic geography as the field is broadly defined as well as to explore a range of associated professional development matters.  Open to doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and recently appointed faculty from the United States and overseas, the summer institute will comprise an intensive, week-long residential program of activities designed to provide participants with an in-depth understanding of the innovative developments and continuing challenges in this field.  NSF support will provide assistance to facilitate participation of at least 37 participants.  Support for the summer institute also is being provided by the Worldwide Universities Network and from the Economic Geography and Antipode journals.  In addition to new insights provided directly to participants through their participation, the institute organizers will establish a website to facilitate dissemination of papers and supporting documentation as well as details of forthcoming meetings.  A number of the presentations made at this year's summer institute (as well as at a planned second institute in 2004 in the United Kingdom) are expected to be included in a planned edited volume tentatively titled \"Politics and Practice in Economic Geography.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer institute in economic geography is expected to establish a basis for future collaborative ventures involving young researchers.  It should also advance thinking about fundamental approaches and frameworks for conducting research in this important field.\r\n",
