 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from the School of Engineering, College of Arts and Sciences and the Health Science Center at the University of New Mexico have teamed in this collaborative project to address critical issues in the development of a new, versatile and adaptive multi-analyte sensing platform. This collaborative research initiative will closely interface with researchers at other Universities, at the National Laboratories and with local industry. It will develop a wide range of technologies including sensing chemistry, biomimetic nanomaterials, microfluidics, and novel optical transducers to yield an integrated sensor system characterized by reliable high performance.\r\nThis project represents a synergistic combination of fundamental and applied research that is requisite for the development of a new generation of high performance biosensor systems based upon affinity microcolumns. The sensor array systems will allow simultaneous, fast, reliable determination of a wide range of trace analyte species. Model analytes are chosen to be representative of broad classes of important chemical and biological species. They are also directly relevant to current grand challenges in trace detection, most notably in chemical and biological warfare defense and in early detection of disease. Critical technology development is grouped into four distinct work areas that will develop: (1) biomolecular assemblies for amplified molecular transduction on microbeads, (2) optimum methods for sample introduction and pumping through multi-analyte affinity microcolumns, (3) multiparameter fluorescence instrumentation capable of reliable detection of reactions in affinity microcolumns, and (4) system integration, optimization and testing. The technical approaches leverage the broad range of expertise of an interdisciplinary team with a recent history of productive collaboration in the development of biosensor technology and systems. A clear mechanism for integration of the sensor systems proposed with state-of-the-art air sampling technology is also presented, through  collaboration with industry.   The research program will offer significant opportunities for participation of students from underrepresented groups through IGERT, REU, and RET programs and a statewide initiative in nanotechnology.\r\n",
