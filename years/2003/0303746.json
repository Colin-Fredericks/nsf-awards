 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will tackle two critical issues in future materials for advanced molecule-based information processing: 1) how to assemble and attach single molecules to electronic contacts; and 2) how to create electronic gain (the fundamental operating principle of a transistor) at the molecular level.  To do this, however, this project will address three major unsolved challenges: (1) Synthesis of new molecules with functionality that allows them to act as nonlinear electronic elements and to chemically attach to silicon-based contact structures (2) Bridging the molecular (created via bottom-up fabrication) with the lithographic (created via top-down fabrication) length scales for device construction and (3) definition of new lithographic approaches that accommodate molecular installation during processing.  The approach we propose addresses these issues and, in addition is designed to demonstrate the important concept of Gain at the molecular level as the result of a state change within the molecular architecture rather than as the response of a molecule to a change in bias of an underlying (macroscopic) gate electrode.\r\nThe advancement of the field of molecular electronics also is fundamentally changing how the next generation of technically saavy students is educated.  Under this work, we propose several activities.  Graduate students will do Ph. D. degrees that involve both traditional science, engineering and technology development aspects and emphasize state-of-the-art research approaches.  In addition, we describe the expansion of existing, interdisciplinary courses suited to developing critical understanding of the field of nanotechnology and an outreach program for women and minorities to expand the diversity of participation in this new, interdisciplinary paradigm.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nMiniaturizing electronic devices to the molecular scale is the next major step in the electronics revolution.  The results of this project will help ensure that better techniques for information processing will be available to keep our economy growing stronger with smaller, faster, lighter electronics.  While this type of research will ultimately be performed by corporate research and development, today there are fundamental, unsolved issues that must be addressed before such entities can assume the risk of such research.  These issues, if addressed using federal funds to universities will make possible the next phase of electronics development, particularly in the United States.
