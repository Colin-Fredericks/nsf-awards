 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Mark Hafner and Ms. Jessica Light at Louisiana State University to investigate the relationships among rodent-restricted sucking lice using both molecular and morphological data.  The investigators will also test for coevolution between one group of sucking lice (Fahrenholzia) and their heteromyid rodent hosts using molecular data.   Sucking lice are obligate, blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals and they are known disease vectors as well as agricultural menaces.  Yet, despite the obvious health and economic importance of sucking lice, there are only a few living researchers investigating anopluran biology and relationships.  Studying the relationships that sucking louse species have not only to each other, but also with their hosts, can greatly improve our knowledge of these poorly known organisms.   Funding will be used to collect both sucking lice and their rodent hosts and to purchase laboratory supplies for molecular investigation of relationships.  Statistical analyses will be performed to test for coevolution between host and parasite groups.\r\n\r\nThis project is the first to investigate the relationships among rodent-restricted sucking lice and the first to investigate coevolution between anoplurans and their hosts.  Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and collected data will be submitted to online databases.  By increasing our knowledge of louse relationships, these results will have both medical and agricultural benefits.  This investigation will also identify appropriate louse-specific techniques and molecular markers for use in future analyses.  Furthermore, a female graduate student will be trained in louse taxonomy, molecular techniques, and phylogenetic methods.  Collaborations with louse morphologists, mammalian systematists, and molecular biologists will also be established as a result of this research.\r\n",
