 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Sandra Rossie from Purdue University to support a symposium on ion channel regulation. The symposium is part of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) summer conference series and will be held on June 14-19, 2003 in Tucson, Arizona. Many recent advances in ion channel regulation research have occurred making this conference very timely.  About 145 participants will be selected and a novel feature of this meeting will be the inclusion of discussion sessions for trainees to speak informally with the main speakers of the conference.\r\n      This meeting will bring together the leaders in ion channel regulation to formulate the directions this field will take in the immediate future.\r\n     Funds will be used to cover speakers' travel expenses and to provide travel awards for junior investigators from U.S. institutions.  An effort is being made to include women and members of underrepresented groups\r\n\r\n",
