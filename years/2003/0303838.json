 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the new international, multidisciplinary conference on Green Engineering to be held May 18 - 22, 2003 in Destin, Florida. Participants will include engineering researchers and practioners from several engineering disciplines and industrial sectors who will meet to benchmark the current status of green engineering and to start defining the Green Engineering principles common across engineering. The focus will be on product and process design within a systems framework, with four themes: 1) What are the drivers for green engineering and how consistent are they across various engineering disciplines? 2) How do we measure progress and evaluate performance? What are the metrics to determine the \"greenness\" of a product or process? 3) What are the tools that are unique to green engineering? How can they be applied across various disciplines? What are their limitations? 4) What are the connections between the process / product design and improvements to the environment (systems approaches)? \r\n\r\nIt is expected that this activity will have significant broader impacts upon the engineering community as a whole in the provision of a set of guiding principles for Green Engineering and also upon society through the establishment of a basis for the design and realization of products that positively impact materials use and total life cycle\r\n",
