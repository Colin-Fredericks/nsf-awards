 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study learning and teaching processes in several exemplary science\r\ncurricula in different subject areas. All of them use new approaches to teaching that are\r\nunique in the way that they foster active learning of conceptual models on the part of the\r\nstudent. At present many of the general principles underlying the learning that occurs in\r\nthese lessons are poorly understood. However, advances in cognitive science have\r\nproduced a very promising new theory of model-based learning which can help to\r\nanalyze and describe these teaching techniques. The investigators will use a\r\ncombination of qualitative and quantitative methods to study these innovative units and\r\nanalyze them using these new cognitive science concepts. The overall goal is to find\r\nprinciples of instruction for developing students'  visualizable models in science. Central\r\nto the project will be case studies of skilled teachers who are adept at fostering model\r\nconstruction by students. The problem is to identify the strategies by which teachers are\r\nable to do this. The project will analyze teaching strategies and resulting student learning\r\nprocesses in detail using protocol analysis techniques. Follow up studies will make\r\nquantitative comparisons between groups that complement the qualitative case studies,\r\nand pre and post testing will measure the size of learning gains in different areas.  In a second part of the project, key elements of model-based learning theory will be elaborated via the analysis of expert learning protocols.  Similarities and differences between expert and student processes will be examined that highlight new ways of understanding student learning processes that suggest new teaching strategies.",
