 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop fundamental theory and algorithms for efficient and reliable data broadcast scheduling. Broadcast is an effective and efficient means for information dissemination over many networks. It is becoming more and more important with the increasing deployment of wireless local and wide area networks. Scheduling of data items is crucial in maximizing the efficiency of broadcast. This research will address a few fundamental and important issues that have not been well studied, i.e. broadcast schedules that can combat channel errors effectively, theory and schedule design for scheduling over multiple channels, and, scheduling for streaming data. This project presents an integration of theory and techniques of error correcting codes to the broadcast scheduling problem, which no previous works on this topic have applied. This research will exploit, and contribute towards, theoretical studies in information and coding theory, probability analysis and combinatorics. \r\n\r\n",
