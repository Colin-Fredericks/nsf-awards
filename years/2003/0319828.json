 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to conduct key experiments directed toward the development of an innovative, ultrafast-pulse laser source. While Ti: sapphire-based femtosecond sources are widely deployed in scientific laboratories throughout the world, they have a level of complexity and cost that is a barrier to wider use of femtosecond systems. Based on a directly diode-pumped Cr:LiSAF laser and following a multi-pass slab design that has proven successful with similar materials, the source to be developed in this project will be less complex, smaller and less expensive than present ultrafast laser systems.  One application that will be emphasized in the project is terahertz generation, which in turn has a variety of significant uses. In the Phase I program, Cr:LiSAF lasers will be built and characterize, with two possible diode-pumping geometries. In addition, a Q-switched laser based on one of the Cr:LiSAF designs will be built and characterized to provide data on the potential performance of a regenerative amplifier based on the proposed technology. Finally a preliminary design will be conducted of a high-power, diode-pumped, Cr:LiSAF-based THz-radiation system. If the overall effort is successful, the outcome will be ultrafast- and terahertz-generation products suited for scientific and industrial customers. \r\n\r\n The initial market for the ultrafast laser would be the scientific research community, but it is anticipated that industrial applications such as process-control spectroscopy, ultra-precise micro-machining, biological imaging and high-speed electronics circuit testing, would also accept this technology.  The development of the associated THz source would provide the option of supplying devices to address the emerging applications of THz systems. These applications include, but are not limited to, communications, atmospheric sensing, collision avoidance, medical imaging, non-destructive inspection and security scanning. \r\n",
