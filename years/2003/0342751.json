At the workshop, discussion will be aimed not just about the value that oral history interviews may have for understanding modern scientific practice, but also to work with participants so that they leave the workshop with hands-on skills for preparing and conducting interviews in the history of science.\r\n\r\n\tThe aim of the workshop is to accommodate from 20-25 graduate students who will be attending the History of Science Society meeting, scheduled to follow the workshop by one day.  The organizers of the workshop will be assisted by three or four facilitators who have extensive experience in all aspects of doing oral history interviews with scientists and science managers, and by two or three invited scientists, administrators, and engineers, who will be asked to participate as interview subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
