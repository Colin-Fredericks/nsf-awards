 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tarduno\r\nEAR-0230230\r\n\r\nSelf-reversal of natural remanent magnetization, the remarkable \r\nability of some rocks to acquire a magnetization in a direction \r\nantiparallel to that of the Earth's geomagnetic field, is thought to \r\nbe rare; it has been established only in a few igneous rocks bearing \r\nhemoilmenite. The investigators have have found two pervasive, nearly \r\nantipodal\r\ncomponents of magnetization (revealed through detailed \r\ndemagnetization studies) from pillow basalts in which hemoilmenite is \r\nabsent. Laboratory thermoremanent magnetization experiments suggest \r\nthat the component\r\nisolated at lower temperatures represents a partial self-reversal of \r\nthe primary magnetization. This self-reversed magnetization is \r\ncarried  by titanomaghemite formed by low temperature oxidation. \r\nBecause  maghemitization of ocean crust is ubiquitous, partial \r\nself-reversals may play an important role in controlling changes in \r\nmarine magnetic anomaly amplitudes with age.\r\n\r\nthe investigators propose to investigate the extent and mechanism of \r\nself-reversal carried by titanomaghemite in oceanic basalt recovered \r\nby the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean Drilling Program. \r\nThrough a\r\nstudy of sites having ages ranging from recent to 170 Ma, they hope \r\nto constrain the time scales of acquisition of self-reversed \r\nmagnetizations. Techniques to be applied will include paleomagnetism, \r\nrock magnetism, x-ray diffraction, microprobe, scanning electron \r\nmicroscopy and transmitted electron microscopy. The work proposed \r\nwill support a Ph.D. thesis and the studies of several undergraduate \r\nstudents at theUniversity of Rochester.\r\n-- \r\n",
