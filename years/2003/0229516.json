 "awd_abstract_narration": "The World Media Foundation is producing and distributing \"Emerging Science of Environmental Change.\"  This radio-based project presents new and cutting edge research to the public through National Public Radio broadcasts, Internet radio broadcasts, multi-media web presentations, Internet-based discussion, formal school curricula and public lectures.  The goal of the project is to provide the public with a longitudinal view of how those engaged in cutting-edge science formulate theories, structure their inquiries and monitor the ongoing processes, pitfalls, unexpected results and successes of their research.  The production team will closely follow the work and processes of one or more research teams over major portions of the 36-month project in order to provide an in-depth understanding of the research process.  \r\n\r\nThe project will deliver nine one-hour radio specials and nine additional hours of shorter program segments that will be included in the NPR \"Living on Earth\" series.  The online component of the project will present expanded versions of the audio through its daily web radio service, as well as multi-media web pages with references and discussions linked to the core subjects of the specials.  School outreach will be directed primarily at largely urban, under-served middle and high schools.  It will use the audio and multi-media web presentations of current research as frames of reference for student instruction in environmental science.\r\n",
