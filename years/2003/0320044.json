 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chow\r\n     The investigator and colleagues organize thematic\r\nexperimental workshops in conjunction with a summer school on\r\ntheoretical methods in neuroscience in France from July 28 -\r\nAugust 29, 2003.  The course covers modern theoretical methods\r\nused in systems neuroscience.  It is part of the Les Houches\r\nsummer school series, which has a distinguished tradition of\r\ncovering leading edge theoretical topics.  The course is intended\r\nfor graduate students and postdocs who have backgrounds in\r\nphysics, mathematics or other quantitative fields.  Neuroscience\r\nrapidly changes and it is essential for theorists to be aware of\r\nnew experimental results and techniques.  Thus, the organizers\r\nhold three Thematic Workshops in conjunction with the theoretical\r\nprogram.  In these workshops, experimentalists give talks on\r\nphysiological issues and lead discussions related to the topics\r\ncovered in the theoretical lectures.\r\n     The impact of this summer school on the students,\r\ntheoretical lecturers and experimentalists cannot be overstated.\r\nIn addition to the training the students receive they also have\r\nthe opportunity to meet and interact with many prominent\r\nneuroscientists.  Conversely, the senior participants have an\r\nopportunity to meet the next generation of theorists.  In biology\r\nthe relationship between theory and experiment is still\r\ntentative.  The workshops present topics important in themselves,\r\nthey fit well with and amplify and ground the theoretical agenda,\r\nand they provide a remarkable opportunity to establish\r\nconnections between theoreticians and experimentalists in an\r\nimportant and dynamic area of biology.  All of the lecturers are\r\nrequired to write an accompanying paper to be placed in a\r\npublished proceedings.  These proceedings will have sufficient\r\ndetail to be treated like a textbook on modern methods of\r\ntheoretical neuroscience and will be a valuable source of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n",
