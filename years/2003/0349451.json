 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the first two phases of the Model Institutions for Excellence program was to develop and refine models for increasing graduates from underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  To meet this goal, Oglala Lakota College served as the lead institution of the Oyate Consortium, a group of five tribal colleges located in South and North Dakota, which focused on developing STEM degree programs targeting a Native American student base.  Considering the Consortium started from ground zero in terms of facilities, degrees offered, and qualified faculty, the three remaining partner schools, OLC, Sitting Bull College and Sisseton-Wahpeton Community College have been very successful in building strong science, math and technology programs.  \r\n\r\nIn 1995 there were no STEM degree programs at any of the Consortium schools.  Today there are 112 degree seeking students enrolled in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science, Information Technology, Natural Science, SEM, and Computer Science.  To date, the schools have graduated 12 students with Bachelor degrees in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science, and three transfer students have received their degrees from other four-year institutions.\r\n \r\nDuring Phase III, OLC plans to offer STEM Bachelor degree programs to 8 more two-year tribal institutions via distance education.   The objective is to expand the at-distance student base from the current number of 16 at the two other Consortium schools to a total of 91 and make an even broader impact in Native American science education. \r\nThe intellectual merit of the program will be demonstrated through the model developed by OLC for increasing STEM students from tribal colleges.  The broader impacts are the increased production of Native American scientists. At the conclusion of Phase III, this model will be available for distribution to other tribal schools that wish to either begin, or expand, STEM programs.  The MIE program has allowed OLC to meet and solve the problems associated with developing a successful STEM initiative at a tribal college.  This includes administration buy-in, needs analysis, infrastructure development, faculty recruitment, student support, and building regional partnerships to expand undergraduate research project opportunities and collaborations. \r\n \r\nPhase III will allow the MIE program to wind down and become institutionalized.  The \r\nOLC administration has committed funds to support its MIE faculty members after three years.  Partnerships are in place with other colleges and universities, and tribal and federal agencies to sustain program projects.  The foundation that was set during Phase I and II will continue to support STEM degree programs and students through graduation.  The Oyate Consortium will continue to work together to keep each college a Model Institution for Excellence.                \r\n\r\n",
