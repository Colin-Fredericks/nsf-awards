 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Creating Baccalaureate Level Nanotechnology Minors with Pathways From Existing Associate Degree Programs in Nanofabrication,\" at Pennsylvania State University, under the direction of Dr. Stephen J. Fonash, is jointly funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Electrical and Communications Systems (ECS) and Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE). The project will build upon the Pennsylvania Nanofabrication Manufacturing Technology (NMT) Partnership initiated in 1998 by the state of Pennsylvania.  The objective of this program is create baccalaureate degree pathways for students holding community college associate degrees in nanofabrication and to give PSU undergraduate students the opportunity to fashion nanotechnology minors or concentrations in their last two years.  An integrated effort is proposed to develop laboratory-intensive, upper division undergraduate courses to support options, minors, or concentrations in nanotechnology within existing baccalaureate degree programs at PSU and other baccalaureate degree granting institutions participating in the NMT Partnership.  This effort will be achieved by engaging faculty members and administrators within PSU and other institutions in a process for joint development of upper division NUE courses; jointly design upper level undergraduate nanotechnolgoy courses with significant hands-on laboratory components to be offered within PSU and by other participating institutions; and create a \"two-plus-three\" bacalaureate degree program through which qualified gradutes of community college associated degree programs in nanofabrication can complete a Penn State B.S. in engineering with a minor in nanotechnology in three years.",
