In mammals, these rhythms are generated by a specific site in the brain, and influence patterns of activity, sleep and wakefulness, eating, drinking, body temperature, hormone secretion, blood chemistry, etc.  Some of the basic properties of this system have been elucidated using traditional laboratory rodents and other animals, but there is much to be learned regarding how the system is influenced by the environment in which the animal lives, and in particular, what happens to the animal when the system is disrupted.  This proposal will examine the circadian system of the spiny mouse, Acomys cahirinus, a rare rodent with many characteristics that make it unique in comparison to other rodents, such as its high degree of maturity at birth, enhanced water regulatory mechanisms, extended social structure, and potentially unique circadian characteristics.  These studies will be accomplished by monitoring the behavioral activity patterns of mice over extended periods of time and under varied environmental conditions, and through analysis of the neurochemical processes and structural development associated with the \"clock\" regions of the brain.  These comparative studies will extend our understanding of how the circadian system works in mammals, and are expected to evolve into a special model system for addressing questions related to physiology, behavior and development.  These comparative studies will be conducted primarily by undergraduate students who will gain valuable research experience using cutting edge technology at an RUI-eligible institution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
