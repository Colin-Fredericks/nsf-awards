 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contra Costa College is providing scholarships to low-income, academically talented students who show interest and promise in majoring in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The objective is to award 72 two-year scholarships to students who enroll full-time into a computer science, engineering, or mathematics curriculum. Contra Costa College provides a student-support infrastructure through its Center for Science Excellence (CSE) that facilitates their successful graduation with an associate-level degree and transfer to a four-year college or university. The student-support infrastructure of the college coordinates formal study, work experience in science and technology, and various science- and technology-based activities through a social support system. It provides academic support in the form of mentoring, academic workshops, tutoring, internship opportunities, leadership development, scientific seminars, and field trips. \r\n\r\nThe scholarship awards are being distributed to the recipients during the first and second years of enrollment at the College. Scholarship recipients enroll as full-time students, are expected to maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average, and follow an educational plan prescribing a sequence of courses that enable them to graduate and transfer to a baccalaureate-granting institution. National Science Foundation scholarship money provides a unique opportunity for low-income students to gain access to a support system that would not normally be possible because of their need to concentrate their time on jobs rather than study. Experience shows that gaining access to a coordinated support system of mentoring, internships, and enrichment activities along with high academic expectations is an important contribution to success for the students. Without stipend or scholarship money, a large population of students is locked out of the mathematics/science pipeline. Scholarship money for low-income community college students is a beacon of hope for students who might not otherwise gain access to programs in computer sciences, engineering, or mathematics.\r\n",
