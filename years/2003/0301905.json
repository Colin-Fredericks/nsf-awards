The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Todd E. Katzner to work with Dr. E. J. Milner-Gulland at Imperial College in London, Dr. Evgeny Bragin, at Naurzum Zapovednik, Kazakhstan, Dr. Sergei Sklyarenko, Institute of Zoology, Almaty, Kazakhstan and Mr. Alexander Gavashelishvili, Georgian Center for Conservation of Wildlife, Tbilsi, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe first objective of this project is to use mathematical models to evaluate population status and identify conservation approaches for two threatened species of large raptors - Eurasian Griffon Vultures and Imperial Eagles.  He will collaborate with local biologists in the Republics of Kazakhstan and Georgia to collect field data to estimate demographic parameters for each species.  The PI will develop matrix population models and conduct sensitivity and cost-benefit analyses to identify those parameters crucial to model stability and well suited to conservation monitoring.  He will also work with these biologists to develop long-term conservation monitoring programs to evaluate future changes in eagles and vulture populations.  A second objective will be to collaborate with his UK host to develop and implement science training workshops for Former Soviet Union (FSU) researchers.  Such training is important because the often closed educational system in the FSU provides little exposure to outside scientific approaches.\r\n\r\nDr. Milner-Gulland has extensive experience collecting and modeling ecological data from the former Soviet Union. \r\n",
