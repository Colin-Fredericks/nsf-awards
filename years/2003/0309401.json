 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many changes in K-12 education have created an increased and critical need for effective\r\nprofessional development for teachers. These changes include new standards; new\r\ncurriculum and assessments; changes in student demographics; advances in classroom\r\ntechnology; and a growing shortage of qualified teachers. To address this need, many\r\neducational organizations are turning to web-based, online professional development,\r\nwhich can provide teachers with flexible scheduling and access to resources, mentors,\r\nand peers that would not be available otherwise.\r\n\r\nA significant body of research enables us to define principles of effective professional\r\ndevelopment in face-to-face settings, and some research is available showing that online\r\ncourses can be effective at the college and high school levels. However, very little\r\nresearch is available about the effectiveness of online professional development in which\r\nthe goals are to impact both the content knowledge and the classroom practices of K-12\r\nteachers. The proposed project will begin to establish a solid research base about online\r\nprofessional development by addressing three major questions, which fall under ROLE\r\nProgram Quadrant III, Research on STEM Learning in Education Settings:\r\n\r\n1. What is the comparative impact on teachers' content knowledge and instructional\r\npractices of alternative models of online professional development, face-to-face\r\nmodels, and hybrid models that combine the two?\r\n2. How do the types of interactions among participants and between participants and\r\nworkshop leaders differ across different online professional development models, and\r\nare these differences related to participants' satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and\r\nchanges in practice?\r\n3. What are the factors that maximize the impact of online professional development on\r\nteachers' content knowledge and instructional practices?\r\n\r\nTo address these questions, the project will develop and implement a series of contrastive\r\nprofessional development workshops, including several online models, hybrid models\r\nthat integrate some face-to-face meetings into the context of online workshops, and a\r\nmore traditional onsite workshop model. The workshops will focus on topics selected\r\nfrom the middle school mathematics curriculum, and seek to both deepen participants'\r\nunderstanding of the mathematics and enhance their approaches to teaching this content.\r\nWithin each content area, the goals, learning activities, teaching approach, and time\r\nrequirements for participants will be held as constant as possible across workshop\r\nmodels. Multiple measures, including assessments of participants' content knowledge\r\nwithin the context of teaching tasks, participant surveys and interviews, analyses of\r\nlesson plans and student work, classroom observations, student surveys, and discourse\r\nanalyses will be employed to address the three main research questions.\r\n\r\nThe results will inform educational policy makers, school and district administrators,\r\nprofessional development providers, faculty in teacher preparation programs, and\r\nteachers, as well as the research community.\r\n",
