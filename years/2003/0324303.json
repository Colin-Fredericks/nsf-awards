This approach relies on the interfacial alternating copolymerization of maleate and vinyl ether monomers.  By choosing hydrophobic and hydrophilic combinations of these two monomer types, which individually do not homopolymerize, the polymeriztion is constrained to occur only at oil/water interfaces.  The principles and methodology behind this encapsulation technique, if proven, will allow for the direct encapsulation of many substrates through a scalabale, inexpensive process presenting a high degree of flexibility and control in manipulating the shell thickness, permeability, and surface chemistry.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact:\r\n\r\nThis process, which potentially combines the best features of existing hollow encapsulation technologies, could have widespread and immediate applications in the encapsulation and controlled release of many drugs, dyes, cells, enzymes, transfection vectors, etc.  In addition, the general principle of interfacial free-radical alternating copolymerziation has many potential applications extending beyond hollow-capsule encapsulation and into many established nanotechnologies where the preponderance of interfaces accentuates the significance of this polymerization technique.  The project will also serve to educate and train undergraduate and graduate students in the principles of interfacial phenomena and radical polymerizations.\r\n",
