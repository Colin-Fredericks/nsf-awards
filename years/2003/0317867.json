 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decision making in public policy as well as commercial settings is often\r\ncomplicated by disagreement among experts regarding estimates,\r\nforecasts, and even the nature of the problem under discussion.\r\nMoreover, it is often necessary to make a decision in the face of such\r\ndisagreements; collecting the required \"hard evidence\" may simply be\r\ninfeasible within a reasonable period of time. Thus, it is important to\r\nfind ways to use the valuable knowledge that experts possess. Expert\r\nknowledge often is best characterized as \"opinions\" that can be\r\nexpressed as probability judgments, the expert's assessment of the\r\nchance that something is true. Typical public-policy settings where\r\nexpert probability judgments are used include energy (especially nuclear\r\npower and engineering), military, intelligence and security, environment\r\nand health policy, and economic forecasting. In commercial settings,\r\nexpert judgments play large roles in overall strategic decision making\r\nand situations such as oil and gas exploration and pharmaceutical\r\nresearch and development.\r\n\r\nNo simple answer exists for improving experts' probability judgments.\r\nPsychological research has documented many ways in which such judgments\r\nare biased. Because different psychological processes may be at work in\r\ndifferent situations, methods to counteract the corresponding biases\r\nmust be adapted to the specific situation. The proposed research offers\r\nthree practical methods for improving experts' probabilities. All three\r\nmethods are grounded in psychological theory and are designed to be\r\napplicable to a variety of probability-assessment situations. Each\r\nmethod will be subjected to rigorous evaluation to demonstrate its\r\neffectiveness. The three methods further provide models for how a\r\nscientist can use psychological results and theory for developing\r\nadditional adjustment methods for improving expert probabilities.",
