 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will bring together experts in the areas of Topological Quantum Field Theory, Hopf  Algebras, Category Theory, Representation Theory, Knot Theory, and Mathematical Physics.  It will contribute to research in all of the above subjects.  Generally, such a conference will increase the knowledge of the participants and could result in the invention of new theorems, interesting conjectures, and fascinating generalizations.\r\n\r\nAn essential feature of this conference is that it brings together people from many different disciplines.  Although these areas of mathematics and physics have impacted each other often in the past, not all the researchers in a given field are fully aware of the recent advances in the other ones. One goal of this conference is to foster a dialogue between the researchers.  The second goal of the meeting is to help students, in particular graduate students, and recent Ph.Ds become acquainted with the new areas of research.  This will broaden their perspective and will contribute to their mathematical careers, mathematical research, and teaching. This conference encourages and supports participation of minorities and women.\r\n",
