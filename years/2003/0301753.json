 "awd_abstract_narration": "A distributed space system is a collection of \r\nphysically separated, multiple space vehicles whose\r\nstates are coordinated to achieve a local or global objective.\r\nThe distributed spacecraft paradigm shifts the complexity of \r\nthe space system design, traditionally associated with the \r\ncontrol of large flexible structures,to problems in planning, \r\ncoordination, inter-spacecraft communication and sensing, and control.\r\nThe objectives of this project are to \r\n(1) develop a hybrid control design methodology which captures\r\nthe interaction between inter-spacecraft communication and sensing\r\non the one hand and the admissible distributed spacecraft\r\ncontrol strategies on the other, and \r\n(2) develop autonomous maneuver planning and \r\ncontrol for distributed space systems.\r\nThis research leads to novel analysis\r\nand synthesis techniques for a class of \r\nhybrid dynamic systems that is tailored to capture\r\nthe interdependence of communication, sensing, and control\r\nof a distributed system.It also examines a paradigm and a new \r\nset of techniques in the matrix inequality approach to path\r\nplanning and control. \r\n\r\nThe education plan is implemented through \r\ncourse and curriculum development, \r\nundergraduate and graduate mentoring, and an outreach effort.\r\nThe undergraduate course focuses on control theory and its applications in \r\nthe design of space systems,and emphasizes its interdependence on \r\ncommunication and computing technologies. \r\nTwo graduate courses, Hybrid Systems and Optimization in Systems Sciences,\r\nemphasize the recent advances in the modeling,\r\nanalysis, and design techniques for a specific class of \r\ndynamic systems, and lays out a rigorous framework,\r\nbased on optimization theory and computational techniques, \r\nfor general dynamic system analysis and synthesis.\r\nThe outreach effort focuses on an interactive Internet website and\r\ntwo teachers' workshops, through which concepts of control and \r\nspace system engineering are communicated to the high school students and \r\ngrades 9--12 teachers.\r\n\r\n",
