 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to create a software reconfigurable solid freeform fabrication tool capable of manufacturing dense metal structures with dimensions below 100 micrometers.  The approach is to develop and optimize a tool comprised of a high resolution, multiple anode, electro-deposition print head that can be micro-positioned above a cathode substrate.  Each anode in the electro-deposition print head possesses a complementary electrolyte injector with a diameter below 100 micrometers, allowing metal electro-deposition to be highly localized.  Rastering the head above the substrate, while simultaneously controlling the deposition current and electrolyte flow, permits the layer-by-layer growth of three-dimensional multi-material structures.  Fundamental studies of the head durability, interaction of the flow and current at the cathode substrate, as well as the release of built structures, will guide the tool design and optimization.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research include the development of a new, flexible, approach for manufacturing metal microstructures. The layer-by-layer build process of this tool is strictly additive, and involves materials with a wide range of functional properties, allowing substantial design flexibility.  The success of this work will impact numerous industries, including aerospace, communications, health care, information technology, security, and defense sectors.  Upon graduation, the two advanced degree students working on this research project will likely contribute to the manufacturing competitiveness of the United States.",
