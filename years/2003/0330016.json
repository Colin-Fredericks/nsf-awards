 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWireless networks of sensor nodes cooperating among themselves for information gathering and analysis\r\nare becoming an important platform in several domains. The area has seen growing research interest in\r\ndifferent layers - devices, communication, network protocols and to a limited extent, applications. For\r\nsensor networks to become viable platforms for the large class of applications it is being targeted\r\ntowards, there is the need to consider the cross-interaction between the different layers. For example, the\r\nfact that the sensors are equipped with smart antennas capable of power optimization should be utilized\r\nby the routing protocols. The novelty of the proposed research is manifold. We propose to design a\r\nsensor node that integrates innovative ideas for the radio frequency (RF) based communication device,\r\nthe MAC layer, and a fault-tolerant and real-time middleware. The integrated node will be used in building\r\na sensor network and evaluating the network for tradeoffs of performance, cost, robustness, simplicity,\r\nand flexibility.\r\nUncertainty will be an undeniable fact of life with sensor networks in their real world deployments. The\r\nuncertainty will stem from environmental variability (e.g., lack of line of sight communication), node\r\nvariability (e.g., faster drainage of battery than expected), traffic variability (such as, higher than expected\r\nsensed data traffic due to frequent occurrence of the event of interest) and attacker induced variability\r\n(e.g., jamming of the physical channels by a malicious intruder). In our research, we propose to provide\r\nin-built support in the nodes to tolerate the uncertainty in the different dimensions. We propose several\r\nnovel low power modes of operation based on the features of our proposed smart antenna in the RF\r\ncommunication equipment. Our proposed sensor node will be capable of not simply tolerating uncertainty,\r\nbut exploiting the uncertainty to its advantage. We propose to make use of limited mobility in case it\r\ncauses the neighbors of a node to be aligned in a narrow band. In such a situation, the antenna can be\r\nswitched from its omni-directional mode of operation to a lower power unidirectional mode.\r\nAdaptivity of the sensor node will be another important driving factor in its design. The sensor node\r\nshould lend itself to reconfiguration in the face of uncertainty through easy to use mechanisms. In our\r\nproposed node, a common thread of adaptivity will be built in at all the three levels under investigation.\r\nThe issues of trade-off between adaptivity or flexibility and performance, cost, and simplicity will be\r\nconsidered for each layer as well as for the cross-interaction between layers. For example, at the\r\ncommunication device layer, the key tradeoff against cost will feature prominently since expensive\r\nantenna arrays can provide the flexibility we require, but at a cost infeasible for the sensor nodes.\r\nAdaptivity at the system software level will focus on performing tasks on an as-needed basis, such as\r\nactivating the sensor only when there is an event of interest. Adaptivity at the middleware level will focus\r\non adjusting the communication and computation to tune the fault -tolerance and real-time quality of\r\nservice provided by the node.\r\nThe proposed research comprises three key tasks: (i) Building diverse and intelligent RF hardware on\r\nelectrically small nodes, which will enable more robust and lower power operation. The key issues\r\naddressed here will be directionality, electromagnetically small size, and tradeoff between attractive\r\nradiation shaping and cost and complexity; (ii) Building MAC and networking mechanisms which can\r\nleverage the flexibility provided by the RF hardware and provide hooks to the middleware. The MAC and\r\nnetwork layers will balance the tradeoffs of resource cost against performance and optimize it based on\r\nthe application requirements; (iii) Building a middleware layer that optimizes the operations for fault-\r\ntolerance and real-time requirements and balances these criteria against the cost and performance\r\nimpact.\r\nBroad Impact in Technology and Teaching: An important goal of the research is to develop sensor\r\nnodes with the new technology and create a sensor network testbed with the nodes equipped with\r\nmobility. The testbed will serve as an intuitive and attractive vehicle for disseminating the research\r\nresults. This trend of popularizing research follows the earlier experience of the co-PI Rosenberg who has\r\ndeveloped and deployed locality aware wireless services (such as, printing services) on the Purdue\r\ncampus for widespread community use. The research findings will be disseminated to the RF, network,\r\nand middleware research community through publications and conference presentations. This project will\r\nhelp in teaching and training the graduate and undergraduate students who are implementing the\r\ntechniques and performing the testbed development and evaluation. The research results may be\r\nincorporated in several graduate and undergraduate courses taught by the PI and the co-PIs (i-Fault\r\nTolerant System Designlt, ieAdvanced Course in Networkingl., ieDistributed Parameter Systemslr).",
