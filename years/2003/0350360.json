 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SLC Catalyst activity focuses on individual differences in learning.  If individual differences can be known -- and marked somehow in each individual -- then it may be possible to intervene to optimize learning. To fully understand the highly individual learning process, this project aims to resolve in detail the molecular, cellular, and systems basis of patterns of neural activity and networks in rodent models and in humans that contribute to individual learning. The long-range vision is to develop an integrated understanding of individual differences in learning such that it may be possible in the future to tailor teaching methods, or other means of intervention, to an individual based on the function of his/her unique brain system to optimize learning. This Catalyst project plans for a Science of Learning Center through a yearlong activity that emphasizes not only pilot projects to explore the basic research core, but the development of a foundation for diverse disciplines to work together. The research activities proposed have the potential to optimize learning for all individuals of our society. New Mexico as the first minority-majority state is a reflection of the changes occurring throughout the nation and consequently, has an important role as a laboratory for the exploration of the foundations of learning in a highly diverse population. The proposed Southwest Center for the Science of Learning will bring to bear the intellectual and diversity resources to address the complex educational, cultural and economic changes facing the rest of the nation. \r\n",
