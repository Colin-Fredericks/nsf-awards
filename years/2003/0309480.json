Igusa also plans to integrate the basic ideas into the\r\nfirst year graduate topology course at Brandeis. The fundamental\r\nconcept being used is that of an A-infinity functor. Since\r\nordinary homology and cohomology have intrinsic A-infinity\r\nstructures and since A-infinity functors give an alternative\r\napproach to spectral sequences, it would be both feasible and\r\nappropriate to introduce this concept at an early stage and to\r\nengage beginning graduate students and gifted undergraduates into\r\nresearch related topics at an early stage. The lecture notes\r\nwould be made available online and expository papers would also\r\nbe posted on preprint servers to explain and disseminate the\r\ncurrent uses of this old concept.\r\n\r\nThis research is about graphs and surfaces. The study of the space\r\nof all graphs and the space of surfaces is an active area of\r\nresearch in Topology and Algebraic Geometry which has captured the\r\nattention of mathematicians and theoretical physicists in recent\r\nyears because of the work of Ed Witten and Maxim Kontsevich both\r\nof whom received Fields Medals for their influential work. Igusa\r\nbrings an innovative approach to this field by apply new methods\r\nin high dimensional Algebraic Topology to the study of these one\r\nand two dimensional objects. Igusa's methods have already solved\r\nseveral previously unanswered questions, both theoretical and\r\ncomputational. In this project Igusa plans to tackle some of the\r\nfundamental theoretical problems in this field which his\r\npreliminary research has found to be amenable to his methods. He\r\nalso proposed to educate the Mathematical public to demonstrate\r\nthe accessibility of these exotic methods. The impact of this\r\nresearch will be to accelerate the expansion of this important\r\narea of research and to make basic Topology more exciting to the\r\nstudents who study it by incorporating topics of current research.\r\n",
