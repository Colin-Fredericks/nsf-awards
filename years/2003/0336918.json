 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a proposal to organize an international symposium in the town of Porto\r\nHeli, Greece from June 25 to July 2, 2003 to:\r\n__ Establish the state of the art in international nanotechnology research as it\r\napplies to a new system class we have defined: polynanomers and\r\npolynanomeric composites.\r\n__ Identify the needs for scientific and engineering research to advance new\r\ntechnologies on a global scale.\r\n__ Identify the requirements for research cooperation between academia,\r\nindustry, governments, non-government and non-profit organizations on a\r\nglobal basis.\r\n__ Develop standards and methods for rapid utilization of new technologies, such\r\nas nanotechnology in areas like the aerospace and health industries.\r\n__ Examine the ability to carry out commercialization of innovation through\r\ninternational cooperations and alliances performed through incubators.\r\nWe anticipate this symposium to impact a broad constituency, ranging from\r\nthe scientific and engineering community to the business, management and science\r\npolicy at the global, regional and local levels. Furthermore, we expect the results of\r\nthe symposium to be incorporated in the formation of an incubator related to the\r\nissues identified.  Basic support is being requested between the U.S., the European Union and Korea to establish the global symposium. Additional countries and/or regions are also being solicitated and will be invited to the symposium.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact Statement\r\nThis symposium may be expected to impact a broad constituency, ranging\r\nfrom the scientific and engineering community to the business, management and\r\nscience policy at the global, regional and local levels. Focusing on rapid\r\ncommercialization of nanotechnology, as it relates to a new class of materials,\r\npolynanomers, that blur the boundaries of polymers, ceramics and metals, the\r\nsymposium will also provide for the first time applications to the aerospace and health industries in an integrated manner. We expect collectively the results of the\r\nsymposium to be incorporated in the formation of an incubator related to the above\r\nsubjects.\r\n",
