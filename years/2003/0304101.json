 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professor Leonard W.  Fine of Columbia University is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Directorate for Biological Sciences.  The award supports the development of three interactive, visual, teaching and learning modules for a General Chemistry course and a General Science course.  The modules integrate science, engineering, and medicine through applications in the nanosciences and nanotechnology and include materials for lectures, student-driven.  recitations, and laboratory experiments.  Modules will be structured in a \"layered\" arrangement with the introductory outer layers featuring basic scientific concepts in context with issues of societal interest needed to build an understanding of nanotechnology appropriate for a General Science course.  The inner layers will be higher level discussions in greater depth, appropriate for the General Chemistry course, exploring more fundamental themes and concepts within the three topic modules.  The emphasis is integrative, taking advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology, and connecting to the interest of all science, engineering, and pre-medical students.  \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of this project include: 1) A reformed chemistry curriculum that demonstrates the benefits of integration of the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, engineering, and technology, through their applications in nanotechnology; 2) The demonstration of the importance of nanotechnology as a central thematic focus of a core science course for liberal arts students; and 3) A unification of research and teaching, with current research results in nanotechnology integrated into the teaching of fundamental scientific concepts.  The evaluation of the project will assess the effectiveness of the proposed instructional materials in developing an integrative understanding of fundamental concepts, and the effectiveness of using examples from the interdisciplinary of nanotechnology in demonstrating the relevance of fundamental scientific concepts to society.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program announcement, NSF 02-148, category NUE.  The project develops teaching modules focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology that will enable instructors and students to relate and connect fundamental concepts with issues of current science, technological, and societal interests.  The project involves faculty at Norfolk State University, an historically black university, who will also incorporate the modules into their chemistry and materials science courses.  \r\n",
