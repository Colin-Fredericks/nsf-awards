 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the acquisition of instrumentation for low temperature research and education on micro/nano-scale electromechanical resonators at Cornell University. This critical instrumentation will enable low temperature actuation and detection of ultra-small, high frequency resonant structures.  Nanoscale mechanical structures have the potential to enable new functionalities and ultra sensitive sensor technology by taking advantage of their low mass. New designs that optimize devices are one of the foci of the research that will be enabled by this instrument. Access to low temperatures where intrinsic loss mechanisms are quenched should lead to a significant increase in the quality factor, a basis of new high-sensitivity devices. The new instrumentation will also enable parametric amplification at low temperatures via electromagnetic, optical, or other methods. The enhanced quality factor is critical in helping to expose non-intrinsic design and process dependent losses. The optimization of the low temperature properties of these structures will positively impact applicability, improve room temperature behavior, and provide significant educational opportunities.  \r\n\r\nThe simultaneous exploration of these frontiers will present exciting research opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral associates and will be a valuable introduction to nano-technology for undergraduates as well as high school teachers. The intuitive appeal of these ultra-small devices will attract students into the sciences at an early stage. Access to these diverse audiences is planned under our program. The instrument itself will be a challenge to complete, and will provide an outstanding training ground for researchers at all levels in the fundamental sciences, and advanced nano-technology that is vital to our future technological infrastructure. \r\n\r\n",
