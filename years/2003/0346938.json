 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n0346938\r\nKevin Sullivan\r\nU of Virginia\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to request support for the organization of two workshops on the  Science of Design. The first workshop  will be held October 12-14, 2003.  It is planned for Airlie Center near Warrenton, Virginia.  The second workshop will be held in the first quarter of 2004, and is also tentatively planned for Airlie Center.  The workshops will support the National Science Foundation.s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) in formulating and establishing research priorities for a science of design.  The workshops will be organized based on national calls for position \r\npapers on the formulation and prioritization of research needs of the field. After a careful selection process, a diverse group of participants will be invited to each workshop to refine  and  develop  an  initial  position  synthesized  from  the  contributions  of  the  invited participants. The final product of each workshop will be a report, which will be available to  National  Science  Foundation  managers  to  plan  and  coordinate  their  activities,  to  the broad research community,  and to the public.  The first workshop will draw largely on \r\nresearchers organized around the CISE division of Computer-Communications Research (CCR); the second will draw on the entire CISE research community. \r\nIntellectual Merit The Science of Design is perhaps unique among sciences for accommodating normative \r\nelements, and thus has the potential to create  a  new bridge between traditional, purely descriptive  natural  sciences  and  the  normative  realm  of  value  that  is  today  largely  the domain of fields such as humanities, the arts, and religion.  The disciplines of computer and information science and engineering have both the need and the means to represent norm-driven design,  from the structures of designed artifacts to the behaviors of the human  and  organizational  processes  that  create  them.ultimately  to  derive  appropriate design structures and processes from the consideration of explicitly represented norms.",
