 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control theory is at a eculiar crossroad.Much of the elegant theory developed over the last 43 years has\r\nrun its course and now appeals to a dwindling number of academics,while it has generated little interest\r\nfrom industry and is mostly irrelevant for engineering design.On the other hand the real design roblems\r\nfaced by control engineers remain unresearched,lack theoretical foundation,are of a fundamental nature\r\nand theoretically extremely challenging,and there is a crying need for analytical and computer aided\r\ndesign ap roaches.Our roposal attem ts to address this gap and to work towards its resolution.\r\nThe exploratory research described here deals with the develo ment of new approaches to the design of\r\n.xed order and structure controllers.The need for this research stems from the following:a)The o timal\r\ncontrol theory developed intensively since 1960 by control theorists result in high order controllers that\r\nare model-based and the theory cannot handle the constraint of .xed order,which is ever present in\r\nindustrial applications;this makes modern theory inapplicable to even such widely used controllers as\r\nPID and lead/lag,for instance.b)O timal and high order controllers can have severe structural and\r\nsensitivity roblems as shown dramatically in the 1997 paper \"Robust,Fragile or Optimal?\"h(IEEE T-AC\r\nAugust 1997)by Keel and Bhattacharyya.This a er showed that controllers designed by H2,H \",l1\r\nand techniques could be acutely sensitive to erturbations in the controller coe .cients rendering them\r\nunusable.Since then no systematic solution to the fragility roblem has emerged despite signi .cant\r\nactivity in this area.c)An important need in practical design roblems is to have sets of feasible\r\nsolutions meeting various objectives such as stability,robustness,time-delay tolerance etc so that design\r\ntradeo .s can be intelligently compared.The resent theory of .xed order controllers is far from answering\r\nsuch questions-indeed it cannot in most cases determine if even nominal stabilization is ossible at all.\r\nWith the above background as motivation our roposed research sets out to explore some new ap-\r\nproaches to solve the .xed order controller design roblem.The .rst step in this,necessarily,is the\r\ndetermination of the stabilizing set.This is a di .cult and longstanding unsolved roblem in control\r\ntheory.We have recently obtained a breakthrough in two s ecial cases.Speci .cally we obtained a mixed\r\nanalytical/com utational solution to the roblem of determining whether a .rst order or PID controller\r\ncan stabilize a given lant.Our solution can determine the complete set of stabilizing controllers and\r\nshows that this set is not convex or even connected.In view of this it is not clear how erformance\r\nconstraints can be e .ectively imposed.Moreover the solution technique used by us in these cases does\r\nnot seem to extend to the general case.\r\nWe intend to explore two approaches for the general case.The .rst will be an attempt to approximate\r\nthe .xed order controller stabilizing sets,which are disconnected in general,through unions of convex\r\nsets.We will explore the use of the interlacing conditions for stability to generate these and it appears\r\nossible that we can get a good and tight approximation to the stabilizing sets as unions of convex\r\nsets.This can open the door to the im osition of erformance constraints and their satisfaction through\r\ncomputationally tractable methods such as linear rogramming and convex optimization,despite the\r\ncomplicated to ology of the stabilizing sets.The second approach that we intend to explore is the\r\nuse of a hybrid Nyquist/D-Decomposition technique that we have found to be useful in simple cases.\r\nThis method has the additional otential advantage that it may be ossible to determine stabilizing sets\r\nfrom frequency domain data only thus making the design based exclusively on experimental data and\r\nessentially \"gmodel-free \"h.In this setting achieving robustness of the design to the data should also be\r\ndevelo ed.\r\nIn summary the exploratory research pro osed here addresses the design of fixed but arbitrary or-\r\nder,robust,non-fragile controllers based on classical as well as modern erformance criteria.This is a\r\nlongstanding and di .cult open control roblem.Nevertheless it needs to be solved in general for the\r\ntheory and ractice of the .eld to rogress.In the roposal we describe some seemingly romising new\r\napproaches which are signi .cant departures from the optimization and model based approaches that\r\ndominate the .eld at resent.We intend to explore how far these approaches can be develo ed into\r\ndesign e .ective rocedures.We believe that such procedures will bene .t control engineering ractice as\r\nwell as academic research and hel close the looming theory-practice gap in our .eld.",
