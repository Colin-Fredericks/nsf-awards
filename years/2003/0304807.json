 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark D. Dadmun, Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee, Rigoberto C. Advincula, Department of Chemistry, University of Houston, S. Michael Kilbey, Department of Chemistry, Clemson University, Jimmy W Mays, University of Tennessee and Grant D. Smith, University of Utah, are funded with an award from the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program with funds provided by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  This multifaceted team will investigate a novel chemical process to modify  and control interfaces; multiply bound polymer chains (MBPCs).  Well-defined  polymers  of  various  architectures will be synthesized, and theory, simulation and experimental techniques utilized to investigate the kinetics of assembly, surface organization, layer structure, and properties of MBPCs made from  these materials. Additionally,  the use of MBPCs in a number of macroscopic applications will be examined.  \r\n\r\nThis multiinstitution, multidisciplinary research will produce surfaces with bound loops that have desired structural features and/or confer useful properties on solid interfaces.  Technological impacts, including the modifation of interfaces to promote or prevent adhesion, stabilization of colloid particles, improvement of multi-component polymer systems, and altered the wear characteristics of surfaces, will result from this research.  This research program will also provide an interdisciplinary training  ground for undergraduate and graduate students, and  will  use  student  exchanges  to  expose  the  students  to  socially  and  culturally  diverse environments.  Also, a number of  experiments  will be carried out at National Laboratories, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratory. Students will acquire hands-on experience in a multi-user facility and develop the next-generation of neutron users.  The participation of under-represented  groups in polymer research will take place through the Engineering in Diversity Program, the Tennessee  Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, and the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities Program. Further, science teachers from public high schools and  junior colleges will spend four weeks in research laboratories contributing to this project, providing exposure to polymers and polymer research.  Finally, a website for polymer interfaces will be developed.",
