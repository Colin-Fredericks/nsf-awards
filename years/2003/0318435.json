 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Communicating Research to Public Audiences project is derived from work funded by research grant DEB-9903416 entitled \"LTREB:  Long Term Studies of African Lions.\"  In partnership with the Bell Museum of Natural History, Craig Packer at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will develop a 500 sq ft traveling exhibition and associated website on the factors that contribute to the successful survival and reproduction of individual lions. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This exhibit builds on public interest in lions and the intriguing question of why males have manes to educate visitors about the process of scientific research.  Its content is based on seven years of observations and experiments by a leading researcher on the behavioral ecology of lions.  The exhibit will include a life-size \"model\" lion (actually a plush toy made to exact specifications) that was used in the field to test responses by real lions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  In addition to being displayed by the Bell Museum, \"The Lion's Mane\" exhibit will travel to zoos with lion exhibits and to museums with lion dioramas.  By highlighting a female researcher, the exhibit provides an entry point and a role model for girls.  This exhibit will benefit from and build upon extensive national publicity received by the Lion Research Project and its lionresearch.org website. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
