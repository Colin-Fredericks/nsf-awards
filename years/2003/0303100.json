VARIATIONAL AND TOPOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO   THE THREE-BODY\r\nPROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposer will investigate several aspects\r\nof the Newtonian three-body problems using\r\ntechniques from geometric analysis and\r\n classical ODEs. \r\nThe main new direction proposed is \r\nto understand scattering in the\r\nNewtonian three-body problem using the technique of ``gluing'' borrowed\r\nfrom geometric PDE.  An unbounded solution with negative energy\r\n consist of two ``bound masses'' orbiting each other\r\nin a nearly Keplerian orbit while the third mass\r\nsails away, asymptoting to  a Keplerian\r\nhypebolic orbit. Each of the  two Jacobi vectors \r\n asymptotes to a solution   to  a   Kepler\r\ntwo-body problems -- an elliptic one for the   bound pair,\r\nand a hyperbolic one for the vector joining the  \r\n receding mass to the center of mass of the bound pair.\r\nIf the solution is unbounded in  both the past and future,\r\nthere can, and typically will,  be different Keplerian orbits in the past\r\nand\r\nthe future -- indeed the pair which is bound in the distant past\r\nmight be different from the pair bound in the future. \r\nWhich Kepler parameters can be connected to which by \r\nan unbounded three-body orbit? This scattering problem is one of \r\nthe central questions we will investigate.  \r\n Other problems to be investigated\r\nfollow past lines of investigation initiated by the proposer.\r\nWe give two examples. Planar three body solutions can be partially encoded\r\nby\r\ntheir syzygy sequence. Is every syzygy sequence possible?\r\nInitial computer investigations suggest not.   \r\nIs it true that every zero-angular momentum negative energy\r\nsolution which tends to the Lagrange homothety orbit\r\neither is the Lagrange homothety orbit, or suffers a syzygy? \r\n \r\nThe Newtonian \r\nthree-body problem concerns the dynamics of\r\nthree\tbodies,    \r\nmodelled as  point masses, attracting each other by Newton's\r\n$1/r^2$ gravitational force.  Think of the bodies\r\nas the earth, moon, and sun, or as three stars.  \r\nThe ``problem'' is not a single problem,\r\nbut rather  a large  collection\r\nof problems concering the         \r\nlong-term qualitative behavior of such a system of masses.  \r\nA solution is called ``bounded'' if the three interbody distances\r\nremain finite and bounded by some fixed distance for all time.  \r\n  A central open question is: how\r\nbig is the set of bounded solutions? \r\nIs it true that arbitrarily close to a bound solution there is an\r\nunbounded one? \r\nThe traditional approach to this question has involved ``Arnol'd\r\ndiffusion''\r\n-- a mechanism discovered by V.I. Arnol'd through which seemingly stable\r\nregions and orbits become unstable and perhaps eventually unbounded.\r\nThe  Arnol'd diffusion method or mechanism is in essence perturbative: one\r\ntries to perturb away from an apparently stable situation.\r\nAs an alternative, we propose to start at infinity and sweep in from\r\ninfinity to see what parts of phase space are swept out.  \r\n``Starting at infinity'' means thinking of the scattering problem --\r\nthe situation of one body infinitely distant from the other two.\r\nThe most interesting case is that in which  two of the masses remain \r\nbounded, orbiting each other in a nearly Keplerian orbit as the third mass\r\nrecedes.\r\nImagine beginning in such a manner in the infinite past, and ending up in\r\nsuch a manner in the infinite future, \r\nbut with the past and future bound pairs perhaps different,\r\nor their  Keplerian ellipse having   different eccentricities,\r\n energies, etc.  In this way we get a kind of ``scattering map'' from\r\nKepler orbits\r\n(or parameters) to Kepler orbits. \r\nWhat does this scattering map look like?  This ``scattering problem''\r\nis one of the main new directions we propose to investigate.\r\nIn addition, we propose several questions more  in line with\r\nour past investigations.  Here is one example.  A ``syzygy'' is an instant\r\nat which all three masses lie on a  line.   \r\nAt such an instant one   mass  ``eclipses'' (lies between) the other two.\r\nLabel the syzygies   by the mass doing the eclipsing.\r\nList the labelled  syzygies in order of appearance, thus  associating to\r\neach solution\r\na syzygy sequence.  \r\nIn the planar three-body problem, are all syzygy  sequences possible?\r\nThis is an open problem.  The proposer has made partial progress.  Initial\r\ncomputer investigations with\r\nthe help of an undergraduate researcher  suggest that the answer might be\r\n``no''.\r\n\r\n",
