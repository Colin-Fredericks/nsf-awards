 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI project focuses on the study of toroidal electron plasma confinement with the following goals: 1) To design and build a toroidal electron plasma confinement device with a one kG confining magnetic field, better vacuum conditions than any previous device of its kind, and field symmetry comparable to cylindrical electron plasma experiments that demonstrate confinement times of minutes or hours, 2) to successfully confine toroidal electron plasmas in a (partially) toroidal trap for times longer than 50 milliseconds, longer than any prior experiment of its type, and permitting detailed investigation of equilibrium, stability and transport physics, 3)  o observe the theoretically predicted magnetic pumping transport mechanism, a transport mechanism that results from toroidal effects, and 4) to develop a charge injection (and plasma diagnostic) strategy for use in a completely toroidal trap, opening up the possibility of studying electron plasma configurations with parallel current. The activity provide research experiences, as well as scientific authorship and presentation opportunities, for undergraduate students",
