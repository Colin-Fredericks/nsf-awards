 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop a novel optoelectronic sensing\r\nsystem for the high-speed identification and sorting of metals, in particular aluminum alloys containing\r\nsilicon and magnesium alloying elements. The goal of the program is to develop a commercial system that\r\nwill be capable of sorting wrought alloys from cast alloys. This new sensor driven technology, called the\r\nSpectramet Technology, will ultimately provide a revolutionary remote sensing intelligent-machine\r\nsystem (actually a platform of sensors and systems) that will accurately and unambiguously analyze and\r\nsort recycled metals at currently unachievable high accuracy and high speeds into compositions of metals\r\nand alloys custom mixed to smelter or mill specifications. If successful, the result would be a commercially viable sorting system.\r\n\r\nWorldwide generation of aluminum scrap amounts to 8 million metric tons per year, of which half is generated here in the U.S. If successful, applying a projected scrap value of $1500 per metric ton, this technology would create a paradigm shift in a $10 billion market for sorting and recycling scrap aluminum. The new technology would be important in helping U.S. industry compete with low cost, labor-intensive overseas operations. It would replace the need for new primary production allowing substitution of existing U.S. aluminum scrap resources into high-grade specification applications.\r\n",
