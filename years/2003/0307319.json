 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this U.S.-Czech research project between Donald A. Gurnett of the University of Iowa and Ondrej Santolik of Charles University in Prague is to apply state- of-the-art analysis techniques to wave measurements in space plasmas.  The European Space Agency's recently launched Cluster mission consists of four identical spacecraft equipped with instruments designed for measurements of plasma waves, fields and particles in Earth's magnetosphere and adjacent regions.  The resulting high-quality wave measurements require advanced methods for interpretation and analysis of the underlying physical processes.  To analyze this new Cluster data and data from two earlier missions (Polar and Cassini), the US-Czech team will employ various methods such as wave distribution functions, higher order spectra, and correlative methods for multi-point/multi-scale measurements. Their research plan builds upon U.S. strengths in wave instrumentation and Czech expertise in satellite data analysis and interpretation of wave observations.  \r\n\r\nTogether the researchers intend to determine the: 1) properties of nonlinear phenomena in the auroral region and near the bow shock, 2) sources and propagation of plasma waves in the whistler mode observed near the magnetic equator and in the auroral region, and 3) wave particle interactions responsible for generation of these plasma waves.  Results should lead to a better understanding of basic physical processes occurring around Earth, many of them related to the Sun-Earth connection in which waves play a fundamental role.  Furthermore, findings should be useful to follow-on multi-spacecraft missions when planning more sophisticated investigations designed to answer questions posed by theorists and modelers about stellar and terrestrial plasma wave environments. \r\n\r\nThis project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. and Czech students to the international space research community through work at partner institutions and direct involvement in the project's advanced data analysis and modeling techniques.",
