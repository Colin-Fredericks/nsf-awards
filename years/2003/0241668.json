The model is intended for use in coarse resolution ocean models.  The first part of this work has already been carried out (Canuto et al., 2001, 2002, C1-2). A turbulence model based on the Reynolds Stress Model was constructed which included the velocity field and two active scalars fields, temperature and salinity. Correspondingly, the model provided the eddy diffusivities of momentum, heat and salinity. The model also provided the eddy diffusivities for a passive scalar. All the diffusivities were expressed analytically in terms of the large-scale fields calculable form the OGCMs. The model was tested directly against the data from NATRE (North Atlantic Tracer Release Experiment) specifically, the heat, salt and concentration diffusivities vs. depth. The data were reproduced quite satisfactory including the ratio of salt to heat diffusivity.  Recent but yet unpublished  data  from  measurements  at  Barbados  (reported  by R.W.  Schmitt  of  WHOI  at  the  Hawaii  Ocean  Sciences  Meeting,  Feb.  2002)  of  a  much  larger mixing  at  Barbados  than  at  NATRE,  are  also  in  agreement  with  the  predictions  of  the  model. When used in a coarse resolution OGCM, the model reproduced data closer to Levitus data than previous models (e.g., a better agreement of the T vs.z profile in the Arctic Ocean). The  model  is  however  local  and  cannot  account  for  key  dynamical  feature  such  as  the entrainment process, a precursor of convective overturning or Deep Convection, DC. The latter  process is one of the ocean's major features since it represents the initial stage of the global-scale ventilation  loops  of  the  world  ocean  and  is  also  the  predominant  mechanism  involved  in  the production of NADW (North Atlantic Deep Water). Many  studies  in  the  last  ten  years  have  highlighted  major  features  of  DC  among  which: spatial  localization (e.g., plumes-like behavior), non-locality (a tracer injected in a plume will not get mixed into the ambient fluid until the plume \"creases to entrain\"; a property is thus transported directly from the surface to the bottom, a non-local process); dependence on rotation. In contrast to this wealth of data, the representation in OGCMs of the rich phenomenon of DC is still rather rudimentary.  The  most  commonly  used  is  the  Convective  Adjustment  proposed  in  1969.  Many shortcomings have, however, been highlighted by recent studies the most prominent being perhaps the excessive level of convection that ultimately yields a poor representation of the ice data (too little  ice).    A  more  promising  model  is  based  on  an  oceanic  adaptation  of  a  Plume  Model originally devised by G.I. Taylor. The model has produced considerably more acceptable results.  Thus,  at  present,  vertical  mixing  processes  can  only  be  dealt  with  by  using  one  model  for convective process and another model for non-convective (diapycnal) mixing. Here, we propose a unified treatment of both processes. As stated above, the non-convective mixing  part  has  already  been  studied  and  we  now  plan  to  extent  the  previous  local  model  to become  non-local  so  as  to  encompass  the  convective  processes.  Not  only  have  we  used  such  a model to study other types of convection but we have recently shown that the non-local turbulence model  reproduces  the  Plume Model  which  assumes  that  Plumes  occupy  a  small  fraction  of  the convective patch which holds true only in the initial stages.  Our mixing model will be first tested against LES data and then implemented in HYCOM (an OGCM in isopycnal coordinates). If  our  project  is  successful,  not  only will  the  convective  and  non-convective  processes  be part  of  the  same  mixing  model  but  we  shall  avoid  the  limitation  of  the  Plume  Model  just discussed.\r\n",
