In this context, model theory includes the search for\r\naxiomatizations and quantifier elimination results for concrete\r\nstructures and the development of general stability and dimension\r\ntheories.  The geometric problems to be studied arise in\r\nalgebraic, complex analytic, rigid analytic, and differential\r\nalgebraic geometry.  Specific projects include the extension of\r\nthe model theory of compact complex manifolds to nonstandard\r\nanalytic spaces and rigid analytic spaces.  Some of this work\r\ninvestigates the extent to which Kaehler manifolds are free from\r\nmodel theoretic pathologies.  In diophantine geometry new\r\nuniformity and finiteness principles are being sought as\r\nreflections of similar results for enriched fields.  In\r\nparticular, a program based on the model theory of separably\r\nclosed fields aims to resolve a function field variant of Denis'\r\nanalogue of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for Drinfeld modules.\r\nThe fine structure of definable sets over D-fields will be\r\ninvestigated, aiming to extend relative completeness and\r\nquantifier elimination theorems to valued D-fields with richer\r\nanalytic structure and to produce effective versions of\r\nquantifier elimination theorems in this setting.  Differential\r\njet spaces and related constructions will be used to uncover the\r\ncombinatorial geometry of regular types in partial differential\r\nfields.  Abstract Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings of\r\nfirst-order structure will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the branch of logic called model theory is, roughly,\r\nthat if we know all of the simply-stated truths about an object\r\nthen either we should know how to recognize that object uniquely,\r\nor anything else sharing the same collection of first-order\r\nproperties should be revealing like the original and might\r\nsometimes be easier to study.  To be more precise, model theory\r\nstudies mathematical structures by considering the first-order\r\nsentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate\r\nstructures that also satisfy all of those first-order sentences.\r\n(Sentences in logic are built out of a small repertoire of\r\nelements and constructions.  \"First-order\" refers to the number\r\nof quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.)  A model\r\nfor the algorithms and bounds sought in some of these projects is\r\nlong division: if you are given two whole numbers to divide by\r\nhand then you can estimate the number of steps required by long\r\ndivision by comparing the number of digits in the decimal\r\nexpansions of the dividend and divisor.\r\n",
