It will be subdivided into seven parallel symposia.\r\n\r\nThe topics are:\r\n\r\n1)\tComplex Fluids: Equilibrium and Dynamics\r\n2)\tNanobiotechnology\r\n3)\tNanoscience\r\n4)\tQuantum Engineering\r\n5)\tCatalysts and nanoporous material prepared by self-assembly\r\n6)\tPetroleomics: From Petroleum Composition to Commercial Realty\r\n7)\tMaterials Characterization Techniques and Nanotechnology\r\n\r\nEach symposia will include a keynote lecture and several invited lectures.  Approximately forty contributed papers will be submitted to each of the symposia, and in addition, several hundred papers will be submitted for poster presentations.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The ASTATPHYS-MEX-2003 Conference will focus on a number of exciting and timely topics in Molecular Engineering.  More specifically, the areas that will be addressed at the meeting include nano-tubes and fullerenes, magnetic nano-structures, nano-circuits and nanolithography, supramolecular chemistry and materials, polymers, gene-delivery, self-assembly, confined complex fluids, ionic channels, dynamics of confined fluids, phase transitions and layered materials and molecular design of catalysts (and nano-catalysis).  These are all timely and highly visible areas of research. By virtue of taking place in Mexico, the meeting will attract a considerable number of Latin American and European researchers. The size, structure, and attendant composition are likely to foster increased interactions between scientists and engineers from around the world in the general areas of nanotechnology, molecular engineering, and statistical physics. \r\n",
