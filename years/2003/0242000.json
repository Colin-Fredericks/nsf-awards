For a neoclassical growth model to exhibit a steady state, either technical change must be entirely labor augmenting in the long run, or the production function must be Cobb-Douglas. To get steady growth in the presence investment-specific technical change, the production function should be Cobb-Douglas; however, this is inconsistent with Facts 2 and 3. \r\n\r\nThis research consists of three projects that document and resolve this puzzle. The first project will create a new dataset on factor payments to capital and labor for a large number of countries, both at the aggregate and industry levels, over as long a time as possible. This is important because Fact 2 runs counter to the conventional wisdom: it is commonly accepted that capital shares are relatively constant over time.  The second project proposes a new production function that is consistent with all four stylized facts. Factor shares and estimates of the elasticity of substitution are driven by short-run properties of the production function. However, requirements for steady-state growth involve the shape of the long-run production function. The production function proposed here exploits this difference. The short-run elasticity of substitution responsible for factor pricing is less than one. In the long run, additional substitution possibilities arise and production occurs with a Cobb-Douglas structure. \r\n\r\nThe third project explores the microfoundations for this new production function. A production technique, with a low elasticity of substitution, may be appropriate for a given input mix. To produce with a very different input mix, a new production technique may be required. The shape of a given technique governs the short-run elasticity of substition, while the long- run elasticity of substitution is determined by the distribution of newly discovered techniques. A necessary condition for steady growth is that new techniques are distributed according to a Pareto distribution. This same distributional assumption generates a long-run production function that takes the Cobb-Douglas form. This research will resolve some of pressing puzzles in growth theories that seem to be inconsistent with the observed facts.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
