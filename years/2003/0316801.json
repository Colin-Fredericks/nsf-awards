 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is in the development of self-assembling nanocapsules.  This research involving the design of organic compounds that form defined structures through noncovalent association is important for the development of new molecules for information storage, catalysis, molecular transport, sensing, and the assembly of supramolecular structures.  The goal of the research program is to provide a versatile toolbox of molecular capsules for addressing a variety of problems in drug delivery, phase transfer catalysis, sensing of biomolecules, and the assembly of supramolecular arrays. The research uses calixarene scaffolds supporting peptide strands that will assemble through ionic interactions in polar solvent.  \r\n\r\nWith this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Suzanne B. Shuker of the Department of Chemistry at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.  Professor Shuker will focus her research on the development of nanocapsules that can combine to encapsulate other molecules.  This research will develop new methods for drug transport and delivery, catalysis, and the binding and detection of biomolecules.  Chemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will be trained.  Professor Shuker's laboratory has a track record of training undergraduate women who have gone on to graduate school.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
