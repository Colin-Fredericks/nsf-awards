 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes a development of effective and accurate algorithms for \r\nsimulation of electromagnetic and acoustic wave scattering processes. \r\nThe project includes the development of efficient, error-controllable \r\nschemes based on asymptotic expansions and on direct discretizations. \r\nWhile the computational emphasis will be on efficiency, \r\nerror-controllability will demand careful mathematical analysis; both \r\nrequirements will call for a number of intellectual innovations. Among the \r\nmethods based on asymptotic expansions, the PI proposes to: (i) further \r\nadvance his work on high-order geometric perturbation methods. Here, \r\neffort will concentrate on the design of alternative schemes with improved \r\nstability properties; and (ii) the search for an innovative (rigorous) \r\nhigh-frequency (integral-equation) solver for scattering by surfaces and \r\nbounded bodies that exhibits the advantages of asymptotic high-frequency \r\ntreatments (i.e. a frequency-independent number of degrees of freedom) \r\nwhile allowing for error control at any fixed, finite frequency. A \r\ncombination of the developments in (i) and (ii) will also be sought in the \r\ndesign of a \"multi-scale\" algorithm. The program on direct methods, on the \r\nother hand, shall be concerned with the development of algorithms for the \r\ntreatment of penetrable bodies. For this, it is proposed to develop (iii) \r\naccelerated high-order methods for (volumetric) integral equations; \r\nnovelties in the proposed approach include the design of specialized \r\nhigh-order quadrature rules for volume potentials, and their incorporation \r\ninto a general strategy for their fast evaluation, based on (planar arrays \r\nof) \"equivalent sources\". Finally, the proposal presents a project on (iv) \r\ncertain specific aspects of (Runge-Kutta) discontinuous Galerkin finite \r\nelement approaches, including the implementation of exact radiation \r\nconditions, the design of optimal inter-element fluxes and \r\ntime-integration strategies, and the derivation of a-posteriori error \r\nestimates for adaptive error control. \r\n\r\nElectromagnetic and acoustic devices are ubiquitous in present day \r\ntechnology. Indeed, electromagnetism and acoustics have found and continue \r\nto find applications in a wide array of areas, encompassing both civilian \r\nand military purposes. Among the former, applications of current interest \r\ninclude those related to communications (e.g. transmission through optical \r\nfiber lines), to biomedical devices and health (e.g. ultrasound, \r\ntomography, power-line safety, etc), to circuit or magnetic storage design \r\n(electromagnetic compatibility, hard disc operation), to geophysical \r\nprospecting, and to non-destructive evaluation (e.g. crack detection), to \r\nname but just a few.  Applications in defense, on the other hand, include \r\nthe design of military hardware with decreased signatures (\"virtual \r\nprototyping\");  automatic target recognition (e.g. bunkers, mines and \r\nburied ordnance, etc); propagation effects on communications and radar \r\nsystems (e.g. over complex terrains, through the atmosphere, etc); \r\ntactical antenna design; etc.  Although the principles of acoustic and \r\nelectromagnetic wave propagation are well understood, their application to \r\npractical configurations of current interest, such as those that arise in \r\nconnection with the examples above, is significantly complicated and far \r\nbeyond manual calculation in all but the simplest aspects. These \r\ncomplications typically arise from geometrical and/or compositional \r\ncomplexity in the underlying structures, from the intricacies of the \r\nelectromagnetic fields, or from both. The significant advances in computer \r\nmodeling of acoustic and electromagnetic wave interactions that have taken \r\nplace over the last two decades, on the other hand, have made it possible \r\nto shift the classical \"trial and error\" design paradigm for devices that \r\nwork on such interactions to one that heavily relies on computer \r\nsimulation. Still, the sheer complexity of some applications of current \r\ninterest and the ever-increasing industrial demand for faster and more \r\nreliable software, present significant challenges to state-of-the-art \r\nnumerical solvers. This proposal is focused on the design and testing of \r\nimproved algorithms that, based on sophisticated mathematical techniques \r\nand developments, will result in implementations that will substantially \r\nexpand on the capabilities of presently available simulators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
