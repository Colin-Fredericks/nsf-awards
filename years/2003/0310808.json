 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nThermodynamics serves as the foundation for a sequence of thermal science courses. It is normally taught using Subject-Based Learning where topics are introduced following a well-established textbook sequence in a teacher-centered environment. Students often cite this course as difficult, full of abstract ideas, and don't seem to have any recollection of fundamental principles in future courses. Extensive research on student learning indicates that students learn better, retain more, and understand to a higher level in active and practical learning environments. Problem-Based Learning has such desirable features, promoting critical thinking and enhanced retention of knowledge. Therefore, we have restructured classical thermodynamics around practical applications where fundamental principles are introduced just-in-time and on a need to have basis. The work being adapted comes from Havener and Barlow in their introduction to engineering course, which provided guidance for our curriculum development efforts. Specifically, their work in Project Falcon Base has been helpful. \r\n\r\nTraditional coverage of topics is incorporated in the form of modules where theoretical information is presented to support understanding and discovery of knowledge as students apply inquiry-based learning. Students assess their own knowledge in the process and produce concept maps linking fundamental principles to working equations. This problem-based approach is student-centered and concept-embedded, with emphasis on students leading the lecture, uncovering basic principles, and gaining practice in higher levels of cognitive skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Our classroom format is cooperative, interactive, and based on students' needs. Computer simulations and animations are integrated to help students perform parametric investigations and visualize processes and devices. Students interacting with \"industrial mentors\" have gained access to real-life data and addressing systemic issues. The objective is for our undergraduate students to leave the course with enhanced critical thinking skills, increased level of retained knowledge, strengthened communication skills, and an improved ability to do research and engage in life-long learning.\r\n",
