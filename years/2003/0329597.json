 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology advancement in automotive engine, transmission, and emission aftertreatment systems has\r\nushered in new challenges in developing sophisticated information processing and control strategies to\r\noptimize vehicle performance at reduced costs. Sensor information processing is of vital importance in\r\nthis pursuit. Optimal utility of low-cost sensors, information coordination of multiple sensors, and\r\nestimation of internal states and system parameters using sensors of limited capability and accuracy have\r\nbecome one of the key design considerations.\r\nUsing automotive systems as a key platform, and gasoline direct injection engine and its aftertreatment\r\nsystem for methodology development and implementation, this project will investigate the following\r\nfundamental issues on sensor information processing: (1) How can one identify system parameters or\r\nestimate internal states by using low-cost sensors that provide only limited information and accuracy? (2)\r\nHow can one maximize the information utility of multiple sensor systems? (3) What is the impact of\r\nsensor location configuration and characteristics on performance benefits and costs? Due to high\r\nnonlinearity, large uncertainty, and sensor limitations, these issues are extremely challenging, and\r\ndemand new methodologies and implementation technologies that will push forward the frontiers of\r\nsystem identification and practical sensor information processing.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Project: With over 220 million registered vehicles and 2.8 trillion miles of\r\nannually traveled distances, the US automotive industry bears an enormous impact on the national and\r\nglobal economy, safety, and environment. This project will develop an innovative methodology of multi-sensor\r\nidentification and estimation, on the basis of extensive past research effort from the PI and his\r\ncollaborators. In collaboration with researchers from the automotive industry, findings from this\r\ninvestigation will be employed and implemented to design better control and adaptation strategies in\r\nautomotive systems for improved performance.\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will also introduce new identification and sensor information\r\nmethods that go much beyond what is known in these fields. In particular, it will lead to new multi-sensor\r\nidentification methods that use binary-valued and other nonlinear sensors, and new understanding of\r\nimplementation issues on practical sensor information processing. In light of tremendous sensor\r\ndevelopment effort in many application areas, such as gas content sensors, biosensors, wireless medical\r\nsensors, nanosensors, etc., which will all demand advanced and new information processing techniques to\r\nmaximize their capabilities and utilities, this project anticipates such emerging requirements for sensor\r\ninformation processing methodologies, and develops generic methods that will see increased utility when\r\nnew sensors are developed.\r\nBroad Impact: Beyond the automotive powertrain platforms, the findings from this project will have\r\ndirect utility in a wide array of applications, including vehicle rollover prediction, fault diagnosis of fuel\r\ncell systems and vehicles, computer network traffic control, medical sensor information processing, and\r\nprocess control problems. The PI and his industry collaborators are currently pursuing methodology\r\nenhancement, technology transfer, and device development in these areas.\r\nThis research project encompasses fundamental research and technology development across a wide\r\nrange of disciplines. It targets directly at a broad and important automotive application; involves\r\nmathematics modeling, sensor signal processing, and system identification; and utilizes the most\r\nadvanced facility at Ford Motor Company. As such it provides participating undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents an excellent opportunity to be exposed to a large spectrum of scientific and technology frontiers\r\nwith fundamental methodology development, hand-on design skills, and industry experience. The\r\nresearch findings and course material from this project will be widely disseminated in professional\r\nconferences and journals. Software packages resulted from this project will be released through the\r\nproject homepage for the public use free of charge.",
