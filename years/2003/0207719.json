We will focus on mixed-wettability systems and the impact of geometric descriptors and anisotropy on multiphase flow.  Synchrotron microtomography stations at Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices at Louisiana State University and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory will be used to capture highly resolved images from multiphase porous medium experiments.  In addition to capturing the morphological structure of these systems, pore-scale properties (e.g., pore body/throat distribution and correlation, tortuosity, connectivity, etc ... ) can be calculated from these images.  Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University will use the data and results from these experiments to extend their pore-morphological approaches to model imbibition.  LB methods will be used to accurately model various aspects of multiphase flow including thick wetting phase films in strongly water-wet systems, heterogeneous wettability, and anisotropic spatial correlations of the pore space.\r\n",
