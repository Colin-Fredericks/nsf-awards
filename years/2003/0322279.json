 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award supports the US-India cooperative research \"Comparative Transcript Analysis of Oryza and Porteresia during Salinity Stress.\"  Professors Hans J. Bohnert, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and A. N. Lahiri Majumder, Bose Institute, Kolkata will collaborate on exploring salinity tolerance in monocots using two species, Oryza and Porteresia.  The researchers propose to exploit the genome sequence and genomic resources readily available for Oryza to dissect salt tolerance in Porteresia.  The findings should provide a new set of genes important for salt tolerance and a platform for future manipulations of cereal crops with this attribute. \r\nScope:  This project will foster ties with Indian scientists in an important research area \r\nand provide training in genomics and plant molecular biology in the US and India.  The investigators are highly experienced in areas that compliment each other and the combination of molecular and biochemical studies will result in broader understanding of salt tolerance in cereals.  Mutual benefits with respect to scientific exchange and graduate student development are expected for both countries.  This research is supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Plant Genome Research Program and the Government of India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.",
