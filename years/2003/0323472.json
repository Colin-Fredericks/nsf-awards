A tight coupling between these activities guides the physics and device experiments on the one hand, and ensures the development of realistic models for the architecture designs on the other. Experiments are being conducted using gates, much like those in charge-coupled imagers, to control electrons on superfluid helium held in lithographically defined channels. Such parallel structures are prototypical of many spin-based implementations, and a particular focus of the architecture effort is on designs which follow from classical gate-array based accelerators for certain problems.\r\n\r\nThis project gives a broad training to the graduate student and postdoctoral fellow working on it.  They conduct and are exposed to a wide range of research, including quantum physics, semiconductor technology, low-temperature physics, algorithms and computer architecture.  The project provides a wealth of educational opportunities for undergraduates, both within Princeton and from other schools.\r\n\r\n",
