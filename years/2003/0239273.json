 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project combines interdisciplinary research and education in optical and materials science focusing on photonic crystals. Research emphasis is on the fabrication of new functional materials--self-assembled photonic crystals (PCs), and exploration of their optical response with emphasis on metallo-dielectric photonic crystals (MDPCs) and polymeric PCs. New methods are proposed for the fabrication of three-dimensional MDPCs exploiting self-assembly of metallo-dielectric colloidal spheres. The primary goal of the research is to achieve a better understanding of light-matter interactions in photonic crystals, and to harness these effects to a variety of chal-lenging applications. In the linear regime, enhanced light transmission is predicted in MDPCs, compared to bulk metals, due to efficient coupling of the electromagnetic field into surface plas-mon-polaritons. While nonlinear properties of most bulk materials in the optical region are well understood, detailed studies of their manifestations in highly patterned structures are only begin-ning to emerge. Nonlinear PCs are predicted to exhibit enhanced nonlinear response, making them candidates for all-optical switching and frequency conversion applications. In addition to comparison with theoretical predictions and exploring new physical systems, these materials of-fer prospects for developing novel photonic devices. The approach includes three main objec-tives: 1) Adapting colloidal self-assembly and chemical synthesis techniques to fabricate novel three-dimensional PCs. 2) Detailed study of the optical properties - both linear and nonlinear of the composite materials. 3) Implementation of PCs in nonlinear optical devices, as a basis for fu-ture photonics technologies. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses fundamental materials science research issues having technological rele-vance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integra-tion of research and education. The education plan addresses four main objectives that mesh with the research, and are aimed at enhancing learning experiences in physics at the undergraduate and high school level. At the undergraduate level the aim is to expand avenues for learning, both by integrating key scientific journal publications in classroom teaching, and by offering undergraduate students working opportunities in the research group. At the graduate level the program ad-dresses the development of an Applied Physics program with emphasis in photonics. The research program offers graduate students opportunities for comprehensive research, to expand their skills as students and scientists while working towards their doctoral degree. Through mentoring of younger students, graduate students will also develop valuable leadership, teaching and collaborative skills. An educational outreach program includes a hands-on summer program in physics, aimed at able and eager high school students. The main emphasis of the educational program is on exposing students of all levels to research and scientific disciplines with a  central goal to actively involve an increasing number of students in physical sciences.\r\n*** \r\n",
