 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a program of calculations of heavy-quark hadron cross sections which are\r\nof great importance in the identifcation of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion colli-\r\nsions. This program will involve the calculation of reaction cross sections of various hadrons\r\nwhich have been proposed as QGP diagnostic probes, such as heavy quarkonia, hyper-\r\nons, and antihyperons. Most of these cross sections are not accessible experimentally at\r\npresent, and as such can only be estimated using theoretical models. The central compo-\r\nnent of this proposal consists of calculations of these cross sections using the well-established\r\nconstituent-interchange model, assuming standard quark model forces and a scattering for-\r\nmalism developed previously by two of us (Barnes and Swanson). This approach is known to\r\ngive reasonable agreement with existing experimental low-energy scattering data for a wide\r\nrange of analogous hadron-hadron scattering processes. Additional research topics which\r\nwill be addressed are the generalization of the approach to multichannel and relativistic\r\nregimes, the incorporation of qq pair production amplitudes, a comparison of microscopic\r\nand effective Lagrangian descriptions, and the development of a T-matrix formalism that will\r\nallow direct application to bound state problems. The cross sections obtained here should\r\nbe useful as estimates of the various hadronic contributions to the proposed experimental\r\nsignals for the quark-gluon plasma. These hadronic contributions must be understood and\r\nincorporated in simulations of heavy-ion collisions before QGP formation can be established\r\nthrough various signatures; for this reason a third component of our program is a close\r\ncollaboration with researchers involved in Monte-Carlo simulations of RHIC experiments,\r\nso that the experimental implications of these hadronic contributions for RHIC can be as-\r\nsesssed. This will be facilitated by the presence of a large RHIC experimental group from\r\nPHENIX at ORNL and University of Tennessee.",
