 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarship support for 29 students studying computer science, mathematics, engineering (transitioning after the first two years to their sister university) or engineering technology. They are emphasizing scholarship support for talented but financially disadvantaged students (including underrepresented minorities and people with disabilities).  The project already has a broad array of excellent support services for students and is adding or enhancing a number of features to further improve their success in recruiting, retaining and graduating students in the fields noted above. Among the features being added are: introduction of a new high school intervention program; development of an undergraduate/graduate school transition program; and development of a program to improve collaborative learning skills in a distributed learning environment. Enhancements are also being made to their pre-college program, their new Scholars Academy and their program with the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences.  \r\n",
