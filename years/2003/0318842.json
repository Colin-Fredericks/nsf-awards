 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop rapid detection protocols for bioterror-related pathogens.  At the current time, there are no simple and inexpensive recognition systems that are well suited to the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogenic agents.  This is particularly true for first responders at the point of attack, such as police, paramedics, and firefighters.  Since exposure to Class A bioterror pathogens causes flu-like symptoms in their victims during the first few days after exposure, it is critical that the pathogen be identified as quickly as possible (that is, in one to four hours) in order to minimize fatalities.  In this project, a unique biorecognition system based on immobilized antibodies to a variety of protein toxins will be developed.  Fluorophores will be attached to multi-branched dendrimers that are also derivatized for immobilization of antibodies against bioterror pathogens.  The detection ensemble will be in a kit form, with easy to follow instructions for the identification of specific pathogens by antibody-antigen binding, using chromatographic separation and fluorescence detection of the complex.  It is anticipated that a typical protocol starting from samples obtained at the point of attack will be able to identify a wide variety of bioterror agents in 1 to 4 hours.\r\n\r\nThe main commercial application of this project will be for first responders involved in Homeland Defense. Additional applications are expected in the food and beverage industry, biomedical research laboratories, water treatment facilities and medical diagnostics companies.",
