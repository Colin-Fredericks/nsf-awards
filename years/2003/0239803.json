 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lloyd Bumm of U. of Oklahoma is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to study the electroluminescence of single molecules.  The approach is to integrate optical spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in a new way.  STM will be used to image electrolumophores while a photon counting scheme will be employed to correlate the effect of applied voltage and tunneling current with the photon yield and associated spectrum.  Molecular dynamics will be studied, as well as electrooptic features of noble metal nanoparticles.  This CAREER plan is developed in collaboration with Nomadics, an Oklahoma company that brings emerging technology into the marketplace.  The PI's education plan includes research experience for teachers.  \r\n\r\nNanotechnology has allowed us to think about molecules in a fundamentally new way.  The long-term benefit of molecular electronics will be realized in the form of smaller, higher-speed electronics.  Students trained in these interdisciplinary technologies will be able to contribute to efforts in improved communications and other photonic applications.",
