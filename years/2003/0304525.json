 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"An Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Program in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (IUPNN),\" at the University of Central Florida (UCF), under the direction of Dr. Sudipta Seal, is jointly funded by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS), Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Division of Physics (PHY) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project, which  fits into the state of Florida funded Nanoinitiative (NIUCF), is to develop a new type of collaborative education that meets the broad and expanding needs in nanoscience and technology.  This proposed interdisciplinary program combines research and educational strengths of faculty from across the UCF.  Under this program which will consist of six modular courses in nanotechnology, the students will specialize in science and engineering subjects with a track in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe program will include: (1) Introductory informal coursework on the basic principals of materials, chemistry, physics, optics, mathematics, biology and nanotechnology with laboratory hands-on experience; (2) Research seminars for undergraduates; (3) Seminars, workshops and discussion sessions on issues of ethics in engineering research;  (4) Research group tutorials; (5) Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the PIs; and (6) Evaluation of the program by the UCF College of Education. \r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
