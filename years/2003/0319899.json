 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current and future generations of wireless systems require compact, broadband/high-speed Monolithic\r\nMicrowave Integrated Circuits and Antennas. Higher speed circuits need large bandwidth that can be realized at\r\nhigher frequencies. There are FCC bands for wireless applications up to and beyond 67 GHz. In order to facilitate\r\nresearch in these bands the following instruments need to be acquired: a) Network Analyzer (67GHz), b) Spectrum\r\nAnalyzer (50GHz), c) Signal Generator (40GHz), d) Wafer Probe Station (67GHz), e) Printed Circuit Scriber, and f)\r\nPrinted Circuit Through-Hole Plating System. These are the highest performance equipment currently available.\r\nThe objectives of the proposed activity are:\r\n1) To enhance the capabilities of the Microwave Engineering laboratory facilities for continued research and design\r\nat high frequencies in the areas of Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs), Hybrid-MICs and, printed\r\nAntennas, 2) To expand the scope of collaborative efforts with industry in the design of novel MMICs for current\r\nand future generation communication systems, 3) To increase the extent of training in advanced research, design,\r\ntests and measurements imparted to students, and 4) To strengthen the Universitys position to seek research funding\r\nfrom industry and government agencies.\r\nIndustry-sponsored collaborative research and design activities in the areas of MMICs have been going on at\r\nBradley University for the past 12 years with Northrop-Grumman Corp. and Fujitsu Compound Semiconductor, Inc.\r\nThese projects have involved MMIC designs in which students have been trained in advanced research and design.\r\nThe outcome was the development of novel circuits for applications in current and future generation communication\r\nand radar systems. The MMICs were designed at Bradley University, but fabrication, tests and measurements were\r\nconducted at the laboratories of the industry. The MMICs could not be measured at Bradley University because of\r\nthe frequency limitation (40 GHz) of the existing Network Analyzer and lack of Wafer Probe Station. This deprived\r\nthe students of valuable research experience. Also, active device modeling projects from industry had to be turned\r\ndown due to lack of Wafer Probe Station. Therefore, acquisitions of a 67GHz Network Analyzer and a Microwave\r\nWafer Probe Station will alleviate this deficiency. It will allow the students to do tests and measurements and\r\nexpand opportunities to seek more industry-supported research projects. The fabrications of MMICs however will\r\ncontinue to be done at industry. The Principal Investigator has been exploring potential collaboration with TriQuint\r\nSemiconductor. He will also explore collaborations with the following companies: Hughes, US Monolithics, iTerra\r\nCommunications, TRW, TLC Precision Wafer Technology, Motorola, Conexant, and M/A-COM where he has\r\nestablished connections or his former students are working.\r\nOther research projects included development of novel, Hybrid-MICs, sub-systems, and printed antennas for\r\nwireless Communication systems. In these projects, the existing microwave Anechoic Chamber/Antenna Data\r\nacquisition system, Microwave Source (18 GHz), Spectrum Analyzer (22 GHz) and Network Analyzer (40 GHz)\r\nhave been used. The circuits and antennas have been fabricated using the existing printed circuit fabrication\r\n(chemical etching) facility. Again, the extent of research and design activities has been limited due to frequency\r\nlimitation of the current Signal Source and Spectrum Analyzer, and lack of precision printed circuit fabrication\r\nfacility. For example, a 24 GHz printed array antenna for Automobile Collision Avoidance System project could not\r\nbe undertaken. Therefore acquisition of the instrumentation requested above will overcome this limitation, enabling\r\nresearch and design work at higher frequencies, and enhance the research training of students.\r\nThere is a critical shortage of microwave engineers in this country. Bradley University is one of the few select\r\ninstitutions that offers advanced education and training in this area of specialization. Graduate and senior\r\nundergraduate students are educated and trained through capstone thesis and design projects as well as courses. The\r\nprojects are intensive and involve planning, design, fabrications, tests and measurements, documentation and\r\npresentation. The projects have resulted in numerous refereed publications. Industry has been a partner in\r\nmicrowave education and training by supporting projects and, providing assistantships and internships.\r\nThe acquisitions of the requested equipment will have the following impact: a) Enhance the capability to provide\r\nadvanced research and design experience in RF and Microwave Engineering, including tests and measurements, b)\r\nExpand the scope of projects and partnerships with industry, c) Strengthen the University's position to seek research\r\nfunding from industry and government agencies, d) Help attract and train students in the critical area of RF and\r\nMicrowave Engineering, and e) Enrich the Microwave Engineering curriculum and education at Bradley University.",
