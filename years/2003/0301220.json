The first two weeks will consist of a series of introductory lectures, covering recent developments in the study of algebraic cycles and motives from the algebraic, geometric, and topological points of view. The status of the main problems in the field (Hodge conjecture, Tate conjecture, motivic problems) will also be covered. The final week will be a research level conference centered around the latest developments in the subject. The primary purpose of this grant is to provide travel and subsistence support for graduate students and young postdoctoral people, especially women and underrepresented minorities. A second priority is to support U.S. participants without other grant support.\r\n\r\nFrom June 15 to July 7, 2003, there will be a Summer School and Conference in Morelia, Mexico on ``The Arithmetic, Geometry and Topology of Algebraic Cycles.'' This is an interdisciplinary branch of mathematics which has seen substantial development in the last few years. The first two weeks will consist of a series of introductory lectures, primarily aimed at training young researchers. To reinforce the ideas and methods presented in these lectures, the third week will be a research level conference centered around the latest developments in the subject. The primary purpose of this grant is to provide travel and subsistence support for graduate students and young postdoctoral\r\npeople, especially women and underrepresented minorities. A second priority is to support U.S. participants without other grant support.  This grant is supported jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of International Science  and Engineering.\r\n",
