 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoff Haines-Stiles Productions is producing and distributing a project that will follow the upcoming NASA 2003 Mars Exploration Rover project.   To Mars with MER consists of three prime-time PBS programs scheduled to be broadcast to coincide with key events in the MER project:  the day before the launch, the day before landing and after the 90 day surface mission.   These programs will examine such mission milestones as key engineering tests and selecting where to land based on the scientific questions we have about Mars.  The prime time specials will be edited and, along with additional live and taped video, distributed to science centers, planetariums, educational cable networks and schools with satellite or high-bandwidth Internet connections.  Passport to Knowledge, a partner in the project, will adapt NASA's public domain materials and its own Live from Mars resources (teacher's guide, websites, etc.) to provide customized resources for teachers and students and for the parents and families who will be watching coverage of the mission on broadcast and cable.  All materials will be made available online.",
