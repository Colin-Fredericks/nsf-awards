 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nWolf Abstract\r\n\r\nThis research is developing new methods for the design of high-performance sensor networks \r\nthat perform significant amounts of computation within the sensor network. High-\r\nbandwidth signal processing applications, such as distributed audio or video processing, are becoming \r\nincreasingly common, and performing large amounts of processing in the distributed \r\nsystem that implements the sensor network poses new design challenges.  On the \r\none hand, high-performance sensor networks are like distributed embedded systems, which need \r\nto be optimized to the application in order to minimize power consumption and cost and \r\nmaximize performance; on the other hand, they are like ad-hoc networks that need to be \r\nable to be operate in a number of different configurations without radically increasing the \r\ncost of operating the network. New design methodologies and tools are needed that can \r\ncreate a resilient architecture that still takes advantage of application-specific \r\ncharacteristics. Traditional algorithms and methodologies for designing distributed \r\nembedded systems can handle some of the aspects of sensor networks, namely distributed \r\ncomputation and the effects of communication delay, but their purpose is to select a \r\nsingle good design. They provide no guarantees that any changes in the system \r\nparameters (number of nodes, communication, power budget) will result in a system \r\nthat operates anywhere close to optimality.\r\n\r\nWith the proper choice of nodes and links, and the right topology and \r\ncommunication patterns within the high-performance sensor network, the cost/power/performance \r\nof the network can be substantially improved. A \r\ncombination of design-time and run-time decisions is required for the successful design \r\nand deployment of high-performance sensor networks because certain characteristics \r\nof the system will not be known until run time, \r\nand those characteristics may change during operation of the network. Furthermore, the \r\nconfiguration of the network may not be known at design time. The overall \r\nhardware and software architecture of the network must be designed to operate well not \r\njust at a single design point, but across a range of possible configurations and operating \r\ndecisions. This research seeks to balance the needs for optimizing the design and adapting its \r\noperation at run time by developing new design methods that find pareto-optimal regions \r\nin the design space. Pareto-optimality has been used to design small-scale embedded \r\nsystems, but this work improves on previous efforts in several ways: handling larger \r\nsystems, lower-variance design; analysis of run-time behavior; and inclusion of Monte-\r\nCarlo methods.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The methods developed in the research will directly enable\r\nsystems for security and a variety of industrial applications.  High-performance audio and \r\nvideo are especially important in security applications and distributed real-time \r\nprocessing of data will help to create security systems that can identify problems more \r\nquickly. Design tools, benchmark data, and lecture materials on distributed embedded systems\r\nwill be distributed over the web.",
