 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entitled CAREER: Functional Nanoscale Architectures by Self-Assembly aims to educate students in chemical approaches to nanoscience through an integration of educational and research objectives.  The thrust of the research is to design new types of monodisperse oligomers of overcrowded aromatics that can fold themselves into well-defined conformations. The synthesis of these multimers will be expanded to create monodisperse oligomers 8 to 20 subunits long.  Due to their unique structure these oligomers could provide new motifs for self-assembly in lipid bilayers and in bulk.  These oligomers will be investigated as one dimensional semiconductors and nanoscale piezoelectric elements.  Integrated within the research plan, is begin to modernize the chemistry curriculum to have the chemical elements of nanotechnology.  Proposed is an advanced organic chemistry lab for junior level undergraduates that would use organic synthesis and self-assembly as a tool to teach the concepts of polymer structure/function relationships, self-assembly/surface patterning, and liquid crystallinity.  Some of the web-based, multimedia modules and nanoscience laboratories created for undergraduate education will be used to reach underrepresented groups in New York area high schools.\r\n\r\nThis project will educate future scientists and engineers through a chemistry program that integrates both educational and research objectives.  The educational objectives will create web-based, multimedia modules and laboratory experiments to begin the modernization and revitalization of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  Some of the elements used in the undergraduate curriculum reform will be used to reach underrepresented groups in New York area high schools.  The research objectives in this proposal will train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research that designs, synthesizes, and studies new molecules that self-organize into novel structures. These unique oligomers could act as nanoscale wires, switches, and devices for energy conversion. This proposal is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry Division.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
