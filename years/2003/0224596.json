 "awd_abstract_narration": "Succinate has many industrial applications and it maybe used in the future as an intermediary commodity chemical feedstock for producing bulk chemicals.  Routinely produced from petrochemicals, succinate can also be produced by fermentation from glucose.  Developing a low-cost fermentation process with high succinate yields would create a new use for agricultural products.  The best succinate producer, Actinobacillus succinogenes, produces up to 100 g/l of succinate.  To engineer an A. succinogenes strain able to produce even more succinate at a higher chemical yield, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will determine which metabolic fluxes to target for genetic manipulation.  A system of linear stoichiometric equations (expressed as a matrix) will be built, based on A. succinogenes metabolic network.  Experimental data (i.e., fermentation balance, biomass production, and label distribution in succinate, formate, and acetate) collected from continuous cultures grown in the presence of 13 C-NaHCO3 or 2- 13 C-glucose will be fed into this stoichiometric matrix to calculate the fluxes in the different pathways.  Control exerted on flux distribution by different metabolic branches will be evaluated by growing cultures in a variety of conditions.  Each growth condition will differ from the optimized, standard conditions by a single parameter.  Parameters will include enzyme-specific inhibitors, different carbon sources, new enzyme activities (by introduction of recombinant genes), and added reducing power (by the intermediary of an electrically-reduced artificial electron carrier).  The conclusions drawn from these metabolic flux analyses should give insights on how to engineer A. succinogenes to produce more succinate.",
