 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue to use genomic resources known as cosmid libraries to study in detail the evolution of genes in the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) of birds.  The Mhc is a genetic locus associated with disease resistance and susceptibility in natural populations.  The evolutionary processes at this locus can be compared to processes in other vertebrate groups, in particular mammals, which are comprehensively studied as part of whole genome projects.  The genetic variability of loci within and outside of Mhc will also be studied in order to understand whether elevated levels of variability within Mhc is due to heterozygote advantage, as opposed levels in the non-coding, neutral regions.  Finally, the extent of genetic linkage between coding and non-coding regions will be analyzed. \r\n\r\nThe resources provided by cosmid libraries will permit a variety of population genetic studies in genetically less tractable songbird species. These studies will be important for understanding how a highly polymorphic, disease-associated locus varies in natural populations and the extent to which such loci influence the evolutionary trajectories of neutral loci that are physically close on the chromosome (hitchhiking). \r\n",
