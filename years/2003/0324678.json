 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal is to provide for participant support for high school students attending the\r\nMaterials Camp program during summer 2003. These camps are similar to the Materials\r\nCamp program funded in 2002 by NSF Engineering Division. The program provides\r\nhands-on learning in materials science and technology for high school students from\r\nacross the U.S. In 2003 two Materials Camp programs are planned, each for 30 students.\r\nThe two programs are to be held as follows:\r\nMaterials Camp West, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, July 7 - 13, 2003\r\nMaterials Camp East, Materials Park, OH, August 11 - 17, 2003\r\nThe curriculum of the camps includes engineering applications of metals, ceramics,\r\npolymers, composites and biomaterials. Students experience learning using both set\r\nlaboratory experiments and a team project in which they explore structure-property-\r\nprocessing-applications relationships in materials as related to engineering systems.\r\nEveryday materials systems are the foundation of the program, building to more\r\nadvanced applications. Professional society volunteers work with each team of five\r\nstudents to ensure real learning and motivation. The camp concludes with project\r\npresentations by the students to a professional audience.\r\nThe expected outcome of this project are a set of 60 students who are more\r\nknowledgeable of engineering and engineering applications, with specific experience in\r\nthe area of materials. Our evaluation of previous camps is very positive in convincing\r\nstudents to consider and enroll in engineering in college. Thus our expectation is that we\r\nwill be able to focus students on the advantages of engineering studies and thus increase\r\nengineering enrollments, not just among the students who attend but among their peers as\r\nwell.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal relates to the knowledge that these student will\r\nlearn. The students who attend the camp are generally the better students in a high\r\nschool. Most of them initially indicate that they are not interested in science or\r\nengineering, but rather other areas from art to social science to medicine. Using the\r\nfocused, hands-on approach of the camp program, our experience shows that the\r\nintellectual content of the camp excites them, thus broadening their thinking as to a career\r\nand future study.\r\nThe broader impact of the program provides these bright students with specific\r\nunderstanding of the potential of careers in engineering, provides a potential new set of\r\nstudents for science and enginering study, thus increasing the pool of U.S. students\r\ninterested in science and engineering. It also serves to broaden student understanding of\r\nthe field of materials, and demonstrates the centrality of materials to engineering and\r\nscience.",
