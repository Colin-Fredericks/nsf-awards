The larger sample will allow them to explore the halo/outer disk stellar population over a wide range of galactocentric distances by  determining the mean metallicity distribution function, the outer rotation curve, and the velocity dispersion of the halo.   Their study will focus on results for stars in the discrete streams of material in the halo that have been discovered recently from wide field imaging surveys.  Ultimately, their sample should allow them to assess the extent to which the disruption of satellite galaxies accreted by M31 has contributed to the formation of the halo population.  \r\n\r\nAll of the collaborators involve undergraduate and graduate students in their research efforts.  They expect to give public lectures and to speak in K-12 classrooms about their research and to make the results of their work accessible to the public.  They also plan to purchase a narrow band filter for work on the Ca infrared triplet, which will be made available to all users of the Keck telescopes.  \r\n",
