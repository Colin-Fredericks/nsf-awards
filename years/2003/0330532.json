In 2003, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 10-15, 2003 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire to discuss research activities in the following areas:  (1) the global carbon cycle and anthropogenic invasion; (2) how N and P cycles drive the ocean carbon cycle; (3) oceanic changes, climate variation and the marine carbon cycle; (4) the nature of marine organic carbon flux; (5) organic carbon production and cycling in the upper ocean; (6) carbon fluxes through the water column; (7) marine organic carbon cycling in the seabed; (8) hydrothermal vent chemistry; and (9) technological advances in marine carbon cycling..  The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and forge new scientific alliances.  For this reason the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 15 graduate students and 25 invited speakers in the 2003 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
