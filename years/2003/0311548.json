 "awd_abstract_narration": "With increasing data processing needs, many applications belonging\r\nto areas such as communication networks, computational biology,\r\ne-commerce, etc. require the processing of very large data sets under\r\ntime and space limitations.  This need makes it necessary to seek\r\nnew, more efficient algorithmic models involving resource restrictions.\r\nThe main objective of this project is to explore the tradeoffs between\r\nlimiting the computing resources (time, space, access to input) available\r\nto an algorithm and the resulting loss in accuracy and effectiveness.\r\nBy testing quantitative properties as well as qualitative ones, the link\r\nbetween the efficiency/effectiveness of property testing and those of\r\napproximation algorithms can be investigated.  To this end, this project\r\ninvolves devising sublinear algorithms for checking combinatorial\r\nproperties of various types of large data objects such as sequences,\r\ngraphs, and sets.  This task can be achieved through intelligent random\r\nsampling of the data,  minimizing the number of bits of the input that\r\nthe algorithm needs to access through either reusing samples or choosing\r\nsamples carefully so that each accessed bit yields as much information\r\nas possible about the input.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is in improving the understanding\r\nof resource-bounded computation on different types of large data.  The\r\nnew meta-techniques developed are expected to apply to a variety of\r\nproblems in different application areas which now see the processing of\r\ninput as a major bottleneck.  For students of computer science, these\r\ntechniques bring a new point of view to understanding the possibilities\r\nand limitations of computation as well as an understanding of data-related\r\nlimitations and bottlenecks of certain types of applications that need to\r\nbe addressed via unconventional models.\r\n",
