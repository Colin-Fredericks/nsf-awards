Matching  the  dynamic  response  of  conductivity  and  temperature  sensors  has  been  a  long-standing problem in the computation of salinity, and this tank offers a new approach to its solution.  This  project will  improve  the existing  tank,  evaluate  a  number  of  available CTDs., and provide improved algorithms for the estimation of salinity. The new tank uses a two-layer  salt-stratified  system 4.7 m  deep  that  is  heated  from below and cooled from above. This generates two convectively mixed layers with a thin double-diffusive interface separating them.  A temperature jump of 5-10 degrees C can be maintained over 1-2 cm (a vertical temperature gradient of order 103 degrees C/m) for ~2 weeks. A variable speed lowering system allows testing of the dynamic response of conductivity and temperature sensors in full-size  oceanographic instruments. An acoustic echo sounder and an optical shadowgraph system provide non-disruptive monitoring of the interface and layer microstructure.  Linear and nonlinear fitting routines have been developed to determine thermometer response times that are a strong function of the speed. A method for the optimal design of lag-correction filters, based on an imposed linearity of the conductivity-temperature relationship across the interface, has been developed to accurately match temperature and conductivity sensors for the computation of salinity. Sensor response characterization is especially important for autonomous instruments where data processing and compression must be  performed  in-situ,  but  is  also  helpful  in  the  development  of  new  sensors  and  in  assuring accurate salinity records from traditional wire-lowered and towed systems. This project will  implement  a number  of  improvements  to  the  tank,  evaluate  several  existing  CTDs, suggest improved algorithms for the computation of salinity and establish the tank as a dynamic response facility for use of the oceanographic community. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work stems in part from its contributions to the pressing societal need for improved ocean observations for climate change research. Also, the dynamic response facility  will  be  a  community-wide  resource  for  improving  the  state-of-the  art  in  salinity observations for both the profit and non-profit sectors. Finally, it will continue to utilize and train graduate and undergraduate students in its operations.    \r\n",
