 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The National Research Council calls for all students to learn science \"through methods and processes of inquiry\".  The Muhlenberg College Physics Department offers inquiry-based courses for humanities and social science students.  The Physics of Music also serves this population. The course explores the scientific bases for the observable phenomena of the art of music.  The course is an adaptation of many resources including a module from Workshop Physics developed by Priscilla Laws, and web resources such as http://faculty.millikin.edu/~jaskill.nsm.faculty.mu/musicinfo.html, and Reginald Bain's, \"A Web-based Multimedia Approach to the Harmonic Series\" published in 2002 CMS/ATMI Conference, ATMI Program Kansas City, MO.\r\n\r\nThe course provides an attractive entry point to exploring rigorous scientific principles, by sparking student curiosity and encouraging a scientific approach to problem solving which can be applied across the curriculum.  The active-learning approach of this inquiry-based course develops technological literacy through use of current technology for experimental observation. Classroom assessments developed by an evaluator measure the students' abilities to connect abstract concepts with concrete examples from the world of sound. \r\n \r\nThe course is designed and taught by professors from the two disciplines, physics and music.  By demonstrating that concepts in physics may be applied to music through activities that relate to students' everyday experiences of listening to music, the course enhances student learning.  Project results are disseminated through conference presentations and articles.  The course offers a novel and engaging approach to science and technology that can be embraced by other liberal arts institutions.   \r\n",
