 "awd_abstract_narration": "1. The purpose of this project is to enhance our understanding of fundamental problems in\r\nstatistical mechanics and probability theory through the use of mathematical methods\r\ninvolving supersymmetry and the renormalization group. Of particular interest are\r\nstatistical models with a geometrical flavor, such as branched polymers and self-avoiding\r\nwalks. Basic questions for these models involve, for example, determining the rate at\r\nwhich the size of a sample grows with the number of monomers or steps. Such divergences\r\nare governed by critical exponents. The values of the exponents may be determined in one\r\nof two ways, either through dimensional reduction (which relates exponents to known\r\nexponents in related systems in fewer dimensions), or through the renormalization group\r\n(which calculates the flow of couplings with the length scale as the microscopic\r\nstructures of the problem are averaged out). Supersymmetry plays an important role in\r\nboth methods.\r\nSpecific goals are: (a) to continue to develop a mathematical theory of dimensional\r\nreduction and apply it to new models, such as directed branched polymers; and (b) to\r\nconstruct an exact renormalization group flows for such systems.\r\n2. Research activities in this proposal will involve collaborations and exchanges of\r\nideas with mathematicians and physicists in a wide range of fields, including probability,\r\nanalysis, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory. Graduate student support, and\r\ngraduate student participation in scientific meetings, will integrate research and\r\neducation and help train a new generation of mathematicians in the methods of field\r\ntheory, supersymmetry, and the renormalization group. These activities will in the long\r\nrun lead to enhanced interaction between mathematics and physics and to new ideas in both\r\nfields.",
