 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint project between the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) and San Jacinto College North (SJCN) designed to: (1) enhance the undergraduate learning environment in science and technology; (2) establish a bridge program to facilitate successful transfer from the community college (SJCN) to the university (UHD); (3) motivate students, especially women and minorities, to pursue careers and graduate degrees in science beginning with increasing the number of students earning associate, baccalaureate, and graduate degrees in areas of natural science and science-based technologies (e.g. biotechnology); (4) promote both on-campus and off-campus student participation in research; and (5) provide students with growing opportunities to explore the interdisciplinary nature of science and its applications in society.  Financial assistance is being made available to undergraduate students, particularly to first-time-in-college students, many of whom are economically disadvantaged and cannot otherwise enroll as full time college students. First-time freshmen majoring in science also often require effective mentoring. Our STEP project is centered around activities associated with the new and innovative Scholars Academy (SA) of the College of Science & Technology (CST) at UHD.  It is facilitating the  establishment of cooperative 2+2 programs in science and technology, including both student and faculty activities, such as sharing faculty and facilities and the establishment of cooperative programs with local and national industrial and government laboratories for student experiential-based learning. Through these activities we are recruiting and retaining more students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).  The broader impact of this project is based on its success in encouraging more minorities and females (most of whom are first-time students) to pursue and complete STEM associate and baccalaureate degrees and continue their education at the graduate level or obtain STEM- related employment. Both UHD and SJCN are providing sufficient facilities, financial, and personnel support to ensure the success of the project and ensure its sustainability. In achieving the goals of the project, UHD and SJCN are making maximum use of student peer interactions, faculty/student STEM-related activities and projects, and the many STEM resources available in the Houston area and nationally. The results of this project will be disseminated statewide through the Texas Coordinating Board for Higher Education and the UHD and SJCN websites, and by presenting papers at national STEM and STEM education meetings.",
