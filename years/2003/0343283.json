 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will undertake department level reform at Lehigh University to establish a cross-disciplinary bioengineering program with an entrepreneurship focus.\r\n\r\nThis program will provide students with a balance of science, humanity, technical and business foundation through an integrated experiential learning curriculum that includes traditional classroom lectures, research, industry, clinical and business internships, co-ops and projects.  Built on Lehigh's tradition in undergraduate engineering education, the close relationships with existing departments, as well as, expand partnerships with regional hospitals, medical schools and biotechnology industry.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop 1) a rigorous curriculum that emphasizes hands-on experiential learning, entrepreneurial and business aspects, 2) advanced laboratories for undergraduate teaching and research, 3)o cultivate industrial partnerships to mentor students and provide real-\r\nworld problems through entrepreneurial projects. A very detailed method for implementation has been prepared involving developing a recruiting, admission, and advising plan that will be integrated throughout Lehigh.  Internal and external evaluation of the project will document results and add to the body of knowledge on how students learn bioengineering.\r\n\r\nThe program will have a local, regional and national economic impact through the placement of our students in successful start-ups and national and globally recognized biotechnology firms.  The success of implementing this bioengineering program at Lehigh will serve as a national model for universities and colleges that are strong in science, engineering, design and business but are without a medical school.\r\n",
