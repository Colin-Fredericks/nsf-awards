Arnold\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is\r\ninitiating a program to partner with established academic\r\nmathematicians who seek to increase the impact of their research\r\nand to take up research problems in areas of significant\r\napplication.  The New Directions program consists of two major\r\nactivities: the New Directions Visiting Professorships, which\r\nwill support established academic mathematicians to visit the IMA\r\nfor a period of several months, immersing themselves in the\r\nannual thematic program, learning new mathematics and\r\napplications, connecting their research with important problems,\r\nand establishing new contacts and collaborations; and the New\r\nDirections Short Courses, two-week intensive courses for\r\nmathematics faculty members that address active and developing\r\nareas of application.  The first short course in June 2003 is\r\ndevoted to Cellular Physiology.\r\n\r\nThe primary mission of the Institute for Mathematics and its\r\nApplications (IMA) is to increase the impact of mathematics by\r\nfostering interdisciplinary research, linking mathematics of the\r\nhighest caliber and important scientific and technological\r\nproblems from other disciplines and industry.  This award to the\r\nIMA helps support visitors who are established researchers in\r\nmathematics and who seek to broaden their research into emerging\r\nareas of application.  Information about upcoming programs,\r\nselection criteria for New Directions professorships and\r\nworkshops, and application forms are available on the World Wide\r\nWeb at http://www.ima.umn.edu/.\r\n",
