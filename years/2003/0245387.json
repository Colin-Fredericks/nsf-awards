More precisely, the investigator connects\r\nspecial values of L-functions of varieties or motives to the orders of\r\nassociated Selmer groups. In joint work with E. Urban the investigator\r\nshowed that if the L-function of a modular form of weight 1 vanishes to\r\nodd order at its central critical point then the rank of the corresponding\r\nSelmer group is infinite. The investigator is exploring extensions to\r\nrepresentations of higher dimension and to pursuing a ``mod p''\r\nversion of this result relating the p-adic order of the L-value (if\r\nfinite) to that of its Selmer group. Additionally, the investigator is\r\ncompleting work in collaboration with M. Harris and J.-S. Li that\r\nconstructs p-adic anti-cyclotomic L-function for automorphic\r\nrepresentations on unitary groups U(n) and which makes progress towards\r\nanti-cyclotomic ``main conjectures'' for these groups. Doing so involves\r\nrelating these L-functions to congruences between endoscopic and stable\r\nautomorphic forms on U(n). The investigator is also pursuing an approach\r\nto the ``main conjecture'' for modular forms on GL(2) by studying the\r\narithmetic of certain Eisenstein series on U(2,2).\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber theory is often divided into two branches: analytic and algebraic.\r\nThe investigator is studying the connection between many seemingly\r\nunrelated objects from these two branches. The primary focus of the first\r\nbranch is the study of L-functions - complex functions built of\r\nnumber-theoretically interesting data (such as the Riemann zeta function\r\nwhich is built out of the prime numbers). The other branch focuses on\r\nalgebraic objects such as class groups. But it is now expected that these\r\nare not unrelated: values of certain L-functions at special points\r\n(generally integers) should be the orders - the sizes - of certain of the\r\nalgebraic objects. Such connections are generally very signifigant.\r\nOne instance was a crucial ingredient in Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's\r\nLast Theorem, for example. Drawing from the theory of automorphic forms,\r\nthe investigator's work establishes new instances of these conjectures.\r\nThis work is motivated by the fact that special values of L-functions\r\nappear in the fourier coefficients of modular forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
