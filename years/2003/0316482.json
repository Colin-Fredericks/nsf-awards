 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gerald Meyer of Johns Hopkins University is supported by the Division of Chemistry for his research to design molecular materials that convert visible light into potential energy and store that energy for a long period of time. Prof. Meyer will utilize steady-state and time-resolved electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques to characterize events occurring after metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excitation of Fe(II) coordination compounds integrated and spatially arranged within sol-gel processed thin film materials, comprised of the wide band gap semiconductor TiO2 or the insulator ZrO2. Specifically he aims to elucidate the role ligand field (d-d) excited states play in non-radiative decay and photochemical ligand loss.  Important fundamental mechanistic questions relevant to the growing applications of Fe(II) compounds in biology, chemistry, and materials science will be studied systematically.  \r\n\r\nIdentifying materials that efficiently convert light into energy is a significant long-term research goal.  This research will probe molecular level processes that have historically limited the utility of iron compounds for energy conversion applications.  The research will contribute to our fundamental understanding of molecular events occurring at semiconductor and insulator interfaces in order that we might control them in a predictable manner.   Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training and research experiences in a forefront inorganic materials chemistry program.",
