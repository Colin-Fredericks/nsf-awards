 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides partial funding for the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on RNA Editing, to be held January 19-24 at the Holiday Inn in Ventura, California.  This meeting has occurred in alternate years since 1997 and is the only existing meeting devoted exclusively to the field of RNA editing.  The meeting serves as the venue where researchers present important and exciting breakthroughs in the field, and recent meetings have featured reports ranging from the development of the first in vitro systems for studying RNA editing in plant organelles, to the first demonstration that RNA editing is crucial for proper neuronal function in mice, flies, and worms.  Because the meeting is the only regularly scheduled meeting in the field, it is the primary means by which young researchers are exposed to other scientists in the field.  Typically, about 40%of the attendees at the RNA Editing GRC are postdoctoral trainees and graduate students. As is typical of Gordon Research Conferences, the 2003 RNA Editing meeting will be conducted in a relaxed setting that fosters informal discussion between participants.   Speakers will be selected based on the significance and quality of their recent scientific contributions, as well as with the goal of achieving diversity among age, gender, and ethnicity.  All attendees will be invited to present a poster and, funds permitting, travel awards will be made to select graduate students and postdoctoral applicants.",
