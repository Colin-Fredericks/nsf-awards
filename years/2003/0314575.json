 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feng, Milner, Minchella\r\n     The interactions between parasitic trematodes and their\r\ninvertebrate and vertebrate hosts are complex.  Models of these\r\ninteracting systems are similarly complex in order to capture\r\nbiologically relevant features of the systems.  Advances for many\r\nquestions in this area face difficulties in part because of the\r\nlarge number of parameters involved in the models and because of\r\nthe limited data available.  The investigators combine the\r\ntheoretical and empirical experience of a parasitologist and the\r\nmodeling and theoretical expertise of mathematicians to develop\r\nand investigate these models.  The work of this project is\r\nthreefold: first, new models are proposed for host-parasite\r\ninteractions, with more complex models motivated by biological\r\nconsiderations and newly available data; second, a study of some\r\nmathematical properties of each model is carried out and their\r\nbiological and ecological implications assessed, such as parasite\r\npopulation control or potential species extinction; third,\r\nvalidation of the models through comparison of model results with\r\nfield data follows.\r\n     The goal of the project is to develop a theoretical\r\nframework for the study of questions associated with\r\nhost-parasite interactions.  A particular host-parasite system is\r\nused, human-schistosome-snail (macroparasitic disease), to\r\nhighlight the generality of our approach.  Specific objectives are\r\nto develop mathematical models to understand the role of various\r\ncomponents of host-parasite interactions in the disease\r\ntransmission dynamics, to determine which biological details are\r\ncritical components in the model, to construct and analyze\r\nappropriate models in which the parameters are readily related to\r\nfield data, and to provide useful information for field workers\r\nand policy makers in public health.  The project significantly\r\nadvances our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of\r\nhost-parasite systems that include intermediate hosts, by\r\nproviding usable models to study natural systems, by analyzing\r\ntheir sensitivity to the parameters affecting the dynamics, and\r\nby allowing structuring of the complexities of the systems into\r\nhierarchies.  Just as important is the possibility to help address\r\nsome of the theoretical issues in the control of schistosomiasis\r\nvia chemotherapy.\r\n\r\n",
