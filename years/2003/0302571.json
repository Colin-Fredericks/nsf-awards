 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the purchase of a fluorescence spectrometer interfaced with a fluorescence microscope. The system will be capable of nanosecond resolution.  Planned uses include measurements of fluorescence with high sensitivity and over wide ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths; spectral and lifetime measurements on long-lived luminescence; and time-resolved measurements of fluorescence anisotropy of chemical and cellular samples.  The spectrometer will serve the research needs of nine users from a total of four University departments, all of whom conduct research in NSF-supported areas.  Research projects that will take advantage of the instrument include studies of the motion of water at biological interfaces, of the regulation of a microtubule motor protein from Arabidopsis, of the organization of luteinizing hormone receptors, and of molecular mechanisms controlling progesterone secretion. The instrument will also be used to develop optical strategies for detecting weak magnetic fields and for improvement of methods for measuring molecular rotation in membranes.  The shared use of the equipment will facilitate interaction and collaboration between researchers in diverse fields, and will also promote teaching, training and learning through use in specific undergraduate and graduate courses.  In addition, the researchers plan to incorporate the results of instrument use into a variety of formal and informal activities that disseminate information about modern science to various audiences.",
