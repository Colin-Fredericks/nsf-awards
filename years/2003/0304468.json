 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to explore flexible synthesis of AlGaInN-based nanowires by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), to investigate transport properties in low-dimensional systems (one- and zero-dimensional), and to demonstrate novel AlGaInN\r\nnanostructures and devices. Recent results observed in our laboratories, in both\r\noptoelectronic and electronic devices, suggested that nanostructures made from wide\r\nbandgap AlGaInN semiconductors are relatively insensitive to surface effects and uniquely suitable as a test bed for nanoscale science and technology. Built upon our core competency in nanoelectronics (Prof. Mark Reed) and synthesis of wide bandgap semiconductors (Prof. Jung Han) at Yale University, we intend to venture into a new frontier of nanostructures using wide bandgap III-N nanowires. Issues that will be investigated include: 1) MOCVD synthesis of AlGaInN nanowires, 2) Electronic transport and optical properties along AlGaInN nanowires, 3) Growth and demonstration of nanowire heterostructures and bipolar devices, and 4) Quantum transport in 1D\r\nheterostructure nanowires, such as superlattices and resonant tunneling structures.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This work places emphasis on epitaxial science in understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic processes pertinent to the synthesis of nanostructures.\r\nThe analysis of one- and zero-dimensional nanoscale heterostructures will test and expand the current understanding in nucleation and strained epitaxy. The characterizations of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices prepared by MOCVD are expected to offer insights on the operation of conventional semiconductor devices in the quantum regime.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The choice of III-Nitride semiconductors, a family uniquely suited for its mechanical robustness, chemical inertness (absence of surface states), and functional versatility, is expected to lead to concrete demonstrations of nanodevices in phtonics and electronics. The knowledge concerning the modern synthesis and behavior of nanostructures acquired in this work will inject a new dimension of opportunities for the III-Nitride community.\r\n",
