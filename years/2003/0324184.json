 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this project is the achievement of baccalaureate degrees in computer science, engineering, and mathematics by academically talented but financially needy students. The project achieves this goal by:\r\n1) Providing financial aid to academically talented, financially needy students through 32 scholarships with an annual value of $2,500 over a two-year period;\r\n2) Improving education in CSEM disciplines by creating supportive environments for these students through changes in organizational culture and practices;\r\n3) Increasing retention of students to degree achievement by encouraging preparation for CSEM careers through student development initiatives;\r\n4) Improving professional development and employment of students by providing enriched research experiences, mentoring, and support in employment placement; and\r\n5) Strengthening university-industry partnerships through collaborative implementation.\r\n\r\nThe project is a collaboration of the College of Engineering, College of Science, Teledyne Brown Engineering, and the Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). The project receives continued support from Teledyne Brown Engineering; serves a region of the Deep South with a large pool of eligible students; and enhances Huntsville, Alabama, a growing technology-based city.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on the success of prior CSEMS support that University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) received under Award No. 0094906 in 2000. UAH envisions broader impact by retaining CSEM Scholars who are transfer students at a rate that is 20 percent greater than a comparable transfer cohort; retaining CSEM Scholars who are continuing students at a rate that is 20 percent greater than a comparable cohort of continuing UAH students; and attaining a placement rate of CSEM Scholars in CSEM jobs or graduate school at a rate of at least 90 percent within three months of graduation. \r\n",
