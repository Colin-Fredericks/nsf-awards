The strain is probated through a mechanism of twin boundary motion as opposed to domain growth as seen in traditional magnetostrictive materials such as Terfenol-D.  Strain levels comparable to commercially available Shape Memory Alloys (SMA's) such as NiTi have been observed.   However, FSMA materials hold greater promise as actuators since their magnetically induced strain allows for higher operating frequencies than the slow actuation (10 Hz) of traditional SMA's.  Research will focus on applications of FSMA material towards transduction needs such as high power sonar, noise reduction, and anti-vibration mounts and structures.  In addition Professor Greg Carman will visit with East Asian researchers to generate collaborative efforts between the United States and East Asia.\r\n",
