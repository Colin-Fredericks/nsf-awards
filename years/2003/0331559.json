 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drexel University, as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for \r\nMinority Participation (Philadelphia AMP), seeks continued funding as an AMP Phase III project, to intensify its \r\non-going efforts to substantially increase the quantity and quality of African American, Hispanic and Native \r\nAmerican students receiving baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), \r\nand subsequently, entering graduate school to attain doctoral degrees.  Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse \r\nalliance of public and private, 2- and 4-year, research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities \r\n(HBCUs) and majority institutions.  \r\n \r\nA salient feature of this proposal is the fundamental manner in which the proposed AMP Phase III project \r\nrests on a solid foundation of partnerships, resources, effective practices and experience derived from eight years of \r\ncollaboration, cooperation and concerted efforts focused on minority student achievement under the current \r\nPhiladelphia AMP Phase II project.  Over the past eight years of Philadelphia AMP.s existence, the Alliance has \r\ncontributed over $7.9 million in matching funds to the project through the use of college/university, foundation, \r\nstate government, and corporate funds.  As a result of Philadelphia AMP.s efforts, a mechanism has been developed \r\nto catalyze changes in institutional, departmental, and organizational culture and the practices that will result in \r\nsignificant increases in recruitment, retention, STEM degree production, and graduate school entry for all students. \r\nIn support of this AMP Phase III project, 170 tenured STEM faculty, academic department heads, and senior \r\nadministrative personnel from the 9 member institutions will actively participate in recruiting, advising and \r\nmentoring AMP students. In this proposal \"minority\" refers to African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. \r\n",
