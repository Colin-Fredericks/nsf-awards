 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0301095\r\nJ. Scott Carter\r\n\r\nIn previous work, the principal investigator constructed a highly \r\nnontrivial filtration of the knot concordance group, indexed by the \r\nheight of gropes embedded in the 4-ball, and partially detected by \r\nvon Neumann's continuous dimension. The resulting graded group \r\nremains unknown, and the principal investigator proposes various \r\napproaches to uncover the structure of this group. Related questions \r\nabout link concordance and embedding problems of 2-spheres into \r\n4-manifolds can also be studied by these methods.\r\nIn the second part of the project, the principal investigator is \r\nattempting to give a geometric definition of elliptic cohomology in \r\nterms of a modification of Segal's \"elliptic objects\". These are \r\nconformal field theories parametrized by a topological space X, in \r\nparticular to each circle in X they associate a Hilbert space. For \r\nmore than 15 years, Segal's approach could not be turned into a \r\ncohomology theory because of the failure of the Mayer-Vietoris \r\nprinciple. The new idea is to apply the fusion of bimodules of von \r\nNeumann algebras, developed by Connes, to make the conformal field \r\ntheory \"local in X\". Fusion is used to decompose the Hilbert space \r\nwhenever the corresponding circle in X is decomposed. Such a local \r\ntheory should then satisfy all the  axioms of a cohomology theory.\r\n\r\nBoth parts of the project relate notions from theoretical physics to \r\nmathematics. Historically, the converse relation was more common, \r\nwhere a mathematical notion (like Riemannian geometry or functional \r\nanalysis) was used to explain a physical theory (like relativity or \r\nquantum mechanics). In the last decades, surprising mathematical \r\npredictions (provable only in very rare cases) came out of \r\nconsiderations in theoretical physics (like quantum gravity or \r\nconformal field theory). It is thus of the ultimate importance for \r\nmathematical research to incorporate such considerations into the \r\nbody of well understood theories.\r\nIn the first part of this project, the principal investigator \r\nproposes to continue his successful study of 4-dimensional manifolds \r\n(most relevant in relativity) via techniques originally proposed by \r\nvon Neumann for the study of quantum mechanics. In the second part, \r\nthe principal investigator proposes to refine the notion of a \r\nconformal field theory so that it leads to a geometrical definition \r\nof \"elliptic cohomology\". This cohomology is an enormously successful \r\ntool in mathematics and the proposed refinement has the potential to \r\nlead to a topological understanding of all conformal field theories.\r\n",
