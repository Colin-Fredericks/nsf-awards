 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0305704\r\nPetra Taylor and Ed Taylor\r\n\r\nThis collaborative proposal details a program that the\r\nresearchers are pursuing to extract geometric, analytic and\r\ndynamic information concerning discrete groups of quasiconformal\r\nmappings acting on a compact metric space. The researchers'\r\nprogram consists of three ``themes'': The first theme concerns\r\ncertain geometric properties of Kleinian groups that are induced\r\nfrom the existence of the ergodic Liouville measure on the unit\r\ntangent bundle of a geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold. A\r\nprimary goal is to pair Liouville theory with quasiconformal\r\ndeformation theory to the extent that it is revealing of the\r\ngeometry of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures\r\nuniformizing a compact co-infinite hyperbolizable three-manifold.\r\nThe second theme details an ongoing program to show that various\r\nanalytical, dynamical and topological properties of Kleinian\r\ngroups (e.g. the exponent of convergence, Hausdorff dimension,\r\nporosity, etc.) illuminate the action of the group when the group\r\nin question is  generalized to a discrete convergence group. In\r\nthis setting the researchers are primarily concerned with\r\ndiscrete quasiconformal groups. The third theme centers around\r\ncertain non-equivariant interactions between complex analysis and\r\nhyperbolic geometry; it generalizes the first two themes. The\r\nmotivating question is: How does the asymptotic geometry of the\r\nconvex hull boundary of a Jordan curve reflect the conformal\r\ngeometry of the curve? Under various stronger assumptions the\r\nresearchers are investigating aspects of this question from both\r\na geometric and analytic perspective.\r\n\r\nThe research described in this proposal resides at the\r\nintersection between hyperbolic geometry and conformal analysis.\r\nThese topics form a vast and fundamental area of study in\r\nmathematics which dates back to the 18th century, when it was\r\ndeveloped by such mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Klein,\r\nand Poincare. Though this proposal does not directly address\r\nphysics, we note that both hyperbolic geometry and conformal\r\nanalysis (especially in the guise of Teichmuller theory) have\r\nfound recent spectacular application in theoretical physics and\r\ncosmology. The proposers are dedicated researchers and educators,\r\nand Boston College and Wesleyan University both have strong dual\r\nidentities as teaching and research institutions. An innovative\r\ncomponent of the proposal is to use its multi disciplinary nature\r\nto introduce motivated undergraduates to areas of mathematics\r\nthat are currently not well represented (e.g. geometry and\r\nanalysis) in the undergraduate degree programs at the proposers'\r\nrespective institutions.  The researchers propose to initiate and\r\nmaintain a ``Joint Boston College - Wesleyan University Working\r\nGroups for Undergraduates and Beginning Graduate Students,'' in\r\npart to entice talented undergraduates into consideration of a\r\ncareer in mathematical research.",
