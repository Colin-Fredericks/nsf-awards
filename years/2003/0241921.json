These include diversity, spatial multiplexing and interference reduction. Wireless standards bodies are incorporating space-time techniques into new standards. However, many existing wireless systems such as GSM and IS-95 rely on a single transmit and receive antenna (SISO) and therefore cannot benefit from space-time technology. This proposal aims to develop a novel approach that brings many of the benefits of space-time technology to SISO wireless by introducing an intermediate node with multiple receive and multiple transmit antennas. We characterize a SISO link with an intermediate node as a SI(MM)SO link. In such links, there is also the possibility of a SISO link bypass to the SI(MM)SO link. \r\n\r\nThe research objectives are \r\n \r\n1.  Characterizing Shannon channel capacity of SI(MM)SO channels with bypass. \r\n2.  Space-time processing schemes at the intermediate node. \r\n3.  Extensions of the SI(MM)SO idea to MIMO channels. \r\n \r\nWhile theoretical work is the primary goal of this proposal, experimental support is available and can help measure real SI(MM)SO channels. \r\n \r\n \r\n",
