 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Daniel B. Oerther of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Cincinnati to host an international workshop of environmental microbiologists, engineers and students at the University Ibn Tofail, Kenitra, Morocco.  This international workshop is a direct follow-up of a workshop held previously at NSF headquarters in the Spring of 2002 (BES-0116929), the purpose of which was for U.S. researchers to explore the value of applying molecular biological tools in the field of environmental engineering.  The theme of the Morocco workshop will be using state-of-the-art molecular techniques to track microorganisms in the environment.  The specific objectives of the international workshop include: teaching state-of-the-art technology to young researchers; transferring technology to potential collaborators; and exploring opportunities for international collaboration to better tackle local issues facing environmental health in Morocco as well as global issues in environmental microbiology.  Approximately ten U.S. university faculty members specializing in environmental microbiology will visit Morocco, present their research results and give talks on molecular techniques for the detection of microorganisms in the environment to potential international collaborators and their students.  The Morocco workshop will also provide researchers from the U.S. with an opportunity to interact with and learn from colleagues abroad.  \r\n\r\nThe 2-day international workshop will serve as a lecture and discussion-based introduction for a two-week hands-on training course sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  Involving environmental microbiologists from the U.S. in this broader training effort demonstrates a commitment by the U.S. to be actively involved in technology transfer and the exchange of intellectual capital in this part of the world.  One of the broader impacts of this effort is the emphasis on bringing female faculty in environmental microbiology from the U.S. to Morocco.  By involving women in this international effort, Dr. Oerther also hopes to elevate the visibility of women scientists in parts of the world where role models for women in science are less common.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
