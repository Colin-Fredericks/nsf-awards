 "awd_abstract_narration": "0238765   Li   The rapidly growing electronic waste (E-waste) stream consisting of such items as obsolete computers, TVs, printers, and cell phones has raised an unprecedented challenge for environmental protection. E-waste already constitutes 2-5% of the municipal solid waste (MSW) in the U.S., and its volume is increasing three times faster than the MSW stream. Most components in the E-waste stream contain toxic substances including heavy metals and halogenated organics. Currently, the majority of E-waste is either stored in homes and offices waiting for disposal or dumped in landfills without proper treatment. This poses potential hazards to human health and the environment. The objectives of this project are to quantify the leaching potential of the toxicants from the popular components in the E-waste stream and to develop a high-pressure compaction pretreatment method for reducing their leaching toxicity.  Extensive experimental study, theoretical analysis and modeling will be included. Integration of education and research activity is emphasized in this project.\r\nThe implementation of this project will result in significant new knowledge and data on the potential hazards of E-waste. The experimental methods, models, and theories developed through this project will be valuable for researchers and legislators to understand the mechanism of E-waste pollution and to develop environmentally-sound E-waste management systems This project will provide an excellent education and training opportunity for students of all levels from K-12 to graduate and will greatly enhance the engineering education at one of the nation's largest historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) Jackson State University (JSU).  JSU is also an EPSCoR institution designated by NSF.  The majority of JSU students are African Americans who are underrepresented, especially in engineering education and practice. The School of Engineering at JSU was just launched in fall 2000 and currently has only two departments. This project will help strengthen the newborn engineering program at JSU and attract minority students to participate in engineering education. The new environmental labs will be enhanced and the engineering courses will be enriched by integrating the research and teaching and by incorporating the findings of this project in the syllabi and lectures. The dissemination of the findings of this project will raise the awareness of the public and promote environmentally conscious practices in handling E-waste to benefit society at large.\r\n",
