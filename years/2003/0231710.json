 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new surface derivatized reactive nanoparticles. These nanoparticles  are expected to be highly active adsorbents and should be important in a number of applications. In the project, attention will be focused on preparing nanoparticles containing Lewis acid or base centers. The chemical modification involves introducing Lewis acidic boron or Lewis basic alkoxy functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles. It is expected that introduction of such sites should enhance the adsorptive capability and the destructive ability of the nanoparticles appreciably. In particular, boron, by virtue of its affinity for electronegative atoms (in nerve agents) and the thio group (in mustard agent and nerve agent VX) should bind and help pull these agents quickly through the nanoparticles. Lewis basic sites should enhance the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticles thereby promoting destruction of agents by reactions such as elimination and/or hydrolysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercially, these materials will find application in both civilian and military markets; for example, in civilan markets as adsorbents in air filters for various industrial toxic agents, scrubbing agents for raw natural gas and as novel catalysts. Militarily, the new nanoparticles will provide  faster and more efficient decontamination of chemical warfare agents and environmental toxins.\r\n",
