 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to provide this deep understanding of server behavior during overload, in the\r\ncase of both static and dynamic content. The approach is interdisciplinary: There is a theoretical\r\ncomponent which aims to prove new theorems on M/G/1 queues with time-dependent load; an implementation\r\ncomponent which performs a rigorous systematic study of web server and database server\r\nperformance under overload as a function of various networking parameters; and a workload and client\r\ncharacterization component which aims to understand statistical properties of the request stream during\r\ntransient overload and incorporate these into the design of a web workload generator for overload.\r\nThis proposal also introduces a very simple idea for improving the performance of web servers\r\nunder overload: a kernel-based implementation of SRPT connection scheduling. The idea is simple\r\nand intuitive. Connection scheduling does not require purchasing more hardware, or any other costly\r\nsystem upgrades. It appears to allow the server to survive much longer periods of overload, and to allow\r\nclients to experience better performance during these periods of overload. Furthermore, it appears\r\nto enable the server to recuperate from overload much faster. The proposal will provide a detailed\r\nevaluation of the benefits of SRPT connection scheduling and will aim to introduce similar scheduling\r\npolicies for databases. The above concludes the intellectual merit portion of the proposal.\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include online availability of all source\r\ncode generated during the project including modifications to the Apache code and to Linux, as well\r\nas online availability of all trace logs collected during this project, and a web workload generator for\r\noverload. The project initiates collaborations across various academic disciplines including: mathematics,\r\ncomputer systems, and operations management, as well as between universities and industry.\r\nThe project will also provide a research opportunity for a minority undergraduate student.\r\nThe proposal involves 1 faculty member (1 summer month only), 1.5 graduate students, and 1\r\nundergraduate, over the course of 3 years.",
