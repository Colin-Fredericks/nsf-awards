 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, \"Nano-Scale Engineering,\" at the University of Kentucky, under the direction of Dr. M. Pinar Menguc, is funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).  The objective of this project is to establish a novel \"Nano-Scale Engineering Certificate Program,\" (NECP) for undergraduate engineering students at the University of Kentucky (UK).  This will be the first time that a certificate program will be offered in a comprehensive way to educate undergraduate engineering students about nanotechnology.  It is expected that the NECP will enhance not only the level of nano-scale education in the College Engineering, but also foster a series of new interdisciplinary research programs around the Campus.\r\n\r\nStudents enrolling the the NECP will be required to take a total of six courses on nanotechnology and attend two semenster-long seminar courses.  Four of the required six courses will be lecture courses addressing both theoretical and fabrication fundamentals as related to nano-scale processes.  The other two courses will be hands-on laboratory courses, and will be in addition o the minimum required courses which are counted towards graduation. In addition, the students will be given the opportunity to participate in the research activities within the laboratories of five core faculty members as well as those carrying out cutting-edge research in other UK departments.  Finally, the students will be exposed to the novel ideas presented during the seminar courses.",
