In the class of closed, positively curved manifolds, there\r\nare few restrictions, most of which are classical, such as the\r\nBonnet-Myers and Synge theorems. For closed, simply connected manifolds,\r\nthere is essentially just Gromov's theorem bounding the total Betti number\r\nin a given dimension. Given that there are few known obstructions, it is\r\nfrustrating that the set of known examples, although infinite, is\r\nrelatively small. My research is concerned with understanding the geometry\r\nand topology of the known examples. More specifically, the goals are: 1)\r\nto attempt to find new examples of positively curved manifolds by studying\r\nmore general metrics on biquotients (in collaboration with J.-H.\r\nEschenburg), 2) to compute the isometry groups for the known cohomogeneity\r\none manifolds of positive curvature and 3) to see whether the\r\n7-dimensional Berger space is diffeomorphic to a 3-sphere bundle over the\r\n4-sphere (in collaboration with N. Kitchloo).\r\n\r\nRiemannian geometry arose from trying to understand curvature. \r\nIntuitively, we know that tabletops are flat while basketballs and saddles\r\nare curved.  Geometers are able to quantify curvature precisely and it\r\nprovides a numerical invariant that helps distinguish objects.  For\r\ninstance, the surface of a doughnut and the surface of a coffee cup have\r\nthe same nature i.e., they are both surfaces with one hole, but they are\r\nshaped differently. On the other hand, the surface of a ball (usually\r\ncalled a sphere) is different in shape and nature from the surface of a\r\ndoughnut (usually called a torus). How can we be sure that this is always\r\nthe case? One may wonder if it is possible to deform the sphere suitably\r\nso that we might end up with the torus. A sphere has positive curvature\r\neverywhere while it can be shown that no matter what shape a torus takes,\r\nit will always have zero curvature somewhere. This tells us that the two\r\nobjects are somehow fundamentally different from each other.  Differential\r\ngeometry is also the language used to express the general theory of\r\nrelativity, our best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on\r\nthe universe. In general relativity, a vacuous space-time universe would\r\nbe inherently flat. This idealized state is warped by the presence of\r\nmasses or energy, Thus, gravity is the curvature in space-time, and by\r\nunderstanding the geometry of Lorentzian space-time, one may some day\r\nunderstand the shape of the universe. My work involves the study of\r\npositively curved objects in higher dimensions. This is part of trying to\r\nunderstand how the structure imposed by curvature (geometry) is essential\r\nto understanding the nature (topology) of an object and vice versa.\r\n",
