The Division also sponsors a 10-week summer basic science research program for undergraduate students to participate in research projects in the fields of cellular and molecular biology.  Objectives of the Cellular and Molecular Biology REU are to: (a) increase knowledge of basic biological research (b) develop students' interest in pursuing biological science research careers: (c) enhance related skills necessary for success; and (d) provide post-program advising and networking.  Participants are recruited from a nation-wide pool, with particular emphasis on recruiting students who are interested in careers in research and on recruiting women and members of under-represented minority groups.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to their research projects, program objectives are attained as students participate in weekly student-faculty research discussions at which they teach each other about their projects, and in a weekly career development series, which covers such topics as choosing graduate programs, completing successful applications, and interviewing.  Special skills sessions are also provided.  Students participate in a peer advising/mentoring program with current graduate students and are provided additional opportunities to meet other research faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings.  Students receive a stipend, housing on the Medical School campus, travel to and from the program, and emergency illness and accident health insurance.  Several mechanisms of formative and summative evaluation are employed.  After participation in the REU summer, program alumni receive twice-yearly newsletters, contact information about each other, and open access to continued advising and counseling by the program director, their individual research advisors, and their peer mentors. \r\n",
