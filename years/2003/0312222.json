 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stanley J. Osher and Luminita A. Vese\r\n     The investigators together with junior faculty, postdoctoral\r\nfellows, and students develop novel and efficient computational\r\ntechniques for partial differential equations of fourth order\r\narising in imaging science, including medical imaging, image\r\nprocessing, computer vision, and graphics, as well as material\r\nscience.  They begin with analysis done on their previous TV model\r\nby Yves Meyer.  This gives a unique blend of nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equation and functional analysis as well as new and\r\nvery useful models for image decomposition.  This leads the\r\ninvestigators to the analysis of more general fourth order\r\nequations used in imaging science, with geometric applications\r\nand interpretations, as well as new efficient computational and\r\nnumerical methods to approximate these and other related partial\r\ndifferential equations.  Problems considered include image\r\ndecomposition into cartoon plus texture, Wulff evolution of\r\nshapes in crystal growth, image disocclusion by the Euler\r\nelastica model, image restoration via geometry of level sets, as\r\nwell as reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points\r\n(such as LIDAR, LADAR, 3D cloud or geoscience data) in the form\r\nof patches belonging to the same unknown surface.\r\n     This investigation dramatically advances the\r\nstate-of-the-art in material science (e.g., microchip design),\r\nimage analysis, computer vision, and graphics.  These fields are\r\nof great strategic value in the US information technology\r\nindustry, in nanoscience, in homeland security, and in medical\r\nimaging.  The level set method and applications, developed by the\r\ninvestigators and collaborators, has impacted numerous areas of\r\ntechnology -- see, e.g., the Google website for close to 5,000\r\nhits on \"Level Set Methods\" with a spectacular range of\r\napplications from Hollywood graphics to underwater explosions to\r\ncontrol of passenger aircraft to developing new microchip designs\r\nand beyond.  The investigators' new models reduce the burden of\r\nlaborious human operations for the processing of large-scale data\r\nsets, enhance the efficiency of domain scientists as well as\r\nordinary users, facilitate modeling and rendering tasks, and\r\nstreamline the pipeline of information and materials processing.\r\n\r\n",
