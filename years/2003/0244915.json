 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for funds to support a group at the University of Cincinnati to participate in BooNE, the new booster neutrino experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab).  BooNE will look for neutrino oscillations. A recent result from the LSND experiment suggested that muon-neutrinos could oscillate into electron-neutrinos. BooNE will use the same technique to look for this effect. BooNE will use the 8 GeV beam from the Fermilab booster to produce the neutrinos. The difference in a factor of ten in primary beam energy compared to the LSND beam energy will mean a tenfold increase in the energy of the detected signal from the electron-neutrino if the LSND signal is real. If the LSND result is due to an unknown background, it should occur at the same energy in BooNE as it did at Los Alamos. If the LSND result is correct, BooNE can expect about 1000 oscillation events, a truly revolutionary result. If the LSND result is false, BooNE will rule it out at the 10 standard deviation level, another truly significant result. In addition to the oscillation results, the experiment will be in a very good position to measure a number of neutrino scattering cross sections. The BooNE detector and beam line are complete and the experiment recorded their first neutrino event in August 2002. During the next three years, in addition to running the experiment, they will be developing the software tools to analyze the data and measuring the inelastic cross sections. \r\n\r\nThis experiment, in addition to specifically looking for muon-neutrino to electron-neutrino oscillations, has a much broader impact in the community. Since BooNE is a small experiment, there are many opportunities for undergraduates, professors from undergraduate institutions, and high school teachers to participate in the research in a meaningful way. All of the above groups have already made impacts on the experiment and they can be expected to continue to do so in the future. \r\n",
