The Museum's Division of Physical Sciences, which contains the research departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) and Astrophysics, will supervise undergraduate students in experimental, observational, theoretical, and computational projects at the recently completed Rose Center for Earth and Space at AMNH. This REU site will collaborate with the long-standing REU program in biological sciences at AMNH. In addition to their research projects in EPS and astrophysics, the student participants will gain exposure to research techniques and philosophies in fields such as paleontology, genetics, and evolutionary biology, through jointly run orientation meetings, in-house workshops, biweekly informal discussions, and joint seminars. This twelve week program will host six students annually. The students will report on their work at the end of the summer, both in a written scientific paper and a 15-minute oral presentation in a multidisciplinary scientific symposium.\r\n",
