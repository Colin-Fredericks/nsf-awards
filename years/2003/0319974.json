 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate a test strain\r\nsensor in microchip form using magnetostrictive spin dependent tunneling materials. Silicon piezoresistive\r\nmaterials have high sensitivity but operate at low temperatures, whereas metallic films have much better temperature capability but much lower sensitivity. The limitations in sensitivity/temperature, susceptibility to ESD, cost, and others have precluded the technology to be used in several key commercial and military applications. An approach based on the high sensitivity, wide temperature range, low power, small size and low cost of similar devices is proposed. Although as a magnetic device, the sensor will be insensitive to external magnetic fields of practical magnitude, using a proprietary approach. The feasibility will be demonstrated by fabricating test  devices; constructing a miniature strain tester; and achieving high strain sensitivity. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that these sensors will find rapid initial acceptance in application areas of industrial control, civil engineering projects, and robotics, and then expand to other applications. This sensor\r\nwill function under very adverse conditions of temperature, ESD and radiation. Unlike\r\nother magnetic sensors the device will have no response to magnetic fields, either natural\r\nor created by the equipment it is trying to control. Because the sensor is manufactured\r\nby microelectronics techniques it will be low cost and the packaging requirements will not\r\nhave to include many of the techniques employed today to \"safeguard\" the existing sensor.\r\n\r\n",
