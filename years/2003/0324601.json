Street (Chemistry)\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on developing a fundamental science-based understanding of the influence of dendrimer interlayers on the nanomechanical, nanotribological, chemical, and morphological properties of the ultrathin metal overlayer films.  The technological motivation for this research is grounded in the desire to develop novel coatings that will increase the capability and durability of critical and emerging engineering structures based on thin film technology such as MEMS and NEMS (micro- and nano-elecromechanical systems) devices, and new materials for microelectronic packaging.  Furthermore, a basic understanding of the changes in properties induced by dendrimer underlayers on films deposited with carefully controlled grain sizes, grain morphologies, and coating thicknesses can open new horizons in the development and application of thinner, more durable coatings.  Educational efforts include the training of graduate students from the departments of Chemistry and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and the integration of undergraduate students from the freshman and sophomore classes at The University of Alabama and from neighboring HBCU's into multidisciplinary research activities.  This will provide those students with practical laboratory experiences above and beyond that normally associated with their academic coursework.  \r\n\r\n",
