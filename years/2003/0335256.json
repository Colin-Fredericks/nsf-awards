 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of ubiquitous high-bandwidth networked services has prompted the\r\nexploration of using ever-increasing bands of spectrum, often in demanding environments and\r\nover bandwidth portions that are already in use for legacy systems. This trend, which we loosely\r\nlabel ultra-wideband (UWB), poses significant challenges for networking, communications\r\ndesign and hardware development. Our goal is to provide a network that makes best use of the\r\nresources available in terms of nodes, energy and bandwidth. To that end, we are signaling-\r\nagnostic. Rather than propose a signaling scheme and construct a network architecture\r\npredicated on that specific scheme, we propose a testbed built upon an agile architecture that\r\nprovides the network the most useful control capabilities under varying operating conditions.\r\nThe researchers propose an integrated approach for UWB networks that considers networking,\r\ncommunications design and hardware development jointly. The integration of these design\r\ncomponents requires significant cross-layer interaction. Due to the new opportunities of ultra-\r\nwideband systems and its properties, network layers above the Physical Layer can take full\r\nadvantage and design a network with superior performance. Thus, we will explore Network\r\nLayer protocols that make its routing decisions based on the time-varying UWB link states and\r\ndynamic traffic demands; Transport Layer protocols that deals with errors and congestion in\r\nmuch more efficient manner and an integrated architecture that is jointly optimized across-layers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The intellectual merit of our proposed work is in the following areas:\r\nA network architecture and testbed that make use, in an agile manner, of different\r\ncommunication configurations.\r\nThe first attempt at integrating ultra-wide-band into a networked system, an important and\r\nnecessary step in the development of this technology\r\nThe development of a cross-layer approach to optimize network performance with\r\nparsimonious but effective visibility into lower layers.\r\nThe dual development of time-domain and frequency-domain communication systems\r\nallowing the network to adapt the signaling scheme to the specific environment in terms\r\nof fades, bandwidth and energy. The challenges of these systems lie in the efficient and high\r\nperformance implementation of these nodes in CMOS and demonstrate co-existence in the\r\nnetwork .\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Our proposed activity couples research and educational development closely\r\nand will integrate communication theory, networking and hardware design in a natural and\r\nunique fashion. We will introduce a quantitative, systematic and, we believe, fundamental\r\napproach to UWB networked communications. In particular, our approach will allow the field to\r\nmove beyond an arbitrary and inflexible signaling-centric approach, and move towards\r\narchitectures based on network requirements and fundamental communications considerations.\r\nThe educational impact of our approach will be in both classroom education and cross-\r\ndisciplinary research for graduate and undergraduate students. The researchers have already\r\nbegun an extensive educational effort to bring wireless technology into the classroom. First, two\r\nof the researchers are developing a graduate-level wireless communication course. Secondly, one\r\nof the researchers is incorporating wireless hardware in undergraduate digital design laboratory\r\ncoursework at MIT. Finally two of the researchers have begun a joint graduate-level teaching\r\nproject combining application and analysis of networking.",
