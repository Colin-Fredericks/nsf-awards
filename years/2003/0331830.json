 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in various fields such as biology,\r\noptics, telecommunication, material and electronics promises novel and sustainable\r\ntechnologies and products. To fulfill the promise, a set of new manufacturing processes\r\nand manufacturing paradigms are needed for industrial scale production. A recently\r\nconducted NSF workshop on Nonomanufacturing and Processing recommends bottom up\r\n(such as electroforming and assembly) and top down (such as EDM, ECM, laser and\r\netching) processes as potential technologies for generating 1D, 2D, and 3D\r\nnanostructures and devices.\r\nThis SGER proposal seeks funding to study the feasibility of developing a Nano-Electrochemical\r\nMachining (Nano-ECM) process. Electrochemical machining (ECM)\r\nprocess, an anodic dissolution process, selectively removes material atom by atom and\r\nthus avoids post-processing operations. As ECM is a non-thermal and non-mechanical\r\ncontact process, it generates burr-free and stress-free surfaces. Micro-ECM process has\r\nshown to be highly successful in machining arbitrary 3D micro shapes. Therefore, ECM\r\nseems an ideal candidate as one of the top down nanomachining processes. However,\r\nmany scientific and technical barriers and associated risks must be considered and\r\naddressed for the realization of Nano-ECM process.\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis study will establish an extensive and comprehensive knowledge base of the state-of-the\r\nart research in electrochemical deposition and dissolution at nanoscale and related\r\nscientific and technical barriers. An attempt will be made to develop a mathematical\r\nmodel to describe Nano-ECM process by taking into consideration mass transport\r\nprocess at a very small gap, coupled modes of mass transport, coupling of Faradic\r\nprocesses and statistical aspects of discrete events of reactions. A Nano-ECM cell will be\r\nassembled using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis study will initiate the establishment of an educational and research infrastructure for\r\nNanomanufacturing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) that will be accessible\r\nto researchers from UNL and other U.S. universities. The success of the project will lead\r\nto the development of a new graduate/undergraduate course on Nanomanufacturing. The\r\nproject results will be demonstrated to high school teachers and students on a regular\r\nbasis. A collaborative research with researchers at the Warsaw University of Technology\r\nwill be planned by simultaneously submitting proposals to US and EU research agencies.",
