 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Weis of the University of Massachusetts is utilizing bacterial signaling proteins responsible for chemotaxis in Escherichia coli in a new design for sensors.  The idea is to make a self-contained combined receptor-enzyme amplifier that can specifically bind small molecules of choice, and by regulating the activity of an associated enzyme, amplify a signal to indicate the presence of the molecule.  Another desirable aspect in the design of these so-called \"chemical detection modules\" is their ability to self-assemble, for use in large arrays.  The goal of this project is to engineer the E. coli oxygen taxis receptor.  The work is to 1.  alter the binding specificity of the receptor using site-directed mutagenesis and 2.  self-assemble by engineering a protein attachment that acts as a template for the self-assembly.  Two graduate students will be involved in this work on biologically-inspired sensing.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.\r\n\r\n",
