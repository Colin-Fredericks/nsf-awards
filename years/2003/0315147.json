Indexed data\r\nscheduling is to design data broadcast schemes that\r\nminimize both the average waiting time and energy consumption\r\nof the clients in retrieving information on air.\r\nAnother objective of this project is to investigate \r\nthe possibility of applying the ideas from indexed data scheduling\r\nto the design of communication protocols for multimedia applications\r\nin wireless mobile communication networks.",
