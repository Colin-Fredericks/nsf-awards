Microcavities as building blocks of integrated optical devices form \r\nthe central application of the proposed research: their spectral, emission and coupling \r\ncharacteristics will be studied with a combination of numerical modeling and\r\n approximation methods. Pure numerics encounters resource limitations in large, \r\ncoupled and fully three-dimensional systems, making approximation schemes\r\n crucial for speedy, goal-oriented design. Among the most widely known such \r\nschemes is paraxial optics, which however breaks down in the resonator \r\nconfigurations of greatest interest for photonic integration.\r\n\r\nThe lack of reliable analytical treatments in this regime is the  \r\ncentral theoretical motivation for the proposed research.  \r\nNon-paraxiality in microcavities translates into chaotic ray dynamics  \r\nwhen considering the short-wavelength or large-size limit; hence,  \r\napproximations relying on large size-parameters bring insights from  \r\nnonlinear dynamics to bear on micro-optic design. This parallels  \r\ndevelopments in mesoscopic electronic physics where similar  \r\napproximations arise in systems whose size falls into the transition  \r\nregion between quantum and classical mechanics.\r\n\r\nBased on this connection, a new course to be developed within the  \r\nApplied Physics Master's program will aim at a unified presentation of  \r\nphotonics and quantum mechanics, utilizing web-based teaching  \r\ntechnology. The latter will be tied to web-based dissemination of the  \r\nnumerical and analytical techniques developed in the proposed research,  \r\nin order to strengthen the student's exposure to issues with broad  \r\ninterest in optics, nanoscience and nonlinear dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
