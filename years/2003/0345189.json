 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Joseph Shinar of Iowa State University is developing structurally integrated sensors utilizing an organic light emitting device for the detection of anthrax.  The resulting battery-operated sensors will be ideal for applications in the area of homeland security as they are both selective and fast, but also inexpensive.  The device takes the novel approach of integrating the excitation light source with the sensing component itself.  This is expected to enhance detection sensitivity.  While this new type of sensor is expected to have an immediate impact on homeland security it is also expected to lead to applications in medicine and environmental monitoring.  A number of graduate students will participate in this highly interdisciplinary project and will be drawn from a variety of disciplines including physics, engineering, biophysics, molecular biology and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community.  The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.\r\n",
