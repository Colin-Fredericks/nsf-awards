Zeotropic mixtures are distinct in that the concentrations of their liquid and vapor phases are continually changing in the two-phase region. The temperature glide between the concentration profiles can cause both component accumulation at the vapor-liquid interface and drastically nonlinear temperature versus enthalpy contours. On the microscale, these behaviors can be exacerbated by the increased effect of intermolecular interactions. The thermodynamic, heat transfer, and fluid flow properties of these mixtures will be studied through theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental observation. The results of this project will provide the tools needed to create effective miniature vapor compression and absorption cycles, pumping mechanisms, and extraction devices. This research can also be used to increase the efficiency of heat exchangers that utilize micromachined components, which may have a large impact on the costs and emissions generated by energy consumption. These types of energy  pplications are appealing to students who are concerned about the environment and to students who are interested in current technology. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be introduced to energy systems through a four-tier integrated approach.  The proposal has been funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.\r\n\r\n",
