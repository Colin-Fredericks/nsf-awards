 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: Our first goal is to measure, for the first time, using MEMS sensors and actuators, the following properties of free standing nano grained nano scale metal films:(a) elastic and plastic response due to uniaxial loading, (b) electrical conductivity, (c) thermal conductivity, and (d) internal friction in low to high temperatures and under various mechanical stresses. Our second goal is to explore the role of grain boundaries and the surfaces in determining the measured properties. For example, grain boundary atoms are known to be randomly and sparsely arranged compared to those within the grains. We will investigate whether the grain boundaries offer sufficient compliance (in contrast to the mechanism of grain boundary sliding) to nano-grained metals lowering the elastic modulus compared to their bulk counterparts (observed in our preliminary experiments). Similarly, we will explore whether the abundant grain boundaries may cause sufficient scattering of the conduction (electrical and thermal) electrons, thus increasing thermo-electric resistively. Theoretical models will be developed to explain and predict the thermo electro mechanical properties of nano scale metals.\r\nThe models will account for grain boundaries and surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation: Research and education must be complementary to each other. Research advances the frontier of knowledge, whereas education disseminates it. As part of PI 's CAREER project (awarded 1998), video series on MEMS has been developed for broad audience including high and middle school students and people with basic science background interested in MEMS. The series, titled A voyage through the world of micromachine is available at http://www.mie.uiuc.edu.\r\n\r\nThe education component of the this project will include:(a) development of short video series on\r\nnano materials and technology ,and the micro instruments for testing such invisible samples. Undergraduate research assistants from diverse group will be recruited for this project; (b) development of web page where micro instruments will be highlighted as well as new findings on nano materials will be posted through videos of experiments and animations (to clarify concepts),(c)development of new course for seniors and entering graduate students on new methods of studying materials at nano scale, (d)introduction of the topic of nano scale materials 'behavior in the traditional courses of mechanical engineering such s mechanics of materials, and design. University of Illinois hosts summer camps for school students. The concepts of nanotechnology will be presented to the visiting young audience through PI 's lab tour, the video series and informal discussions.\r\n",
