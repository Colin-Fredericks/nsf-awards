 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Informatics for fiscal year 2003.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. These fellowships provide opportunities for interdisciplinary research and educational activities in biology and informatics to a wide range of recent doctoral recipients.  There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Probabilistic models for reconstructing molecular pathways using an integration of genomic data.\"  Various methods probe different attributes of complex biological systems at a genome-wide scale, providing the bioinformatics community with massive amounts of data.  This research project develops models and algorithms suited for computational reconstruction of molecular pathways through the integration of diverse data types and multiple species using probabilistic graphical models.\r\n\r\n",
