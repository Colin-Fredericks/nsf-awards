The particular project is The Engineer of 2020, which will provide a bold vision of engineering in the future and explore the educational pathways that will enable us to realize that future. \r\n\r\nThis award supports Phase II, which will develop strategies that will meet the needs of engineers and society in 2020.  The primary activity of Phase II will be a national summit of engineering educators, employers, and policy makers to initiate a national dialogue (based on the Phase I vision) on short- and medium-term term strategies for engineering educators, funding organizations, and government agencies. Follow-on surveys of a wider audience will provide feedback for refining strategies and recommendations.  The proceedings of the summit, survey results, and a summary report, including recommendations for action, will be published in a peer-reviewed National Academies report. Brochures highlighting the major findings of the project and a specially designed website display will also be used to publicize the results.   \r\n \r\n",
