 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER project is a comprehensive education and research program aimed at the development of next-generation devices using functional perovskites by providing atomic-level understanding of interface properties relevant for practical applications. Materials science research will be pursued research toward: (a) mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite oxides for electrochemical devices, and (b) ferroelectric thin films for capacitors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In these devices, interface structure and properties play a key role in determining materials and device properties. Providing a fundamental understanding of transport mechanisms across interfaces will enable more energy-efficient, cost-effective devices, and aid the design of thin film electrochemical devices. Ferroelectric perovskites have a host of properties that enable further development of technologies such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The physical properties of ferroelectric perovskite thin films are drastically different from those of bulk materials, for reasons that are currently poorly understood. Establishing the role of interfaces in observed behavior is expected to allow development of optimized microstructures for applications in MEMS and electronic devices. The method developed in this project will concentrate on interfaces with known atomic arrangements and defect chemistry. These will be obtained by controlled thin film growth experiments and by utilizing unique capabilities of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Macroscopic measurements of transport properties of oxide interfaces and of the physical behavior of ferroelectric thin films is being studied to establish fundamental limits of interfacial properties, relevant for all applications of functional perovskites.  In addition, this research is intended to set the stage for atomic level calculations that will need the true atomic structure as input. Part of the research on thin film electrochemical devices will involve an established collaboration with industry, as well as interdisciplinary research with national and international university researchers in the areas of electrochemical transport and electrical characterization. \r\nAn important feature of the project is the training of students in interdisciplinary, industrial and international collaborative activities, in technologically important research areas. A main goal of the project is to thoroughly integrate research into educational activities. Emphasis will be placed on (a) participation of undergraduate students in research early in their studies (b) interdisciplinary and international training, and (c) mentoring of students of underrepresented groups with the goal to encourage them to pursue graduate studies in materials science and engineering. Course development plans include strengthening the core curriculum to emphasize conceptual understanding of the course material for a broad interdisciplinary audience, and to incorporate new technologies. Conceptual testing as a method to evaluate the success of the educational activities will also be developed.\r\n%%% The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. \r\n***  \r\n",
