 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThis proposal requests three yeas of support to continue a research program involving one senior\r\ninvestigator, one postdoctoral fellow and several students. The research will address hadrons\r\nand hadronic processes in terms of the con.ned quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics\r\n(QCD)b y joining recent advances in understanding the propagators and vertices involving\r\ngluon, ghost and quark .elds with advances in covariant modeling of mesons, form factors and\r\ninteractions.\r\nThe principal investigator has expertise in continuum nonperturbative QCD modeling of\r\nhadrons and the subsequent description of hadronic processes based on the Dyson-Schwinger\r\nequations of the theory. Previous work has concentrated upon the solution of the Dyson-\r\nSchwinger equation for the dressed quark propagator followed by the solution of the bound\r\nstate Bethe-Salpeter equation for mesons. The e.ective interaction that has emerged preserves\r\nthe perturbative short distance behavior of QCD while the perturbative domain is described\r\nwith two parameters. It generates the empirical amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking\r\nand the closely related phenomena of absolute quark con.nement is implemented. The evident\r\nsuccess of this approach for the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons of light quarks,\r\nand for baryons, needs to be reconciled with recent advances by others that have increased our\r\nunderstanding of the gauge boson sector of QCD.\r\nIn particular, we seek to replace the two parameters of the above-mentioned e.ective interaction\r\nby results of independent studies of the more fundamental gauge boson sector of QCD. There\r\nare available model solutions of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger equations for at least the gluon\r\nand ghost dressed propagators that we wish to connect to. Also there is available independent\r\nquality data from lattice simulations of QCD for these quantities and for the important gluonquark\r\nvertex. Thus the time is ripe for development of continuum models of hadronic processes\r\nconstrained by QCD data. These issues relate to the origin of quark con.nement and dynamical\r\nchiral symmetry breaking. Information on how to move beyond the ladder approximation is at\r\nhand and will be used. The consequences will be subjected to an evaluation in terms of hadronic\r\nobservables. This information is needed to both advance our understanding of hadron physics\r\nand learn about the physically relevant nonperturbative dynamics of the gauge sector of QCD.\r\nOur combined approach will be an advance in continuum Poincare invariant investigations of the\r\ndominant quark-gluon mechanisms underlying hadron physics.\r\nSeveral activities within this project have broader impact. The research undertaken with\r\nthis grant helps to advance both nuclear and particle physics. The quark-gluon basis of hadronic\r\nproperties and processes is a focus area of nuclear physics and theoretical progress contributes\r\nto the return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC. This work also\r\ncontributes to the integration of research and education through the training of graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral scholars, and through the involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral\r\nscholars in undergraduate teaching. Also students get the opportunity to participate in professional\r\nmeetings. The international collaborations with scientists at the University of Tuebingen,\r\nGermany, needed to carry out parts of this project contribute to the nation's infrastructure for\r\nresearch and education.",
