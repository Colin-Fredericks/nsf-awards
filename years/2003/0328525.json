 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beverly Clayton from The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center(PSC), along with collaborators of NSF's Education, Outreach, and Training Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (EOT-PACI) are funded by a grant from the ACIR Program in the CISE Directorate to provide the teachers of the City of Pittsburgh Schools a professional development program entitled TeacherTECH. Using successful strategies and materials developed in previous presentations of this program, the trainers will equip the teacher participants with knowledge and techniques to help them increase student's involvement in computational activities.  The program will focus on the effective use of software applications that are currently available in the City of Pittsburgh Schools to creatively support the standard curriculum in science and mathematics.  In addition, the program will contain elements of outreach and awareness intended to promote the participation of underserved populations in science and engineering.  The program consists of a five-day, intensive, hands-on workshop designed to increase teacher's knowledge of computer programs that are in use in the City of Pittsburgh Schools and encourage more effective use of these programs.  During the school year, follow-up activities will be held that will give teachers an opportunity to share gender equity issues, technology knowledge and the techniques that they have developed with colleagues who were not participants in the summer session.  \r\n\r\n",
