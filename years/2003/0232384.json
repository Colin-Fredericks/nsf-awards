 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will address the problem of creating robust and efficient software for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimization problems. Taking advantage of recent advances in algorithm design, the project will investigate novel versions of both interior-point and active-set methods for nonlinear optimization, and will examine an innovative integrated approach that takes advantage of both methods to achieve greater speed and reliability than are available from current single-method codes. Optimization software resulting from this research is expected to have commercial applications to difficult nonlinear problems in such areas as network planning, optimal power flow, computer-aided design, and aerospace engineering, as well as in applications for decision analysis in such areas as finance and revenue management.\r\n    Broader impacts of the activity include enhanced understanding of optimization techniques that play a key role in engineering and commerce; an advance for NSF's educational goals by providing support to a postdoctoral researcher; and commercial software products whose further development can be supported by sales revenues.\r\n",
