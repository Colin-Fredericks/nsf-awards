One point of entry to \r\nthese ideas is Real-oriented homotopy theory, which uses \r\nthe complex conjugation action on the complex cobordism \r\nspectrum to approach homotopy groups of spheres. The method \r\nused here is a case of descent, which appears also in \r\nVoevodsky's homotopy theory of algebraic varieties. In this \r\ndirection, the investigator is interested in algebraic \r\ncobordism, the algebro-geometric analogue of complex \r\ncobordism. Another closely related idea is that of Verdier \r\nand Grothendieck dualities, both in algebraic geometry and \r\nin equivariant homotopy theory. Yet another related but \r\ndifferent kind of duality is Koszul duality. Using this \r\nduality, the investigator, jointly with collaborators, \r\nproved a version of Kontsevich's conjecture on Hochschild \r\ncohomology of k-algebras. This in turn is related to the \r\nquestion of deformation quantazation in mathematcial \r\nphysics. Another area into which Koszul duality enters is \r\nthe string topology of Chas and Sullivan, which gives \r\nanother connection between algebra and homotopy theory.  \r\nThe investigator is also involved with another project \r\nrelated to physics, namely constructing geometric models \r\nof elliptic cohomology.\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of spaces that can be deformed\r\ncontinuously. In part, this proposal seeks to better \r\nunderstand maps between such objects by ``stable'' \r\nmethods, i. e. considering a sequence of objects of \r\nall higher dimensions at once, and by using certain \r\nsummetries upon them.  Similar methods can also be used \r\nto study more rigid geometric objects, for example in \r\nalgebraic geometry the solution sets of systems of \r\nalgebraic equations. This leads in turn to the \r\nstudy of algebraic structures on an abstract level.\r\nFinally, the related idea of string topology considers \r\nnot just a space itself, but structures on the space \r\nconsisting of loops in it. In particular, this is \r\nimportant to string theory in physics, which sees \r\nthe universe as composed not of point-like particles \r\nbut of loop-like ``strings''.\r\n",
