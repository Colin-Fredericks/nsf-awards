 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a proposal to acquire a slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to be attached to a newly-\r\ninstalled JEOL Model 2010F field emission gun (FEG) transmission electron microscope (TEM) at\r\nBoston College, for recording digital images directly from a TEM to a computer, thus basically replacing\r\nthe photographic film recording media in a traditional TEM.\r\nThe Department of Physics at Boston College recently acquired the JEOL-2010F FEG TEM and finished\r\nits installation in 2002. This advanced TEM is currently playing a key role in education and research\r\ntraining on the nanoscale at Boston College, and for fundamental and applied studies on several materials\r\nand systems. It is thus an indispensable tool for research in the materials-related science programs at BC,\r\nand is utilized by faculty and students in four academic departments: Physics, Chemistry, Biology and\r\nGeology & Geophysics. We have a number of research projects going on in the above-mentioned\r\ndepartments, and the successful fulfillment of these projects depends strongly on the characterization\r\nwork that will be carried out in the new TEM.\r\nUnfortunately, we were unable to acquire from the beginning a very important attachment to this TEM,\r\nthe requested CCD camera. Traditional photographic films are presently used as the recording media,\r\nwhich is a costly, extremely low efficiency and frankly unsuitable solution for such an advanced\r\ninstrument. The difference between a CCD camera and film recording is analogous to that between digital\r\nand film-based cameras. With film, TEM images are first exposed, and then the films are developed and\r\nfixed in a dark room. After that, the films are either printed in the dark room or scanned to a computer for\r\nfurther processing and analysis. The above tedious work that can cost several hours or even a few days\r\ncan instead be accomplished in a few minutes or within an hour by using the CCD camera system.\r\nThe requested slow-scan CCD camera represents a major innovation in electron microscopy because of its\r\nexceptional imaging characteristics and the benefits associated with immediate image visualization and\r\ncomputer processing and analysis. The advantages of a CCD camera are numerous, and include avoiding\r\ndelays and chemical waste involved in film processing; providing a higher dynamic range and improved\r\nlinearity which produce better data quality; and recording data in a form immediately suited to\r\nprocessing, analysis and archiving. CCD cameras have developed to the point where they can be used\r\ninstead of film in a number of applications, providing rapid feedback on specimen and image quality.\r\nMoreover, the detection quantum efficiency of a CCD camera is superior to that of photographic\r\nemulsions and is therefore well-suited to acquiring data from radiation-sensitive materials, such as\r\nbiological samples, organic materials etc., which has proven to be extremely difficult or impossible by the\r\nnormal photographic film method. Direct image acquisition by a CCD camera can reduce the\r\ncharacterization time greatly while saving tremendous labor and resources. It can not only greatly\r\nadvance our research in a significantly short turnaround time, but also open new windows for quantitative\r\nelectron microscopy and imaging of radiation-sensitive materials. It will quite positively impact our\r\neducational program, with a graduate-level course being taught every 2 years, open to students from all\r\nthe science departments. Each semester, about 6 undergraduate students, 5 graduate students and 4\r\npostdocs are trained to use the TEM. The requested CCD camera will facilitate our teaching in such a way\r\nthat the students can view their results immediately in a computer, and the feedback information\r\nimmediately guide them to optimize their operation procedure.\r\nThe research topics for which the TEM is playing an essential role include: novel electronic materials and\r\nphenomena involving carbon nanotubes and arrays; unconventional superconductivity in molecular\r\norganic conductors and heavy Fermion materials; new approaches to unanswered questions about the\r\ncuprate superconductors; membrane interactions in nerve myelin and molecular organization of\r\npolypeptides; studies of metallic nanoparticles and nanoporous sol-gel glasses; and studies of the role of\r\ncolloids in the hydrosphere. Support for the research activities that employ the TEM comes from NSF\r\n(DMR, CHE, IBN and ECS), ARO, NIH (NCI), DARPA, DoE, NASA, EPA, Sloan and Dreyfus\r\nFoundations and the ACS Petroleum Research Fund. We describe herein several of these projects\r\nemanating from the multiple PI's programs.",
