 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor/filter device based on the \"pass\" and \"stop\" frequency bands of phononic lattices is proposed. The device uses the piezoelectric properties of the ZnO material system, in order to achieve the generation/detection, and propagation of acoustic waves through phononic lattices on a planar integrated device. The work will explore the properties of such device, explore the concept of acoustic wave propagation through phononic lattices experimentally, and the practical capabilities of\r\nphononic lattices for ultra-high frequency filter applications and biomedical sensor applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposal addresses the development of a novel SAW type device that is capable of exploring experimentally the properties of a class of artificially made lattices, the phononic lattices. Furthermore, it provides a functional device capable of ultra-high frequency response suitable for developing secure mobile communication systems and high performance acoustic, gas, and bio-immunosensors. Due to the novelty and potential applications of the device intellectual merit is considered very high.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This device will revolutionize wireless and mobile communication systems as it can achieve ultra-high frequency band pass filters, and furthermore, this capability of substantially higher operational frequencies will lead to the development of sensors with much higher selectivity and detectivity, such as those currently using quartz microbalance for immunosensing, with tremendous implications on the detection of pathogens and other bio-hazards.\r\n",
