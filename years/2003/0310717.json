The P.I. and Center Director is Dr. Jorge Rocca, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at CSU.  The vision of the ERC is to inexpensively harness the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), soft x-ray range of electromagnetic radiation to image and measure small features, particularly in the metrology of VLSI masks and the microscopy of biological specimens.  These functions currently are performed using synchrotron radiation sources.  EUV wavelengths can image nanoscale features, making the deliverables of this ERC useful in manipulating and producing nanoscale objects. The ERC is based on a partnership with microelectronics firms and will prepare a diverse workforce of physicists and electrical engineers needed to advance and implement EUV and nanoscale science and technology",
