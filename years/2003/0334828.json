Jabbour [jabbour@ms.uky.edu]\r\nInstitution: University of Kentucky\r\nTitle: Conference on Multiscale Effects in Material Microstructures and Defects\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMuch progress has been made over the past several decades in understanding the effects of microstructures and defects on the macroscopic properties of a wide class of technologically important materials.  The goal of this conference is to bring together mathematicians, engineers, and scientists working on analytical and computational problems related to microstructures and defects in materials and multiscale modeling techniques in general.  The conference will provide an opportunity for established researchers, recent Ph.D.'s, and advanced graduate students to interact, share novel ideas, and possibly initiate new collaborations.  The organizers of this conference aim at attracting a large pool of advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s.  Emphasis has also been placed on ensuring the active presence of female investigators and students in an effort to promote the participation of underrepresented groups.   Abstracts of delivered talks and a summary of the open discussion session (in which new directions of research will be discussed) will be posted on the conference's web page.\r\n",
