 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rosemarie Reed is producing a one-hour documentary film about the life and accomplishment of Lise Meitner, the Austrian born physicist whose pioneering work in nuclear physics contributed to the discovery of nuclear fission, which led to the creation of the atomic bomb.  Rosemarie Reed Productions, Ltd., is requesting a planning grant of $50,000 to conduct research, secure visuals, develop a treatment, and do preliminary formative evaluation of the treatment for this film.  An examination of Meitner's life and work will help correct the inaccuracies and injustices that have distorted the legacy of one of the founders of the modern nuclear age and address the need for the recognition of women in science.  The film will also offer stufents insight into the social, political and scientific events of the first half of the twentieth century and will introduce audiences to the work and thought of such key figures as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, Max Planck and Otto Hahn.  The project will be informed by an advisory board comprised of leading experts in Meitner studies and theoretical physics; formative evaluation will be conducted by Georgia Institute for Technology.",
