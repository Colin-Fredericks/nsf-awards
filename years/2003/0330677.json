 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Howard Taylor is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) on the topic of signal processing in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The algorithm developed by this group has the potential to greatly improve the productivity of NMR by cutting the machine time needed to do the most common experiments.  The idea is to insert a noise reduction scheme between the experimental acquisition of the Free Induction Decay time signal and the final Fast Fourier Transform to the spectrum.  The project will explore, extend and demonstrate the usefulness of this newly invented tool in sub-fields of chemistry that employ NMR.  With Professor C. E. McKenna, NMR using costly isotopes will be studied.  With Professor G. K. S. Prakash, carbon 13 coupling experiments will be the focus.  \r\n\r\nNMR is used in virtually every chemistry department for the analysis of structure and kinetics of molecules, usually in solution and sometimes in the solid phase.  The instruments are costly and require high maintenance.  This work aims to increase the productivity of the machines that are present now in labs, and to thus free up NMR time for difficult experiments that require greater data acquisition times.  \r\n",
