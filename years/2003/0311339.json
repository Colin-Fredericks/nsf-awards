 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broader Impact\r\nThis project  advances the state of education for wireless system software developers by adapting and implementing wireless industry best practices in the classroom. Nokia is the leading manufacturer of wireless handsets worldwide. This project adapts and implements a software quality assurance program CE Nokia's OK Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME) application certification process CE in a core set of wireless software engineering courses. Auburn University initiated the nation's first undergraduate wireless engineering degree program in August, 2002. These courses make up the software engineering track of the wireless engineering degree.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe objectives of this project are 1) to adapt Nokia OK application standards for\r\nclassroom use as examples of what is expected of industry-quality software; 2) to incorporate Nokia OK software development tools into a student-friendly software development environment; and 3) to implement in-house Nokia OK certification procedures as a basis for assessing student projects and providing feedback.\r\n\r\nOur anticipated outcomes are 1) students who will have been immersed in a technology similar to what they are likely to encounter in their first years of work; 2) wireless industry standards adapted to the classroom, J2ME development capabilities incorporated into an existing popular software tool, and an industry testing process implemented in an academic setting; and 3) evidence of the effectiveness of using wireless industry practices in the classroom.\r\n",
