 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nKalton\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the aim  is to study a number  of problems\r\nrelated to Banach space  theory and its applications.   Part\r\nof the project  deals with the  theory of extensions  of one\r\nBanach space by another.  For example it is planned to study\r\nthe problem  of classifying  those Banach  spaces such  that\r\nevery minimal  extension is  trivial.   This problem  can be\r\nreformulated as a  problem in approximation  theory.  It  is\r\nalso  planned  to  study  applications  to  problems  in the\r\nnonlinear theory  of Banach  spaces, related  to problems of\r\nexistence  of  uniform  homeomorphisms  between  two  Banach\r\nspaces or between their unit balls.  In a somewhat different\r\ndirection  the  proposer  plans  to  continue  his   ongoing\r\nresearch on  Rademacher-bounded families  of operators  with\r\napplications to sectorial operators and semigroups.\r\n\r\nThe theory of extensions can be considered in the  following\r\nterms.  Suppose we are given a centrally symmetric solid  in\r\nthree or more dimensions and we are allowed only to  compute\r\nits  cross-section  by  a  slice  in some directions and the\r\nshadow cast  by the  body in  the perpendicular  directions.\r\nThis gives us some information about the solid, but does not\r\npermit  complete  reconstruction.    The  idea  of  studying\r\nextensions is to obtain more complete information about  the\r\nbody under certain additional conditions.  Many questions of\r\nimportance  in   mathematical  analysis   and  applications,\r\nalthough  not  formally  expressed  in  this  way,  can   be\r\nvisualized in terms of extensions.  Sectorial operators  are\r\nof importance  in the  basic theory  of partial differential\r\nequations  of  evolution  type;  such  equations  are   very\r\nimportant in physical  applications.  Typically  a sectorial\r\noperator is a differential operator acting on some  suitable\r\nspace  of  functions.    By  understanding the properties of\r\nsectorial  operators  and  the  semigroups they generate one\r\ngains a better understanding of the behavior of solutions of\r\ncertain partial differential equations.\r\n",
