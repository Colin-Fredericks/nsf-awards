 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will  develop  processes  and  controls  for  producing  commercial quantities  of  nanostructured  hydroxyapatite (HAP)  biomaterials  suitable  for  load  bearing  orthopedic  and  dental applications.    Though  hydroxyapatite's  osteoconductivity  has  generated  interest  in  many  clinical \r\napplications,  conventionally  processed  hydroxyapatite  materials  have  been  limited  by  their  poor sinterability  and  lack  of  mechanical  strength  attributed  to  poor  phase  purity  and  homogeneity.    By controlling physical processes such as the method of mixing of reactants, particle recovery and synthesis conditions  during  the  chemical  precipitation  of  HAP,  the  crystallinity,  stoichiometry  and  particle \r\nmorphology of HAP will be optimized for mechanical strength.  Hydroxyapatite optimized for mechanical strength will be nanocrystalline and possess increased chemical and thermal stability; these properties will lead  to  enhanced  sinterability  and minimal  grain  growth.    As  a  result,  fully  dense,  nanocrystalline HAP monoliths possessing superior chemical homogeneity, microstructural uniformity, ultrafine grain sizes and \r\nminimized flaw sizes will be achieved.  In the final result, the nanocrystalline HAP monoliths produced will provide superior  compressive  (900  MPa)  and  bending  (200  MPa)  strengths  as  well  as  fracture  toughness  (1.3 MPam1/2).\r\n\r\nCommercially, these nanostructured materials can be formed into constructs and utilized in experimental models commonly employed to validate orthopedic implants.\r\nNanostructured hydroxyapatites will contribute to better osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization. \r\n",
