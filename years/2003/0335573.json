 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce program at Trinity aims to increase both the quantity and quality of math and science teaching in the San Antonio area by awarding Robert Noyce scholarships to seniors and post-baccalaureate candidates in their M.A.T. year.  During the M.A.T. year students intern nearly full-time for eight months in classrooms in local schools in an apprenticeship model of teacher preparation analogous to a medical teaching hospital internship experience.  Extensive recruiting activities are targeting all qualified candidates with special attention to under-represented groups. Criteria for selection include: GPA overall and within the major field; intellectual and pedagogical potential as evidenced by references and interview; demonstrated financial need; and estimate of the candidate's ability to be an effective role model for students in San Antonio area schools. Students who apply as seniors may be STEM majors either at Trinity, or they may be STEM majors from other institutions who have applied and gained admission to the M.A.T. program as post-baccalaureate candidates.  All Noyce recipients are assigned both STEM faculty and Education faculty mentors. During the first three years of teaching, their STEM and Education faculty mentors will continue to provide support. Noyce scholars also participate in other department of Education in-service programs. In addition, to help sustain novice teachers, new and experienced teachers are linked through Trinity's \"Critical Friends\" groups that enable teachers and administrators to maintain a professional community.  The department of Education will track each Noyce recipient's career through its on-line database and monitor and enforce compliance with program conditions.",
