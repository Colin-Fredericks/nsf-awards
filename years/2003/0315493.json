 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for the acquisition of particle tracking instrumentation for soft matter and biomaterials research and education at Johns Hopkins University.  In particle tracking, colloids are suspended in a complex fluid, and their motion is measured and analyzed. The study of this motion, which can result from thermal fluctuations, interactions with other particles or the host fluid, or the application of external fields, provides a unique probe of fundamental properties of complex fluids as well as an important avenue for applications. This new instrument will make possible a new research program focused on studies of orientational ordering, pair interactions, and controlled self-assembly of magnetic nanowires in nematic liquid crystals. They will enable existing programs on soft glassy materials and protein hydrogels to branch into new directions, and will provide needed new capabilities to advance studies of the microrheology of the cytoskeleton in living cells. \r\n\r\nThese unique instrumental capabilities will be available to experimenters across the Johns Hopkins materials research community through a convenient user access arrangement. The particle-tracking instrument will also be an important resource for student training, educational efforts, and outreach programs in soft matter and biomaterials at Johns Hopkins. The strongly visual nature of particle tracking techniques makes them highly well suited for introducing young scientists and potential scientists to materials research. Among the specific educational plans for the instrument is its integration into the curriculum of a new interdisciplinary laboratory course on complex fluids targeted at upper-level undergraduates and beginning graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
