 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Prof. Richard H. Holm of Harvard University focused on molybdenum/tungsten hydroxylases and oxotransferases.  The catalytic centers contain mononuclear Mo or W atoms bound to one or two pterin-dithiolene ligands (often called molybdopterin).  The experimental approach involves  the  synthesis  of  low  molecular  weight  representations or analogs of  the  catalytic  sites  of  enzymes,  which  are  fully  characterized  before being studied  in  reactivity investigations.  The natural ligand is represented by a synthetic dithiolene, which functions as an ene-1,2-dithiolate when bound to molybdenum  or  tungsten  and  closely  simulates  the  electronic  environment  engendered  by  the  pterin-dithiolene.  \r\n\r\nThrough analog systems, the project examines reactions of the enzymes nitrate reductase, formate dehydrogenase, arsenite oxidase, acetylene hydratase, sulfite oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase, among others.   This involves the synthesis  of  new  active  site  analogs  in  oxidized  and  reduced  states, including  uncommon monodithiolene complexes, and kinetics determinations with attendant evaluation of rate  constants  and  activation  parameters.  Kinetic and other  information  is  used  to  deduce  probable mechanisms  for  the  reactions  investigated.    Also under investigation are the synthesis and oxo transfer reactivity of the non-physiological metals niobium, tantalum, and rhenium in their higher oxidation states.  \r\n\r\nThe essential components of enzymes involved in global carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles and catalyzing the transfer of a single oxygen atom will be studied through analog complexes.  Some of these enzymes, such as the sulfite and xanthine oxidases, occur in humans; and their malfunction leads to significant health risks.  Graduate and postdoctoral students will be trained in synthesis, characterization and mechanism and in regard to the interrelationships between model and biological systems.\r\n\r\n",
