The project builds on Dr. Kney's recent results supported through a NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  That research demonstrates that an applied magnetic field integrated with an ion exchange operation affects chromatographic results. The proposed collaboration with Dr. Parsons primarily involves studies of magnetic water conditioning mechanisms.  They will work on magnetic conditioning experiments using cations with varying magnetic susceptibilities - lead (II), nickel (II), cadmium (II), copper (II), and zinc (II).  In addition, they will investigate the effects of ion concentration, ion-exchange material, and magnetic field intensity.\r\n\r\nThis cooperative research project takes advantage of British expertise in magnetic water conditioning and in the treatment of scaling waters with magnetic fields.  The collaboration could provide information to advance the fields of chemical free water and wastewater treatment.\r\n",
