 "awd_abstract_narration": "PHOTON II: Web-based Collaborative Learning for Teachers is an adaptation and implementation project built on Project PHOTON (DUE/ATE #0053284), a program of the New England Board of Higher Education.  This project is: 1) adapting the successful PHOTON instructional materials, laboratory equipment kit and \"alliance\" model to a web-based distance-learning environment, 2) disseminating PHOTON instructional materials, laboratory equipment kit and \"alliance\" model, (the inclusion of teachers/faculty and career counselors from consortia of secondary and postsecondary institutions) to a national audience, and 3) evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based distance-learning program that methodically applies adult collaborative learning principles for future replication.\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nPHOTON II is utilizing 21st century web-based technology to deliver a one- semester web-based professional development course \"Introduction to Photonics Technology\", the content of which has been implemented and field tested by teachers and faculty in middle, secondary and postsecondary institutions in New England. In spite of a slowdown in the technology sector, the applications of photonics technology are growing rapidly in fields as diverse as national security, medicine, manufacturing, aerospace, the environment, transportation and more. Demand for these technicians continues to grow. Distance learning has proven to be a very useful tool in bringing education to more learners in a time-efficient manner. Research has shown that although there are many positive aspects to distance learning, there are challenging pedagogical aspects to achieving successful learning experience. PHOTON II addresses these challenges by applying collaborative and adult learning principles in the design and development of the new web-course.\r\nCollaborations established with photonics companies and industry associations (OSA and\r\nSPIE) in Project PHOTON are being continued and expanded from a New England to a national focus. Outreach is being initiated with other NSF photonics programs and a number of colleges and high schools are committed to participate in the project.\r\nBroader impact\r\nThe growing demand for photonics technicians requires that new ways be tested to train technicians nationwide. This project is not only adapting the tested technician-level \"Introduction to Photonics Technology\" instructional materials, it is testing a pedagogically designed distance learning model. Evaluation strategies are designed throughout the project and results are informing what support components are the most critical in achieving effective transfer of knowledge and program implementation. The field-tested PHOTON II distance learning course can be offered as a regularly repeating course, and field-test findings can inform other technological fields.\r\n",
