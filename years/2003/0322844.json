 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new class of materials (metamaterials) has been discovered that propagate electromagnetic waves with fantastically novel and exciting properties. Certain of these metamaterials are expected to behave as if they have a negative index of refraction, turning ray optics on its head and leading to many counter-intuitive results. However, the understanding of metamaterials and their applications is still in its infancy. Even the most basic predictions, and the outcomes of the associated experiments, are hotly contested. Because of the high ratio of theoretical to experimental work in this field, there is a clear need for more experimental work on the most ideal (i.e. closest to theory) materials that can be produced. The objective is to investigate key fundamental questions about negative permittivity, negative permeability, and negative index of refraction materials using superconducting metamaterials to provide definitive answers. Specific activities include development of novel superconducting tunable negative-e and negative-u metamaterials, direct measurement of evanescent wave amplification in a superconducting left-handed material development of a novel ultra-compact rf resonator, and the use of superconducting phase-slip centers to quantum mechanically tune the properties of nano-engineered superconducting metamaterials. The broad impact of the proposed work includes demonstrating qualitatively new ways of manipulating microwave signals, developing novel microwave applications of these materials, including resonators, band-pass and band-stop filters, near-field lenses with unprecedented properties, and negative refracting materials, all with myriad new uses in industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work investigates and promotes applications of metamaterials for the RF and microwave industry. There are concepts for new and possibly superior microwave filters (band pass, stop, tunable, etc.), radically improved methods to image microwave properties of materials and devices, the development of new resonant structures that may improve NMR and MRI systems, and many other potential applications. These developments will be of direct and measurable value to society through the generation of high tech jobs, improvement of wireless communications, and a positive impact on health care. The project will train two graduate students, with backgrounds in electrical engineering and physics, to discover new phenomena at the cutting edge of electromagnetic research. The PI's group has a history of broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in his research group and is involved in outreach activities with nearby minority-dominated middle and high schools. This activity will establish a new branch of metamaterials research that is expected to make significant contributions to fundamental understanding and new applications. These activities will create new partnerships, collaborations, and facilities that will alter the landscape of this field. The results will be disseminated through publications, talks and posters at international conferences, a research web site, and continuation of the extensive outreach activities by the PI and students.\r\n",
