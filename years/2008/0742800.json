 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will develop a synthetic and predictive theory for plant biology that links physiological processes from the level of plant cells and hydraulic vascular systems to that of whole forests and the biosphere. Using theoretical, laboratory, and field based techniques, the research brings together plant physiologists, ecologists and theoretical biologists to advance existing theory in order to develop a unified and quantitative scaling approach. The work will ultimately show biologists which attributes to plants to measure and how to put these measurements together in order to predict plant growth, water transport, and carbon flux. \r\n\r\nThese predictions will crucially inform how our nation can anticipate and respond to anthropogenically caused global warming and extinction crises. Results from this research will provide a necessary tool in the development of a predictive theory for connections between functional plant bioogy and ecosystem science. For example, the proposed work will likely lead to more accurate calculations of terrestrial carbon budgets, earlier genetic selection programs, appropriate species choices that correspond to different management goals, and prescriptions for pruning or spacing in forests, row crops, and orchards. Results will also inform how ecosystem and ecological processes are affected by changes in individual plants. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in the project will be trained to integrate new theoretical developments with empirical tests to advance a deeper understanding of biological processes.",
