These studies are expected to provide the knowledge needed to develop strategies for tailoring the thermodynamics and kinetics of cooperative two-electron transfer reactions.  Multielectron transfer reactions are central to many of the most important challenges in chemical synthesis and catalysis, including energy conversion and storage.  Two classes of reversible two-electron transfer reagents will be investigated.  A battery of physical experiments will be used to determine electronic structures, ligand fluxionality, redox thermodynamics, and rates of electron transfer.  The research activities will bring together a research team composed of high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and Professor Connick.  A chemistry web site will be developed in collaboration with a Cincinnati Public Schools high school teacher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to advance our understanding of the electron-transfer reactions of late 2nd and 3rd row transition metal complexes.  These studies are relevant to the development of catalysts for applications ranging from fuel cells to synthesis of pharmaceuticals.  The research had the following objectives: (1) Prepare platinum and palladium two-electron reagents, and (2) characterize the electron-transfer reactions of these molecules.  In addition, the project aimed to train a broad spectrum of participating researchers.  All objectives were met.\n\nThe intellectual merits of the project outcomes include the design of metal complexes with ligand architectures that are capable of stabilizing the preferred geometries of both the d6- and d8-electron configurations of late transitions metals.  This required developing new synthetic strategies, as well as new approaches to evaluating non-covalent interactions.  The ensemble of synthesized complexes and studies of the electron-transfer properties provide a roadmap for what does and does not work when designing cooperative outer-sphere two-electron reagents, in which the transfer of the first electron is less favorable than transfer of the second.  Moreover, this large library of reagents presents a tremendous opportunity for exploiting this reactivity.  Along with complementary chemical redox studies, the accumulated evidence led to significant insights into the redox mechanisms, including the special role of non-covalent interactions.  One of the most significant contributions was determining how the metal, the ligand architecture and the ligand donor properties influence the redox potentials, as well as the chemical and electrochemical reversibility.  These results provide rare evidence-based thermodynamic information about how these factors influence cooperative two-electron transfer.  This knowledge is an essential component of strategies for coupling these reactions with substrate activation. \n\nThe knowledge obtained from this project has the potential to contribute to society by enabling innovation and the development of new technologies in areas such as engineering, medicine and environmental science.  The described activities have produced some of the understanding that ultimately will be needed to develop evidence-based strategies for tailoring the redox properties of d6/d8-electron systems for catalysis.  Knowledge of this kind would be expected to be applicable to a wide range of problems in areas that include water electrolysis, fuel cells, CO2 fixation, hydrocarbon activation, solar cells, and nano-machines.  Furthermore, in the course of this study new stimuli-responsive materials also were discovered.  This led to the development of a new strategy for detecting perchlorate down to 0.1 ppb in water.  Thus, the knowledge and materials generated in this project may lead to the development of commercial technologies, which will in turn help to promote sustainability and contribute to efforts to shrink the human environmental footprint.   \n\nIn addition to advancing discovery and understanding, the broader impacts of this work include promoting teaching, training and learning by engaging young scientists in research.  In total, more than 70 high school, undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, visiting scholar, and PhD researchers were directly and significantly impacted, including a number belonging to traditionally underrepresented groups.  The research environment encouraged members of this diverse team to assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, thereby infusing the learning process with the excitement of discovery.  In addition to mentoring, participants received training in critical thinking and a wide array of chemical laboratory techniques.  These experiences were complemented by immersion in a culture of safety and accident prevention.  The research also helped to support research infrastructure by making heavy use of institution..."
