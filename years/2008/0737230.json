The project develops a set of introductory optics experiments and activity-based curricular materials that provide students with the necessary skills to perform and understand the more advanced quantum mechanics experiments by adapting a series of photon quantum mechanics experiments used at the sophomore and the junior/senior level. Student understanding of quantum interference as well as student attitudes and excitement about quantum mechanics are assessed.",
