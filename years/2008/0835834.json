 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Novel Information Model For Efficient Routing Protocols in Delay Tolerant Networks with General Mobility\r\n\r\nThis project supports the research on a novel information model for efficient routing protocols in delay tolerant networks with general mobility. Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is a type of wireless mobile network that does not guarantee the existence of a path between a source and a destination at any time. It has broad applications in sensor-based, satellite, underwater acoustic networks, and Internet connectivity in remote places. In this project, nodes mobility cannot be predicted. Routing in DTNs with general mobility poses unique challenges due to the uncertainty and the time-varying nature of network connectivity. To facilitate the routing, a novel information model using the least square methods and their variations are explored. The techniques involve the information that each node should gather and process so that the message can be delivered to the destination as soon as possible even though the location of the destination is unknown and unpredictable. \r\n\r\n",
