 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide support for the highest achieving entering students at the university declaring majors in chemistry and biology. Many of these students have significant financial need and thus balance university life, significant work hours, and commuting as they live at home during their university career. These responsibilities make it difficult for them to realize their scholarly potential. S-STEM funds provide need-based scholarships so that the students can live on campus and participate fully in the intellectual and research life of the university. Recruiting efforts include direct mail, web resources and on-campus recruiting fairs to promote the S-STEM Scholarships to prospective students in Georgia. Selection is based on multiple academic criteria, financial need, and an interview. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: New activities include (a) a new Freshman Learning Community, (b) a new course, HON1001, (c) a program for freshman to participate in research group seminars, (d) peer-led honors tutorials, (e) a new honors biochemistry course, (f) biochemistry concentrations in both chemistry and biology, (g) a new course in career planning, (h) increased support for undergraduate research opportunities, (i) student presentations at local and regional conferences, (j) support for summer research programs, (k) support to develop leadership in chemistry and biology student clubs and (l) opportunities for the students to teach in supplemental instruction and the Writing Across the Curriculum courses. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: About 60 students are receiving S-STEM funding (approximately 20 each for three consecutive entering classes). The new programs benefit the other chemistry and biology students (approximately 300 and 1400, respectively). Scholarships from the S-STEM program enable the Netzel Scholars to live up to their considerable promise as scientific leaders.",
