This award is jointly supported by Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems in the Division of Engineering and the Division of Materials Research.  Research investigates how materials interact with lasers under conditions relevant to laser processing of covalent semiconductors. The work develops methods for predicting how processing conditions affect the resulting material structure. The work includes the development and use of novel computer simulation methods to elucidate the fundamental physical processes relevant to laser processing of covalent semiconductors. The general approach applies to intense femto-second pulses interacting with silicon. \r\n\r\nThe researchers address the fundamental technical challenges relevant to the development of a multiscale model of heat and mass transport appropriate for far-from-equilibrium conditions.  Electronic heat transport is treated at the continuum level, while the lattice dynamics are treated using classical molecular-dynamics. A crucial component of the proposed work is that the interatomic interactions will depend on the local electronic temperature TE. Parameters in the interactions will be based on a new modification of the popular Tersoff potential, with the dependence of the parameters on TE established by fitting to a large database of energies from finite-temperature ab initio calculations. This novel approach will capture nonthermal effects known to be important for sub-picosecond melting. Heat transport by excited charge carriers is addressed using ab initio simulations of excited liquids and the Kubo-Greenwood method.  The coupling between the continuum description of the electrons and the lattice will be driven using Langevin dynamics with the damping parameter fit to experiment. The focus of the proposed work develops a model for silicon as a test case. The model will be tested in its treatment of the fundamental physics of laser ablation of crystalline silicon and laser annealing of amorphous silicon. Comparison to experiment is used to validate the results of the model, and produce new insight into the role of bond-weakening and ultrafast non-thermal processes to melting and ablation.\r\n\r\nCarrying out this project requires researchers to address the fundamental technical challenges relevant to the development of a multiscale model of heat and mass transport appropriate for far-from-equilibrium conditions. \r\n\r\nThe effort includes both scientific and educational elements. The theoretical and computer simulation methods will expand researchers' ability to model the fundamental physics of laser ablation and will be applied to the technologically relevant processes for   crystalline silicon and laser annealing of amorphous silicon. The work as educational value in developing student skills, particularly the graduates and undergraduates who are directly involved in the research and the activities aid in recruiting new students for graduate study in materials simulation. The researchers and students engage in workshop activities that introduce students to materials simulation, including molecular-dynamics simulation and visualization which is coordinated with the Florida Society for Materials Simulation. The work integrates education and research through the development of course in materials simulation.\r\n\r\nNONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis award support research and education in optical interactions of lasers and semiconductor materials.
