 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sinclair Community College (Dayton, Ohio) is creating an urban STEM Teacher Academy with Dayton area partners, which include the Dayton Public Schools, the University of Dayton, Wright State University, Miami University, and EDvention, the Dayton area's P-20 council. This new K-12 science and mathematics teacher education paradigm utilizes national and state Tech Prep program standards and best practices in STEM education to provide future teachers with a solid, content-rich foundation in STEM disciplines and the pedagogical framework to effectively teach STEM subjects. The objectives include: (1) establishing a new Tech Prep STEM Teacher Education Pathway at the high school, community college, and university levels; (2) developing  new STEM courses for the Ohio College Tech Prep Teacher Education Pathway; (3) creating a series of transitional activities for future STEM teachers (STEM Teacher Cadets)  that foster success in matriculating to the associate degree level; (4) facilitating the matriculation of STEM Teacher Cadets to the baccalaureate level through articulation agreements; and (5) integrating innovative uses of technology in teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThe new STEM teacher education program emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches for learning science and mathematics and integrates project-based learning, relevance, personalization, STEM content rigor, technology integration, and problem solving, exemplifying the strategies the prospective teachers are expected to employ in future STEM classrooms. The pedagogy that current STEM teachers are learning  and modeling for STEM Teacher Cadets helps both groups better understand the interrelations between science, mathematics, technology, and the real world of business and industry. Teachers have the opportunity to participate in industry externships to learn how STEM is used in area manufacturing, IT, biotechnology, and aerospace industries.  A web-based learning community called \"iDiscovery\" provides ongoing peer support for teachers during the academic year, following summer professional development institutes.  Current teachers as well as the STEM Teacher Cadets are being prepared to teach science and mathematics embedded in real-life contexts using best practice problem-solving and inquiry-based approaches.",
