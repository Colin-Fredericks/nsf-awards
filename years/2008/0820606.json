 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 21st Polymer Physics Gordon Conference will take place at Salve Regina in Newport, RI, the week of June 29th to July 4th, 2008.  The Conference which first ran in 1969 has remained a key meeting in the area of polymer physics by ensuring that each program is filled with top speakers  presenting their most current results in areas both new and enduring.  The 2008 Conference will combine breadth and depth, with talks by experimentalists and theoreticians representing academia, national labs and industry.  While the talks are by invitation only, all attendees are welcome to present posters.  The tradition of Polymer Physics has been that even the very well-known scientists who are attending (without being invited speakers) are thoroughly involved in the poster sessions.  It is worth noting that the diverse group of national and international speakers and session chairs includes a record number of women participants, lively and scientifically stimulating at Salve Regina this summer.\r\n%%%\r\nThe modest grant being requested here from the National Science Foundation will enable support for the attendance of scientists who are just starting their independent careers in this field.  A critical requirement in keeping a field vibrant and productive is that it continue to attract  bright and committed new members.  Once such individuals become invested in a research area it is equally important to help them make connections with established members.  The Gordon Conference offers unique opportunities in this regard.  It runs every two years, which allows for 'repeated exposure;' the daily routine makes one-on-one personal interactions a priority, in that talks are scheduled in the morning and after dinner, with the whole afternoon open for scientific-social interactions.  It is anticipated that participation in the upcoming Polymer Physics Gordon Conference will have a significant impact on its junior attendees.  This will come about because of the ideas which will be sparked or further developed as a result of insights and dialogue which take place during the meeting, as well as from the continuing scientific interactions and friendships which are formed and nourished as the week progresses.  The Polymer Physics community will be broadened and its future will be strengthened through the NSF support requested here.\r\n \r\n",
