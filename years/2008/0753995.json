 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support the Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2008 to be held April, 3-5, 2008 at the University of Delaware.  These seminars have been held annually since 1981; they have become one of the most important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, also reaching far beyond the limits of the North American continent in attracting participants.  Each seminar  brings together a diverse group of accomplished researchers and young investigators in probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. For this purpose, there are five invited speakers, successful young researchers as well as accomplished senior researchers, who lecture on the latest developments in the field during the morning sessions. The list of past invited speakers is a \"Who is Who\" in the world of probability today.  The afternoon sessions give graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering them the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field in an informal setting. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women and minorities as well as junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.\r\n",
