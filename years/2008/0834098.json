The Society of Engineering Science (SES) Annual Technical Meeting is one of the premier annual venues for exchange of research ideas in the field of engineering science and mechanics in the US.  The presentation competition will bring together dozens of top graduate students in the areas of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, bioengineering, applied mathematics, and other areas related to engineering science.  Students will deliver oral presentations on their research projects in regular conference symposia, and will compete with each other for prizes to be awarded at the conference banquet.  National Science Foundation support will subsidize reduced student registration fees for the conference in order to encourage participation in the presentation competition, and it will pay travel expenses for students selected among a prestigious group of finalists.\r\n\r\nThe support will have significant impact by encouraging broad participation among students in the activities of the Society of Engineering Science.  This will serve individual students by providing an opportunity to present their work at a major professional conference, and it will help to generate interest and participation among new members of the Society, which ultimately serves the broader technical community of researchers in engineering science and mechanics.",
