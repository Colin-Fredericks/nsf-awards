 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  II project is to develop a spatially-resolved bio-sensing technology based on spectroscopic swept-source optical coherence tomography (S-SSOCT) and gold nanoparticles as bio-sensors at 1060nm spectral region. The proposed system will advance contrast-enhanced molecular imaging of diseased tissue. The project will explore several contrasting agents for imaging applications, among these are; the traditional florescence and absorption dyes, to the latest semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles. The recently engineered gold nanoparticles possess superior light scattering and absorbing characteristics as well as long-term stability, and when bound to antibodies, can enable high-contrast molecular and cellular imaging of various diseases. \r\n\r\nThe advancement of biotechnology and nanotechnology will benefit greatly from the ability to perform spatially-resolved and sensitive imaging of diseases in molecular and cellular levels through contrast enhancing agents. One expected outcome of this project is to make it possible to track the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, treat disease, monitor responses to therapies, as well as to provide novel pairing of therapeutic and diagnostic processes. A particular goal of this project is to advance cancer diagnostic technology by developing a high-speed, high-resolution bio-medical imaging modality using gold nanoparticle as bio-conjugated sensors. This market is driven by synergy between various imaging methods (optical, nuclear, and magnetic) and new types of imaging agents. \r\n",
