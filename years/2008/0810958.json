 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generation, propagation, and energetic transport of ocean waves\r\nplay a crucial role in many technologies including near-shore\r\nwatercraft navigation, the design of deep-sea oil-drilling rigs, and\r\nthe generation and propagation of tsunamis.  However, the fundamental\r\ntechnologies for the remote detection and measurement of these\r\nnonlinear waves are based upon the scattering of linear acoustic or\r\nelectromagnetic radiation from the surface or bulk of the fluid.  Not\r\nsurprisingly, the state-of-the-art in theory, approximation, and\r\nnumerical simulation of these two disparate wave phenomena is quite\r\ndifferent.  In this proposal the Principal Investigator (PI) advocates\r\nthe development of a unified computational approach to these two\r\nproblems with the goal of producing a set of highly accurate, stable,\r\nand error-controllable numerical algorithms for the detection,\r\nsimulation, and evaluation of waves on the surface of large bodies of\r\nwater.  Over the past ten years the PI has developed a set of stable,\r\nhigh-accuracy Boundary Perturbation (BP) algorithms for the study of\r\nboth traveling ocean waves and scattering returns from irregularly\r\nshaped obstacles.  These BP algorithms each involve an independent\r\nperturbation parameter and the PI proposes to investigate a strategy\r\nof coupling these two disparate algorithms by linking these\r\nparameters, thus realizing huge computational savings.  Additionally,\r\nthe PI proposes to significantly extend and improve existing BP\r\nalgorithms for the simulation of linear waves in the high-frequency\r\nregime.  In short, the Geometric Optics solution points the way to a\r\nsolution Ansatz which can be represented with a frequency-independent\r\nnumber of unknowns.  The PI, in collaboration with F. Reitich, has\r\ndemonstrated how this Ansatz coupled to classical BP methods can be\r\nused to compute high-frequency scattering returns from shallow\r\nsurfaces with enormous computational savings.  In this proposal the PI\r\nadvocates the further development of these algorithms to incorporate\r\nthe scenario of multiple reflections.\r\n\r\nThe generation and propagation properties of ocean waves are crucial\r\nin many technologies including watercraft navigation, design of\r\ndeep-sea oil-drilling rigs, and the study of tsunamis.  However, the\r\nmethods for the measurement of these nonlinear ocean waves are based\r\nupon the scattering of linear acoustic or electromagnetic radiation.\r\nThe state-of-the-art in both the theory and practice of these two\r\ndisparate wave phenomena is quite different.  In this proposal the\r\nPrincipal Investigator (PI) advocates the development of a unified\r\napproach to the computation of these two problems with the goal of\r\nproducing a set of reliable and accurate numerical algorithms for the\r\ndetection and simulation of ocean waves.  This will involve the PI\r\nbringing together two separate threads of his research program to\r\nimplement this unified approach.  Additionally, he will need to expand\r\nthe capabilities of his algorithms to account for the highly\r\noscillatory character of the linear waves which arise in these\r\napplications.  The latter task will be particularly challenging and is\r\nthe current focus of a great deal of research by both civilian and\r\nmilitary agencies.\r\n",
