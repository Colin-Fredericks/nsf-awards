 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and decay dynamics of highly excited states in molecules is a research area that has provided a rich and diverse sampling of elucidating physics. The hydrogen molecule, being the simplest stable neutral molecule, is an especially important system for probing fundamental quantum mechanical effects in molecules. A dramatic example is a class of so-called double-well states of unusually large size.  The structure and dynamics of these molecular configurations have long been of interest to scientists, but their nature has made them very difficult to create and study.  The PI has developed a new excitation scheme that will allow us unprecedented access to these exotic states in molecular hydrogen.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the experimental measurements will provide an important incentive for the development of improved methods of calculating the structure of ?super-excited? molecular configurations where internal energies exceed ionization and dissociation thresholds and large ranges of molecular size must be considered. The results will provide new information about the dynamics of highly excited states of molecular hydrogen and their important role in many astronomical and atmospheric processes. This research program will be conducted at Bryn Mawr College and will provide young women an opportunity to obtain in-depth laboratory research experiences.  Engaged in research, members of this underrepresented group in physics will build mentor relationships and explore career expectations that can support their persistence and success in the physical sciences.\r\n",

Understanding processes such as photoionization, photodissociation, ion-pair formation and photo-association has required detailed and accurate knowledge of the unique way molecular systems behave. The hydrogen molecule, being the simplest stable neutral molecule, is an especially important system for probing fundamental quantum mechanical effects in molecules.  The structure of its energy levels continues to be a significant test of ab initio methods used to accurately account for deviations from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in molecular systems. \n\nA dramatic example of such a breakdown is a class of double-well states produced by strong avoided crossings between multiple potential energy curves. In H2, these states are formed by an avoided crossing at relatively small internuclear separation between a bound state and a doubly-excited dissociative state, and at large internuclear separation, by a crossing with the ion-pair configuration.  The result is a series of electronic states consisting of an inner and outer well separated by a potential energy barrier.  These potential energy curves support bound states of unusually large internuclear separation and atypical dynamics. While the double-well states in the gerade manifold of H2, have been studied extensively, those in the ungerade manifold have not.\n\nRecently, ab initio calculations of high-energy ungerade potential energy curves which correlate to the third and fourth dissociation limits were made, predicting double-well configurations that support bound states of exceptionally large size.  In the case of the 6th member of the series of states, it was predicted that it can be 10 times the size of the ground state. The members of the series are also predicted to follow closely the ion-pair configuration in large parts of their outer wells.  In principal then, the elusive heavy Rydberg series of ion-pair levels in H2 may also be observable in this energy region. \n\nThe unusual structure and dynamics of these molecular configurations have long been of interest to experimentalists, but these same features have also made them very difficult to create and study.  In our search, we used a double-resonance excitation scheme through the E,F, v=6 state to probe the rovibronic structure and dynamics of the predicted ungerade series of double-well states correlating to the third and fourth dissociation limits.  Resonances are observed by ionizing H(n=3) to produce H+, which is then detected by using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. \n\nRemarkably, our approached worked! The energies of the series of resonances that we observed agree well with the predictions of a mass-scaled Rydberg formula for bound quantum states of the H+ H- ion-pair Coulombic potential in which the electron in the atomic case is replaced by the composite H- ion.  The kinetic energy of the H+ ion confirms that the observed signal is due to the photo-ionization of neutral H(n=3) atoms, indicating that dissociation into H(n=1) + H(n=3) atomic fragments is a significant decay channel for the ion-pair states in this energy region.  Energies and quantum defects have been determined for principal quantum numbers in the range of n= 130 to 210.  These results are the first to be made in the frequency domain for states of ungerade symmetry.  They can be compared to earlier work of Vieitez, Ubachs and co-workers in the Netherlands, who, using a different excitation scheme, recently made the first spectroscopic observation of heavy gerade Rydberg states in H2. Our results also confirm a new theoretical approach by Kirrander that predicts a rapidly changing quantum defect for the series in this energy region.\n\nWhile the agreement with the one other experiment and theory to-date is favorable, several anomalies and intriguing complications are present in our mea..."
