 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator's proposed research has three parts.  The first \r\nconstructs representations using tools from topology and symplectic \r\ngeometry, especially the theory of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson, and \r\nextends those tools to larger classes of varieties.  The second tackles \r\nalgebraic and combinatorial projects that solve problems in the geometry \r\nof the associated varieties.  This subject is often called modern Schubert \r\ncalculus; specific projects include determining multiplication formulas \r\ninside the cohomology ring of flag varieties and Grassmannians.  The third \r\nfocuses on computational and enumerative geometric properties of \r\nvarieties, such as Hessenberg varieties, that arise in areas of \r\nrepresentation theory including the Langlands program.  The projects will \r\nidentify fundamental geometric properties of the varieties, like \r\npure-dimensionality, that are critical to advances in representation \r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nGeometric representation theory builds algebraic structures called \r\nrepresentations from geometric objects.  This leads to deep insights \r\nconnecting different mathematical disciplines, including algebra, \r\ngeometry, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. Crucially, a geometric \r\nrepresentation establishes a table of correspondences between geometry and \r\nalgebra.  On one hand, the table answers questions in representation \r\ntheory via geometry; on the other, it answers questions in geometry using \r\nalgebra and combinatorics.  The proposal includes projects to foster \r\nstudent development at all levels and to provide mentoring for women and \r\nother underrepresented minorities in mathematics.",
