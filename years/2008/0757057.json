 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed to increase the number of talented at risk undergraduate students receiving baccalaureate degrees in Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Earth Science, and Mathematics at Lamar University.  At risk students include women and minorities who are underrepresented in science, technology, and mathematics, as well as low income and first generation students who are at risk because of financial burdens and the lack of role models.  The goals are to: (1) retain talented at risk students; (2) help transition them into advanced study or careers in science; and (3) attract more students to the field.  Strategies include: (1) engaging STAIRSTEP students in an enriched research plan with tutoring, mentoring, and peer support; (2) using institutional relationships to help students bridge to the next level; (3) dispelling misconceptions that discourage participation in science; and (4) engaging STAIRSTEP students in outreach programs for high school students, community college students and university students in general studies or undeclared majors.  STAIRSTEP students are applying concepts they learn in class to their research, and their research is in turn incorporated into relevant classes.  The program is helping prepare new scientists for the global workforce by having them work in teams that are diverse, including men and women from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.  It is benefiting society by enabling at risk students to attain fulfilling careers in science, which in turn strengthens the field by the infusion of their diverse ideas and perspectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLamar University\u00c6s Students Advancing through Involvement in Research Student Talent Expansion Program (STAIRSTEP) received a 2013 Star Award from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board for making exceptional contributions towards closing the gaps in higher education in Texas.  The project was supported by a five-year National Science Foundation grant that started in January 1, 2009; and is currently supported by Lamar University. \n\nSTAIRSTEP targets talented \u00e6at risk\u00c6 students who are low income, first generation, and/or underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), including females, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Alaskan Natives.  These students face social and economic challenges that can make it difficult for them to progress to graduation.  STAIRSTEP\u00c6s goals are to recruit students, retain them, and transition them within six months of graduation to careers or advanced study in STEM.  The project focuses on five disciplines: Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth and Space Sciences, Mathematics and Physics.  Its success helps broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM and helps our high-tech society to meet the growing need for STEM professionals. \n\nThe project uses best practices for increasing participation in STEM.  Small teams of typically five undergraduates are paid competitive stipends to participate in research, outreach and transitioning activities under the direction of a faculty mentor in their discipline.  Teams can include freshmen through seniors.  The more advanced students help mentor, tutor and train the less experienced.  Working in teams gives the students a supportive peer environment that protects them from isolation.\n\nSTAIRSTEP is innovative in the range of students served (freshmen through seniors); the scope of services and activities (recruiting, retaining and transitioning); and its multi-disciplinary approach (five distinct STEM disciplines).  The broad ranging services and activities help fill the pipeline of incoming freshmen and develop the undergraduates\u00c6 professional and interpersonal skills that are needed throughout the continuum from entry to career transition. The model also provides a way to include undergraduates in research during their freshman and sophomore years, when retention is most at risk.\n\nThe research is discipline specific. Research areas include computational chemistry and chemical education; artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning and computer science education; subsidence and storm surges; properties of the G-graph of a group; and optics and photonics.  The research enhances the educational experience of the STAIRSTEP students and is often integrated into related courses.  The undergraduate STAIRSTEP students present their research at professional meetings and conferences.  Several have won awards for their research presentations, and STAIRSTEP has been a springboard for many to attain scholarships, fellowships and other research opportunities.\n\nThe five STAIRSTEP teams pool their resources to participate in a wide variety of outreach activities.  Participation in middle school, high school, and community college outreach activities helps the students develop their communication, teamwork and teaching skills.\n\nSTAIRSTEP has had a very positive direct measurable impact on its student participants.  Ninety-six undergraduates have participated in STAIRSTEP.  Over 89% have been retained in their STEM major.  STAIRSTEP participants have had much higher grades and dropped far fewer classes in their major that cohorts of students from prior years.  The program has had a significant impact on its participants\u00c6 growth in professional knowledge, skills, interest, abilities, and progression towards achieving the learning objectives of their discipline.  Over 86% of graduating student participants have transitioned to STEM careers or advanced study within six months of graduation. \n\nIts wide-reac..."
