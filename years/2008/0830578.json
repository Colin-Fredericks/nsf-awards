 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solvent interactions play a critical role in determining the structure and\r\nfunction of biomolecular systems.  However, accurate modeling is a challenging\r\ntask due to long-range correlations and vast numbers of solvent atoms and ions.\r\nFor very large systems, one method for reducing this expense is the application\r\nof an implicit solvent model which replaces the explicit atoms and ions with a\r\ndielectric continuum. One of the more accurate implicit solvent models is\r\ndescribed by a generalized Poisson equation or Poisson-Boltzmann equation with\r\npoint charge source terms. Although the generalized Poisson approach is\r\nconsidered in very many cases to be sufficiently accurate, most current methods\r\nfor approximating its solution have been deemed prohibitively expensive for\r\nvery large systems and for applications requiring rapid repetitive evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis project centers on the creation and analysis of algorithms of unsurpassed\r\neffectiveness for approximating the solution to the generalized Poisson\r\nequation (GPE) and its extensions. The approach involves solving for an\r\n\"effective charge distribution\" given by the Laplacian of the solution\r\nto the GPE.  The corresponding electrostatic potential can be recovered using\r\na fast N-body solver.  Broader impact of this project will be realized through\r\nthe incorporation of novel algorithms in simulation software.  Better methods\r\nand software in the hands of scientists will enable biomolecular simulation of\r\nmuch larger systems with improved accuracy which will result in contributions\r\nto society.  In addition, this project provides an opportunity for a graduate\r\nstudent to engage in research that spans computer science, physical science,\r\nand mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
