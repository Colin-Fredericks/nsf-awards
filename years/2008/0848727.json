 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds an NSF-funded programming contest for students in the Database Management Systems (DBMS) area at the ACM SIGMOD 2009 conference.  Student teams from degree-granting institutions will compete in a programming task selected by a committee of DBMS experts, including the principal \r\ninvestigators.  The topic chosen would be exciting to students, non-trivial to accomplish, and would have research potential.  The goals of the contest are to:\r\na)    Stimulate student interest in the DBMS field\r\n\r\nb)    Present a research challenge\r\n\r\nc)    Foster the creation of sharable open source code modules\r\n\r\nd)    Foster Computer Science education by creating a forum in which students can excel\r\n\r\ne)     Present a forum in which excellent students can get noticed, other than by writing papers.\r\n\r\nThe contest would be conducted during early 2009, with a bakeoff among \r\nthe finalists at the SIGMOD conference.  A substantial prize \r\n(approximately $5,000), donated by a DBMS company, will be awarded to \r\nthe winning team.  In addition, a conference speaking slot will give \r\nvisibility to the winner.  For more information visit the contest web \r\nsite, http://db.csail.mit.edu/sigmod09contest/.\r\n\r\nThe grant is used to support the creation of the necessary \r\ninfrastructure (test harness, test data, etc.) for the contest and for \r\ntravel grants for the contest finalists.  If successful in year 1, the \r\nprincipal investigators would make this an annual contest.",
