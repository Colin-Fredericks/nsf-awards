 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is based on an inventory of the freshwater insects of the waterways of the central and eastern Altai Mountains and southern Hangai Mountains in western Mongolia. Studies of aquatic insect  taxonomy and distribution provide important results for understanding evolution, biogeography, and ecology of aquatic communities.  Increasing economic development and human population growth in these western mountains are stressing both aquatic biological communities through mining, untreated wastes, agriculture, over-grazing, fires, and climate change.  This project will generate not only basic scientific knowledge of biological diversity, but also provide the Mongolian government a yardstick for monitoring water quality.  This proposal details a comprehensive, three-year sampling program for a range of aquatic macroinvertebrates to assess habitats and measure physical parameters. The expeditions will be collaborative with Mongolian scientists and students and non-Mongolian scientists.  Goals for this project include surveying the major groups of aquatic insects and other invertebrate groups, collaborative publication of the survey results, and development of associated databases.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project, which include the sampling of aquatic invertebrates along with the collection of water quality and riparian zone (streamside) measurements, will directly benefit efforts to establish a baseline for future water quality monitoring programs. The scientific knowledge will be useful in guiding Mongolia's government in its attempts to protect the environment and to develop eco-tourism.  The proposed survey will allow U.S. scientists to develop meaningful collaborations with current Mongolian scientists and to train Mongolian students in the field and laboratory.\r\n",
