 "awd_abstract_narration": "Torque and rotation are of paramount importance in many essential cellular processes including transcription. Transcription is the first step in gene expression and a major point of gene regulation. It is carried out by RNA polymerase which functions as a highly processive molecular motor that moves along the DNA template transcribing genetic information from DNA to create messenger RNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase is known to transcribe against DNA supercoiling. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase carries out transcription under torsional stress remains one of the most fundamental and intriguing problems in biology. The PI's lab will carry out a comprehensive set of single molecule experiments to investigate the regulation of E. coli RNA polymerase under a well-defined applied torque using an angular optical trap that has been developed in the PI's lab. Although the proposed project focuses on E. coli RNA polymerase, the general methodology and approach are readily extendable to viral and eukaryotic polymerases as well as many other DNA-based molecular motors. This project should prove to be a powerful cross-disciplinary approach for tackling important problems in biology.\r\n\r\nThe results of our work will be well disseminated through publications, presentations, and broader education to the community. The project will involve graduate students, undergraduate students, and even high school students in research. The PI also plans to involve undergraduate students to construct an optical tweezers mobile exhibition for the ScienCenter, a hands-on science museum in Ithaca, and to participate in various outreach activities organized by Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeveral decades of research have convincingly demonstrated that RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation can produce torsional stress in DNA (DNA supercoiling).  Despite the functional significance of transcription-generated supercoiling, the interplay between DNA supercoiling and RNAP is not well understood.  In particular, there is a lack of quantitative studies, stemming from the technical challenges of measuring minute biological torques,\n\nWe have successfully tackled this challenge by employing the angular optical trap (AOT), an instrument developed in our lab specifically for single-molecule torque measurements.  By monitoring E. coli RNAP transcription on a torsionally constrained DNA template in real time, we observed the dynamics of torque accumulation and its impact on the RNAP.  Specifically, we found that RNAP stalled at an average torque of 11 pN&middot;nm.  This torque is sufficient to disrupt the secondary structure of an arbibrary DNA sequence, which signifies that transcription-generated supercoiling has the potential to affect DNA stability genome-wide.  We also found RNAP to be resilient to both brief torque fluctuations and long periods of torque-induced stalling, the latter being a likely mechanistic adaptation to prevent accumulation of stalled polymerases in vivo.\n\nOur angular optical trapping techniques enable investigation of many processes that were previously inaccessible.  They are not limited to DNA-based motors, but could be applied to other molecular motors known to generate torsion, such as the bacterial flagellar motor and the F1-ATPase motor.  Inspired by work from our lab, a number of other labs have adopted angular optical traps for their own research. \n\nThe PI and her lab members have also been actively involved in science outreach activities.  The \"Launch Tube\", created by postdoctoral fellow Bob Forties from the PI\u00c6 lab, has become part of Cornell\u00c6s Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) Lending Library which allows teachers across the country to borrow science demos.  The \"Launch Tube\" gives students an intuitive understanding of the physics behind projectile motion by allowing them to explore and experiment hands-on.  Furthermore, it inspires students to think quantitatively as they acquire and graph data.  This science demo has been an immense success and has travelled across the country to various primary and middle schools and libraries.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michelle Wang"
