Minority faculty have an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. Consequently there will be the broadening of participation, and enhancing diversity within the Foundation?s programs as a vehicle to achieve the objectives of the America Competes Act.",
