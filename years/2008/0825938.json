 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building construction systems, such as Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) have demonstrated the capabilities for energy efficient and affordable housing but with inadequate resistance against wind storm loading and floods. The objective of the project is to, for the first time ever, adapt a new preforming process and low cost thermoplastic technology to develop innovative multifunctional envelop systems for sustainable housing and storm shelter through the evolution of Composite SIPs (CSIPs) concepts that will provide better energy efficiency, inherent flood resistance and substantially higher strength with much thinner structural panels. Adaptation of inexpensive natural fiber reinforced composite to replace conventional building materials will receive emphasis. Numerous issues regarding basic materials science and engineering, joining (including mechanical attachments and bonding), structural testing and analysis, and environmental performance modeling will be addressed to determine if the potential of CSIPs can be fully realized. \r\n\r\nThe potential payoff for success of this program could be rapid technology insertion into building systems needed for the rebuilding of homes in the gulf coast states and in flood prone areas since the approach builds upon existing construction systems concepts. The potential for these technologies to lead to low cost, energy efficient housing with superior resistance to natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes, and tornados is tremendous with excellent potential for transition into commercial applications. The spirit of interdisciplinary engineering education will be encouraged through cross-disciplinary educational program including web casting of large-scale tests and engaging the composites industry in the construction market.  \r\n        \r\n",
