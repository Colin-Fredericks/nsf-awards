 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Next-Generation Solvers for Mixed-Integer\r\n  Nonlinear Programs: Structure, Search, and Implementation\r\n\r\nMany scientific, engineering, and public sector applications involve\r\nboth discrete decisions and nonlinear system dynamics that affect the\r\noptimality of the final design.  Mixed-integer nonlinear programming\r\n(MINLP) optimization problems combine the difficulty of optimizing over\r\ndiscrete variable sets with the challenges of handling nonlinear\r\nfunctions.  MINLP is one of the most flexible modeling paradigms\r\navailable, and an expanding body of researchers and practitioners,\r\nincluding computer scientists, engineers, economists, statisticians, and\r\noperations managers, are interested in solving large-scale MINLPs.\r\nUnfortunately, the wealth of applications that can be accurately modeled\r\nby using MINLP is not yet matched by the capability of available\r\nalgorithms and software.  This research will address the mismatch\r\nbetween natural optimization models and available robust optimization\r\nsolvers, developing and delivering powerful new solvers for\r\nmixed-integer nonlinear programs. \r\n\r\nThe research thrusts are in three main categories.  In the first thrust,\r\nthe investigators study the structure of fundamental MINLP models,\r\ndeveloping preprocessing techniques and strong valid inequalities.  The\r\nsecond thrust, search, leverages the results of the structural analyses\r\nto design search and partitioning strategies for algorithms.  The third\r\nthrust, implementation, focuses on implementing the resulting\r\nalgorithmic frameworks efficiently on modern computational resources.\r\nThe project has the transformative goal of making MINLP into an area in\r\nwhich researchers and practitioners can access robust tools and methods\r\ncapable of solving a wide range of important, commonly occurring\r\ndecision support problems.\r\n\r\n",
