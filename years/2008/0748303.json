However, the fundamental question of how the central nervous system controls neck muscles to stabilize the spine is unresolved. The research objective is to understand how the activation of neck muscles complements passive tissue stiffness to achieve postural stability. The central research hypothesis is that the passive neck system is intrinsically unstable, and that activation of neck muscles provides the critical stiffness necessary for static and dynamic postural stability. The expected outcome of this research is to identify how the stiffness of active muscles contributes to head and neck stability under static postural conditions and following a perturbation to the head. Results of this study will enable future research on mechanisms of injury and neck pain, potentially leading to more effective prevention and treatment strategies.\r\n\r\nThe educational objective of this proposal is to utilize physical models of the head and neck to engage students in applying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Undergraduate students will build physical models that illustrate how physical and mathematical principles (e.g., trigonometry, mathematical functions, statics, inertia) can be used to analyze the head and neck system and answer interesting questions about neck injury. Through collaboration with an existing NSF GK-12 grant, these models will be integrated into high school classrooms with diverse cultural backgrounds. This educational program is expected to increase learning and interest in mathematics and physics among the participating students, especially among groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n",
