This workshop, to\r\nbe held July 6-10, 2009, at the CIRM (Luminy) conference center,\r\nconcerns equivariant generalizations of invariants defined by\r\nholomorphic curves.  In Gromov-Witten theory, equivariant\r\ninvariants have been extensively studied by Givental and others,\r\nin the sense of integrals of equivariant cohomology classes over\r\nmoduli spaces of stable maps.  The focus of the workshop will be\r\non the following more sophisticated version of equivariant\r\nGromov-Witten theory: the study of moduli spaces of maps to the\r\nstack-theoretic quotient of, say, a smooth projective variety by\r\na reductive group.  By definition, such a map consists of a\r\nholomorphic principal bundle, together with a section of the\r\nassociated bundle. From the symplectic point of view, suitable\r\nmoduli spaces of such pairs are known as moduli spaces of {\\em\r\nsymplectic vortices}.  The workshop is organized around this\r\nspecific direction, with an aim to bring together researchers in\r\nalgebraic and symplectic geometry who have had no previous\r\ninteraction.  On the other hand, the workshop will promote\r\ndiscussion of the interaction of holomorphic maps, gauge theory,\r\nand group actions more broadly.  Applications of the theory are\r\nexpected for instance, to the relation between Gromov-Witten\r\ntheories of different varieties, and to the relation between the\r\ngauge-theoretic invariants such as Floer-Donaldson invariants and\r\ntheir symplectic analogs.\r\n\r\nWe propose a workshop which will bring together gauge theory and\r\nholomorphic curves.  Gauge theory is the study of local symmetry\r\nin mathematics and physics; the most famous example is\r\nelectromagnetism.  Holomorphic curve techniques aim, in algebraic\r\ngeometry, to understand spaces by understanding the certain\r\nclasses of curves in them, or in symplectic geometry, to\r\nunderstand the periodic orbits of dynamical systems.  Symmetry of\r\nthe target varieties may be used as a computational tool, and\r\nalso combined with holomorphic curves to define new invariants.\r\nThe workshop will focus on recent developments and emerging\r\napplications to algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and\r\nlow-dimensional topology.  The workshop will benefit a number of\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in this area\r\nwho have had little interaction with other groups working on\r\nrelated problems.\r\n\r\nThe conference web-page controlled by the organizers is\r\nwww.math.rutgers.edu/~ctw/Luminy, while that controlled by the\r\nconference center CIRM is\r\nwww.cirm.univ-mrs.fr/web.ang/liste_rencontre/Rencontres2009/Renc346/Renc346.html.\r\n\r\n",
