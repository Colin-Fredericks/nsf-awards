 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origins of space and time are one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? Can we sensibly describe these singular highly quantum states of nature? In order to answer such basic questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of gravity. String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. The first aim of this project is to explore the nature of time in string theory through the study of both singular and non-singular time-dependent backgrounds. The second aim is to further explore the physics of flux compactifications with a focus on the heterotic string and the relation between moduli stabilization, the emergence of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and cosmology. The broader impact of this project centers on improved interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through lectures at schools and workshops, and through direct collaboration. A second aspect of the broader impact is via the PI continuing his participation in the Space Explorers innercity K-12 enrichment program.",
