 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, being conducted through a partnership between UCLA and the California Science Center, is focused on developing a series of professional development opportunities specifically targeting elementary teachers in grades 3-5. The California Science Content Standards for those grades are rich in Earth and Space Science topics, creating an important need for effective professional development resources that emphasize cross-curricular integration and the use of real-world observational techniques in the classroom. This project is testing the hypothesis that site-based, master teacher-led professional development activities are more effective for this audience than the more traditional summer workshop format.  In the course of investigating that premise, three grade-specific professional development summer workshops will be designed and offered to Los Angeles Unified elementary school teachers at the California Science Center.  Sustained partnerships between scientists and teachers will lead to creation of the more customized site-specific programs, which will be offered at the Culver City Unified School District.  Internships provided to twenty UCLA upper classman science majors participating in the California Teach program will enable them to playing an integral role in the design and implementation of this program, thereby enhancing their own communication skills and understanding of educational practice.  Both LA and Culver City school districts are urban, high-needs settings; improved teacher preparation will thus enhance the quality of Earth science instruction received by students underrepresented in the geosciences and help to advance efforts to broaden participation. Additional broader impacts of this project include the development of a Handbook for Scientists on how to effectively develop partnerships and programs for elementary science education, as well as strengthened collaborations between in-service elementary teachers, professional science education specialists, Earth science faculty and undergraduate students in the LA region.",
