Voronov\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to solve a number of important\r\nproblems in the rapidly developing fields of Topological Field\r\nTheory (TFT), Symplectic Field Theory (SFT), and Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory. The first part of the project will span from higher\r\ncategory theory, to cobordisms and to quantum field theories. The\r\nplan is to place cobordisms of manifolds with corners within an\r\nappropriate n-category framework and describe TFTs as n-functors\r\nfrom the n-category of cobordisms to that of n-vector spaces, as\r\nwell as show that physical models, such as gauge\r\n(Wess-Zumino-Witten), Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons, Seiberg-Witten\r\ntheories, and sigma-model may be described as such higher\r\nTFTs. The second part of the project consists in bringing\r\ntogether algebraic geometric and symplectic methods to construct\r\na full solution to the so-called Quantum Master Equation in\r\nGromov-Witten theory. This equation describes the topology of the\r\nmoduli spaces of holomorphic curves and relevant algebraic\r\nstructures, providing important invariants in symplectic and\r\nalgebraic geometry. The third part of the project aims at lifting\r\nGromov-Witten theory to the (Floer) chain level and developing a\r\ncombinatorial version of Gromov-Witten theory, thus bridging the\r\nareas of enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic Floer theory,\r\nand graph homology. The last, SFT part of the project will result\r\nin constructing a new compactification of the moduli space of\r\nRiemann surfaces, which would govern the algebraic operations and\r\ninvariants arising in SFT.  This compactification will be an SFT\r\nanalogue of the Deligne-Mumford compactification relevant to\r\nGromov-Witten theory.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at discovering and studying new algebraic\r\nstructures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematical\r\nphysics, in particular, string theory, Symplectic Field Theory,\r\nand Gromov-Witten theory.  Another long-term goal is to build a\r\nbridge between several mathematical cultures working on problems\r\nrelated to mathematical physics. These cultures include\r\nalgebraists, algebraic topologists, symplectic geometers,\r\nalgebraic geometers, and geometric topologists, to name a\r\nfew. The algebraic structures is a mathematical reincarnation of\r\nsuch fundamental structures of physical theories as correlators\r\nand relations between them (Ward identities). Understanding this\r\nstructure is crucial for understanding the physical theory. From\r\nthe point of view of mathematics, the project leads to new\r\nmathematical ideas, new algebra, geometry, and topology,\r\nmotivated by physics.\r\n",
