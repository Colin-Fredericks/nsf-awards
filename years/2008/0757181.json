 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis award provides partial support for the International Symposium, Complexity in Materials far from Equilibrium. The conference plans meet the expected standards of expertise in invited speakers and the associated merit of intellectual exchange of the highest caliber. The impact of the conference is deemed to be high because the topics represent the leading edge of science in the evolving field of complexity and nonequilibrium properties of materials. The subject area of the symposium extends the traditional field of statistical mechanics and invests in the newest science associated with biological materials and dynamics of living systems. The conference emphasizes the newest topics of the science bringing forward a range of theoretical and experimental techniques, but with a focus on elucidating fundamental coherent themes that underlie research and discovery and recent advances in complexity and nonequilibrium materials. \r\n \r\nNSF support will help to enhance the participation of minority and underrepresented groups at the conference, with special attention given to students and early career scientists.  The conference organizers demonstrate plans for diversity in the invited speakers, including substantial representation of women and minorities. There will also be broad international participation and so this extends the experiences of domestic participants as part of the global scientific community.  \r\n",
