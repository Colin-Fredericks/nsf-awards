These environments fuse multi-dimensional streams from multiple 3D cameras and other sensors across multiple sites to render a shared multi-view visual cyberspace at each site that immerses all participants. In the cyberspace, each participant manipulates herself (e.g., positions, size), and interacts with remote participants or graphical objects ?virtually?. \r\nA fundamental challenge in these environments is the need for effective real-time interaction among multi-site geographically distributed 3DTI environments and the PI observes that maintaining a consistent, information-rich shared visual context is the key to effective real-time interaction.  If the views of different participants become out of sync, their collaboration is severely disrupted. \r\nIn this project, the PI presents a novel view control management, called VIEWCALL. VIEWCALL presents (1) a holistic approach to view dissemination where the PI investigates forest construction and load balancing for view-centric stream dissemination among individual 3DTI environments; (2) a novel approach to visual context/feedback distribution due to dynamics in view or resource demands, and (3) new distributed algorithms for capturing, updating, coordinating and synchronizing view-based visual context metadata. \r\n\r\nThe VIEWCALL system has an impact on the 3DTI environments where research community investigates new forms of dance choreography, students learning tai-chi, in-home care of ageing population, computer gaming, and wheelchair-basketball coaches training players with movement disabilities. VIEWCALL is regularly shown at the annual UIUC?s Engineering Open House as well as to ChicTech all-schoolgirl summer camp. \r\n",
