Raab\r\nStanford University\r\n\r\nProposal # 0808604  \r\n\r\nInvestigators from San Diego State University, Washington University, and Stanford University will collaborate to study the role of iron and humic substances as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration in peat soils of drained thaw lake basins in the Arctic. The role of microbial physiology in carbon flux from Arctic soils has substantial implications of climate change, and the PIs will apply novel methods that promise new insights. The study will further our understanding of controls over and seasonal and spatial variability in of carbon fluxes from Arctic soils. The goals are to: (1) determine the specific mechanisms of exocellular electron transfer in Alaskan peat soils, and the microorganisms that mediate these processes, (2) quantify the importance of exocellular electron transfer to soil respiration in Arctic drained thaw lake basins, (3) determine the effects of polygon-induced microtopography on exocellular electron transfer, and (4) determine how age and complexity of soil humic materials along a soil age gradient affect rates of exo-electron transfer, and the conditions under which it occurs. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This type of process, where iron and HS are used as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration, has been studied in some wetlands but never before in Arctic soils. This process is tied directly to the carbon cycle and the production of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and so understanding this process in the Arctic is important for predicting what will happen to the large amount of carbon stored in frozen arctic soils as the climate warms. We studied soils in the Arctic Coastal Plain near Barrow, in northern Alaska. These soils are permanently frozen below about one foot deep, and this permafrost layer prevents water from draining away. Therefore these soils stay wet most of the summer, blocking the diffusion of oxygen into the soil, leading to anoxic conditions over much of the landscape. Under anoxic conditions, soil microbes switch to different types of anaerobic metabolism depending on what alternative electron acceptors are available. This ecosystem in unique in that the more commonly studied alternatives to oxygen, such as nitrate and sulfate, are available in very small amounts, but large amounts of oxidized iron is present, in both soluble and insoluble forms. The large amount of organic matter that develops in these soils over time from the partial decomposition of dead plants also contributes to the production of HS. Respiration of iron oxides and HS are different from respiration using oxygen or small, simple, soluble compounds like nitrate or sulfate, in that both require the microbes to transfer electrons outside of their cells to these large, complex extracellular electron acceptors. In fact, the same microbes that breathe with iron and HS can also generate electricity in devices called microbial fuel cells, in which they use an electrode as an electron acceptor.

Despite the variations in iron across the landscape, there was enough iron to allow for high rates of anaerobic respiration. However, CH4 production decreased in areas with more iron.
