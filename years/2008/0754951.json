This \r\nnew site provides ten-week summer research experiences at the University \r\nof Maine (UMaine) for ten undergraduates each year for three years. With \r\nintegrated expertise of ten faculty researchers from both computer \r\nsystems and domain applications, SuperMe allows each undergraduate to \r\nconduct meaningful research, such as developing supercomputing techniques \r\nand tools, and solving cutting-edge research problems through parallel \r\ncomputing and scientific visualization. Besides being actively involved \r\nin research groups, students attend weekly seminars given by faculty \r\nmentors, formally report and present their research experiences and \r\nresults, conduct field trips, and interact with ITEST, RET and GK-12 \r\nparticipants. \r\n\r\nSuperMe provides scientific exploration ranging from engineering to \r\nsciences with a coherent intellectual focus on supercomputing. It \r\nconsists of four computer systems projects that aim to improve \r\ntechniques in grid computing, parallel I/O data accesses, \r\nhigh-resolution scientific visualization and information security, \r\nand five computer modeling projects that utilize world-class \r\nsupercomputing and visualization facilities housed at UMaine to \r\nperform large, complex simulation experiments and data analysis in \r\ndifferent science domains. SuperMe provides a diversity of cutting-edge \r\nresearch opportunities to students from under-represented groups or from \r\nuniversities in rural areas with limited research opportunities. Through \r\ninteracting directly with the participant of existing programs at UMaine, \r\nincluding ITEST, RET and GK-12, REU students disseminates their research \r\nresults and experiences to middle and high school students and teachers. \r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership \r\nwith the NSF REU Site program.",
