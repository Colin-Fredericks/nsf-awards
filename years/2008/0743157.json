 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flowering plant group Carex subgenus Vignea is a large and difficult group of sedges (Cyperaceae), including approximately 300 species worldwide.  Dr. Eric H. Roalson (Washington State University) and Dr. Andrew L. Hipp (The Morton Arboretum) propose to conduct a thorough evolutionary study of this diverse group.  Sedges are critical but poorly understood ecological components of riparian, alpine/tundra, and meadow habitats worldwide. Characterizing species differences and evolutionary patterns is critical to conserving biodiversity and defining the ecological function of the species. Drs. Roalson and Hipp will use variation in DNA sequences and genome structure to study the diversification of major lineages and evolutionary innovations in the genus.  These studies will also lead to a taxonomic revision of the group and new tools for species identification.\r\n\r\nThis proposal involves training undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate researchers in gathering and analyzing biosystematic data.  Online resources will be developed to aid scientific and lay workers in identifying species in this group, which will greatly facilitate ecological and biodiversity studies.  Finally, our results will be disseminated to the wider scientific and general audience communities through scientific publication, presentation of results at national and international meetings, and enhanced collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
