 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a discipline-specific, well-designed program focusing on women\r\nin atmospheric science/meteorology to create leaders for advancement.\r\nThe emphasis during the proposed three-day Atmospheric Science Collaborations and\r\nEnriching Networks (ASCENT) summer workshop program and follow-up reunion\r\nevents will be to initiate positive professional relationships, among female faculty of\r\ndifferent ranks and postdoctoral researchers. These individuals will work in teams (each\r\nsenior scientist will be paired with two junior scientists) and foster connections.\r\nFurthermore, while networking with like-minded women scientists, participants will have\r\nthe opportunity to explore specific promising practices toward eliminating the \"leaky\r\npipeline,\" defined by the attrition of women at different stages in their academic careers.\r\nBy fostering relationships among women faculty and researchers, ASCENT will\r\ndemonstrate a commitment to developing research bases and improve the quality of\r\ncollaborative atmospheric research conducted at multiple universities and colleges.\r\nASCENT has been designed to achieve the following specific goals:\r\n1) Ensure that junior women scientists know about and have access to resources and\r\npeople who can help guide them through their career and life path.\r\n2) Encourage positive mentorship and create mentoring opportunities.\r\n3) Learn and teach others about primary obstacles for women in atmospheric sciences\r\nand meteorological fields, and develop or share communication tools to assist in\r\nnavigating these obstacles.\r\n4) Meet potential scientific collaborators at other institutions.\r\nIn order to ensure success and longevity of the proposed workshop and collaborative\r\nexperience, an extensive evaluation program will be implemented. The process will\r\nbegin at the initial stage of workshop development; continue throughout duration of the\r\nworkshop and past termination to determine long-term outcomes. Evaluation findings\r\nwill be disseminated in professional forums, such as conferences or refereed journals.\r\nThroughout these workshops, the organizers will assemble knowledge on techniques\r\nand methodology to strength the participation of women within the fields of atmospheric\r\nscience and meteorology. This information will be disseminated to this academic\r\ncommunity via Eos and Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS).\r\nASCENT will also produce a bi-annual electronic newsletter to provide summaries of\r\n\"lessons learned\" and current literature regarding the advancement of women in\r\ngeoscience. This newsletter will be sent to all participants in the workshops, the Earth\r\nScience Women's Network (ESWN) list serve, and other interested parties.",
