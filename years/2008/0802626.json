 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant proposal describes several directions of\r\nresearch to be undertaken by Jay Jorgenson and his co-authors\r\nwhich, somewhat generally, build on his prior investigation of\r\nnumber theoretic applications of heat kernel and heat kernel\r\nanalysis. Previous work by Jorgenson with J\\\"urg Kramer focus on\r\nanalytic aspects of Arakelov theory.  Continuing this work,\r\nJorgenson and Kramer recently established a relation between\r\ncertain L-functions attached to non-holomorphic Maass forms and\r\nL-functions attached to holomorphic forms of weight two.  Part of\r\nthe proposed research describes work to be carried out by\r\nJorgenson and Kramer which studies the application of their\r\nL-function relation to questions involving bounds of Fourier\r\ncoefficients of Maass forms. Additionally, the Jorgenson and\r\nKramer collaboration has resulted in projects involving the\r\ninter-relations between hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic\r\nEisenstein series.  The research proposal describes a number of\r\nproblems which remain in this direction.  In collaboration with\r\nGautam Chinta and Anders Karlsson, Jorgenson has initiated a\r\nprogram of study of heat kernels and analytic number theory\r\nassociated to totally disconnected spaces, including discrete tori\r\nand Cayley graphs associated to finite groups.  The proposal\r\noutlines further questions to be investigated by Jorgenson in his\r\njoint research efforts with Chinta and Karlsson.\r\n\r\nThe heat kernel, and heat kernel analysis, is present\r\nin many areas of mathematics and related fields.  For example, one\r\ncomponent of the joint research undertaken by Chinta, Jorgenson\r\nand Karlsson is to study determinants of certain matrices\r\nassociated to graphs associated to finite groups.  Going back as\r\nfar as Kirckhoff in 1847, connections have been known which\r\nestablish relations between these determinants and other\r\ndisciplines, such as electrical engineering and chemistry.  More\r\nrecently, one can say that a considerable amount of financial\r\nmathematics and financial engineering is built on heat kernel\r\nanalysis.  In addition to specific research problems posed by\r\nJorgenson which relate to finance, his teaching duties include\r\ncurricular development activities involving financial engineering\r\nand bio-statistics courses, all of which benefit from Jorgenson's\r\nresearch program.  Finally, the proposal describes a wide range of\r\nproblems which are assessable to students of many levels, ranging\r\nfrom advanced undergraduate students to recent Ph.D.'s.\r\n",
