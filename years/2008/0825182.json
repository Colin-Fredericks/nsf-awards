Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research. The project will furthermore contribute to the state-of-the-art in hazards research by developing knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help building occupants, their rescuers and city officials respond appropriately during extreme events.",

Men had lower tendency of hearing blast. Presence in  Murrah Building negatively related to hearing blast, contradicting common sense since people in building should have had a greater chance of hearing explosion; 2. Receiving assistance in evacuating was not significant predictor of hearing explosion but assistance from other victims showed negative relationship; 3. Respondents with more severe injuries had lower rather than greater chances of hearing explosion: 4. Hearing blast was not significant predictor of entrapment by rubble. It is as if victims gave \ngreater importance to what they perceived critical to survival in what may be termed as time acceleration. \n \nMoore, Oklahoma tornado of May 2013\n1. Ten sections of town most severely impacted by tornado had different lead times or number of minutes between when a warning is given and storm impacts area; question was if people with homes in first sections of path of tornado reported lesser sense of urgency since they had smaller lead times and would have been focused almost entirely on immediate threat, as acceleration effect would predict. Against hypothesis, respondents reacted similarly  irrespective of zone. There is need for better design to test hypothesis. \n2. Strong disaster subculture in Moore perhaps explains near uniform responses irrespective of zones, to wit: 40% respondents prepared to face tornado one minute after warning; 92% ready in eight minutes; for 68% response preplanned; for 72% someone in household decided beforehand protective action; 40% used underground shelters in their homes, 29% in their neighbors'. They used many sources of warnings: 66.7% received warnings from TV; 50% from radio; 73% from both sources; 25 % called by one or more of four categories of kin---dad, mother, grandparents, siblings; 40% prepared to face tornado one minute after warning was given!, 92% in eight minutes. These numbers showed extraordinary levels of protection.\n \nComputer Simulation of the 2003 Station Nightclub Evacuation\nInformation used in simulation comes from analysis of evacuation data made available in World Wide Web. Fire killed 100 and injured nearly 200 persons; fourth deadliest in US history.  \n1. Building had four exits and two sets of windows. 128 victims evacuated through main exit, 78 used bar exit, 17 used  kitchen exit, 24 used stage exit door; 71 through front windows and 34 through greenhouse windows.  There were 179 groups.  Majority was located either in bar area---mostly males, or in dance area, near stage---with large proportion of females. When fire started patrons searched for members of their groups; resulting delays accounted for high morbidity.\n2. Research  looked at  behavioral differences existing between survivors and  victims, documented existence of role extension among employees of  nightclub, providing support for claim that dangerous contexts negate  protective influence of intimate relations in groups. Conclusions argued  for abandonment of  emphasis on irrationality and herd?like imitative behavior in studies of evacuation and  inclusion of group?level processes in social psychological explanations of these incidents.\n3. Results and other information helped develop an  Agent Base Computer simulation model (ABM) to answer \"what &ndash;if\" questions. 100 simulations generated data for each avatar every 15 seconds of the first 150 seconds of the fire. Analysis tested various attributes of agents, including presence of supra force (see below.) Location and behavior data of agents over time made it was possible to determine building areas conducive to supra force emergence. ABM tracked comprehensive data about every agent, including current status of avatar and its gr..."
