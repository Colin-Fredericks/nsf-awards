Organized by Dr. Javier Rojo of Rice University, the PASI will address cutting edge topics in theoretical statistics and applications to genetics and bioinformatics. Top researchers from Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay, and the United States will present cutting edge research in the areas of Statistical Finance, Statistical Multivariate Methods, Dimension Reduction, Survival Analysis with Microarray Data, Bioinformatics, and Statistical Genetics. \r\n\r\nThe activity will provide 45 young researchers (including advanced PhD students, post-docs, and young faculty) with support for the duration of the Institute.  Expected outcomes in this PASI will include: re-energized efforts in Latin America in theoretical statistics and their applications, enhanced collaborations between U.S. and Latin American researchers, and increased student exposure and experience to new fields of knowledge.  The PASI results will be disseminated through lecture notes and proceedings to be published through the CIMAT and Rice University technical report series and will be mailed to all the participants. The lecture notes will also be made available on-line. \r\n\r\n",
