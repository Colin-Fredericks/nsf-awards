 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project on the Theory and Practice of Accountable Systems investigates computational and social properties of information networks necessary to provide reliable assessments of compliance with rules and policies governing the use of information. In prior research, project leaders have demonstrated that achieving basic social policy goals in open information networks will require increased reliance on information accountability through after-the- fact detection of rule violations. This approach stands in contrast to the traditional mechanisms of policy compliance in network environments that rely on security technology to enforce rules by denial of access to resources at risk of abuse. So, access-based systems must be supplemented with accountability-based systems. To ensure that accountable systems can provide a stable, reliable, trustworthy basis on which to ground social policy arrangements in the future, it is necessary: 1) to research practical engineering approaches to designing these systems at scale, and 2) to develop a theory of the operating dynamics of accountable systems in order to establish what types of accountability assessments can be made, when those assertions are reliable, and what vulnerabilities accountable systems may have to attack, intrusion and manipulation. The key hypothesis to be tested regarding Information Accountability is that people are more likely to comply with rules (social or legal) if they believe that their non-compliance will be noticed. Successful study and development of accountable systems will ultimately enable real people, communities and institutions to take advantage of Information Accountability as a means of achieving better privacy and compliance with other information usage rules. \r\n",

Then, given the large scale of data collection and analysis now common (aka \u00e6big data\u00c6), we need to be able to design reliable, scalable computational mechanisms to help prevent against such misuse.\n \nThe research team has pioneered the design of \u00e6accountable systems\u00c6, information systems that are able to detect violations of rules and hold those who break rules accountable for their actions. The overall goal of this research is to ensure that accountable systems can provide a stable, reliable, trustworthy basis on which to ground social policy arrangements in the future. In furtherance of this goal, the TPAS project has developed practical engineering approaches to designing these systems at scale, and explored a theory of the operating dynamics of accountable systems in order to establish what types of accountability assessments can be made, when those assertions are reliable.\n \nThrough NSF-supported research, we have developed working systems that can represent information rules in machine-readable policies and then use those policies to compute automated assessments of whether information usage in a given system complies with the applicable rules. Not only are we able to determine whether or not information usage complies with the rules, but also we can offer the user human-readable explanations of how the system make its policy analysis. The reasoning done by our computerized reasoning system is presented in a form that is close to the legal reasoning often employed by privacy lawyers. Our research also addresses the fact that organizations are often subject to many different rules. Using linked data technology, we are able to bring together a number of different rule sets and apply them to diverse data formats.\n\n\n \nRecognizing that privacy implicates significant legal and public policy issues, our research has been conducted in close cooperation with legal and policy experts. We have developed technical tools that meet the needs of legal experts and conducted research workshops that bring together computer scientists, legal scholars and government regulators and policy officials. These interdisciplinary activities will help assure that our research has broader impact on the privacy policy issues that have motivated our work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/10/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold Abelson"
