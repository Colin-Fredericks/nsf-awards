One approach to continue scaling is to work out approaches to extend and enhance the underlying CMOS technology that serves as the cornerstone of Moore?s Law.  It is CMOS technology that is used to build the computer and other chips that drive the electronics revolution.  In this effort, we propose to extend CMOS technology by including nanocrystal films in the transistors.  This enables new types of functions to be designed.  We will investigate how to design the computer circuits that would be enabled by this new device.\r\n\r\nAs well as pursuing appropriate involvement with Undergraduates, and integration with coursework, this activity will also help us continue to support the NCSU Physical Design Kit ( www.eda.ncsu.edu ).  This kit enables the design of ICs in the MOSIS processes using popular commercial design tools.  This kit has been downloaded by over 2,000 organizations, including most major Universities.  We are constantly upgrading this kit as new processes become available and other improvements are deemed necessary. Currently, we (with Davis and others) are adding a notional 45 nm kit for classroom use.\r\n",
