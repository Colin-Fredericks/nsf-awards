 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dena'ina is an endangered Athabascan language of Alaska, with fewer than 75 speakers remaining.  There are four primary dialects: Upper Inlet (spoken in Eklutna, Tyonek, Susitna, and Knik); Outer Inlet (spoken on the Kenai Peninsula); Inland (spoken in Nondalton, Lime Village); and Illiamna (spoken in Pedro Bay, Old Illiamna, Lake Illiamna).   Although linguists have recorded a great deal of the language in the past, little has been transcribed or organized into conceptual domains. With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Patricia Partnow of the Alaska Native Heritage Center and her team will conduct three years of research on linguistic domains in the context of rites of passage and coming of age in the Dena'ina villages of Nondalton and Lime Village. The end products of this project will include new audio and video contextualized field recordings. These recordings will be translated, digitized and indexed, then supplemented by existing language materials, and together will encompass twelve aspects of \"coming of age\" for Dena'ina men and women.\r\n\r\nWithout concentrated fieldwork of this sort, the language is destined for extinction before the middle of this century.  The challenge facing Dena'ina learners (three of whom will conduct the bulk of this research) is having both the opportunities for learning the language in meaningful contexts and learning information that is relevant to the needs and interests of the learners themselves.  This project will result in a corpus of contextualized language recordings that can be produced as web pages, video teaching tools, and podcasts for dissemination to anyone with an interest in the language.  At the same time, young Dena'ina language learners will become proficient in conducting linguistic fieldwork and will improve their skills in translating and transcribing oral texts.\r\nUnderstanding the Dena'ina linguistic domains and the context in which the language is spoken and taught is fundamental to the success of this project.\r\n\r\n",

A CD entitled \"Dena\u00c6ina Language Packet:  Pronunciation [Guide] with Joan Tenenbaum\" was produced by the Alaska Native Heritage Center in collaboration with the Kenaitze Indian Tribe, with additional support from the Administration for Native Americans.

Alan Dick prepared a synopsis of each recording to assist with selection of tapes for transcription and translation.  Tenenbaum and Mitchell conducted a second workshop on developing skills for transcription of Dena\u00c6ina audio files. A key strategy assisted new transcribers:  having fluent speakers repeat slowly and clearly for re-recording the words spoken during the original interviews.  This procedure assisted transcribers in hearing and writing more accurately.  \n\n In total, 31.2 hours of new interviews were transcribed. Linguist James Kari reviewed, edited, and commented upon several of the transcriptions, which contributed markedly to the skills of the new transcribers.  Dr. Kari also transcribed and translated 24 recordings of 10 Dena\u00c6ina elders: Emma Alexie, Pete Bobby, Helen Dick, Alexie Evan, Antone Evan, Ruth Koktelash, Shem Pete, Alexandra Allowan, Katherine Nicolie, and Hamushga Zakhar.
