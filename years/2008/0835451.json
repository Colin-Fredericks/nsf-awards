 "awd_abstract_narration": "This support by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the National Science Foundation Chemistry Division is to encourage participation in a Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) Workshop by graduate students and postdoctoral, with an emphasis for women and minorities, and encourage training of next generation SECM users and developers. The goal of this 3-day workshop is to bring leading scientists in the field of SECM together in order to stimulate intensive discussions and initiate national and international collaborations. This workshop will be different from symposia on SECM that have been held at national meetings (e.g. American Chemical Society, Pittcon, and Electrochemical Society) in that it will allow much more time for both formal and informal discussions, especially between senior investigators and students or postdoctoral fellows. SECM technology has had a wide impact in a variety of scientific fields including fundamental electrochemistry, corrosion science, electrocatalysis, liquid-liquid interfaces, biochemistry, biology and high-resolution imaging. This workshop will facilitate interactions between scientists from ten countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, United Kingdom, United States) with broad and complementary research interests in SECM who would normally not have the opportunity to meet.",
