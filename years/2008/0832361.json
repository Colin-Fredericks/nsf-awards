 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Denver is planning to join the existing multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Safety, Security, and Rescue Research (SSR-RC).  The current center is built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Minnesota (lead university).  The primary focus of the proposed site will be on developing novel, heterogeneous, and modular mobility and sensing components; and integrating these diverse capabilities into reliable systems.   The proposed site also brings some novel research aspects that are not represented in the universities currently participating in the SSTR-RC.  For example, the proposed research site has recognized expertise in the development and delivery of infectious disease cultures and their vaccines.  Furthermore, the University of Denver brings expertise in software engineering that is critical to the systems aspects of the center?s agenda and also valuable to companies looking to commercialize medium term academic research.\r\n\r\nThe activities proposed by the University of Denver (UD) research site will impact many important technology needs in the commercial and public sectors.  Together, with the support of partner companies and other campuses, new small-scale sensors will be developed and integrated with robust mobile platforms and truly human-centric interfaces, leveraging close cooperation with the user community in real application scenarios.  The site director has a diversity plan for the I/UCRC that makes specific efforts to attract under-represented groups to fill research, undergraduate and graduate positions.    \r\n",
