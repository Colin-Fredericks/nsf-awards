 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ordinary construction materials, including concrete, can now be made photocatalytically active by the introduction of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2), particularly in the tetragonal anatase form. In the presence of water, oxygen, and ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet light, a series of reactions occurs on the TiO2 surface, imparting self-cleaning, biocidal, and smog-abating qualities to the surfaces of the materials which contain it.  In particular, the potential for passive smog-abatement by photocatalysis has attracted much attention. This research will characterize the long-term compatibility between photocatalytically active materials and their cement-based substrates.  A comprehensive research plan, which relies upon microchemical analysis and nano/micro-scale and bulk measures of mechanical properties (e.g., nanoindentation, microhardness, compressive strength), will be used to better understand the initial material structure and properties, characterize the influence of photocatalysis on surface and bulk properties, and describe the influence of material variables and environmental parameters on performance.  \r\n\r\nVerification of, and potential improvements to, the long-term performance of cement-based construction materials with smog-abating capabilities is an intrinsic broader impact of this research. Additional impact will be made through the mentoring and training of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate researchers in a multi-disciplinary research environment, the publication of research findings, and by the research team?s participation in international research conferences. Finally, the research team will develop high-school appropriate tutorials on the topic of photocatalytic construction materials and will seek to make these publicly available through existing web portals at Georgia Tech.\r\n",
