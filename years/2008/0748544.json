 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new exciting and profound question was brought up by the confirmation of neutrino oscillations: Can the source of the matter/anti-matter asymmetry of the universe be explained by CP violation in the neutrino sector? The answer to this fundamental question strongly depends on the magnitude of observable CP violation effects, which is, restricted by the size of the neutrino oscillation angle theta-13. The PI proposes a combined research and educational project focused on a highly sensitive search for a non-zero value of this neutrino mixing angle with the Double Chooz experiment. This experiment will measure, or significantly improve the upper limit on, the value of sin^2 (2theta-13) from 0.2, as measured by CHOOZ experiment, to 0.026.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to build a multi-axis calibration system that will greatly enhance the precision of the measurement. Precise and comprehensive calibrations are critical to the minimization of systematic errors and the success of the Double Chooz experiment. The development, utilization and optimization of the articulated robotic arm system, and the analysis of the data obtained from the full volume calibration are all part of this five year research and education project. Besides providing an important augmentation for the Double Chooz experiment, the development of an articulated, robotic arm calibration system and its usage will also have important applications to future neutrino experiments where full target volume calibration systems will be of increasing importance. \r\n\r\nThe PI is strongly committed to extending the scope of her research program to educate a broad range of students. A highly interactive multimedia web site that will introduce the physics of neutrinos and the Double Chooz experiment to high school students and their teachers as well as interested members of the general public will be designed and developed.\r\n",
