 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: Magnetic interactions between hard and soft magnetic phases in nanostructured two-phase composites result in permanent magnet materials with significantly enhanced magnetic properties. The properties dramatically increase with increasing soft magnetic phase fraction. However, in granular materials the soft magnetic phase fraction is limited to about 15 percent by the development of soft magnetic grain/soft magnetic grain neighbors. However, the development of novel nanostructures via eutectic phase transformations offers the potential to increase the volume fraction of the soft magnetic phase to 20-30 percent. The objective of this project is to develop microstructural selection maps for ternary Sm-Co-T alloys in the vicinity of the binary Sm-Co eutectic at 8 atomic percent Sm. With this information, alloys can be designed with high Co content with eutectic structures that avoid formation of primary Co. The microstructural selection maps will be determined for both conventionally processed alloys and after rapid solidification. Rapid solidification processing effectively refines the scale of the soft magnetic phase to the nanostructural level necessary for effective exchange interactions between the hard and soft magnetic phases. The magnetic properties of the nanocomposite permanent magnets will be determined from hysteresis loops as a function of temperature in order to understand the behavior of nanocomposite permanent magnets as a function of temperature. DC demagnetization and isothermal remanence magnetization measurements will provide additional insight into the magnetic behavior, especially the reversal processes and interphase magnetic interactions. The magnetic behavior of the nanocomposites will be closely tied to the nanostructures by characterizing structures using x-ray diffraction and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography and three-dimensional field ion microscopy will also be used to characterize the nanostructures; this will be accomplished in collaboration with Dr. Frederic Danoix of the University of Rouen in France. NON-TECHNICAL: Rare earth permanent magnets are integral to technological advancements. As a result, continued development of improved permanent magnets directly benefit society by providing advanced electronic devices, new medical imaging capabilities, and countless other applications, some known and some not yet imagined. Additionally, the research will provide fundamental understanding of solidification of ternary alloys at and near eutectic compositions. This project will also educate and train the next generation of scientists and industry leaders, primarily through the integration of teaching and research by involving undergraduate and graduate students in research. Collaborative research with researchers at the University of Rouen is planned, with graduate students involved with short-term visits to the University of Rouen to conduct the research experiments. Collaborations with researchers at National Laboratories and use of national user facilities will also expand the experiences of students involved in this project. The PI has also developed a course in nanomaterials, and discoveries made in this project will be incorporated into it.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPermanent magnets are a critical component in a wide variety of automotive applications, electronic devices and for energy conversion. For example, high-efficiency permanent magnet motors find many automotive applications, including as traction drive motors in hybrid and electric vehicles.  The high precision of voice coil motors are critical components of hard disk drives, and the wind generators dotting the landscape are possible because of high-strength permanent magnets.\n\nWith the widespread use of permanent magnets, new alloy development to both improve performance and use less of the critical rare earth materials is important.  Enhanced performance will allow further miniaturization of devices, or improve efficiencies.  This project developed new materials in the high-strength permanent magnetic based on samarium (Sm) and cobalt (Co).  The focus was on reducing the Sm content by exploiting a phenomenon known as \"exchange coupling.\"  Here, an alloy contains two different magnetic phases, or regions with differing atomic arrangements.  Figure 1 shows a nanoscale arrangement of two phases.  If the scale of the regions is on the order of a few nanometers, the magnetic phases behave cooperatively, and can result in enhanced performance.  This project examined different combinations of elements, and the resulting changes in behavior.  One part examined the role played by iron (Fe) if substituted for Co on the developing microstructure.  With increasing Fe, a transition to a less-favorable microstructure was observed (Figure 2).  Thus, the limit on Fe substitution was determined.  Additionally, this project discovered new alloys with excellent magnetic performance, including an alloy with the highest room-temperature coercivity ever produced (the coercivity is the magnetic field required to reverse polarity).\n\nThis project also played a critical role in educating and training future scientists and engineers. Two students completed thesis work required for their Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering under this project, while another initiated her Ph.D. research with support from this grant.  The two M.S. students, Ms. Wendy Keeler and Mr. Brian Dick, are currently employed as engineers.
