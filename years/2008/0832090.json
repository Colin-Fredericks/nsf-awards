 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historical static spectrum allocation has led to an artificial spectrum \r\nscarcity, leaving no usable spectrum for  future wireless networks. \r\nDynamic spectrum access is the ideal solution to break such scarcity and \r\nmake spectrum available to new wireless networks.  However, without \r\nproviding proper reliability guarantees, dynamic spectrum access is \r\nunacceptable to many networks and services.   Thus, instead of focusing \r\nsolely on improving spectrum utilization, dynamic spectrum access should \r\nprovide reliable spectrum usage that meets network's individual needs. \r\nThis research develops SAFIRE, a robust architecture for dynamic spectrum \r\naccess that provides reliable and efficient spectrum usage to large wireless \r\nnetworks.  This research holds great practical values for wireless network \r\ndesigners and service providers who rely on available and reliable spectrum \r\naccess to deploy and advance their networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecognizing the fundamental tradeoffs between spectrum utilization and \r\nreliability, this research focuses on efficient algorithms to meet \r\nindividual networks? reliability requirements while improving spectrum \r\nutilization. The investigators will develop statistical mechanisms to \r\nproactively regulate spectrum demands based on their reliability requirements,  \r\nand apply distributed coordination and cross-layer design to quickly adapt \r\nspectrum allocations and application patterns to network and spectrum dynamics.  \r\nTo support large-scale dynamic networks, this research focuses on \r\ncomputational-efficient mechanisms with minimum management overhead.  \r\nThese advancements will help attract large commercial interests into \r\ndynamic spectrum systems, facilitating their wide adoption.  Finally, \r\nthe investigators will use this research as a basis to develop \r\ninterdisciplinary computer science training across both software and \r\nhardware layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
