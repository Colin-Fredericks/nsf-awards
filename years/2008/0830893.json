  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant was beneficial to Idaho State University and the general public.  This scholarship for service (SFS) program benefited Idaho State University by creating an opportunity for 44 students complete a Master\u00c6s in Business Administration program.  This MBA course was expanded with the addition of an interdisciplinary set of information assurance courses that result in a very employable information assurance federal employment candidate. We require our students to dedicate twenty hours a week to information assurance projects and programs.  These students are immersed in a critical thinking environment.  The grant provided them a stipend, paid their tuition, providing their books for classes and supported their trip to the SFS job fair.  In return, the students are obligated to a year of information assurance government service for each year of academic support. \n\nAll 44 students found employment with government agencies in the information assurance sector upon graduation.  Our students are popular with multiple agencies due to our multi-disciplinary program and students are placing with DHS, NSA, CIA, SPAWAR, Air Force, FBI, NRC, Bureau of Public Debt, Treasury Department and US Senate as well as others.  Not only do our students complete their two year obligation, they often continue to work for a government agency after their service obligation is completed.  Several of our SFS graduates have taken educational positions in information assurance after completing their service obligation.  Also, importantly, most students are part of the ISU SFS family for life and keep in contact with their colleagues.  Further, the students attend lectures from information assurance professionals through our contacts in the industry.  Our students have attended lectures from Howard Schmidt (cyber security), Tim Mucklow (NSA historian on cryptography), Julie Ryan (George Mason University &ndash; research methods), Rita Wells (INL cyber security), Gene Griessman (leadership and motivational speaker), Herbert LaFond (Micron Industries &ndash; SCSDA), Dan Ryan (National Defense University &ndash; risk management framework) and Lisa Albright (University of Utah &ndash; health care database analysis). \n\nOne hidden benefit of the SFS grant is the ability to attend a SFS Job Fair held in Washington, DC.  Over forty agencies come to interview and select worthy candidates from a candidate pool of SFS students.  This is a unique opportunity to meet potential employers in the government and determine match between our student\u00c6s capabilities and their needs.  Our students take advantage of this opportunity and enjoy their first immersion of the DC culture.  At the end of their first year of study, the students are obligated to a ten week internship, which is oriented towards a future employer.  All our students achieved this and benefited from it. \n\nOur program is adapting over time and we still mix hard and soft modalities.  Some of our students have a strong flair for the hard modalities (networking, hardware, cryptography, and programming).  Our interdisciplinary program also supports the softer modalities such as systems analysis, risk management, federal policy, human-computer interface as well as training, education, and awareness.  We find our SFS graduates are sought after for their technical experience and communication plus project management/business analytical skills\n\nThis grant promoted STEM outreach in the Idaho/Utah/Wyoming community.  Our students are sponsoring and supporting major cyber range activities in Idaho, Washington and Hawaii.  Over the past six years they contributed in a major fashion to the success of the Pacific Range CCDC.  This student effort includes creation of injects, judging, establishing the environment, logistical support and selection of the red (attack team &ndash; SFS ISU alumni).   They conducted two annual NIATEC Competitions with both university and high schools competing.  These efforts required our SF..."
