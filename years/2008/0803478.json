 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the basic building blocks of computers shrink to the atomic scale, new physics, in particular quantum physics, arises which shapes how these devices function. Systems that could previously robustly store information, when they are scaled down to atomic scales, lose their ability to robustly store information. On the other hand, it is known that if one could build computers at atomic scales which operate strictly according to the laws of quantum physics, then these computers would offer significant advantages over\r\ntoday?s classical computers. Quantum computers, if they could be built, would break today?s modern cryptosystems and revolutionize the simulation of quantum many-body physics. The research proposed here would result in a new method for constructing robust devices for storing and manipulating quantum information. This method starts with the observation that classical information storage is made possible by the physics of the devices used to store the information. For example, the magnetic domains used to store information on a hard drive are robust storage devices exactly because of the existence of an ordered low temperature phase in the Ising model (in two or greater dimensions.) The research described here follows the same principles which allow robust classical storage of information: in short the research attempts to show how to\r\nengineer condensed matter systems which can act as a quantum hard drive. This\r\nresearch is particulary novel in that it makes direct contact with the traditional method for showing that robust quantum computation is possible, concatenated coding. In standard error correction, encoding information across multiple independently erred systems reduces the rate that information is destroyed. By encoding encoded information, also known as concatenating, one can achieve an even further reduction in the rate of information destruction. In this research this is put to use in constructing a particular class of many-body quantum system, called quantum concatenated code Hamiltonians, which use the concatenation idea on energy landscapes to preserve quantum information. The research includes a theoretical study validating the robust storage capability of concatenated code Hamiltonians along a plan for implementing the\r\nmodel in a variety of realistic architectures. The final outcome of the research will be the schematics for a new type of quantum information storage device, one which will drastically improve the prospects for building a quantum computer.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "In the first year we found that our analysis of the robustness of quantum concatenated code Hamiltonians is correct -- we can rigorously show a threshold below which these codes have exponentially insensitivity to external local perturbating interactions.  This is detailed in the paper published in Physical Review A.  The second major finding was that the amplification of perturbation-theory gadgets can be done rigorously.  An important insight here was the mixing of two types of gadgets previously considered in the literature.  This is being written up and will be submitted, most probably to Physical Review A.  A third finding was a classification of subsystem codes generated by two-qubit interactions for up to nine qubits (or more, depending if one assumes planarity of the interactions).  These subsystem codes could be useful in building robust concatenated code Hamiltonians, a subject which we will investigate next.  Finally, we have found a novel method for doing computation on systems like our quantum concatenated code Hamiltonians using adiabatic evolution.  This solves a long-standing issue with these models for how to perform quantum computation on these models.  A simple version of our ideas leads to a novel protocol called adiabatic gate swapping, which is a new way to perform universal quantum computation using adiabatic quantum evolution. \n \nThe main findings in the second year were the discoveries related to adiabatic methods for computing on energetically protected systems like quantum concatenated code Hamiltonians.  Adiabatic cluster state computing and adiabatic quantum transistors are two major new models of computing that have the potential to drastically change how a quantum computer is built.  They also provide a new method for achieving universality it schemes like quantum concatenated code Hamiltonians.  Further, by examining concatenated codes in the quantum transistor model we have a new model for using concatenated codes in energetically protected systems and expect that this model will yield fruitful theoretical results in the coming year.  Another major finding was the thermodynamic triviality of certain quantum concateanted code models and the resulting mapping between classical ground state computing models and probabilistic circuits.  This later mapping should have an extension to the quantum regime where we expect it to be important for understanding the robust properties of energetically protected quantum systems.   A final finding consists of a better understanding of the amplification using perturbation theory gadgets.  In particular we have now realized that the ancillas play an central role in these constructions, and that we must encode information across these ancillas if we are going to achieve energetic protection.\n \nThe main findings in the final year was the discovery of a way to construct subsystem codes that involve few body spatially local Hamiltonians.  This represents a major new class of subsystem codes that are likely to be useful both for fault-tolerant quantum computing, and for systems such as the adiabatic quantum transistor (described in previous year findings.)  We found that quantum expanders can be used to efficiently make any stabilizer code into a low-weight stabilizer code.  As a corollary, we can connect two open questions about stabilizers codes:\n \n(1) Does there exist a family of  n-qubit stabilizer codes with linear distance and sublinear weight generators?\n \n(2) Does there exist a family of n-qubit stabilizer codes with constant-weight generators and distance growing as n&delta; for &delta;&gt;1/2?\n \nSpecifically, our results show that (1) implies (2).\n \nThe results of the research in this grant are collected on the group's website, which is now a Wiki:  http://quantum.cs.washington.edu/ as well as on the arXiv preprint server.\n \n\nFurther, the results were communicated on the PIs blog, \"The Quantum Pontiff\" at http://dabacon.org/pontiff.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 1..."
