The goal of the Kansas Partnership project is to assist graduate students to be better communicators of their science with K-12 teachers and students in particular and with the broader community of non-scientists in general. The specific anticipated outcomes of this project are to: provide highly qualified Ph.D. candidates in engineering and science with a unique opportunity for professional growth through the development of their teaching and learning skills;  foster the incorporation of additional hands-on science experiences and cooperative learning strategies into middle school classrooms;  establish a sustainable outreach partnership among the partner school districts that will provide a vehicle for interpreting the significance of science and engineering, and; contribute to improving the science achievement of at-risk middle school students in two of the largest urban school districts in Kansas. \r\nIntellectual Merit of the project addresses removal of barriers to student engagement in science and engineering through innovative content delivery using active learning strategies and science research activities based on National and State curriculum standards for grades 6-9.  The institutionalization of the professional development courses, the interaction with the Uplink program and the continued commitment of the Centers to maintain their partnership with the districts will ensure the sustainability and broader impact of the program. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
