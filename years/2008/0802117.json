 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The need for storing and accessing large amounts of data with the ease of being portable is apparent from the ubiquitous use of small form factor consumer electronics where demands for terabit per inch square areal densities is predicted. Conventional modes of data storage are reaching fundamental limitations on the areal densities achievable. Probe based data storage solutions, based on atomic force microscopy principles employ a force probe that has the resolution to image data at the atomic scale. Information is stored in the form of indentations that are a few square nanometers in area. Probe based high density data storage has the promise of delivering a few terabit per square inch densities in the near term. The dynamic mode probe based data storage platform will be developed under the proposal goals.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: A real-time model of the probe dynamics will be developed for high density data storage applications. The dynamic mode operation that leads to\r\nsignificantly smaller forces on the media and the probe will be employed as compared to the static mode operation that has been used in previous work. The fundamental tradeoff between the speed of reading the data and the resolution of the read data existing in current dynamic modes is overcome, leading to two orders increase in the detection speed. The physical modelling part of the proposal will provide an appropriate level abstraction of the forces appearing between the probe and media that remains tractable and is sufficient for data storage purposes. The communication system modelling and design objectives part will develop a communication channel model of the data storage system. Efficient and high performance detectors and error control codes\r\nwill be developed for the system.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The proposal objectives if achieved will directly impact the\r\nconsumer electronics market and will provide a small form factor high density data storage alternative. Synergistic transfer of know how between the academia and industry by exchanging student visits and presenting specialized workshops will be achieved. A new course on probe based data storage that bridges the know how between the systems and physics communities will be developed.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work enabled by this grant has led to new modes and tools of investigating material properties at the nanoscale. The main results facilitated by this grant are described below. The figure below describes an Atomic Force Microscope; a tool widely used by nanoscience researchers for charactrizing nanoscale properties of material.\n\n \n\n\n \n Figurre 1: Shows an atomic force microscope. The main probe is a cantilever with a sharp tip at one end. When the tip atoms interact with the atoms on the sample, the interatomic forces cause the cantilever to deflect. This forms the means of sensing sample forces. The resulting deflection of the cantilever is measured by a laser-photodiode mechanism. The sample sits on a positioning stage that enables the cantilever tip to probe different locations of the sample.\n\n \n\nModeling and characterization of a thermal probe: A primary means of interrogating matter at the nanoscale employs a stylus with a sharp tip at one end which senses forces from the atoms on the material surface. Under this grant we have modeled and characterized such a stylus which senses the topography of the sample being investigated. This probe was made by IBM and employs a temperature sensing mechanism to determine the height of the sample. Closer the sample is to the probe, more is the heat dissipated, cooler is the temperature, lower is the resistance of the probe to voltage and the larger current results in detecting the closeness.  The micro-scale probe was investigated and its dynamic behavior was characterized. The model obtained was validated with experimental data.  This work will impact characterization methods for micro-scale probes and in interrogating material using thermal means at the nanoscale.\n\n \n\nRelevant Publication: P. Agarwal, D. Sahoo, A. Sebastian, H. Pozidis, M. V. Salapaka,``Real time models of electrostatically actuated cantilever probes with integrated thermal sensor for nanoscale interrogation\", Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Vol. 19, No. 1, pp: 83-98, 2010 \n \n\n \n\nEnabling hi-fidelity images at the nanoscale: An atomic force microscope uses a micron-sized cantilever with a sharp tip at its end to probe material at the nanoscale. In many imaging scenarios when the sample is being scanned under the sharp tip, the tip loses interaction with the sample when there is a valley encountered. During this loss of probe situation, information on the sample is lost. Under this grant a new method was devised where the probe-loss situation was detected in real-time  and upon detection the sample was moved into contact with the probe so that imaging of the material could continue.\n\nRelevant Publication: Real time reduction of probe-loss using switching gain controller for high speed atomic force microscopy,   Review of Scientific Instruments, vol. 80,pp. 103701, 2009\n \n\nA new theoretical and experimental paradigm for high density data storage: \n\n \n\nFigure: Bits 1 and 0 are encoded using profiles b(t). The signal e(t) has to be deciphered to decode the source string of 0's and 1's.\n\nThe need for high density data storage is evident given the data deluge forced by the ubiquitous use of digital information. A means of storing data with extremely high densities (4 Terabit per inch square an above) is to deform polymer material using a sharp tip with the ability to raise/lower topography of the polymer surface with nanometer scales. A key issue is to read the data where the main task is to decipher the levels of the topography that encode a 0 or a 1, without damaging the polymer media which is a soft matter. Under this grant, a theoretical paradigm was developed that showed the potential of  reading data with high speed without damaging the media. Increases in speeds can be as high as two orders of magnitude. The gain in speeds was experimentally verified.  The methods used an innovative mix of communication engineering, control engineering, signal processing and physics.\nRelevant Publication:: N. Kumar,..."
