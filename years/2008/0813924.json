 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help to subsidize the participation of graduate students in the third Northeast Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) to be held May 2-4, 2008 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This conference is to include oral and poster presentations by students and invited talks and tutorials by senior AI researchers. The conference will be largely run by a program committee consisting of doctoral students under the guidance of senior faculty. The program committee will conduct a review process to select the projects chosen for oral and poster presentations. In addition to graduate students, the conference plans to encourage attendance by a few outstanding senior undergraduates in the hope that it will increase their enthusiasm for research and thus the likelihood that they will go on to graduate work. The project integrates research and education and commits to broadening diversity.",
