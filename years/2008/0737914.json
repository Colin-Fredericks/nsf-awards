This conference is held every two years as a follow on to the IEDM, which is also held every other year in Washington.  The ISDRS is a University oriented conference in the area of novel and emerging electronic materials and devices, targeting the scientific and educational development of young scientists and engineers starting in this very critical field of research and development. \r\nThe ISDRS Conference is dedicated to disseminating new, innovative emerging areas of science and engineering.  \r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe ISDRS promotes new and advanced research in Science and Engineering critical to the advanced and emerging new areas of research in electronic materials and devices.  It promotes heavily the educational development of students and young scientists and engineers.  The conference disseminates novel concepts and technologies.  The proceedings of the conference are published in the special issue of Solid State Electronics, which further disseminates and facilitates the spread of knowledge to the community. The ISDRS is technically sponsored by IEEE EDS and LEOS Societies and financially and technically sponsored over the years by ARO, ARL, NASA, NIST, DARPA, and NSF\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThis conference is unique in promoting participation of students and young scientists and engineers.  45 % of the attendees in this conference are students presenting their research work for the first time.  It encourages minority and under-represented group participation, and offers several awards to students and the Van der Ziel award to prominent scientists and educators.  Some of the research areas emerging from the conference are incorporated in graduate and undergraduate course to improve the education curriculum and develop a body of students and professionals knowledgeable in new emerging areas.\r\n\r\n",
