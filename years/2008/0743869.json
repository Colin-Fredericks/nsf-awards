 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project involves university and museum scientists in research on a key evolutionary novelty: the genetic origin and morphological evolution of baleen and filter feeding in baleen (mysticete) whales.  Living baleen whales lack teeth, and use plates of baleen to feed, but they evolved from ancestors that had teeth. Study of baleen structure, its bony correlate (palate vascularization) and other anatomical characters related to whale feeding mechanisms will focus on an enigmatic group of fossil baleen whales ('cetotheres') implicated in the evolution of extant lineages of mysticetes. Newly discovered baleen whale fossils will be prepared and described. Hypotheses on the evolution of feeding in mysticetes also will be tested.  Anatomical, molecular, and combined datasets will provide context for documenting this major evolutionary transition in mysticetes.  \r\n\r\nThis research will use evidence from fossils, development, molecules, and phylogeny to document a major macroevolutionary transition from toothed mysticetes that pursued individual prey items to baleen-bearing mysticetes that are bulk-feeding predators.  This project will provide training for both undergraduate and graduate students.  Results of this study will be incorporated into a project website and exhibits on whale evolution at the San Diego Natural History Museum.",
