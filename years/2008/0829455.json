The purpose of this meeting is to bring together an international group of researchers, especially from Japan and Europe, to exchange research findings in this field.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, there currently exists a lack of fundamental understanding of thermofluid processes in liquid and superfluid helium, such as the role of turbulent transport.  Flow visualization may enable improved comprehension of such transport processes.  This workshop will bring together this focused research community in one venue to discuss their research results and to enhance the potential for international collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include NSF support for a number of junior and female researchers.  Since the workshop will be held in conjunction with the APS Fluid Dynamics meeting, it will be relatively easy for interested researchers to attend.  A major goal of this workshop is to produce increased international collaboration opportunities among US, Japanese, and European researchers.\r\n  \r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program, and by the Fluid Dynamics Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.",
