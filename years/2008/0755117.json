 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Rochester is offering a REU Site program in Cellular and Molecular Biology to promising undergraduates. The goal is to encourage students to pursue graduate education and careers in the Biological Sciences.  Participants will experience the excitement of hands-on, hypothesis-driven research under the mentorship of a faculty. The Site will recruit underrepresented minority students and students from smaller, non-research-intensive, undergraduate colleges. Students will be selected from a large national pool of applicants, and will participate in a 10-week independent research project under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students will attend research seminars as well as seminars on ethics, graduate school and career issues, and will also be offered the opportunity to participate in a GRE prep course and in discussion groups. Participants will present their research in poster form at a mini-symposium at the end of the summer.  Finally, continuation of research work during the academic year will be strongly supported and used as a mechanism to support linkages between UR and other colleges. More information is available by contacting Dr. David A Pearce at David_Pearce@urmc.rochester.edu, or by visiting the program website at http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/GEBS/summer.htm.\r\n\r\n",
