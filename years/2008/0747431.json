Early work on MSP focused on purely functional languages. The goal of this proposal is to put what we know about MSP to work in the context of mainstream languages such as Java and C#. This will be achieved by means of carefully designed, minimal extensions that provide an expressive, statically checked mechanism for effectively eliminating the interpretive overhead.\r\n\r\nThe project will design an object-oriented language that provides statically checked support for the writing of program generators. The language, called The Java Program Mint (Mint) will support: \r\n\r\n   1. Staging constructs that are statically checked before expansion/generation,\r\n\r\n   2. Indexed types, to enable further optimizations that are particularly synergistic with staging, and\r\n\r\n   3. Disciplined, statically typed compile-time computation. \r\n\r\nThe design of Mint will be evaluated by establishing formal safety and expressivity results, and the implementation will be evaluated by building demonstration applications. The novel features of Mint will have the most impact on applications that use reflection and that constitute domain-specific language (DSL) extensions, such as serializers, JavaBeans customization facilities, and  synchronization libraries.\r\n",

The key educational\nactivity has been the development of an online tutorial that has been\nposted on the Java Mint website.  This tutorial was recently presented\n\nat a research conference.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe main findings of our research year were published in a PDLI\npaper that was presented in Toronto in 2010.  In what follows\nis an excerpt abstract of this paper:\n  In the purely functional setting, it has been shown how\n  Multi-stage Programming (MSP) can be used to reduce the overhead of\n  abstractions, allowing clean, maintainable code without paying\n  performance penalties. Unfortunately, MSP is difficult to combine\n  with imperative features, which are prevalent in mainstream\n  languages. The central difficulty is scope extrusion, wherein free\n  variables can inadvertently be moved outside the scopes of their\n  binders. This paper proposes a new approach to combining MSP with\n  imperative features that occupies a ``sweet spot'' in the design\n  space in terms of how well useful MSP applications can be expressed\n  and how easy it is for programmers to understand. The key insight is\n  that escapes (or ``anti-quotes'') must be \"weakly separable\"\n  from the rest of the code, i.e. the computational effects occurring\n  inside an escape that are visible outside the escape are guaranteed\n  to not contain code.  To demonstrate the feasibility of this\n  approach, we formalize a type system based on Lightweight Java which\n  we prove sound, and we also provide an implementation, called Mint,\n  to validate both the expressivity of the type system and the effect\n  of staging on the performance of Java programs.\n\nSecondary contributions came in the form of advances in hardware\ndescription language through the use of staging.  In particular, work\nin this year focused on showing that a wide range of static analysis\ntechniques can be developed to enable the determination of hardware\nresource use on staged hardware descriptions.\n\nOur contributions to hardware description languages can be viewed as\nextending to the fields of electrical and electronics engineering.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe project has trained two PhD students (Jun Inoue and Mathias\nRicken), partially contributed to the training of one post-doctoral\nstudent (Edwin Westbrook), and to involving one undergraduate student\n(Yilong Yao, ECE) in research activities.\n\nMathias Ricken and Edwin Westbrook gained significant\nexperience with the internals of the Java compiler as well as\nmanaging large research projects that require modifying the \ncompiler.\n\nJun Inoue and Edwin Westbrook developed significant\nexpertise in the design of type systems in general, and in particular,\ntype systems for multi-stage languages.
