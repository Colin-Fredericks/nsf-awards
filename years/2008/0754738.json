The program will be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa and managed by Sarah Larsen of the Department of Chemistry. The program will provide eight rising junior or senior undergraduate students with research experience in cutting edge topics related to environmental and health aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology. REU participants will have the opportunity to work with faculty mentors from the departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Occupational and Environmental Health. Each mentor will provide their REU student with a well defined project related to one of the three interrelated research themes that compose the scientific core of this REU program: (i) fundamental studies of nanoparticles and nanomaterials in environmental and health applications; (ii) fundamental studies to better understand the environmental and health implications of nanoparticles; or (iii) instrumentation development for field and laboratory measurements of nanoparticles and nanomaterials. All projects are designed to develop the REU students' lab skills and critical thinking skills so that they can become independent researchers. Students will also participate in a Communicating Science workshop that will focus on the communication of scientific results through written media and through oral presentations.\r\n",

The number of applicants increased from 34 the first year (late funding notice) to 118 in the third year of the program.  Of the total number of participants, 13 (39%) were underrepresented minority students (12) or handicapped (1).  19 students (58%) were women.  The majority of students 21 (64%) were from institutions that do not offer graduate degrees in chemistry or engineering and therefore, have limited research opportunities.  Of the 16 student participants from 2008-2010, who have graduated from college, 14/16 (88%) are enrolled in graduate or professional degree programs and 2 are employed in industry\n\nThe primary objective of this REU site was to provide undergraduate students with a stimulating research experience with a core intellectual focus in the interdisciplinary research area of nanoscience and nanotechnology.  At the end of the program, students reported a \"better understanding of scientific research,\" \" an increased interest in pursuing a graduate degree,\" and \"an increased knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\"   The program evaluations indicate that the students had a meaningful REU experience at the University of Iowa in the Nano-REU program.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah C Larsen"
