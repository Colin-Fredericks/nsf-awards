 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IREU) Site continues to operate in 2008 under the supervision of Prof. Seraphin at the University of Arizona. Six undergraduate students will be recruited nationally to participate in collaborative research projects at King Mongkut?s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) and National Metals and Materials Technology Center (MTEC) in Bangkok, Thailand for 10 weeks. The research projects are related to understanding the relationships among the structure, processing, and properties of technologically important materials.  The IREU participants will also attend workshops on science/engineering ethics, Thai culture, and language. Opportunities to improve scientific communication skills through presentations of research findings and final reports as well as visits to research laboratories, local factories, a power plant, and archeological sites in Thailand are included. The program will strongly encourage participation of minorities and underrepresented students. \r\n\r\nSupport for this IREU Site is provided by NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, Engineering Education Centers program, Divisions of Materials Research and Social and Economic Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
