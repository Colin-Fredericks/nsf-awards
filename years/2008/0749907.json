 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of heterocyclic ring systems and their functionalized derivatives.  The chemistry exploits the high reactivities of superelectrophilic species to accomplish the synthetic objectives.  Other aspects of the project examine the critical structure-activity relationships of the superelectrophiles.  These mechanistic studies (including theoretical calculations) will help to better understand the chemistry of the superelectrophiles.  As a result of this project, the potential impact of superelectrophiles in biochemical transformations can also be established.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Douglas A. Klumpp of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University.  Professor Klumpp's research centers on the chemistry of highly reactive electrophiles.  Electrophilic chemistry is of broad importance in biological processes, in the actions of medicines and drugs, and in facilitating the chemical conversions in the chemical industry.  Successful completion of the proposed research will consequently have an impact in these areas of science, medicine, and industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSynthetic organic chemistry is a significant part of this nation\u00c6s economy.  It is intimately related to the pharmaceutical industry, polymer and plastics applications, and the energy sectors.  The funded research worked in the area of synthetic organic chemistry.  Improved synthetic chemistry can lead to lower manufacturing costs and more environmentally benign industrial processes.\n\n \n\nAs a result of this National Science Foundation grant, we were able to develop a number of new synthetic routes leading to heterocyclic organic compounds &ndash; key structures in pharmaceutical, material science, and other applications.  We also discovered several new structure-activity relationships in their chemistry.  These observations may help scientists understand why heterocyclic compounds undergo particular types of chemical reactions, essential information for the use of heterocycles in pharmaceutical and material sciences.\n\n \n\nThe new chemistry was presented at several major scientific meetings, published in numerous peer-reviewed journal articles, and disseminated through lectures at colleges and universities around the nation.  Moreover, the research provided excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry.  The research work was the basis for graduate dissertations and theses, while also providing undergraduate students with the opportunity to get work experience in synthetic organic chemistry.  As such, our research fulfilled the research and educational missions of the National Science Foundation. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas A Klumpp"
