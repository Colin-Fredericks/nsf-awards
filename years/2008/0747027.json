 "awd_abstract_narration": "Securing Active Information\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nWhen multiple parties attempt to collaborate, they often end up having to\r\ncompromise the confidentiality of their private information.  Cryptographic\r\nprimitives like secure multiparty computation and obfuscation are aimed at\r\nmitigating this situation. We view many such problems as part of a unifying\r\nparadigm that we call Active Information: various parties in a system can have\r\naccess to prescribed actions of the information in the system, but nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe first focus area of the project is secure multiparty computation, which\r\nlets mutually distrusting parties emulate a commonly trusted party, by means\r\nof a protocol. We identify and investigate crucial properties required for\r\nthis to be useful in practice: \"network-awareness\" addresses issues that arise\r\nin a realistically complex environment, and a new class of \"context-awareness\"\r\nfeatures are vital in integrating secure multiparty computation into a larger\r\napplication.  We also derive insight into the fundamental nature of various\r\nmultiparty computation tasks by classifying them into complexity classes.\r\n\r\nAnother focus of this project is on \"secure active objects\" that offer far\r\nmore flexibility in their use, compared to protocols. We study well-known (but\r\nlittle understood) concepts like obfuscation, as well as new tools we develop\r\nlike \"remotely primed obfuscations,\" and \"active encryptions,\" and also\r\nfeatures like anonymity and unlinkability that are important for applications.\r\nSecure active objects also serve as a platform to integrate the study of\r\nhardware-based security solutions into the theory of cryptography.\r\n\r\nThe tools developed span a wide spectrum, ranging from low-level algebraic\r\ntechniques used in constructions, to high-level frameworks for conceptualizing\r\nsecurity definitions.\r\n\r\nTowards bringing the subtle concepts from theoretical cryptography to a\r\nbroader audience of current and future practitioners, two online resources are\r\nbeing developed: (1) a wiki-based tutorial/reference website, and (2) a blog\r\naimed at students and a non-specialist audience.\r\n",
