 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science (CAMOS) of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. CAMOS identifies and discusses issues of concern to the atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) science community, particularly in connection with research opportunities, and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their associated programs.  The committee?s operating guidelines are:  (1) to provide active stewardship of the agenda laid out by the AMO 2010 report; (2) to provide a means by which federal agencies can request technical information and assistance from the National Academies about AMO science and related fields; (3) to initiate case studies on important timely topics in AMO science and/or its multidisciplinary connections with other fields of science and technology; (4) to provide an interface for communication among the subfields of the AMO community as well as with the staff of federal agencies that support research in the field. CAMOS prepares white papers on emerging areas of research in the atomic, molecular, and optical sciences to initiate subsequent National Research Council committee studies on those topics. CAMOS oversees all studies initiated under its auspices.  A specific topic that CAMOS is expected to address in the process of following up the AMO 2010 study is quantum information science.",
