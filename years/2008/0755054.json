The new scheme is based on the concept of dynamic dose painting and is designed to take advantage of the new robotic patient positioning system on the latest Gamma Knife units. In their scheme, the spherical high dose volume created by the Gamma Knife unit will be viewed as a 3D spherical paintbrush, and treatment planning reduces to finding the best route of the paintbrush to paint a 3D tumor volume. Under the dose-painting concept, Gamma Knife radiosurgery would become dynamic, where the patient is moving continuously under the robotic positioning system. In the proposed research, they plan to solve the various engineering and computational problems associated with dynamic Gamma Knife radiosurgery. They plan to solve these problems by bringing together techniques from graph algorithms, computational geometry, and operations research, and they will develop and verify a prototype treatment planning system for dynamic Gamma Knife radiosurgery.\r\n",
