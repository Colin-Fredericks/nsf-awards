The existing Global Cestode Database will be expanded to\r\ninclude descriptions of all tapeworm species and enhanced to allow data entry from\r\nanywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe project website will provide public access to information on new and known\r\ntapeworm species, and to resources including a list of tapeworm specimens available in\r\nmuseums around the world, keys to aid in the identification of tapeworms, and\r\ncheck-lists of vertebrates and their tapeworms. The project will include 4 post-docs, 4\r\ngraduate and 4 undergraduate students, and will result in the generation of 5 children's\r\nbooks, narrated by \"spokesworms,\" describing life for tapeworms in the various\r\nvertebrate groups. The project will ultimately lead to a global understanding of\r\ntapeworms and their hosts that is unprecedented for any host/parasite system to date.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The project focused on tapeworms&mdash;a gutless group of remarkable parasitic worms found in the gut of all major groups of vertebrate animals, including humans. The primary goals of the project were to survey and inventory the tapeworms of as many different species of mammals, birds, fish, snakes, lizards, sharks, and stingrays from around the world to discover as much novelty as possible and to establish an understanding of the evolutionary relationships of these parasites based on molecular and morphological information. Over 200 people from around the world worked together on the project. In total, almost 15,000 specimens of over 1,900 species of vertebrates from 52 countries globally (including 11 US states) were examined for tapeworms. The amount of novelty discovered was substantial; publications to date document 3 new orders, 2 new suborders, 6 new families, 64 new genera, and 203 new species of tapeworms. This brings the number of tapeworm orders to 19 and the total number of described tapeworm species to nearly 4,800; remarkably, almost half of these orders are parasites of sharks and stingrays. Over 3,000 species belong to the single order Cyclophyllidea and are primarily parasites of birds or mammals. Hundreds of additional new species discovered over the course of the project remain to be described. Based on these results and the number of vertebrate species that have yet to be examined for tapeworms, it is likely that the world is home to well over 10,000 species of tapeworms! Because so many of the new tapeworm species were discovered in host species not previously examined for tapeworms, regardless of country, future survey work aimed at discovering additional novelty should focus on unexplored host species. New molecular sequence data for up to 4 genes were generated for hundreds of specimens of hundreds of species across tapeworm orders. Evolutionary trees for most of the major groups of tapeworms were generated, as was a basic framework for the evolutionary relationships among the 19 tapeworm orders overall. These trees serve as important resources for future work on, for example, various aspects of the evolution of these parasites and also of the evolution of their relationships with their hosts. In total, 191 scientific publications dealing with various aspects of the naming and categorizing of tapeworms resulted from the project. In addition, a ~420-page monograph synthesizing all of the results of the project in a single document, was generated to be liberally distributed in print and made freely available electronically from the project website (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of elements of the project were specifically aimed at expanding the impact of the project to groups outside of tapeworm experts. The project website (tapeworms.uconn.edu) was developed to provide public access to many of the products of the project beyond the primary publications. These products include the Global Cestode Database and its records of the 12,225 tapeworm species ever described, (whether they are valid or not), the Host Specimen Databases (which include the Elasmobranch Specimen Database and its 9,050 records of sharks and stingrays), the Citation Database (with 3,850 records of taxonomic works involving tapeworms), an Illustrated Glossary of tapeworms (with original illustrations of tapeworm features; see Fig. 2), galleries of images of some of the fieldwork, as well as lists of the publications and new species resulting from the project. An exhibit entitled \"The 'faces' of parasites,\" including spectacular 4-foot LED panels portraying colorized scanning electron micrographs of the scolex (i.e., attachment organ) (Fig. 3) of some of the tapeworm species discovered over the course of the project was mounted by the University of Kansas Natural History Museum. A prototype of a children's book entitled \"Meet the Suckers\" (Fig. 4) was developed to provide children with scientifically accurate information on the tapeworms that live inside of animals in a typical public Aquarium, using a \"spokes tapeworm\" named \"Cyri\" as a tour guide (Fig. 5). The project also provided amazing opportunities for training a substantial number of individuals. Approximately 50% of the over 200 individuals included in the project were formal trainees. These consisted of 13 postdoctoral fellows (most of whom went on to accept permanent academic positions), 32 graduate students, and 56 undergraduate students. A total of 36 of the project personnel were non-white and 86 (including the PIs) were women. The traditionally collaborative culture of tapeworm taxonomists led to highly interactive and productive interactions among all individuals involved.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kirsten&nbsp;Jensen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0818823/0818823_10025966_1483379259350_Fig1_book_cover--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0818823/0818823_10025966_1483379259350_Fig1_book_cover--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Monograph cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0818823/0818823_10025966_1483379259350_Fig1_book_cover--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Monograph cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
