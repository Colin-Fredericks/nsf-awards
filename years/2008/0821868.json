James (PI) and Shepherd Meyers (Co-PI)\r\nDepartment of Natural Sciences, Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii\r\n\r\nBishop Museum, the Hawaii State Museum of Natural and Cultural History, was awarded $100,000 for the purchase and implementation of three integrated sets of research instrumentation: microscope imaging station (stereo and compound microscope, digital camera, auto-montage software); herbarium imaging station (high resolution digital camera, low UV and heat lighting); and a server for data storage and online access (4-TB hard drive space, backup system).  The instrumentation is critical to the study and documentation of the plants and animals of the Hawaiian Islands and Pacific region, including taxonomic description and revision, biodiversity assessment, invasive species detection, and collections digitization for research.  \r\n\r\nSpecimen digitization will avoid damage of collections from excessive handling and shipping, and significantly increase the accessibility of the collections to local, national, and international scientific communities and the general public through searchable online databases.  The funded imaging stations will provide training opportunities for interns, students, and visiting researchers including Hawaiian, Pacific Island, and female scientists.  Images will be used in web-based information dissemination, online identification keys, and other scientific and educational products to promote a greater understanding of the natural ecosystems, management of endangered species, and the prevention and eradication of invasive species in Hawaii and the Pacific.",
