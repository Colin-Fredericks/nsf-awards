 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) scholarship program and is designed to provide scholarships averaging $4,000 for academically talented and financially needy students. Approximately 130 students per semester are being supported to enroll full time (12 credits) in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) associate degree programs. Students who carry a 16 credit load to complete their associate's degree in two years are eligible for up to $5,400 in scholarship support. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Each student is assigned a faculty mentor from a STEM department. A colloquium course for the scholar cohort sponsors guest speakers and workshops. This project continues the CSEMS successful scholarship probationary period that allows students to remain in the program for one semester if their GPAs fall below 3.0. During the probationary semester scholars work with their mentor and an academic support coordinator and receive academic assistance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This community college is the number one provider of transfer students to the University of Minnesota, the University of St. Thomas, and Minnesota State University, Mankato. This scholarship program provides a pool of diverse candidates for these institutions and their STEM baccalaureate degree programs.  High technology industries in the Twin Cities metropolitan area benefit from the skilled workers whose education is subsidized by the scholarships. The program recruits underrepresented groups to pursue education and careers in STEM disciplines. The minority participation in the current CSEMS program is 27% which is higher than for the college as a whole which is at 21%.",
