 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOne of the main challenges in multi-core processor resource management is that\r\nexisting operating systems (either conventional OS for single core or OS for SMP) are\r\nnot able to effectively handle the new complexities in multi-core processors.\r\nIn order to address this challenge, the collaborators will conduct three closely related\r\nprojects. (1) A hybrid system design and implementation for OS-based cache\r\npartitioning will provide efficient software management of shared caches with minimum\r\nhardware complexity, and will well define hardware/software interface of shared cache\r\nmanagement. (2) The collaborators will design and implement scheduling algorithms in\r\nOS kernels to effectively allocate CPU, caches and memory bandwidth resources to\r\nmultiprogramming jobs in multi-core processors. (3) A data object locality-aware cache\r\npartitioning design and implementation will distinguish the locality strengths of objects\r\nand make effective cache allocation decisions.\r\nThe intellectual challenges of this project are threefold: (1) Hybrid system design\r\ninvolves complex interactions between hardware and the underlined operating system,\r\nand demands insightful understanding of existing system structures and innovation to\r\nenhance both architecture and the OS kernels. (2) OS-based scheduling in multi-core\r\nprocessors is a fundamental and complex problem in system research. (3) System\r\nimplementation of proposed algorithms for scheduling and object coordination demands\r\na lot of creative ideas for their seamless integration in the kernels. The broader impact\r\nof this project is expected to be significant. Solutions to address critical issues for\r\nsignificant performance improvement in multi-core processors are timely demanded in\r\nmany application areas. The research training to both undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents will address the concerns of lacking strong system professionals in IT and\r\ncomputer industries.",
