 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Diane Hinkens of South Dakota State University as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Hinkens will synthesize and study the properties of new types of variable band gap block copolymer materials for phtovoltaic applications.  Hinkens will work in collaboration with scientists at South Dakota State University, and at the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Laboratory.  In her plan for broadening participation, Dr. Hinkens will develop hands-on activities describing photovoltaic materials for inclusion in the mobile science laboratory \"Science on the Move\" that travels across South Dakota, reaching small rural schools as well as schools on Native American reservations.  In addition, she will develop a photovoltaic laboratory for the Chemistry Van of the Chicago Science Alliance -- which supports science teachers in the Chicago Public Schools. \r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Hinkens is aimed at developing new kinds of materials for photovoltaic devices as well as developing a better understanding of how these materials behave.  The ultimate aim of research like this is to develop better materials for solar energy conversion.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Hinkens are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.",
