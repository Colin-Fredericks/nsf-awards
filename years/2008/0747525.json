Neely\r\nUniversity of Southern California\r\nhttp://www-rcf.usc.edu/~mjneely/\r\n\r\nAbstract: \r\nThis research investigates communication strategies for time-varying networks, with the goal of developing a fundamental theory for analysis and control of network delay.  While much is known about network throughput optimization, the delay problem is more complex and less understood.  Delay-aware algorithms must be designed for very large systems and must be able to optimally adapt to environmentswhere future network traffic, link conditions, and mobile user locations are uncertain.  This project seeks to establish mathematical techniques for computing tight delay bounds, and to develop scheduling and routing algorithms that achieve provably high throughput with order-optimal delay.  This project also explores intelligent mechanisms for scheduling redundant packet information and for making use of (and controlling) network mobility.  Indeed, although redundancy and mobility increase the complexity of decision options, both can be used advantageously to improve network performance.\r\n\r\nThis project also introduces a new topic of mathematical optimization:  The study of controlling Lagrange multipliers.  Specifically, it is known that network optimization is closely related to convex programming theory, where Lagrange multipliers can play a role analogous to queue backlogs and/or \"network prices.\" However, there has been little research in the area of controlling the magnitude of the Lagrange multipliers that are used in an optimization problem.  A general theory of controlled Lagrange multipliers is thus important to this study of network delay and for related problems of network pricing and economics.  Such a theory may also prove useful in other optimization contexts, and may have broader applications to machine learning and online dynamic programming. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF Career project by PI Neely studied the topic of network optimization, particularly with respect to analysis and control of network delay.  Modern networks have both wireline and wireless components and the network algorithms must adapt to time-varying conditions.  This includes time-varying arrivals, wireless device mobility, and fluctuating channel conditions.  Is it possible to maximize network data rates, and optimize average power use without knowing the future?  The \"drift-plus-penalty\" algorithm developed in prior work by PI Neely shows this is possible for classes of systems that reach a \"statistical steady state.\"  This project went further to establish low complexity techniques for reducing delay while maintaining the same level of network utility and power efficiency.  Further, the project established \"universal scheduling\" principles that extend to arbitrary time-varying networks, even networks that do not reach a statistical steady state.\n\nSeveral methods were proposed for this research.  This included:  Lagrange multuiplier methods, queue and virtual-queue grouping techniques, controlled network calculus, and controlled redundancy.  All of these techniques proved successful in reducing network delay.  This research developed new ways of thinking and analyzing these problems, and established optimal tradeoffs between delay and network utility.  For example, a new technique that uses Lyapunov analysis and network calculus was developed to provide worst-case delay guarantees in a wireless network:  The network has no knowledge of the future channels or channel probabilities, but provides utility to within any desired precision to optimality (where optimality is defined as the best performance possible even if one knows the future), with a tradeoff in worst-case delay. As another example, a method for bounding the average delay for a simple class of \"maximal scheduling\" algorithms was developed.  The method treats general traffic models with arrivals that can be correlated over time and space.  The delay bounds are given in terms of simple correlation parameters.\n\nSeveral of the results generated interest in other collaborative NSF-Eager projects.  In particular, the drift-plus-penalty and Lagrange multiplier concepts influenced collaborative work on \"Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) Backpressure\" that was implemented on a network testbed in a collaborative project with PI Krishnamachari (also at USC).
