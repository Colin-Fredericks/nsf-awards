The PRB is a forum for high level discussion as well as an oversight body that designs studies, workshops, and other activities that use volunteer experts to provide objective advice. Activities include program reviews, assessment of priorities, and analyses of controversial and nationally important topics. The PRB serves as US National Committee to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and International Polar Year 2007-2008 and thus facilitates US leadership in these international groups. For 2009-2010, PRB will continue to plan activities where objective, independent discussion and analysis are needed. IPY 2007-2008 will remain a top focus, especially the final activities needed to ensure synthesis and integration of the results.",
