Our \r\ngoal is to encourage students who want to become part of the Semantic Web \r\nresearch community, and  we expect that participation in ISWC 2008 will be \r\na significant event in the graduate careers of the selected students.\r\n\r\nThe doctoral consortium, in particular, creates an opportunity for \r\ndoctoral students to test their research ideas, present their current \r\nprogress and future plans, and  to receive constructive criticism and \r\ninsights related to their future work and career perspectives.\r\n\r\nIn selecting applications for travel support, preference is given to \r\nstudents selected to participate in the doctoral consortium, followed by \r\nstudents who are first author on a paper accepted at the conference, \r\nfollowed by students who have other authorship on a conference or related \r\nworkshop paper.\r\n\r\nDetails, including application instructions, can be found at\r\nhttp://ebiquity.umbc.edu/ISWC08Travel \r\n\r\n\r\n",
