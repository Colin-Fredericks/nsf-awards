This will result in development of an\r\neffective method of error correcting code performance analysis\r\nbased on the idea of instantons or most probable message\r\ndistortions causing the decoding error.  The motivation for the\r\ndynamics of iterations study comes from an observational fact:\r\nnonconvergence of the iterations and the consequent decoding\r\nerror is because the iterations circle around the fixed point. \r\nIn contrast to the currently available method, the newly\r\ndeveloped instanton search method is applicable to the case of an\r\ninfinite (or very large in practice) number of iterations in\r\ndecoding. \r\n\r\n     During our everyday activities we send and receive a huge\r\namount of information.  In many situations it is important that\r\nthe information is transmitted without the slightest error.  To\r\ndecrease the probability of the transmission error people for\r\nages have introduced some redundancy in their messages, e.g.\r\nrepeating the message several times or using a phonetic alphabet. \r\nPractically all modern electronic devices would not operate\r\nproperly without that kind of error correction.  Recently it was\r\nshown that a certain class of error correcting codes (low-density\r\nparity-check codes) is extremely effective in suppressing errors. \r\nThese codes have a problem, though.  We can not guarantee their\r\ngood performance in applications that demand a very small\r\nprobability of error, e.g. computer hard disk drives.  A careful\r\nanalysis of the problem source is needed before we can adopt this\r\ntype of code in demanding industrial applications and enjoy the\r\nbenefits these codes provide.  In this project the investigator\r\nstudies ways to achieve good performance of these codes in\r\npractical applications. \r\n",
