 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nCS1 and calculus are major hurdles for computer science and computer engineering majors, and faculty members at the University of Arkansas have found that students entering their programs with an ACT score below 26 are not adequately prepared to enter and succeed in these courses. To help students overcome the CS1 and calculus hurdles, this project is developing a preparatory CS0 course in which the teaching of programming is focused on calculus as an application area. Through this course, students not only are gaining the skills and confidence to succeed in subsequent courses, but also their exposure is making the ideas presented in the subsequent Calculus I course seem familiar and less intimidating. In the CS0 course, students are exploring calculus through the implementation of very small and elegant programs. This course is being encouraged for students failing to reach the ACT score threshold. It will ultimately be required for these students. The two critical components of this course are: a simple, yet expressive programming language, and a calculus text that explains the basics of calculus in a clear and concise manner, and develops ideas in step with the introduction of programming fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThe CS0 course is boosting the performance and retention of at-risk students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. The primary metrics for measuring project success are GPA and retention statistics. \r\n\r\n",
