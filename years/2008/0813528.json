Content areas will include: Asteroids ? Up-close and Personal; Deep Impact; and Planetary Protection.  \r\n\r\nDeliverables will include a 2,500 square-foot traveling exhibit for small to mid-sized museums; four, 300 square-foot ?small exhibit components? (SECs) for libraries, community centers, etc.; Web 2.0 sites for the project developers and for the public; public education programs; professional development programs for informal STEM professionals; and a study of how Web 2.0 can be used to improve the evaluation of Web sites.  The project team will be experimenting with virtual prototyping of exhibit modules as a way to improve exhibit development, especially with team members who are around the country.  \r\n\r\nTeens from around the country will be enlisted to help inform the project on its deliverables.  The Association of Science-Technology Centers will manage the exhibit tour.  The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the evaluation activities, including the study of Web 2.0 and virtual prototyping tasks.",
