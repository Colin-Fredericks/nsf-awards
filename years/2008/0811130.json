 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this proposal is on the mathematical analysis and efficient \r\nimplementation of a new class of Krylov deferred correction accelerated \r\n\"method of lines transpose\" for time dependent PDE's. The method first \r\ndiscretizes the temporal direction using Gaussian type nodes and spectral \r\nintegration, and the resulting coupled elliptic equations are preconditioned \r\nusing deferred corrections, in which each correction procedure only \r\nrequires the solution of a decoupled system using available fast elliptic \r\nequation solvers. The preconditioned nonlinear system is then solved \r\nefficiently using iterative Newton-Krylov techniques. Preliminary numerical \r\nexperiments show that this method is unconditionally stable, very efficient, \r\nand can achieve arbitrary order of accuracy in both time and space. In \r\nparticular, no CFL constraints have been observed and the time step size \r\nonly depends on the smoothness of the solution and hence is \"optimal\".  \r\nHighlights of the PI's preliminary results include (a) a time domain \r\nMaxwell equation solver which provides accurate results for a long-time \r\nelectromagnetic wave simulation problem for which most existing time \r\nintegration schemes fail; and (b) a symplectic Schrodinger equation solver \r\nwhich preserves the structure of a Hamiltonian system with singular \r\npotential while most existing numerical techniques quickly blow up. \r\n\r\nIt is well known that inaccurate numerical algorithms have caused many \r\ncostly project failures, examples include the sinking of the Sleipner A \r\noffshore platform in Gandsfjorden near Stavanger, Norway, on August \r\n23, 1991, which was due to inaccurate finite element analysis and resulted \r\nin a loss of nearly one billion dollars. The purpose of this proposal is to \r\nuse advanced mathematical analysis and develop numerical techniques that\r\ncan efficiently provide accurate and stable numerical simulation results \r\nto important science and engineering problems. In particular, the PI \r\nwill study and implement a novel class of numerical algorithms for \r\ntime dependent problems modeled by partial differential equations.\r\nThe success of this project will bring new tools and techniques to a \r\nwide class of applications in science and engineering that are impossible\r\nto solve efficiently and accurately using existing techniques, examples \r\nincluding the design of optimal drug structures in biochemistry, the study\r\nof cosmos structure in astrophysics, and improved understanding of the \r\nphysics that govern hydrologic processes in Earth system science. \r\nThis project also focuses on the training of a new generation of scientists \r\ncapable of developing advanced numerical tools using sophisticated \r\nmathematical theory.\r\n",
