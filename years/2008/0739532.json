 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project \"Workshop on Creating an Application Software Consortium\" will lay down the basis for a Software Consortium to enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness, through the application of High Performance Computing (HPC) as a key enabler. The vision of this workshop is that it will result in the development of a unique collaborative program with the U.S. government, industry, and academia as key players. \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this workshop rests in establishment and operation of a unique software consortium which would result in the development a next generation of simulation based engineering science applications, an open multi-scale and multi-physics infrastructure/database supporting multi-vendor interoperability, yet preserving the private sector?s proprietary interests. Broader Impact of this activity would be 1) to greatly increase the capability of computational simulation, modeling and predictive software applications, leveraging entry level systems to large scale HPC computing systems, to address the full spectrum of multi-scale and multi-physics industry challenges to enhance U.S. competitiveness and security. 2) Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits from cost reductions, faster time to market, maximum market penetration (1% increase market share = $4.4 billion economy wide gain, thousands of new jobs). 3) Enable significant ISV and HPC computing market growth.",
