 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has four key focus areas which are designed to \r\nprovide opportunities for student learning, retention and success. The Outreach component \r\ntargets the K-12 system to foster science exploration and success with the ultimate goal of \r\nincreasing the number of students choosing STEM science careers. At the college level, the \r\nproject will increase enrollment of STEM science majors through the development of new \r\ncourses and programs. For retention of STEM students, the project will foster increased \r\nopportunities for student success.  To increase completion/transfer/four year graduation \r\nrates, TMCC will initiate partnerships with four year schools to upgrade its curricula, initiate joint \r\nresearch and aid students in developing familiarity with four year schools. \r\n\r\nThe project will conduct an in-depth review and revision of the existing \r\nTMCC science courses.  This effort meets two critical needs: enhancing student learning by \r\nproviding more hands-on activities and ensuring the curricula is consistent with the standards at \r\nfour year schools.  In the latter area, the project will foster partnerships between the college and \r\nfour year colleges.  These partnerships are expected to bridge the rural isolation experienced by \r\nthe TMCC faculty and provide four year school familiarity to students prior to transfer. \r\n As this project is the demonstration of how involvement in learning impacts student \r\nachievement and career choices, it is applicable not only in STEM subjects but across the \r\ncurriculum.  The current literature suggests student learning is heavily impacted by how \r\nengaged the student is in the learning process.  Using a results driven approach, the project will \r\nidentify what enhancements positively impact student learning not only at the college level, but \r\nacross the continuum of education.  The results of this project can be replicated not only at the \r\ncollege level but in K-12 Native American programs. \r\n \r\n",
