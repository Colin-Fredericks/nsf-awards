 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arizona is renewing its participation in the Connection One (C1) center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2002.  The lead institution is Arizona State University, and the center at present includes five universities and more than twenty industry members.  The main research mission of the C1 is to develop technologies and solutions for emerging wireless communication systems, ranging from circuit designs and smart antennas to wireless network architectures and protocols.  The scope of C1 extends to the integration of wireless and broadband wire-line technologies (optical communications). \r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the proposed site over the next five years will be to increase the scope of the present work focused on communication protocols for wireless systems as well as mixed analog/digital circuit designs.  The extensions to areas of research in wireless technology such as security and RFID are very positive.  The cognitive radio area is also an important area for contribution as well as the integrated sensor area.  \r\n\r\nThe activities proposed by the University of Arizona (UA) research site will impact many important technology needs in the commercial and public sectors.  The use of industrial internships to enhance the educational experience is very attractive.  The site director at UA plans to exploit the NSF SBIR/STTR program to allow small businesses to directly participate in the C1?s research, and anticipates at least two new small companies to be part of the joint UA/industry projects.  The site director has a diversity plan for the I/UCRC that makes specific efforts to attract under-represented groups to fill research, undergraduate and graduate positions.    \r\n",
