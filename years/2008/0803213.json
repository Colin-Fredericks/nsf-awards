Bleiler\r\n\r\nThis grant partially supports the speakers and participants at\r\nconferences of the Cascade Topology Seminar (CTS).  During the\r\nthree-year grant period May 1, 2008 - April 30, 2011, meetings of\r\nthe CTS are scheduled at semiannual intervals.  These conferences\r\nwill be held at various universities in the Northwestern United\r\nStates and Southwestern Canada.  Universities currently active in\r\nthe CTS are the Universities of British Columbia, Calgary,\r\nNevada-Reno, Oregon, Puget Sound, Victoria, and Washington, and\r\nBoise, California-Chico, Oregon, and Portland State Universities.\r\n\r\nThe basic goals of the CTS include providing for frequent\r\ncontacts between workers in similar fields, to allow participants\r\nto keep abreast of recent developments by bringing in speakers\r\nfrom outside the region, to enable graduate students and\r\ntopologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to\r\nhear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers\r\nand members of other institutions, and to provide an opportunity\r\nfor local people to lecture on their own work.  Topics covered\r\nare not limited, however, the interests of the various organizers\r\ntend to be mirrored by the interests of the participants.  Thus,\r\nthe seminar programs usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low\r\ndimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or\r\ncombinatorial group theory.  The CTS also coordinates its\r\nactivities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the\r\nWestern States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom joint\r\nmeetings have occasionally been held.  The URL for the Cascade\r\nTopology Seminar is http://www.mth.pdx.edu/events/cts/.\r\n",
