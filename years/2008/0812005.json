 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a challenging career developments plan focusing \r\non several fascinating problems in Discrete Mathematics. Specific areas in \r\nwhich PI plans to work include Ramsey Theory, Graph colorings, Extremal \r\nCombinatorics and Random and pseudo-random graphs. Furthermore the author \r\nplan to study application of all these areas to Theoretical Computer \r\nScience. The main tools which are going to be used in this investigation \r\ncombine combinatorial techniques, probabilistic methods, tools from Linear \r\nAlgebra and spectral techniques amongst the others. First group of \r\nquestions in this proposal deals with Ramsey numbers. The author wants to \r\nbound these numbers for sparse graphs, i.e., graphs in which every \r\nsubgraph has bounded average degree. Here the goal is to show that such \r\ngraphs have Ramsey numbers which grow linearly in the size of the graph. \r\nAn additional topic is to study various extremal problems. In particular \r\nto obtain extensions of classical Turan's theorem and prove better bounds \r\non the Max Cut in the graphs with forbidden subgraphs. Some of these \r\nproblems were posed many years ago by Erdos, and despite all efforts are \r\nstill open. Another set of questions deals mainly with the study of the \r\nchromatic and choice numbers of graphs. Usually there is a huge gap \r\nbetween these two parameters, so one of the goals in this proposal is to \r\nunderstand the graphs for which chromatic and choice numbers are equal. \r\nFinally the PI also intends to study the asymptotic properties of random \r\nand pseudo-random graphs which is one of the central topics in \r\nProbabilistic Combinatorics.\r\n\r\n Concepts and questions of Combinatorics appear naturally in many \r\nbranches of mathematics, and have also found applications in other \r\ndisciplines. These include applications in Information Theory and \r\nElectrical Engineering, in Statistical Physics and Molecular Biology, and \r\nmost notably in Computer Science. The PI is convinced that progress in the \r\nproblems he discusses will be interesting and significant, and will lead \r\nto new developments in Discrete Mathematics. He believes that the new \r\napproaches and techniques resulting from this project will be applicable \r\nand useful in other fields as well. The author also proposes a wide range \r\nof educational measures closely related to his project. He plans to \r\ndevelop a series of courses for senior undergraduate and starting graduate \r\nstudents, which will serve as a gentle introduction to the variety of \r\npowerful methods in modern Combinatorics. Part of these courses will be \r\nclosely related to the research problems in this proposal. Along the \r\ncourse, the author plans to integrate research activities into the \r\nteaching by introducing open questions that will motivate the students to \r\nundertake research on these fascinating topics, which can lead to a B.A. \r\nthesis or Ph.D. dissertation.\r\n",
