 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue work on the development of concise methods for the asymmetric synthesis of novel beta-lactones (2-oxetanones) via organocatalysis. In particular, further development of Lewis base-promoted, aldol-lactonizations (net cycloadditions) that construct a C-C bond and a C-O bond simultaneously will be pursued to access these versatile strained heterocycles.  In addition to studies of novel Lewis-base promoters, mechanistic studies will be undertaken to gain further insights into the overall reaction pathway including a potential acyl substitution proceeding via an SN2 pathway.  In addition, novel transformation of these heterocycles including ring expansions by way of dyotropic rearrangements of bicyclic and tricyclic beta-lactones will be explored further.  Hypothesis driven studies of novel reaction pathways involving ammonium enolates and including extended and interrupted Morita-Baylis-Hillman processes will be pursued.  The utility of the methods and processes developed will be highlighted by applications to the total synthesis of spongiolactone and curcumalactone. With respect to educational objectives, the translation of laboratory research into the teaching laboratory will continue along with further development of multimedia approaches for conveying the societal relevance of organic synthesis.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Daniel Romo of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University.  Professor Romo's research efforts revolve around the development of catalytic, asymmetric methods for the synthesis of beta-lactones and their application in synthesis including natural product total synthesis.  The results of this research will contribute significantly to further use and application of these underutilized heterocycles, which possess a diverse array of reactivity modes making them highly versatile intermediates for organic synthesis.  Successful development of the proposed methods will have an impact on organic synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries as the methods being developed are robust and \"user friendly.\"  In addition, synthesis of the targeted natural products will have broader impacts in enabling the further understanding of fundamental cellular processes.",

Romo (Texas A&amp;M University)\n\n \n\nThe practice of organic synthesis continues to be instrumental in propelling significant advances in the areas of human and animal health among other fields. One area that has become a focal point for organic synthesis, involves a desire to find ever increasing efficiency and expediency in assembling complex organic molecules with useful biological activity and importantly as single enantiomers (\u00e6single-handedness\u00c6, optically active). In another area, the development and exploitation of novel arrays of atoms (functional groups) for synthetic endeavors continues to be at the core of fundamental organic chemistry. This NSF-funded project enabled the Romo Group to make important contributions in both of these areas.\n\n \n\nIn the past grant period, we (i) developed novel synthetic organic transformations that enable shape-shifting or morphing (dyotropic rearrangements) of three-ring organic compounds containing the novel array of atoms know as beta-lactones, that are joined side to side to three-ring compounds that are joined at one carbon atom (ii) developed a an optimized, practical synthetic procedure for a one-step synthesis of optically active bicyclic (two ring) and tricyclic (three ring) systems containing useful beta-lactones from simple and readily available starting materials (iii) demonstrated the applicability of the aforementioned synthetic processes in conjunction with the dyotropic rearrangement of derived three-ring systems to develop highly concise syntheses of the anticancer agents (a) curcumalactones and curcamonolides and (b) the marine sponge-derived natural product spongiolactone and (iv) in two separate collaborations with computational chemists (Dr. Lisa Perez, Texas A&amp;M Laboratory for Molecular Simulation and Prof. Dean Tantillo, Univ. of California, Davis), we developed mechanistic proposals for a previously developed reaction that also generates beta-lactones and secondly for the described dyotropic process.  In the former case, the mechanistic studies led to a new process for the synthesis of beta-lactones.  The synthesis of the bioactive natural products serves as a prelude to the broader impact of gaining a molecular level understanding of their biological effects.  In particular, the presence of the beta-lactone in spongiolactone which is know to react with proteins also serves as a general biological tool to identify proteins in the proteome that interact with this small molecule.  Thus, this NSF-funded project enables development of novel methods for the synthesis of novel ring structures, beta-lactones, in optically active (\u00e6single-handedness\u00c6) form and demonstrates the use of these intermediates for the efficient synthesis of complex, biologically active natural products.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Romo"
