BRIGE awards further the broaden participation of engineering researchers by increasing the number of engineering graduates, by improving the representation of women and minorities in engineering, and by understanding how to improve recruitment and retention of engineering students.\r\n\r\nThis BRIGE award addresses the toughening of elastomeric materials.  The toughening of elastomeric materials has primarily focused on the incorporation of reinforcing domains (nanofillers, ordered domains); little attention has been given to modification of the elastic response of the network under deformation as a mode of toughness enhancement. Inspired by the hierarchical molecular architecture of and toughening mechanisms exhibited in natural materials, such as collagen and titin, it has been suggested that the incorporation of periodic, ordered domains, similar to the architecture of titin, in an elastomeric framework is a viable method for tuning the elastic response. Weakly-binding supramolecular motifs are ideal systems for developing tunable (temperature, binding activity, environmental conditions) and responsive elastomeric platforms for this investigation. \r\n\r\nThe significance of this interdisciplinary research program lies in the generation of new scientific knowledge relating the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of the supramolecular template and the photopatterned crosslinked domains.  It is anticipated that this fundamental investigation will provide valuable insight into the underlying toughening and dynamic restructuring mechanisms exhibited in nature-inspired supramolecular elastomers. The research will contribute to global efforts to rationally design lightweight, functional materials with enhanced material properties and impact technological advancements in protective systems, sensors, etc. \r\n\r\nThis BRIGE investigation seeks to impact advanced, functional materials and to drive the development of new technologies through establishment of key structure-function relationships.  The PI has designed a thematic program to apply the novel and exciting research to broad educational and outreach activities.  The PI has formed Project Research Teams to mentor and train undergraduate and high school students, especially from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  Additionally, the PI has created innovative outreach programs for middle and high school students, including a Saturday Science Academy, to address the national need to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, particularly engineering. The common thread of this educational and outreach platform is that the PI and strategic partners from industry and academia will serve as mentors, role models, and educators through a comprehensive blend of applied research, preparatory programs, and hands-on learning.\r\n\r\nThis BRIGE grant will broaden the participation of and increase opportunities for all engineers including those from groups underrepresented in the engineering disciplines.  This BRIGE grant will also encourage the PI to become actively and competitively engaged in research as an independent investigator.\r\n\r\n",
