 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site Program in molecular biosciences at the University of Oregon offers an exceptional opportunity for highly motivated undergraduates to carry out individual research projects. Students conduct research under the supervision of a faculty mentor in areas including molecular and cell biology, developmental and evolutionary biology, neurobiology, computational biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology. The 10-week summer program includes an orientation, workshops on experimental methods, group meetings to discuss research progress, faculty seminars, professional development workshops, and field trips. Weekly social gatherings with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and fellow undergraduates provide additional opportunity for students to network with their peers and to learn about research careers. At the end of summer, students present their work as a poster presentation at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. REU students receive a stipend, housing, meals and reimbursement for travel costs. Students from groups underrepresented in the sciences and those with limited access to research are especially encouraged to apply. More information is available at http://biology.uoregon.edu/uoreu/, or by contacting the Program Director, Dr Peter O'Day, at oday@uoregon.edu or (541)346-4518. \r\n\r\n",
