However, when a large-scale \r\nquantum computer is finally built, it will force us to abandon \r\nestablished methods of cryptography, such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman, \r\nwhich are in common use today.  The proposed research will further \r\nthis line of disruptive quantum algorithmic research; but it also aims \r\nto erect a new framework of secure post-quantum cryptography, in order \r\nto maintain this societally critical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe most attractive approach for salvaging modern cryptography would \r\nbe to develop classical cryptosystems for which we have compelling \r\nevidence of security even in the face of quantum adversaries. Recent \r\nwork by the PIs and their collaborators has shown that certain \r\nalgebraic problems possess hardness properties relevant even for \r\nquantum algorithms. We propose to strengthen and leverage these \r\nresults in order to develop cryptographic schemes which can be carried \r\nout by today's computers, but which will remain secure even against \r\nquantum attack in the future.\r\n\r\nIn tandem with this effort, we propose to develop new quantum \r\nalgorithms for breaking cryptosystems based on conjugacy in the braid \r\ngroup.  This is one of the few remaining classical cryptosystems which \r\nhas not already been shown to be vulnerable to quantum attack.\r\n\r\nOur research program is also directly integrated with graduate student \r\ntraining at all four institutions, undergraduate educational \r\ninnovation, educational outreach, and broad scientific dissemination.\r\n\r\n",
