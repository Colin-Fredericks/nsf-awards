 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its broad outlines, the research program of the P.I. aims at the\r\ndevelopment, analysis and computer implementation of numerical methods designed\r\nto approximate the solutions of some partial differential equations (pde's)\r\nthat have important applications in the fields of engineering and physics. The\r\nDiscontinuous Galerkin method constitutes the core methodology of this\r\neffort. The ultimate goal of the research is to make full use of this method\r\nto develop convergent and efficient adaptive methods designed to reduce the\r\nrun time of the algorithms by finding optimal or quasi-optimal meshes. Other\r\nefforts will be directed towards the development of domain decomposition and\r\nmultigrid algorithm for the fast solution of the resulting systems of equations\r\non single as well as multiprocessor computers.\r\nThe P.I. will develop methods and adaptive algorithms for second and fourth\r\norder elliptic problems, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the\r\nCahn-Hilliard equations and use  them to simulate phenomena\r\nmodeled by these equations. Adaptive methods will also be used to simulate\r\nfinite-time blowup of nonlinear evolution equations. Some areas of\r\napplications are chemical reactions where the geometry of the domain plays an\r\nimportant role and the simulation of tumor growth.\r\n\r\nScientific computing is playing an increasingly important role in the progress\r\nof Science as a cost effective alternative to \"real life\" experiments which\r\ncould be very costly, say wind tunnel experiments in aircraft design, or even\r\nimpossible to duplicate, such as supernova explosions and other astrophysical\r\nphenomena. It is worth mention that numerical simulations are playing a crucial\r\nrole in the identification of the potential effects of global warming. The U.S.\r\ngovernment, through its various funding agencies, has made important investments\r\nby the creation of supercomputing centers equipped with the latest\r\ngeneration of massively parallel computers. To extract the full power of these\r\nmachines, with some having tens of thousands of individual processors, efficient\r\nand \"scalable\" methods and algorithms must be developed to keep pace with the\r\nadvances in hardware. Indeed, most current algorithms fall short of harnessing\r\nthe full power of these computers especially when the number of processors\r\nexceeds a few thousand. The Discontinuous Galerkin method is a recently\r\nintroduced methodology with great potential and wide applicability. Its many\r\nattributes include flexibility, ability to handle complex geometries and\r\nscalability. Further understanding of this approach and the development of\r\nefficient and parallel computer codes will have a positive impact on the\r\never increasing areas of Science that make essential use of numerical\r\nsimulations. Finally, two graduate students are actively participating in this\r\nproject as partial fulfillment of their Ph.D. degree requirements. This will\r\nachieve another goal of this project which is to contribute to the training of\r\nthe next generation of researchers.",
