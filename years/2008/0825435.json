 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fabrication and Thermomechanical Characterization of NiTi Shape Memory Alloy Nanowires\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this award is to develop a fundamental understanding of martensitic phase transformation at nanometer scales and the resulting thermomechanical behavior of shape memory alloy (SMA) nanowires. SMA nickel-titanium (NiTi) is a promising functional material for the nano-biotechnology field, constituting an ideal, biocompatible, nanoscale mechanical transducer. The research will result in methods to synthesize nanostructured NiTi and to characterize their resulting shape memory properties.  The research approach includes (1) development of a novel bottom-up approach to synthesize NiTi nanowires and nanopillars, (2) experimental measurement of the thermomechanical deformation and shape memory effects of NiTi nanopillars, and  (3) use of novel atomistic simulations to interpret experimental findings and guide experimental test plans.\r\nIf successful, the results of the research will provide original contributions to elucidate the fundamental deformation mechanisms of shape memory alloy NiTi nanowires. The active coupling of the experimental and modeling approaches will yield a deeper understanding of martensitic phase transformation and dislocation nucleation in nanostructures. Another expected benefit of the research is the development of a new material for nanometer scale actuation. The ability to invoke mechanical transduction at the nanoscale is imperative for many emerging nanosystems. Some innovative applications may include: directed actuation for device self assembly, repeated actuation for locomotion, pressure induced local fluid flow, generation of local force on adhered cells or organic molecules, force delivery from a micro-device. The project will engage graduate researchers, as well as high school students and teachers.\r\n",
