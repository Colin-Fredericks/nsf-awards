 "awd_abstract_narration": "NEDG: Efficient Protocol Design for RFID Systems\r\n\r\nInternet revolutionized the world by connecting numerous computers together. Now people are witnessing another revolution when billions of physical items, such as clothes, folders, books, and other items are connected to the computers. This vision is becoming a reality, thanks to the supporting Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, which allows a reader to read remotely information from an inexpensive tag attached to an item. To enable this technology for reading massive tags for realistic applications, it is crucial to design efficient protocols for RFID communication. The analysis to the current RFID research shows that a dichotomy exists between the high layer data consumer and the low layer wireless communication engineer -- most of the information visible to the low layer is hidden from the high layer. This restricted, throttled interface results in efficiency and security related problems. \r\nTo solve the problem, this project aims to apply cross-layer design methodology so that high layer data users may harness more information exposed from below to solve the existing problems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project will design protocols and algorithms that deliver better performance for very relevant inventory control applications, help researchers in RFID industry to understand the power of \"cross-layer design\", and guide the design of RFID communication protocols to make relevant information available to the high layer.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: This work will potentially have an impact in the industrial standard for RFID communication protocols. The project will also integrate research and education by introducing algorithm and system design in RFID to students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
