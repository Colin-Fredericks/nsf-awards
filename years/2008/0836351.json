 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SGER proposal for the field testing of a promising formative assessment-based mathematics intervention in the civilian sector. The original intervention, from which the civilian intervention will be co-developed, focuses on building mathematics knowledge and reasoning skills in Navy recruits - these are basic skills necessary to meet Navy technical and job demand requirements. This SGER supports the co-development of the civilian sector intervention. The skills the Navy needs in basic mathematics are the same skills necessary to meet basic technical job requirements in the civilian sector - essentially pre-algebra and algebra skills. The project will use CRESST's POWERSOURCE middle school mathematics intervention for this study. The majority of Navy recruits deficient in mathematics are from under represented communities - these are the same communities that are a disadvantage in the civilian workforce because of their lack of basic mathematics skills. The project will produce materials appropriate for use in vocational schools, 2 year colleges, and for remedial mathematics in 4 year institutions.\r\n",
