 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Mexico project will support a workshop in Biological Chemistry, jointly organized by Dr. Joan Selverstone Valentine of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles and Dr. Liliana Quintanar of the Department of Chemistry at the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados (CINVESTAV) in Mexico.  The workshop, to be held in Mexico City, Mexico in October 2008, will discuss multidisciplinary advances in protein folding and their applications.  Protein folding can be studied from many different perspectives, including the understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects that dictate the formation of folding intermediates, to the understanding of the chemical interactions that make protein folding possible, to the more biological aspects about physiological function and protein folding in the cell.  The meeting will bring together all these different perspectives in order to generate new insights and international collaborations.\r\n\r\nA major component of this workshop aims to introduce graduate students and young researchers to different approaches to studying protein folding and to promote the interactions between senior and young researchers in the field from different countries of the Americas. Interactions between students, young and senior researchers are expected to encourage students to pursue graduate and postdoctoral studies and stimulate future collaborations. \r\n",
