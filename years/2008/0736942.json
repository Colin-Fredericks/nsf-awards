 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)  An academic-industry partnership is creating and offering an upper-level undergraduate course, Computer Aided Negotiation of Water Resources Disputes, in which students tackle a real-world, interdisciplinary problem in the form of an interstate water supply dispute.\r\n \r\nStudents are integrating science, technology, public policy, and law to create mutually beneficial solutions to resource disputes. Each student plays the role of a lawyer, biologist, geologist or engineer employed by one of the water supply stakeholders. The stakeholder groups use (1) web-based, pedagogically-sound instructional tools, (2) a multi-disciplinary panel of working professionals, and (3) a computer model that utilizes linear programming algorithms to derive optimal solutions in accordance with priorities determined jointly by the stakeholders. The computer-aided negotiation process, which has been applied successfully to water resources disputes over the past two decades, is being used to develop and seek consensus on a set of operating rules for the system. \r\n\r\nStudents are learning to utilize scientific knowledge and technological tools, function effectively on interdisciplinary teams, and successfully negotiate with disparate interests. Moreover, the students learn the background information required to participate in resource negotiations using research-supported pedagogy. \r\n\r\nGeorge Mason University, the University of Lethbridge, and the University of Texas at Austin are serving as beta test sites for the course.",
