 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to advance the understanding of the mechanics of hydroforming sandwich materials. Sandwich materials, constructed from two face sheets and a porous core, have been used to reduce weight, improve thermal insulation, reduce noise and vibration, and increase energy absorption. The traditional method of constructing shaped sandwich panels is costly and time consuming. The proposed project will investigate a new approach to manufacture shaped sandwich panels based using sheet hydroforming techniques. The project will address challenging issues including: effective characterization and modeling of the constituents of the sandwich panel; understanding the competing failure modes among face sheet wrinkle/fracture, core shear/fracture, and de-lamination between the face sheet and the core; determining the forming limit of the sandwich materials; and conducting experiments to validate model predictions.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will lead to a fundamental understanding of the deformation mechanics of sandwich panels and will broaden the use of sandwich materials for weight reduction applications in various industries. The research results can generate significant impact such as improving vehicle fuel efficiency and decreasing harmful emissions. The project will also provide excellent opportunities for students to actively participate in a research project that has practical applications.",
