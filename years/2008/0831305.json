 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to reason about different equational theories is very\r\nimportant to the analysis of cryptographic protocols.  An understanding of\r\nhow equational properties of a function used by a protocol can be\r\nexploited by an intruder can be invaluable in finding flaws that might\r\notherwise be missed.  Numerous examples exist in the literature and even\r\nin fielded protocols. One very powerful tool for cryptographic protocol\r\nanalysis  with equational theories is equational unification. Equational\r\nUnification was the basis of the NRL Protocol Analyzer (Maude-NPA). Its\r\nuse of these theories allowed it to both reproduce existing flaws and find\r\nnew ones at a level of precision way beyond that available to other tools\r\nat its time. This suggests that equational unification if properly\r\nextended, can give support in a similar fashion to analysis of\r\ncryptographic protocols that use functions that obey more expressive\r\nequational theories. The aim of this project is to provide a\r\nlaboratory for equational unification that will develop the algorithms\r\nand techniques that can be used to support the use of equational\r\nunification in cryptographic protocol analysis. This effort will\r\nconsist of two parts: the development of unification algorithms for\r\ntheories of interest to cryptographic protocol analysis, and the development\r\nof new techniques for employing unification in cryptographic protocol\r\nanalysis. The project will help in the design and implementation of next\r\ngeneration tools for protocol analysis. Tools developed in the project\r\nwill be made available to other researchers working on formal protocol\r\nanalysis methods as well as to protocol designers for experimentation. The\r\neducational component of the project will involve undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students at both institutions.\r\n \r\n",
