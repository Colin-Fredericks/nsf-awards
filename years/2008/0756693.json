In order to accomplish this goal the investigators have established two objectives; the first objective is to fabricate and characterize several different types of SHIM enhanced nanoparticles using both lithographic and chemical synthesis techniques to give maximum flexibility. The second is to actually demonstrate SHIM imaging and hyperthermia in a biological setting. In order to accomplish this aim, the investigators will use bifunctional crosslinkers to apply a protective coating to the particles, making them biologically stable and non-toxic, and also easy to conjugate with an antibody or ligand (such as folic acid) to promote selective binding of the particles to target cells and tissues. The investigators will demonstrate the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles as well as their potential to perform targeted therapy through hyperthermia.",
