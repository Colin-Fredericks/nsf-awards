 "awd_abstract_narration": "The city-sized, rapidly rotating, neutron stars known as pulsars are revealed to astronomers primarily through their radio-frequency emission beams, which sweep past the Earth much like lighthouse beacons. These trains of radio \"flashes\" exhibit a rich variety of phenomena, reflecting complex processes in the pulsar magnetosphere that in turn reflect exotic physical conditions above the stellar surface. Pulsars thus provide uniquely important opportunities to extend and test our basic understanding of physics in extreme conditions. \r\n\r\nHere, the mechanism of pulsar emission will be studied by focusing on two closely connected issues: their predominant core emission in single pulses will be investigated for the first time; and the orientation of its orthogonally polarized modes relative to the magnetic field will be determined, thereby providing important new opportunities to assess, model, and develop appropriate physical theories.\r\n\r\nThe observational, analytical and theoretical work will be conducted by a skilled and experienced international team which will include Dr. Rankin, a graduate student, undergraduates, and collaborators in India and Europe. Dr. Rankin will also continue her public talks on pulsars to K-12 schools and the general public.",
