 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will support the research of the Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC) by using its tools for mapping algorithms onto reconfigurable hardware.  The algorithms to be tested are the preprocessing and feature extraction portion of automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms.  The objective of the proposed work is study the computational complexities associated with hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithms when applied to ATR.  The proposed research will allow investigation of application areas that are not supported by the current CHREC industry members.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will provide access to cutting edge tools for mapping signal processing algorithms onto reconfigurable hardware.  This set of skills is becoming more prevalent in the telecommunication and defense industries.  The proposed research will be performed at a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), and will utilize undergraduates who are underrepresented in the STEM fields and give them with exposure to research activities.  \r\n",
