 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alboran Sea was created in the wake of the young subduction zones that swept across the Western Mediterranean in the Neogene during the convergence of Africa and Europe.  The Gibraltar Arc and Alboran Sea are the westernmost part of the system and one of the most confusing.  The mixture of westward rollback, extension, strike-slip, volcanism, uplift and subsidence has defied attempts to compose a consistent scenario that explains all of the obervations.  Partly as a result of inadequate data, there are many models that have been proposed involving subduction, slab breakoff, delamination and drips.  There is credible evidence that the lithospheric mantle of the overriding plate of a west-facing subduction zone has been thinned by both back-arc stretching and some type of convective removal (e.g. drips, delamination, etc.).  The process of convective thinning is poorly understood but is believed to be important in driving uplift and subsidence of the Earth?s surface, influencing rates of deformation in active orogens, and contributing to recycling of continental materials back into the mantle.  \r\n\r\nThis award provides for a multidisciplinary, international investigation of the Alboran Sea, Gibraltar arc, Atlas Mountains and surrounding areas in the western Mediterranean using passive and active seismology, magnetotellurics, geochemistry, petrology/structural geology, and geodynamic modeling.  The overall goal of the project is to study the processes responsible for convective thinning in the Gibraltar-Alboran Sea region.  The project, known as PICASSO, has now been funded in Spain and Ireland as a colloaborative EU-US program, with proposals from a number of other EU nations submitted or in process.  The project was selected as the pilot experiment for TopoEurope, an EarthScope-like initiative recently approved by the European Science Foundation.  A large part of the field deployments will be done by European scientists, including a 3D EarthScope-type rolling array (IberArray), with additional targeted field experiments by US investigators.  The IberArray is already underway with ~60 stations deployed in the PICASSO field area. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate deep crustal and lithospheric dynamics beneath southern Spain and northern Morocco through seismic imaging and integration of geochemical and geochronologic data of volcanic rocks.  Our primary question is what is controlling the high elevations, magmatism, and exhumational history in the region.  Hypotheses all include some form of deep lithospheric and asthenospheric processes, but can be categorized into slab rollback or lower crustal delamination endmembers. \n\nThe seismic part of the project revealed that there is indeed a fragment of oceanic lithosphere that is rolling back, generating asthenospheric upwelling in its \"wake\". This, in turn, appears to have triggered delamination of lower continental crust and lithosphere on the margins of the western Mediterannean, resulting in the high elevations of southern Spain and northern Morocco.  This also resulted in decompression melting, as evidenced by the widespread occurrence of small basaltic magmatic centers throughout the region.  Thermobarometric constraints on these basaltic magmas constrain the depths of magma generation to be relatively shallow (&lt;70 km), consistent with lithospheric removal by delamination or small-scale convection. \n\nOur results also show the presence of low velocity zones within the lower crust.  These low velocity zones could be zones of partially melted crust, which if so, would be consistent with recent removal of lithospheric mantle, as only in such a process could extensive portions of the lower crust be heated up to the point of partial melting.  Felsic volcanic centers in the region attest to the presence of crustal melting.  Our ongoing work on crystal zonation has allowed us to estimate that the melt-filled porosity of the lower crust is between 20-30%.  Calculated velocities and eletrical conductivities are consistent with geophysical observations.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cin-Ty A Lee"
