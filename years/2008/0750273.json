 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop a practical catalytic method for CH functionalization by means of carbenoid-induced CH insertion.  This project covers the design of new chiral catalysts and the application of unusual carbenoid transformations into useful synthetic methods.  Studies will also be conducted to further define the scope of rhodium-carbenoid induced CH functionalization with emphasis on refining the controlling elements for regioselective CH functionalization and broadening the range of donor/acceptor carbenoids that can be used in this chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Huw M.L Davies of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY at Buffalo.  Dr. Davies will focus his work on the development of methodologies for metal catalyzed asymmetric transformations.   The use of donor/acceptor-substituted carbenoids to increase the scope of C-H insertion chemistry will be highlighted by this research.  The project has potential broader impact for the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries and the work provides an excellent venue for the training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates.",
