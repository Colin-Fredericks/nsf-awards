Lawson\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to relate the theory of formal group\r\nlaws to phenomena in stable homotopy theory and K-theory.  In\r\nstable homotopy theory, the objective is to begin making\r\nfundamental computations in the theory of topological automorphic\r\nforms developed in joint work with Behrens.  This will first\r\nproceed by examining and computing the homotopy of spectra\r\nassociated to certain moduli of abelian surfaces such as Shimura\r\ncurves, and then by working towards higher chromatic filtrations.\r\nIn algebraic K-theory, the objective is to make systematic use of\r\nthe relationship between formal group laws and complex cobordism\r\nto systematize computations in algebraic K-theory and relate them\r\nto the chromatic filtration, with the hope of gaining\r\nunderstanding of the \"chromatic redshift\" phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe subject of homotopy theory arose as a method to answer\r\nconcrete questions in geometry by way of algebra.  In the\r\nprocess, a strange connection was discovered with formal group\r\nlaws, which themselves are intimately related to quite different\r\nsubjects such as number theory and elliptic curves.  In\r\nparticular, there is a surprising connection between elliptic\r\ncurves and mathematical physics.  This research focuses on\r\napplying very recent developments in homotopy theory to study\r\nconnections such as these, with the hope that our understanding\r\nof number theory and our understanding of homotopy theory can\r\nbenefit each other.\r\n",
