 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators of the project Measurement, Modeling, and Methods Category are studying how science and engineering students build towards problem solving expertise throughout a major part of their academic careers and how they transfer their knowledge and skills across undergraduate STEM courses. They are observing students' problem across 3 years of courses starting with mathematics and continuing through introduction to physics to engineering courses. \r\n\r\nThe three year research plan consists of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that take place both in-class and out-of-class and involve 3000 students through seven classes at Kansas State University. The research team is studying the following variables associated with problem solving: the problem features of structuredness, complexity, domain specificity, and dynamicity; problem representation of form, organization, and sequencing; and individual differences of domain knowledge, problem solving experience, reasoning skills, and epistemological maturity. Quantitative data and qualitative evidence are being used to study the variables. An on-line homework system created with previous NSF funding (DUE 0206923) will enable quantitative analysis of the variables with large numbers of students.\r\n\r\nThe data of subjects from underrepresented groups will be analyzed and compared to the larger groups of students. Results of this project are expected to advance the knowledge and understanding of STEM teaching and learning in undergraduate education. \r\n",

Our results indicate that in all three disciplines students are able to master procedural\nknowledge.  However, they do not necessarily develop a deep conceptual understanding.\n\nIn mathematics, the students have difficulty gaining conceptual understanding beyond the action and process levels of a mathematical concept.
