Subjects treated\r\nrange from orbifold models in string theory over representation\r\nand character theory in 2-categories to generalized Moonshine and\r\nstable homotopy theory.  Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character theory\r\narose in the context of homotopy theory and exposes many formal\r\nsimilarities between the above fields.  The goal of the project\r\nis to better understand the mechanisms underlying these\r\nobservations. Power operations in elliptic cohomology were\r\nalready linked to product formulas in string theory and to the\r\ntwisted Hecke operators of generalized Moonshine. This project\r\nwill further pursue these connections, aiming to clarify the\r\nlinks between the literature in these three subjects.\r\n\r\nIn less technical terms: Elliptic cohomology is a rich mix of\r\nareas of mathematics and physics, which on the surface do not\r\nappear to have much to do with each other. Especially in the\r\npresence of an action by a group of symmetries, one can observe\r\nmany analogies between seemingly unrelated research areas. With\r\ncollaborators from various fields of mathematics, this project\r\nseeks to find an explanation for the deeper mechanisms underlying\r\nthese phenomena.\r\n",
