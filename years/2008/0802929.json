 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioanalytical sensors are detection/measurement devices that transform a biological recognition event into a measurable signal.  Over the last 20-30 years, bioanalytical sensors have led to both economic and intellectual breakthroughs in medicine, environmental monitoring, industry, and biotechnology.  In more recent years, the importance of sensors in national defense and security has also been recognized.\r\n\r\nThe 2008 GRC on Bioanalytical Sensors will bring together the experts in the fields of biochemistry, biology, chemistry, engineering, materials science, medicine, molecular biology, and physics to discuss the latest developments in bioanalytical sensing.  The overall goal and long term objective of this conference is to generate new ideas and collaborations leading to improved instrumentation and materials for future detection platforms.  Specific themes of the 2008 conference will include: molecular recognition; signal transduction/platform development (SPR, fiber optic, cantilever, magnetic-based, and electrochemical sensors); supporting/enabling technologies (microfluidics, nanoparticles, MEMS); and real-world detection.  At least one oral session will be devoted to each general thematic area, with a total of 28 oral presentations and 2 poster sessions.  In addition, we will convene a Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) immediately preceding the GRC; the GRS is organized and conducted by graduate students and postdocs, with limited guidance from the GRC chairs. \r\n",
