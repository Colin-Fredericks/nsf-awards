 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Minnesota is the centerpiece of an overall Education and Human Resources program within the University?s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC).  This site provides cutting-edge research and education experiences in Materials Science and Engineering by assembling a group of talented undergraduates along with high school teachers.  Seven undergraduate students are recruited for a 10 week summer program from a nationwide pool of applicants with an emphasis on four-year, Tribal colleges, and Native American students.  Six teachers, mostly from the greater Twin Cities area, participate in the 6 week Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program.  Each participant in the REU and RET programs will be integrated into the research group of a faculty member from one of the MRSEC?s interdisciplinary research groups and pursue an independent research project in polymers, organic electronics, magnetic materials, and nanoparticles.  MRSEC faculty and students are based in six different science and engineering departments, assuring a particularly broad and interdisciplinary experience for all the participants. In addition to engaging in research projects, participating students and teachers will attend research seminars, career development and ethics workshops, on-campus social events, and have opportunities to present their research at professional meetings.  This Site is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences.",
