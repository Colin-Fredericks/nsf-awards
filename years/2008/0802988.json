 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to provide partial support for a Topical workshop in  Miami which will bring experimentalists and theorists together to discuss new developments in LHC related physics, dark energy, dark matter as well as new theoretical ideas in AdS/CFT and  Gravity. The workshop will be held in Miami in December and the funds requested will be for the support of students and young post-docs who otherwise would not be able to attend.  The experimental talks will focus on Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Neutrino Physics and LHC detectors and planned experiments. The Theory talks will be centered on the \r\nAnti-deSitter Space- Conformal Field theory connection first suggested by Klebanov and \r\nMaldacena (both are giving talks) and which has been very fruitful in improving our understanding of strongly coupled QCD especially the quark-gluon plasma as well as various properties the spectra of QCD. Recent developments of this correspondence as well as more general talks on recent advances in theoretical particle physics will be discussed at this workshop.\r\n",
