 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a new foundation for workflow and business \r\nprocess management, called the \"artifact-based semantic workflow model\", \r\nand working in this context to develop new theoretical results, \r\ntechniques and algorithms for specifying, designing, evolving, and \r\nimplementing workflows. The new foundation is based on two fundamental \r\npremises. The first is to use the artifact-based approach to workflow \r\npioneered at IBM Research. This approach is data-centric rather than \r\nprocess-centric, and allows to structure workflows according to the \r\ndesired life-cycle of key business artifacts (or entities) that are \r\nmanipulated by a workflow. The second premise is to use techniques from \r\nsemantic web services to enable the declarative specification of \r\nworkflows based on the semantics of the workflow services (or tasks) to \r\nbe performed and underlying goals of the business managers. This is \r\nfundamentally different from most current approaches to workflow \r\nspecification, which are procedural. \r\n\r\nA major thrust of the proposed \r\nresearch is to develop technical results (e.g., techniques, algorithms, \r\nand tools) to enable the automated construction of workflows, starting \r\nfrom from a specification of the artifacts to be manipulated, the \r\nindividual services that might be applied to them, and a goal to be \r\nachieved (expressed using a logic formula rather than as a flowchart).\r\n \r\nMore information can be found from the project web page \r\n(http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~su/NSF/0812578).\r\n",
