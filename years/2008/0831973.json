 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of communication networks has profoundly increased \r\nthe availability of information and increased productivity. A \r\nkey requirement in continuing to reap the benefits of connectivity \r\nis the growth of pervasive wireless networks. Wireless networks \r\nare resource constrained, primarily due to their broadcast nature. \r\nAlleviation of this constraint requires an efficient, distributed \r\nsolution to the Medium Access Control (MAC) problem. In this project, \r\nthe investigators study `locally-optimal scheduling and PHY \r\nadaptation', by incorporating physical layer (PHY) models into \r\nmaximal scheduling for increased accuracy, and priority mechanisms \r\nfor increased efficiency. This will result in the design of \r\nefficient, distributed MAC protocols, whose guarantees are accurate, \r\nfrom the PHY perspective. The results from this research, which is \r\ntraining a graduate Ph.D., are disseminated through appropriate \r\npublications and seminars, to guide the development of future \r\nwireless network MAC protocols and are incorporated into the \r\nuniversity?s undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n\r\nPHY adaptation and scheduling (MAC) in general ad hoc wireless \r\nnetworks, is an NP-hard problem, especially, if distributed \r\nsolutions are desired. In this project, the investigators study \r\nlocally-optimal algorithms, a generalization of maximal scheduling, \r\nusing broad queuing results that prove stability, and adapt them \r\nto wireless networks, with careful attention paid to the PHY model. \r\nTheoretical characterization of the performance of these algorithms \r\nis carried out using graph theoretic and optimization theoretic \r\nanalysis, along with intuition on the design of optimal (though, \r\ncentralized) MAC algorithms. The key ideas of this research, which \r\nare at the intersection of communication theory, queuing theory, \r\ngraph theory and optimization, are incorporated into university \r\ncourses, using the concepts of Lyapunov functions and fluid models. \r\n",
