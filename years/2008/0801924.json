Khondaker, University of Central Florida\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to design, fabricate and characterize a novel planar gated organic photovoltaic device (OPV) with in-plane cathode and anode deposited from different metals. The approach is to (i) fabricate interdigitated electrode arrays by a combination of optical and electron beam lithography on a doped silicon substrate, (ii) deposit active layers of different thickness, and (iii) characterize device performance by photocurrent imaging, and room- and low temperature transport measurements.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: A novel planar electrode OPV with integrated back gate will be fabricated. In contrast to existing OPV?s, this new device will (i) allow independent control of active layer thickness and electrode spacing, (ii) eliminate the need for transparent electrodes giving more flexibility in choice of materials, and (iii) allow in-situ field effect mobility measurements. Device properties will be correlated directly with the figures of merit of the device under investigation. This will lead to high efficiency OPVs by offering better charge mobility, enhanced charge transport and collection efficiency, and device manufacturing methods.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Successful demonstration of the planar gated OPV will have significant impact towards realization of high efficiency, low cost organic solar cells. For educational development and outreach the investigators propose: (i) training of female and minority students, high school students and teachers, (ii) development of a new graduate course on energy and nanoscience, and (iii) community outreach through internet, news letters, exhibitions at the Orlando Science Center, and Florida Solar Energy Center.\r\n",
