 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory project involves qualitative research on the impact of green built technologies on subjective experience of health and well-being of users.  Observations and interviews with residents are conducted on two communities.  In one, buildings were designed with \"green\" technologies with an objective of making the community environmentally and socially sustainable.  In the other, social and environmental sustainability are emphasized, but buildings were not built with green technologies.  Through the comparative design, the PI identifies key differences in people's perception of their health and well-being.  This information will be used to develop a more extensive study of a larger sample of communities.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in its identification of the pathways through which people are satisfied or unsatisfied with socially and environmentally sustainable living and the effect that green technology has on satisfaction.  The broader impacts lie in the study's contribution to the design of environmentally and socially sustainable communities identifying the factors that create the highest degree of satisfaction among its residents.",
