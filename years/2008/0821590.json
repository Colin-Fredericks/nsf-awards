Such a system does not presently exist in the United States. III-nitrides are of interest as critical active materials optoelectronic devices (light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and solar cells) and transistors. The development complements ongoing investment at UNC Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit is in enabling basic research on III-nitride optoelectronic materials, and through understanding of connections between device performance, material properties, defect formation, and growth conditions. The track record of participants is excellent and adequate resources are in place for conducting this work. The proposed research is not incremental but fundamental in the study of ultra-low defect material growth. A proposed photoluminescence system will provide a means for quantitative analysis of radiative efficiency of semiconductor materials.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program is to provide unique optoelectronic heterostructures to many device researchers including: (1) UNC Charlotte faculty and students in several departments, (2) selected high school student interns through established UNC Charlotte programs, (3) businesses operating within the Charlotte Research Institute, and (4) as part of the Optics User Facilities, faculty and researchers at other institutions. Students will benefit by directly operating the reactor, and also by fabricating devices using novel materials provided. Societal impact is considerable, through increased lighting efficiency and improved solar cell technology.",
