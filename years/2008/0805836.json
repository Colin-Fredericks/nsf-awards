Contact structures on 3-manifolds encode subtle\r\ntopological information, and knots in contact manifolds (tangent\r\nor transverse to the contact planes) have many additional\r\nproperties. The goal of this project is to better understand the\r\nrelation between and find new applications of various invariants\r\nof contact structures and Legendrian and transverse knots. More\r\nspecifically, the PI will study various versions of the contact,\r\nLegendrian and transverse invariants in Heegaard Floer homology;\r\nshe proposes to investigate knots via associated contact\r\nmanifolds, such as those obtained by surgery on Legendrian knots\r\nand branched covers of transverse knots. A related part of the\r\nproject is to develop similar invariants in knot homologies\r\narising from quantum algebra (Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky\r\nhomology).  An intriguing relation between Heegaard Floer theory\r\n(defined via holomorphic disks) and the quantum algebraic knot\r\nhomologies exists outside of contact geometry; the PI proposes to\r\nstudy this relation in presence of a contact structure. In\r\nparticular, in her previous work the PI suggested a transverse\r\nknot invariant in Khovanov homology.  The interplay between\r\nHeegaard Floer and Khovanov homologies allows to use this\r\ninvariant to prove tightness of certain contact structures on\r\nbranched double covers of knots. Further progress on this project\r\ncould yield quantum algebraic tools for studying contact\r\nstructures in a more general setting, and would improve our\r\nunderstanding of the relation between theories of a very\r\ndifferent nature.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is on geometric topology, an area of\r\nmathematics that studies shapes of curved spaces (manifolds) in\r\nvarious dimensions.  In dimensions 3 and 4, this can be thought\r\nof as understanding the structure of space and space-time, and is\r\nparticularly interesting and important. The study of knots in\r\ndimension 3 plays a major role in topology and has important\r\nconnection to other sciences (for example, DNA and certain\r\nproteins can be knotted). The proposed project focuses on study\r\nof 3-manifolds and knots in presence of a contact structure, an\r\nobject somewhat analogous to an electric field in physics.\r\n(Historically, the study of contact structures was first\r\nmotivated by classical mechanics, optics and thermodynamics.)\r\nContact structures are important objects by themselves, but also\r\nencode valuable information about the space they live in. In her\r\nresearch, the PI plans to use tools and ideas from different\r\nbranches of mathematics such as geometry and quantum algebra. The\r\nbroader goals of the project thus include a better understanding\r\nof the relation between these different branches, as well as new\r\nresults in and applications of the topology of contact manifolds.\r\n",
