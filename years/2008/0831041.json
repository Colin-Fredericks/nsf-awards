 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on hardware features \r\nto improve the security of software systems.\r\nBy refining the coarse-grained protections available in\r\ntoday's architectures, the project will aim to protect\r\nthe integrity of individual software objects or components.\r\nThe hardware mechanisms force tight controls on \r\nthe execution of software components, which\r\nprogrammers can define to be as large as entire\r\napplications or as small as individual objects. \r\nThe goal is to rapidly detect and also recover from attacks that\r\nimproperly access memory or take over the CPU.\r\nThe approach also includes hardware-supervised\r\nrecovery, to enable systems to return to normal \r\noperation after an attack and to protect the recovery \r\nprocess itself from attacks.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this project include the ability to \r\nthwart a large class of attacks and the potential of\r\ndeveloping more robust software systems in the future.\r\nRecovery, which has received somewhat less attention than\r\nattack prevention or detection, is especially important for \r\nembedded systems that do not have the luxury of intervention \r\nby human operators.\r\n\r\nThe project will be used to train graduate students and to \r\nfeed material into graduate courses taught at the three \r\nparticipating universities. Modules will also be developed for \r\nuse in K-12 education with the aim of drawing students into \r\nconsidering careers in computer science and engineering. \r\n",

Over the course of the year, multiple teams of Iowa high school students were \npresented with learning modules related to the Alice environment, which supports an innovative game-like environment for teaching fundamental \nprogramming concepts. As part of this outreach program, the PI with the assistance of several undergraduate students developed several video game scripting engines. The main goal behind this development was to introduce programming and computational thinking concepts to students in 6th through 12th grade who are unfamiliar with programming. Instead of bogging students down with syntax, compilers, and debugging, our engines are an attempt to provide a more entertaining first programming language experience. We've created 4 games to date and are always looking for new project ideas.\n\nDuring outreach sessions, we introduce the concept of game scripting to s..."
