 "awd_abstract_narration": "URM: Environmental Biology in the Pacific Islands\r\n\r\nThis program, based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, will significantly increase the number of Pacific Islanders pursuing bachelors and advanced degrees by recruiting and training promising students from the islands of Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands, and the U.S. Compact-of-Free-Association Micronesian states (Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and Republic of the Marshall Islands) in modern approaches to environmental biology.  Research areas include: field ecological studies on marine ecosystems that are largely intact, as well as those that are badly damaged by invasive alien species and pollution; studies of both coastal and mountain biota, with emphases on invertebrate, vertebrate (esp. Hawaiian birds) and plant communities; biodiversity investigations using classical and molecular approaches; and species-focused research on island endemics.  Thirteen students will be trained each years, eight during summer-only research internships, plus five, selected from the summer interns, who will remain in the program throughout the year. Up to 45 students will be extensively trained throughout five years of the program.  Internships will be intimately tied to faculty-mentor laboratories for training in scientific research and preparation for graduate school, augmented by important cohort training in ?how to do science,? scientific writing, and oral presentations. Emphasis will be on one-on-one training by the mentor and others in her/his lab and student ?ownership? of a research project.  Interns will be guided to develop all aspects of an individual research project that will contribute to the solution of globally felt problems.  Additionally, the program will introduce interns to activities in governmental agencies and NGOs involved with environmental management and conservation. This URM will contribute to understanding biodiversity and conservation problems, with a particular focus on island ecosystems where impacts of modern society are heavy and where, for many, global climate change is not just a concept but a threat to the Islanders? way of life.  The program will return to the islands a group of native islanders exceptionally trained to recognize and resolve local problems and to serve as role models and educators for other young residents.
