Galloway\r\n\r\nThe Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden is running a\r\nsemester long program on Geometry, Analysis, and General\r\nRelativity from August to December, 2008.  The program will start\r\noff with a conference at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)\r\nin Stockolm, August 25-29, 2008.  This will be a comprehensive\r\nprogram focusing on analysis and geometry problems revolving\r\naround the Einstein equation, the the field equation of general\r\nrelativity. The purpose of this award is to help U.S. researchers\r\nand students with travel expenses to Sweden, and with local\r\nexpenses pertaining to their participation in the KTH conference.\r\nThe Einstein equation is one of the most important geometric\r\npartial differential equations, in both the Lorentzian and the\r\nRiemannian settings.  Spectacular progress has been made in\r\nrecent years in the study of the Einstein equation, wih progress\r\nbeing made on many fronts. These developments have brought into\r\nfocus the deep connections between the Einstein equation and\r\nother important geometric PDE's, including the wave map equation,\r\nthe Yang-Mills equation, the Yamabe equation and the Ricci flow\r\nequation. The main aim of this Mittag-Leffler Institute program\r\nis to bring together the leading contributors to these\r\ndevelopments to promote collaboration in the study of the global\r\nstructure of solutions to the Einstein equation and related\r\ngeometric PDE's.\r\n\r\nRapid progress on experimental and numerical aspects of\r\ngravitational physics has been made in recent years, and it is of\r\nincreasing physical importance to understand effects such as\r\ngravitational radiation, gravitational collapse and inflation,\r\nwhere the strong field features of the Einstein equation play a\r\nfundamental role. The results of the collaborative research and\r\nanalysis to be carried out during the program will have a\r\nsignificant bearing on these fundamental physical problems.\r\nParticipation of graduate students and recent PhD's is a key\r\ncomponent of the program, and is crucial to the continuing\r\nvitality of the area.  Further details concerning this\r\nMittag-Leffler program and the kick-off conference at KTH may be\r\nfound at: http://www.mittag-leffler.se/programs/0809f/\r\nhttp://www.math.kth.se/ag08/\r\n",
