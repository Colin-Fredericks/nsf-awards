 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting support to enable it to implement a second Leadership Development Institute (LDI) that will support and encourage broader participation by Native American and Alaska Native faculty and staff in efforts to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at their home institutions. Based upon the lessons learned and the overall success of the first Leadership Development Institute, the second Institute will be expanded to include Native Hawaiian faculty/staff selected through the application and review process for the second LDI.\r\nThis overall goal and a set of specific objectives will be achieved through a Program consisting of a three-part Leadership Development Institute and. The proposed three-part Institute will consist of a five-day Institute (Session I) in August 2008; a two-day Institute (Session II) in February 2009; and a five-day Institute (Session III) in August 2009. Participants in the Program must be currently employed at a Tribal College or University (TCU), an Alaska Native-serving institution, or a Native Hawaiian-serving institution and must be an enrolled or affiliated member of a federally recognized tribe/entity or have a demonstrated long-term commitment to and involvement in STEM education at TCUs, Alaska Native-serving Institutions, or Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. Communication and interaction with participants in between sessions will be through videoconferencing, Listserv, and a dedicated web site.",
