 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a research conference to develop guidelines for 21st Century pedagogical middleware: an integrated set of conceptual, methodological, and technological tools for teaching complex innovative and creative thinking in a digital world.  The focus area of interest will be to model the sustainabilty of urban areas, particularly in very large or megacities. The conference will be held in Arizona so that researchers can parter with NSF's Long Term Ecologial Research Network (LTER) at Arizona State. Select expert researchers will participate, drawing from the following interdisciplinary fields: (a) theories of learning, (b) technology, (c) virtual learning organizations, (d) research methodology, and (e) measurement. For each theme, a lead discussant will prepare working documents prior to the meeting, lead discussions during the meeting, and prepare the appropriate section of the resulting white paper.  \r\n\r\nFunding for this initiative is important because it is address the problem of how to best guide research and development of technologically complex learning communities and organizations. This colloquium is innovative in its goal to link theories of how people think creatively in cross-functional teams to inform the design of collaborative technologies. Further, by considering assessment throughout the process, the resulting integrative framework (whitepaper) will be well-grounded and useful to a wide interdisciplinary audience.",
