 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kapitula\r\nDMS-0806636\r\n\r\n     The governing equations for the wave function of a\r\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are Hamiltonian; in particular,\r\nthey are a variant of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation known as\r\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation.  The analysis of this physical\r\nsystem leads to several intriguing fundamental mathematical\r\nproblems for Hamiltonian systems which deal with the existence,\r\nspectral stability, and nonlinear stability of waves.  The major\r\nmathematical problems to be addressed in this proposal include\r\n(a) the construction and spectral stability of fully\r\nthree-dimensional waves in the presence of a cigar magnetic trap\r\nvia the technique of spatial dynamics, (b) the construction and\r\nspectral stability of two-dimensional periodic waves in the\r\npresence of an optical lattice, and (c) a careful study of\r\neigenvalues with negative Krein signature.  Regarding (c), there\r\nare two avenues that are to be explored: (1) the determination of\r\nembedded eigenvalues of negative sign in the case that the\r\nsolitary wave is realized as a limit of a family of periodic\r\nwaves, and (2) the determination of the exact number of\r\neigenvalues with negative sign.\r\n\r\n     Especially since the 1997 Nobel Prize winning work of S.\r\nChu, C. Cohen-Tannoudji, and W. Phillips on the exotic quantum\r\nphenomenon known as BECs, there has been a great deal of exciting\r\nexperimental and theoretical work in the study of BECs.  In order\r\nto form a BEC, it is necessary that the matter is cooled to\r\nbillionths of a degree above absolute zero; hence, BECs are\r\nextremely fragile, and it is likely to be some time before any\r\npractical applications are developed. Nevertheless, they have\r\nproved to be useful in exploring a wide range of questions in\r\nfundamental physics.  Examples include experiments that have\r\ndemonstrated interference between condensates due to\r\nwave-particle duality, the study of superfluidity and quantized\r\nvortices, and the slowing of light pulses to very low speeds. \r\nVortices in BECs are also currently the subject of\r\nanalogue-gravity research, studying the possibility of modeling\r\nblack holes and their related phenomena in the lab.  The\r\nmathematical results of this proposal will help both\r\ntheoreticians and experimentalists better understand the dynamics\r\nof not only patterns such as vortices, necklaces, and solitons in\r\nBECs, but also the dynamics of waves and patterns in Hamiltonian\r\nsystems which are used to model interesting phenomena such as\r\nwaves in fluids and light propagation in optical fibers.  The\r\ninclusion and training of undergraduate students is an integral\r\npart of this proposal. Introducing students to the interplay\r\nbetween applications and experiments, numerics, and formal and\r\nrigorous analysis, will lead them to being excited about seeing\r\nthe connections between the physical world and the mathematical\r\nworld.  This will further lead the participating students towards\r\na deeper appreciation for the usefulness of mathematics in other\r\ndisciplines, and perhaps then allow them to be open to the idea\r\nof doing more serious applied mathematics at the graduate level. \r\nCalvin College has a history of producing successful Ph.D.\r\nstudents in mathematics and statistics. Approximately one-third\r\nof these students have been women, who are significantly\r\nunderrepresented in the mathematical sciences. Furthermore,\r\nCalvin has been very successful in the education and training of\r\nsecondary education teachers.  As a consequence of this award,\r\nthe investigator will be able to fruitfully support the\r\ncollege-wide effort in training future researchers and educators\r\nin the mathematical sciences.",
