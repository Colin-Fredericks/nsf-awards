This proposal enhancement activity consists of sponsoring a one-day workshop inclusive of presentations focused on effective proposal writing as well as a forum for prospective PIs to discuss specific questions related to their proposals with NSF Program Directors working in the S-STEM program.  The workshop is designed to accommodate fifty participants from various institutions throughout the country.  Universities that have traditionally been unsuccessful in receiving S-STEM awards as well as institutions that serve historically underrepresented students are targeted for participation in the workshop.",
