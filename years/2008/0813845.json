 "awd_abstract_narration": "This year, the IEEE Communications Theory Workshop will take place on May 11-14 in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. The continued success of this workshop lies in its informal and highly interactive atmosphere, in contrast to more formal conferences. As before, the workshop will be single track, with five technical sessions, three plenary speakers, two panel discussions, and a hot-topics submitted poster session. The technical sessions consist of invited lectures given by leaders in academia and industry. In addition, there will be hot-topics poster session with an open call for participation.  This workshop uniquely combines communications, information theory, and networking.  The NSF support for travel to the workshop will be carefully disseminated to women, minorities, or young researchers by the young, successful, up-and-coming organizing committee. \r\n\r\n",
