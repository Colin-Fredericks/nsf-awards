How Fast?\r\n\r\nThe production of Portland cement-based concrete is considered one of the largest contributors to carbon dioxide, which is a major component of greenhouse gas emissions.  Through life cycle assessment of the sustainability of concrete, concrete carbonation has been evaluated as a potentially important sink for carbon dioxide.  However, the extent and kinetics of the up take of carbon dioxide by concrete that is crushed and recycled after its primary use have not been examined in detail.  This exploratory project will develop a conceptual model for the sequestration of carbon dioxide by concrete through data mining of existing equilibrium and kinetic studies from diverse disciplines.  The data will be analyzed to estimate maximum carbonation potentials and optimize sequestration.  The results will be incorporated in life cycle assessment models and experimental approaches to evaluate the sequestration potential of reuse and recycle of concrete.  Understanding the role of deconstructed materials in greenhouse gas sequestration will influence the recycling of concrete as well as use of concrete in future construction.  The participating graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from exposure to a broad range of disciplines and development of conceptual models.\r\n",
