 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Chad A, Mirkin at Northwestern University to study functional coordination chemistry-based systems. The laboratory is utilizing a synthetic methodology for the preparation of flexible supramolecular complexes known as the Weak-Link Approach (WLA), resulting in structures that allow one to access multiple geometries in situ.  Using this coordination-chemistry approach, the laboratory is targeting allosteric and heteroligated systems with unique functions that cannot easily be accessed using alternative strategies based on conventional coordination- or organic chemistry.  Through this work, the laboratory will design: (1) novel detection systems with signal amplification capabilities that have true \"off-on\" capabilities in terms of the allosterically regulated catalytic event; (2) structures with recognition groups that can orient a complex substrate for the regioselective catalytic functionalization of the substrate; and (3) systems that can function in aqueous media (without organic co-solvents. Practical application of many of the amplification systems demonstrated thus far will require the ability for such complexes to function in water.  \r\nThe work will lead to a new class of highly sensitive and selective chemical detection systems for analytes that are hazardous to the environment and new catalysts capable of effecting high value chemical transformations. In addition, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students trained through this work will gains skills that make them highly competitive in the US chemical industry.  An emphasis will be placed on including women and under-represented minorities in the three year effort.",
