The meeting will be hosted by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor MI from 17-20 May 2009. NSF funds are targeted to increase the participation of graduate students at the meeting.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, the three United States sections of the international Combustion Institute - Eastern States, Central States, and Western States - initiated a biennial series of national meetings on combustion.  These meetings have been highly successful, based on the attendance and the number of presentations. Consequently, this biennial event has gained a prominent stature and become the premier national conference in fundamental and applied combustion. \r\n\r\nThe conference will consist of three days of primarily contributed presentations organized in multiple parallel sessions each day. (Typically, there are six parallel sessions or more.) The contributed presentations will include both podium and poster presentations. A few invited speakers will also present each day. Information about the availability of travel support to graduate students will be provided in all the meeting announcements and on appropriate websites. In addition, an announcement about the availability of travel support will be mailed to members of the Combustion Institute.\r\n\r\nCombustion research is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing diverse disciplines in engineering and science. Society relies on combustion for power generation, transportation, and manufacturing. This conference allows combustion-focused researchers to exchange ideas in a stimulating technical forum. Policymakers will also be in attendance to participate in the exchange of information. The intellectual merit of this activity arises from the participation of combustion experts from across the United States and from various countries, dissemination of their technical findings, their communications with students, and their visions of future research directions.",
