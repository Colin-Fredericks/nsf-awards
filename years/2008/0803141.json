The development of a new elementary education program of study that is standards-based and uses constructivist methods that focuses on relevant science and math based on identified needs will represent an innovative model being done for the first time in a tribal college setting. The incorporation of Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara cultural values with math and science concepts across the elementary teacher education curriculum will enhance the chance for elementary school age children to become grounded in STEM fields because of their teachers.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mada Maagarishtauo Awa Hee Aadsa Aru Maa Giguckiigash (The ones that teach our children how everything on this earth works) was a STEM Teachers of Excellence Program that proposed to \"strengthen the quality of elementary school teachers who will eventually teach on the Fort Berthold Reservation.\"  The major outcomes that came from this funding were:\n\nThe development and accreditation of a baccalaureate degree in elementary education with emphases in middle school math and science that is standards-based and uses constructivist methods and utilizes cohort strategies to help students succeed.  \nThe program increased the number of American Indian elementary education teachers in Fort Berthold schools.  The graduates of the program learned to incorporate culture into their courses and teach STEM courses in a hands-on constructivist method.  These students grew up locally and are dedicated to the community and the students in the schools.  This had made a tremendous impact on Fort Berthold, although there have only been eight graduates thus far in the program.  \nThroughout the grant, the program offered professional development opportunities in math and science for local K-12 teachers and administrators.  It was our goal, not only to train our students in culturally relevant constructionist methods, but also to train the existing teachers.  By providing the training, we aimed to increase the learning done by Fort Berthold children in the classroom.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stacey Mortensen"
