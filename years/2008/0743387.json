 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wetlands have long been recognized as significant habitats where organic matter and other materials are stored and transformed.  While their quantitative importance is well-established, it is less clear why certain wetlands carry out these functions to a greater degree than others.  This research will test the idea that the actual location and configuration of patches of vegetation within tidal wetlands influences the extent of alteration in water quality.  In the simplest case, patches closest to the actual point where water exchanges between the wetlands and the mainstem Hudson River should have the greatest effect on concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients.  In contrast, patches at higher elevation are less frequently inundated by tides and therefore should have less influence.  \r\n\r\nWetlands are rigorously protected by law and frequently the target of restoration efforts to improve the services they provide to wildlife, water quality and human society.  Prioritization of protection efforts and design of restoration plans presupposes a solid knowledge of what factors control how well these ecosystems perform these functions.  This research addresses such controls and will directly involve teachers and employees of resource management agencies in both field work and data analysis.  This real-world experience should improve the ability of teachers to prepare lessons illustrating ecological principles and give managers a firm rationale for protecting these valuable ecosystems.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nTidal freshwater wetlands of the Hudson River carry out\nseveral important ecological functions including nursery areas for small fishes\nand contributing to improved water quality. \nWe examined the capability of these wetlands to remove nitrate as tidal\nwaters enter and exit a range of wetlands. \nNitrate is often the most common form of fixed nitrogen in water and\nsoil and may cause water quality problems where overabundant.  While all wetlands showed some ability to\nreduce nitrate concentrations during tidal exchange it was obvious some were\nfar more effective than others.  It turns\nout that the prevalence of certain kinds of vegetation, the common cattail for\nexample, were associated with greater nitrate removal and so tidal marshes with\nmore of these plants were more effective at nitrate removal.  These plants typically occur on the higher\nparts of the marsh surface and our findings raise the question of whether these\nplants can persist as se-level rises.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have communicated our results to the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation who are responsible for managing\nnatural resources so they can include this information in future policy\ndecisions.  Knowing which of the\necosystem values of wetlands may be at risk in the future will enable proactive\nmanagement.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the field work for this research was carried out by\npublic school teachers who collected water samples associated with different\nparts of the marsh.  They found that water\ndraining small creeks deep within the marsh had the lowest levels of nitrate, helping\nus understand how these wetlands were working. \nThese teachers have  prepared\nlesson plans derived from their research experience thus helping students\nappreciate what human benefits are provided by marshes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stuart E Findlay"
