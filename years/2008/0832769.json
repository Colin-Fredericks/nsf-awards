 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research to be conducted here centers around models for the structure and evolution\r\nof giant planets which can be used to relate observations of giant exoplanets to\r\nfundamental properties such as mass and radius. First, a modeling effort will be\r\nundertaken to compute the thermal evolution of young giant planets over a range of\r\nmasses in a self-consistent way, i.e., coupled with core accretion models, rather than with\r\nthe arbitrary initial conditions currently used. From these models, both spectra and colors\r\nwill be calculated to allow for more accurate determinations of the masses of young\r\nobjects found orbiting other stars. A second project will explore recent revisions in the\r\nequation of state for hydrogen to evaluate the corresponding changes in model radius. It\r\nis suggested that this change leads to larger radii at a given age and that the wide spread\r\nin radii seen among transiting extrasolar giant planets may be understood in terms of a\r\nlarge range in interior heavy element abundances versus the need for internal energy\r\nsources.\r\nThis work will improve the return of future space missions to locate extrasolar planets as\r\nwell as efforts from the ground by enabling more accurate determinations of basic\r\nproperties from observations. The models here will also serve as a stepping stone to the\r\neventual detection of Earth-like planets. The results of this work will be posted on the\r\nSETI Institute website and disseminated to the public through articles in popular journals.",
