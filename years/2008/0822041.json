 "awd_abstract_narration": "While a number of studies have shown that the early social environment can have a significant effect on the subsequent expression of social behavior, these studies have either failed to examine the effects of early social experience on control mechanisms, (changes in the brain), or have been conducted in relatively asocial species.  The aim of this project is to use the highly social bi-parental prairie vole (Microtus ochragaster) to study the effect of early social environment on the organization of the brain, specifically effects on neuropeptides, steroids and their receptors, in regulating the ultimate expression of social behavior.  This study takes advantage of significant population differences in the expression of social behavior, with prairie voles from Kansas (KN) expressing significantly lower levels of prosocial behavior and higher levels of aggression than voles from Illinois (IL). These differences are also associated with differential expression of the central mechanisms.  The research will examine the effect of parent of origin and the presence of the father on the expression of social behavior and mechanisms that regulate the expression of behavior.  The heritability of the mechanisms controlling social behavior will also be determined.  The expression of social behavior will be directly related to the degree of social interaction during the neonatal period. These changes will be associated with specific changes with the central nervous system, such as an increase in the presence of estrogen receptors in less social males.  This study will provide critical understanding of how early experiences act to mold the ultimate expression of behavior.  Broader Impacts include significant educational opportunities for undergraduate participation in research, with an emphasis on minority inclusion through the McNair program and interdisciplinary studies with Sociology.",
