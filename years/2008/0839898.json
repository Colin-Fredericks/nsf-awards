The goal is to build an annotated inventory of evaluation tools for determining the effectiveness of projects targeted at improving engineering education and student retention along the engineering pipeline. An experienced team of engineering education, assessment and evaluation professionals will conduct an extensive search for existing evaluation tools and document their usefulness for the engineering education research and development community. Recognized national experts in engineering education and evaluation will review and contribute to the evaluation of tools and the resulting inventory. Products of this work include: (1) a catalog of evaluation tools characterized by outcomes addressed, instrument stage of development, and instrument usability, (2) a prioritized list of evaluation tool gaps needing to be addressed to support engineering course, curriculum, and laboratory improvement, (3) a journal publication presenting the methodology and results of the evaluation tools inventory, (4) a national workshop to refine and disseminate results and to promote needed evaluation tools development, and (5) a strategy for broad dissemination of findings and evaluation tools \r\n",
