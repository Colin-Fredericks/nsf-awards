 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snowshoe hare populations show regular dramatic 20 to 50-fold changes in numbers over a ten-year span in most of Alaska and Canada. These changes occur at approximately the same time across the continent.  In the contiguous U.S., however, fluctuations in hare numbers appear to be disconnected among geographically distant populations. This study will analyze data about snowshoe hare numbers from across the range to validate or refute the long-held belief that northern (Canada and Alaska) and southern (northern contiguous U.S.) hare populations have different population dynamics. The researchers will use statistical methods designed to identify regional clusters of synchrony for snowshoe hares. This information will be combined with genetic analysis and computer models to evaluate the relative importance of three major factors proposed to influence regional hare dynamics and synchrony: habitat fragmentation, specialist hare predators such as Canada lynx, and regional climate patterns.\r\n\r\nSnowshoe hares are important prey for the federally threatened Canada lynx and many other forest carnivores in North America. Understanding the factors that cause hare numbers concurrently to increase or decrease across large areas is necessary for managing snowshoe hares and their many predators. In addition to informing current conservation, this study will provide insight into how this ecologically important species may be impacted by future habitat loss, increases or declines in predator numbers, and climate change. \r\n",
