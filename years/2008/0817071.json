PREP provides extended support for adaptation and implementation of curricular materials and pedagogical strategies that have been shown to be effective in improving the teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics.  Themes for the PREP workshops include inquiry-based learning; distance learning; service learning; redesign of the undergraduate program in mathematics; interdisciplinary studies, especially mathematics and life sciences, mathematics and the environment, and financial and actuarial mathematics; preparation of future teachers; and how best to serve the next generation of college students, especially those who have already studied calculus in high school.  PREP workshops extend over time with preparatory, intensive, and on-going components that make extensive use of the latest technologies.",
