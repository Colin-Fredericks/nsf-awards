 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER award supports a study for the investigation and development of theoretic foundations and advanced analysis of real-time, hybrid, and embedded systems. The study is expected to contribute towards the deeper integration of theoretical foundations and advanced analysis at the nexus of these research disciplines.  It has four focus areas: fundamental methodology, theoretical verification, schedulability analysis, and stochastic analysis.\r\n\r\nThis study is also expected to contribute to a new Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) vision being developed in NSF's Computer and Network Systems division.  The goal of CPS research is new science and engineering methodologies that integrate the interacting cyber and physical elements of future engineered systems. CPS seeks new design principles and systems technology that can routinely yield high-confidence physical and engineered systems.  This study will contribute theoretical foundations for the deep integration of physical and cyber dynamics\r\n",
