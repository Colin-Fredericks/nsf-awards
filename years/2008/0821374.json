 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe PIs propose to acquire instrumentation that will form the basis for a new microbial single cell genomics facility at the institution.  Single cell genomics represents a novel approach to study uncultured microorganisms and serves as a complement to metagenomics.  The proposed instrumentation will enable research efforts investigating biogeochemistry and microbial interactions, microbial evolution and diversity, and biotechnology.  The proposed instrumentation includes:  nanoliter reagent dispenser, a thermal plate sealer, a PCR hood, an anaerobic chamber, a liquid handling workstation, a real-time PCR thermocycler, an ultracold freezer, and a bioinformatics computer cluster.  The requested instrumentation would enable high throughput wetlab and computational DNA analyses and help reduce DNA contamination and overall per-sample costs, two of the most significant limitations for single cell genomics to date. The new facility will be operated in close collaboration with an existing aquatic cytometry facility using established user fees, scheduling and protocols.  The lead PI will be responsible for the overall management of the purchase, installation, and operation of the instrumentation.  A part-time technician will be employed for the wet lab instrumentation.  The instrumentation will initially be located in different laboratories, but will be relocated to a dedicated workspace upon construction of new laboratory facilities at the institution projected for 2010. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIn addition to establishing a shared-use facility to enable access to single cell genomics techniques, the PIs propose developing an annual course in single cell DNA analysis, as well as incorporating classes on single cell genomics into existing courses.  The PIs will also encourage on-site visits by college and university faculty and students.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
