 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of armed conflict in societies at risk, scholars and practitioners commonly recommend power-sharing arrangements that include all previous parties to the conflict and any potential spoilers.  Power-sharing institutions include grand coalitions, federal institutions, and proportional allocations of government positions and benefits. Existing scholarship on power-sharing institutions, including cross-national quantitative studies as well as historical case studies, recognize that power-sharing comes in many forms, but argue that such institutions generically have beneficial effects.  Yet, existing studies of power-sharing have tended to use fairly simple institutional measures and not to differentiate between arrangements that serve to include factional representatives in government (power-sharing institutions) and those that exclude them (power-dividing institutions). Moreover, there has been little rigorous theoretical recognition of the ways in which power-sharing may affect government decision making or the relationships between politicians and their constituents. Finally, the empirical literature on power-sharing has suffered from selection bias, as studies have focused much more on societies that have actually experienced civil conflict than on societies that have faced similar challenges but avoided overt conflict. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the fact that it addresses each of these issues. It improves the theoretical understanding of both power-sharing and power-dividing institutions by identifying and distinguishing their most important features. It develops game-theoretic models to examine the short- and longer-term effects of these institutions on conflict and public goods provision.  The project will create a quantitative data set that covers all major states from 1946 to the present and reports specifically on the mandate and implementation of power-sharing and power-dividing institutions. The data set will include both societies that have undergone civil conflict and societies with no such history but having characteristics that put them at risk for civil war. Such data help avoid the selection bias of many previous studies and help determine whether post-conflict situations are in fact more difficult than other situations in which there is a credible threat of internal violence.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is that it will give scholars and policy makers a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different institutional strategies for reducing the civil conflict. Civil conflict is by far the most common type of armed conflict in the world today, and it is responsible for the great majority of military and civilian casualties. The project will assess the performance of political institutions often adopted in societies that have undergone civil conflict, and it will for the first time allow us to compare the performance of such societies with others that are at risk of war but have not yet experienced civil conflict. Finally, the project will generate an extensive data base on transitional aspects of political institutions, data that are currently unavailable and that will provide substantial benefit to other researchers in this very important field of study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nPolitical power sharing has in recent years been of great interest to scholars interested in civil peace and conflict, as well as to practitioners that attempt to build peace and democracy in societies prone to conflict.  According to many such scholars and practitiioners, institutions of political power sharing are promising vehicles for building civil peace and democracy.\n\nOur research has sought to examine such claims by identifying the incidence and consequences of 19  different political power sharing institutions across 180  countries between 1975 and  2010.  We have identified three clusters of political power sharing institutions, mapped their incidence across all the major countries of the world annually over 35 years, and analyzed the extent to which they influence the risk of civil conflict and/or  transitions from democratic to autocratic (non-democratic) governance.\n\n\n\n\nOur research shows that political  power sharing institutions take three distinct forms, which we identify  as inclusive, dispersive, and constraining power sharing, respectively.  Inclusive  power sharing refers to provisions that guarantee demographic or political  minority groups representation in executive or legislative arenas.   Dispersive power sharing institutions, such as federalism or  devolution, share power through geographical decentralization or by granting autonomy to social minorities over, for example, educational policies.   Constraining power sharing limit the power of  political incumbents and especially political executives through  constitutional protections of individual and minority rights, strong and independent judiciaries, and  civilian control of security forces.\n\nWe find that power sharing institutions of all kinds have become more common in the world's states between 1975 and 2010.  But this trend has been much stronger for constraining power sharing than for dispersive and especially inclusive power sharing.  We also find a stronger trend toward power sharing institutions after 1990 than before that time. \n\nConcerning the effects of power sharing on civil peace and democracy, our research shows that  constraining power sharing has by far the strongest and most positive effects, in the sense that it significantly reduces the risk of civil  conflict as well as the risk of transitions from democracy to  autocracy.  These beneficial effects exist regardless of how poor, ethnically fragmented, or previously conflictual these societies have been.  Inclusive power sharing also reduces the risk of civil war, but only in societies that have already undergone conflict.  Such power sharing has little or no effect on democratic survival.  Finally, dispersive power sharing has no clear effect on the risk of civil conflict and may under some conditions heighten the risk that  democracy may fail.\n\nThese results are of great relevance for domestic and international actors that try to build peace and democracy under difficult circumstances.  Our results suggest that inclusive power sharing should not be as much of a priority as it has been in many countries and situations.  While inclusive power sharing may be beneficial and even necessary in some particularly troubled societies, constraining institutions have stronger positive effects under a broader set of circumstances.  Scholars and practitioners should therefore carefully consider implementing such constraining power sharing institutions, especially in situations when the immediate risk of war has subsided.\n\nOur results have been published in five different scholarly journal articles so far.  Members of our project team have also published two articles for a broader audience in the Monkey Cage column of the Washington Post.  Finally, we are currently completing a book manuscript on the experience with political power sharing in seven African countries.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kaare Strom"
