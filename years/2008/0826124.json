 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this GOALI award is to develop advanced optimization methods for product design. These methods are based on the mathematics of biogeography, which is the study of the distribution, migration, speciation, and extinction of biological species. Biogeography is nature?s way of distributing species. This research will explore the feasibility of using the concepts of biogeography to aid in general problem solving. The research includes the investigation of biogeography theory, the development of biogeography-based problem-solving methods, the application of the methods to general product design, specifically automotive design, and benchmark testing of these methods. Deliverables include Internet-based biogeography optimization software for general-purpose product design optimization.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a framework for optimization based on biogeography theory that has the potential to greatly improve our ability to design products which possess a high number of variable parameters. These methods will be used early in the design process, before the detailed product design has been developed, to support the designer in exploring a wide range of design options. The software developed as a result of this research will be available for solving a variety of optimization problems. Close collaboration with the industrial partner, General Motors, will provide the opportunity for the research team to test these methods on industrial problems. Graduate students will gain industry experience through summer internships at GM. The minority population of Cleveland State University provides a rich environment from which to recruit minority students for involvement in this research. Dissemination will occur through journal publications, industrial seminars and presentations at technical conferences.\r\n",
