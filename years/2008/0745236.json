 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cupin superfamily is a group of functionally diverse proteins found in all three kingdoms of life. These proteins have a characteristic signature domain comprising two histidine-containing motifs separated by an intermotif region of variable length. This domain consists of six beta strands within a conserved B-barrel structure. While most cupins contain a single cupin domain, a significant number of proteins belonging to this family are bicupins, containing two pairs of motifs. Although some cupins have known functions and have been characterized at the biochemical level, the majority of these proteins are known only from gene cloning or sequencing projects. Several members of the cupin superfamily have been shown to use oxygen as a substrate or cofactor, including flavonol 2,3-dioxygenase. This enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the heterocyclic ring of flavonols to yield carbon monoxide and the corresponding depside, play a role in the degradation of flavonols by fungi and other microorganisms. This unusual transformation involves the cleavage of two C-C bonds with the release of CO. To date, two flavonol 2,3-dioxygenases have been characterized, although an increasing number of hypothetical proteins from a large number of organisms whose genome have been sequenced share high sequence homology to these enzymes. Structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic studies are proposed for the Bacillus subtilis flavonol 2,3-dioxygenase. This enzyme has been chosen as a model system for the study of the metal-binding selectivity in members of the cupin superfamily to elucidate how variations in metal cofactors influence the reactivity of the catalytic center for O2 binding and activation.\r\nIntellectual Merit:The long-term goal of this research is the understanding of the interrelation between protein structure, function and evolution in metalloenzymes, utilizing members of the cupin superfamily as model systems. Most enzymes belonging to this superfamily require a metal ion for activity, and the conserved residues at the cupin motif (3His and 1Glu) provide an optimal metal binding environment in the characteristic double barrel  B-helix structural motif. The contribution of conformational plasticity of the cupin scaffold to the choice of substrate and metal ion is currently unclear and the enzyme flavonol 2,3 dioxygenase represents an excellent model system for the study of the relationship between metal ion and enzyme activity. In addition, this enzyme, as a bicupin, also serves as a model for the study of the role of gene duplication in members of this superfamily.\r\nBroader Impacts: This research provides an excellent opportunity for the education of graduate and advanced undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary and multicultural research environment under the guidance of the PI, a member of an underrepresented group actively involved in the mentoring of minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PI will encourage the participation of undergraduate students for the duration of this project. Emphasis will be given to the recruitment of underrepresented minority students with the involvement of NSF supported LSAMP and AGEP programs base at the PI's institution. In addition, graduate students will be provided the opportunity for training in spectroscopic techniques not currently available at the PIs institution through collaboration with an international group.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of the work:\n\nFlavonols are plant compounds abundant in onions, leeks, broccoli and blueberries.  Examples of flavonols include quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin.  These compounds have been shown to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  A small group of bacterial and fungal enzymes have been shown to participate in the decomposition of flavonols.  The main catabolic enzyme, which has been named quercetinase, belongs to a family of proteins with a particular fold commonly known as the cupin superfamily, one of the largest protein superfamilies known.  Most enzymes belonging to this family require a metal ion for activity, usually iron or managanese.  However, examples of other metal ions (e.g. copper and nickel) have been shown.   The determinants for metal specificity for members of the cupin superfamily are currently unknown.  In this study, we investigated a number of quercetinases derived from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis (a manganese-containing enzyme) and various species of the fungus Aspergillus (a copper-containing enzyme) to investigate how these enzymes are able to catalyze the difficult reaction of breaking two carbon-carbon bonds with the concomitant release of carbon monoxide and how metal cofactor specificity is determined.  An important contribution to this work was the demonstration of the ability of the small molecule nitrosyl hydride to replace dioxygen as a substrate for these enzymes, opening the door for this molecule in the study of other dioxygen utilizing enzymes.\n\nThe broader impacts of the work:\n\nThis work contributed to some extent to the understanding of how metal ion specificity is determined in metal-containing enzymes and provided evidence for the role of the metal ion in catalysis in these two members of the cupin superfamily.  This work also contributed to the development of the use of the small molecule nitrosyl hydride as a substitute for molecular oxygen as a substrate for oxygen-dependent enzymes.  This project provided an excellent interdisciplinary training opportunity to a number of graduate and undergraduate students.  The PI participated in programs that provided training opportunities to members of underrepresented groups at his institution.  The PI also participated in outreach activities to students from this group at various institutions and national meetings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wilson A Francisco"
