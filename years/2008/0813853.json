 "awd_abstract_narration": "?FIRST AMERICAN ACADEMY OF MECHANICS CONFERENCE?\r\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\r\nJune 17-20, 2008\r\n\r\nThe Inaugural Conference of the American Academy of Mechanics will be hosted in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 17-20, 2008. Following this conference this event will be hosted in the USA every four years to coincide with the International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. The proposed conference will provide a broad forum in mechanics to characterize and assess the behavior of solids and fluids. It will cover a wide spectrum of topics in mechanics in the areas of solids, fluids, dynamics, biomechanics, control theory, thermal sciences, etc. The participants in this conference will address characterization and modeling of systems at the nano, micro and macro scale. They will also bridge those scales in an effort to better interpret the behavior of solids and fluids. \r\n\r\nThis conference will attract researchers from academia, industry, federal and state agencies and students. It will help the participants prepare to pursue multidisciplinary research and develop more systematical strategies in dealing with the mechanics problems for years to come. The conference will help the participants and the Mechanics community to identify the current trends in research and the funding opportunities in those areas. Federal funding agencies and industry will also help promote their research directions for present and future. A book of abstracts will be circulated in the meeting along with limited proceedings for some mini-symposia. The wide spectrum of the mechanics areas outlined above will help in contributing immensely in the improvement of the mechanics discipline in the engineering, scientific and educational aspects. \r\n",
