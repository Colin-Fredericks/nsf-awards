The first problem is in representation theory:\r\nit is a conjecture in local harmonic analysis that is\r\nmotivated by taking Arthur's conjectures together with results\r\nof Burger, Li and Sarnak. This problem is of interest as a\r\nquestion in representation theory; it also offers a testing\r\nground for Arthur's conjectures and affords the possibility\r\nof a better understanding of the automorphic spectrum. The\r\nsecond problem is to study analytic number theory in the context\r\nof automorphic forms on groups of higher rank.  The dream goal of\r\nthis is a better understanding of higher moments of L-functions,\r\nbut there are a number of easier and concrete problems, such as\r\nthe development of large-sieve inequalities, whose solution would\r\nalso have immediate consequences for analytic number theory.\r\n\r\n\tThe project concerns two questions in the field of\r\n``automorphic forms.'' This is a relatively new field of mathematics,\r\nguided by the Langlands program -- it seeks to establish\r\nconnections between certain (apparently) far-separated\r\nareas of mathematics. These connections have allowed work in\r\nautomorphic forms to have a significant impact in other fields.\r\nMany cryptographic algorithms -- necessary for secure communication\r\nover the Internet --  are based on\r\nvery subtle properties of prime numbers, and underlying\r\nmany of these algorithms are difficult results from analytic number\r\ntheory and automorphic forms. Another application\r\nof automorphic forms has been the construction of ``Ramanujan graphs''\r\n-- these are graphs with remarkable connectivity, and have had\r\napplication to communication networks and to theoretical computer\r\nscience. The questions under consideration will deepen\r\nour understanding of automorphic forms. In addition\r\nto the type of application just discussed,\r\nthese questions lie at the intersection of different fields of\r\nmathematics, and will encourage collaboration between experts\r\nin these different fields.\r\n",
