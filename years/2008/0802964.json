A collaboration of the University at Buffalo\r\n(UB), Buffalo State College (BSC), and the Hauptman-Woodward\r\nMedical Research Institute, the project brings together an\r\ninterdisciplinary group of 16 faculty researchers who have a\r\nshared sense of the importance of computation in the mathematical\r\nsciences, a record of successful supervision of undergraduate\r\nresearch, and a commitment to increasing the effectiveness of the\r\npreparation of students at UB and BSC for post-graduate education\r\nand careers in the many fields that now demand a combination of\r\ncomputational and mathematical skills.  Prior to commencing the\r\nfull-year research experience, students take calculus,\r\ndifferential equations, linear algebra, and a new sophomore\r\ncourse in scientific and mathematical computing which was\r\ndeveloped with this project in mind and is offered to all math\r\nmajors.  Special efforts are made to recruit minorities and\r\nwomen, who are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. \r\nThe year of research begins in the Spring semester of the\r\nstudents' junior year with: a support course that provides\r\nbackground on the theme that unifies all the research projects\r\nfor that year (e.g.  stochastic processes in 2009); a team-taught\r\ncourse on the tools and methods of computational research;\r\nregular meetings with the research project mentor; and the first\r\npart of a seminar that runs throughout the year.  Research\r\ncontinues through the summer, and students write an honors thesis\r\nor a paper for publication in the Fall.  Computational resources\r\navailable to the students include a 2000-node cluster and a\r\nvisualization laboratory at UB's Center for Computational\r\nResearch.  Talks by eminent outside researchers are a feature of\r\nthe seminar, and students attend a national conference in an area\r\nrelated to their research, disseminate their results at regional\r\nmeetings and local exhibitions of undergraduate scholarship, and\r\nparticipate in outreach activities at local high schools.  After\r\nthe year is over, in their final undergraduate semester, the now\r\nhighly trained students serve as teaching assistants in the\r\nintroductory differential equations course that is taken by all\r\nmathematics, engineering, and science students. \r\n\r\n     Over the multi-year course of the project, the research\r\nfocuses on a wide variety of topics of societal importance. \r\nThese include optical fiber communications, agricultural pest\r\ncontrol, cryptography, medical imaging, and the behavior of\r\nmaterials (from semiconductor devices to mudflows).  The project\r\nnot only trains a select annual cohort in these vital areas, but\r\nalso reaches a substantial fraction of all math majors at UB and\r\nBSC with a curriculum that is computationally enriched by the\r\npreparation and support courses for the project, and a\r\ndepartmental life that is enhanced by the seminars and the\r\nexposure to peers engaged in research.  The project is supported\r\nby the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of\r\nMultidisciplinary Activities, and the EHR Division of\r\nUndergraduate Education.",
