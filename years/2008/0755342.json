Recently approved standards for polyethylene materials in potable water public infrastructure indicate that polyethylene pipes are increasingly being installed for water distribution and plumbing worldwide, although the agents and mechanisms responsible for their physical failure caused by long-term chlorinated water exposure are unknown.  Further, contaminant interaction of aged polyethylene has received little scrutiny.  Under this award, an interdisciplinary research team will integrate chemistry and engineering to examine the mechanisms that control new and aged high-density polyethylene (HDPE) resin and HDPE water pipe degradation as well as aged polyethylene contaminant interaction.  An outreach component will integrate teaching of radical chemistry and polyethylene infrastructure engineering to middle school students through a summer camp at the Science Museum of Southwest Virginia and to high school students in the Montgomery County, VA Public School System.",
