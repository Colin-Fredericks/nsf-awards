 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appropriate information distribution and sound decision making during weather emergencies are critical to saving lives, reducing injuries and protecting property.  Several governmental and non-governmental organizations have placed a high priority on research to improve warning systems for extreme weather events.  This project addresses these needs by developing an integrated understanding of warning systems and processes, with a focus on hurricanes in Miami, Florida and flash floods in Boulder, Colorado.  The project will (1) address the role of uncertainty throughout the warning process, including information distribution and decision making; (2) develop an understanding of how scientific information is analyzed and transmitted through warning networks to diverse users; (3) identify the factors influencing organizational (e.g., media) and governmental decision making during extreme weather events; and (4) characterize public preferences for different attributes of forecast and warning information.  The project uses a multidisciplinary approach to understanding weather warning systems, system components, and their interactions.  Integrating information and research methods from meteorology, sociology, economics, decision science, and public policy analysis, the project will generate new understanding about decision making, risk, and uncertainty regarding extreme weather events.  More specifically, the project will analyze how extreme weather warnings are communicated, obtained, interpreted, and used in decision making, as well as stakeholder perceptions of warning characteristics needed for sound decision making.  The project will help improve extreme event weather warnings and potentially reduce related injuries, deaths, and property loss. \r\n",
