The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in these fields for technical exchange on topics at the intersection of these discipline, as well as emerging research areas that transcend these traditional disciplinary boundaries. This proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference on women by encouraging and enabling their participation, especially in cases where travel support would otherwise preclude attendance.  Priority for these funds will be given to defray the travel expenses of female students (graduate and undergraduate) and female junior faculty.",
