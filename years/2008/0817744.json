Irish\r\nProposal # IOS-0817744\r\nDissecting gene regulatory networks controlling petal organogenesis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formation of an organ depends on the coordination of a variety of cellular processes, including cell division, tissue organization, and patterning of the organ as a whole.   Plant organogenesis is not well understood, despite the importance of plants as sources of food, and increasingly, fuel.  This project focuses on analyzing the regulation of petal organogenesis in Arabidopsis as a model for understanding how other, more complex tissues and organs are generated.  Several complementary approaches will be taken to identify new genes involved in petal organogenesis.   These will include microarray-based approaches to identify genes required for the initial stages of petal organogenesis; genetic strategies to identify quantitative trait loci controlling petal shape and size; and molecular approaches to identify microRNA-dependent processes controlling petal organogenesis.  Genetic and molecular interactions between newly discovered and previously identified genes will define pathways essential for petal organogenesis.  These results will be used to develop a genome-level regulatory network that functions in controlling different steps in petal organogenesis.  In turn, characterizing the petal organogenesis network will be valuable in developing a systems level understanding of plant organogenesis, and the emergent properties of such a system. This interdisciplinary approach will provide a unique perspective as to how the spatial and temporal aspects of cell division, cell type differentiation, and the coordination of growth and development result in the formation of a particular organ type. Furthermore, this comprehensive characterization will also be important for generating new tools to understand and manipulate organogenesis in other, economically important plant species.  A component of this project is to provide a variety of training opportunities for a postdoctoral associate, a graduate student, and undergraduates that will foster critical analytical skills in the next generation of researchers.",
