 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials for Infrastructure: Building Bridges in the Global Community Symposium is designed to effectively and proactively address the complex technological, professional, educational, societal, environmental, and economical issues that challenge sustainability of today's infrastructure and new construction in developing countries.  TMS is partnering with the Indian Institute of Metals and the Chinese Society for Metals to ensure a global perspective.   \r\n\r\nMaterials of construction play a pivotal role in the design and realization of many components of a country's infrastructure. A growing world population and increasing economic development demand solutions for cost-effective, safe, structurally-efficient, and environmentally-sensitive buildings, bridges, and public utility systems. Also, concern is arising in developed countries for monitoring and preventing infrastructure decay. Materials for Infrastructure: Building Bridges in the Global Community Symposium will address progress in materials design, production, and application in these infrastructure systems from a global perspective, including but not limited to India, China, and the United States.  This symposium will heighten awareness amongst students and professionals as to global needs and provide a forum for the discussion of efforts to meet society's infrastructure needs.  \r\n",
