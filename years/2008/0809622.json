 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor H. Floyd Davis of Cornell University, together with his graduate, and undergraduate students, will investigate the dynamics of how transition metal atoms insert into chemical bonds.  The investigations will be carried in a crossed molecular beam.  Prof. Davis will study how changing reactant translational or vibrational energy influences chemical reactivity. In addition to his research work, Prof. Davis proposes to continue his development of inexpensive spectrophotometers (ca. $50) for use in high schools, along with curricular materials to go with them.\r\n\r\nTransition metal-containing species catalyze a large number of industrial processes.  The ultimate goal of research like that of Prof. Davis is to develop a better understanding of how metal atoms react in these processes.  A better understanding of these reactions should lead to better processes.  In addition to the broader impact of the proposed research work, Prof. Davis' work in developing rugged, inexpensive laboratory equipment will help to bring science experiments to schools, here and abroad, which operate with limited resources.  The graduate and undergraduate research students supported on this award will also enter the technical workforce with superb training in chemistry, physics and modern laboratory science.\r\n",
