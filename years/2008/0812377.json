 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wide use of the internet coupled with the steadily decreasing cost in computing and storage has led to an expansion of the data that users expect to retrieve from simple numeric and alphanumeric, to include images,audio, video, where the retrieval criterion is one of similarity. An inherent difficulty with similarity retrieval is deciding on a criterion for the similarity. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis proposal explores issues involved in retrieval that is based on several criteria of similarity:\r\n\r\n(1) In the spatial data context, similarity is usually defined in terms of proximity in spatial position. Instead, this research will examine similarity in relative spatial orientation. Thus there will be a focus on groups of objects, In particular, attention will be paid to position-independent indexes that find use in applications involving pictorially-specified queries to symbolic image databases.\r\n(2) Issues involved in finding the k nearest types of objects rather than the k nearest objects will be explored. At present, it is the type of the objects that is of interest rather than their identity. This differentiation is similar to the classic distinction made in spatial databases between location-based and feature-based queries.\r\n(3) Also of interest will be finding similarity between sets of objects where the similarity measure is the maximum of the minimum distance between objects in the two sets (the Hausdorff distance). Of particular interest will be methods that are incremental so that data is obtained as quickly as possible without waiting for the algorithms to complete.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts\r\n\r\nPosition-independent indexing has application to pictorially-specified image databases as well as to databases of moving objects which can be used for searches that include traffic data. The Hausdorff distance is applicable to multimedia databases as is the focus on retrieval by type rather than individual objects. Via a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, the research team will investigate what makes a good similarity measure for bioinformatics applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to investigate issues in similarity\nretrieval over a wide spectrum of data types in applications\nincluding, but not limited to, document clustering, point set\nmatching, and bioinformatics.  The emphasis was on finding\nnearest neighbors using different similarity criteria.  The key\noutcomes of the project can be divided into several parts which are\ndifferentiated by the corresponding problem domains.\n\nOur primary focus was on similarity searching in the document\ndomain where our domain was streaming news articles and our goal was\nto automatically group news articles into sets of documents, termed\n``clusters'', such  that each cluster should only contain the\ndocuments encountered in the input stream seen so far pertaining to a\nspecific topic.  This problem is a variant of similarity searching in\na very high-dimensional vector space, where dimensions correspond to\nthe unique words in English language.  Our work was motivated by our\ndesire to display the clusters on a map associated with their\nprincipal geographic location.  This requirement differentiated our\napproach from conventional ones in that it had to be an ``online''\napproach which means that the clusters are formed and updated as the\ndate is encountered rather than having to wait until all the data has\nbeen input.  The reason we needed the online approach is that the news\narticles are constantly streaming in and thus must be placed in the\nappropriate cluster so that the results can be seen immediately.\n\nWe also investigated the problem of similarity search over a\ncollection of point sets. The ability to identify similar point sets\nwith respect to a reference point set Q is useful in a number of\napplications.  For example, given a geographical distribution of a\ncurrent disease outbreak represented as a location set Q, an\nepidemiologist may wish to find k occurrences of outbreaks (from a set\nD of historical outbreak distributions) that are most similar to\nQ. These results can then be used to help identify correlations\nbetween the outbreak in question and other outbreaks.\n\nAs another example, letting Q denote a location set of warehouses of a \nlogistics company and D denote a collection of location sets of gas\nstations where each location set contains locations of gas stations\nwithin a single oil company, to form a partnership with an oil\ncompany, the logistics company may wish to find the oil company whose \nlocation set S minimizes the maximum distance from each warehouse in Q\nto the nearest station in S.\n\nFor both of these problems we used the Hausdorff distance , which is a\nmeasure commonly used to determine the maximum discrepancy between two point sets.

In our research, we\ninvestigated the problem of identifying similar biomolecular structures\nbased on certain geometric properties.
