 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholarship assistance is being provided to two cohorts of full-time undergraduates (1) majoring in Computer Science (CSC) or (2) majoring in Information Technology (IT) or Mathematics (MTH) with a minor in CSC... The project focuses on increasing enrollment in CSC and maximizing student retention, graduation rates, and placement in careers and/or graduate schools. Scholarship recipients are benefiting from a network of support services provided by the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Department, faculty advisors, and the Student Financial Services and Career Services Offices. \r\n\r\nStudents are strongly encouraged to augment their primary major by either taking a minor in a related field or by having a second major. The scholars are encouraged to engage in research projects (either as independent study or as joint faculty-student projects) and to participate in internship and co-op placements. Faculty interaction with professional and public organizations and with industry serves to provide additional opportunities for student research, internships, and co-op placements. \r\n\r\n",
