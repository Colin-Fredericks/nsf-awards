 "awd_abstract_narration": "The successive innovations in semiconductor manufacturing over the\r\nlast 35 years of Moore's law have turned what used to be a room-sized\r\ncomputer system into a single chip composed of billions of\r\ntransistors. These levels of integration have forced a change toward\r\nparallelism in computer system design, including both single-chip\r\nmultiprocessors and systems-on-a-chip. Today, these chips have a few\r\ntens of individual processors but future scaling will make hundreds or\r\nthousands available on a chip. Critical to the success of such systems\r\nis the hardware network that enables the processors on the chip to\r\ncommunicate with one another. Today's chips typically employ simple\r\nnetworks-on-chip (NOCs) such as bus, ring, or small grid. Future\r\nsystems with numerous processors will need scalable and innovative\r\nNOCs to provide high communication bandwidth, low latency, and low\r\npower consumption.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to develop scalable NOCs that are well suited to\r\nswitch and wire capabilities in emerging chip fabrication\r\ntechnologies. In particular, the project would investigate new NOC\r\ntopologies that exploit the enormous number of on-chip wires while \r\nreducing the number of hops to travel from a source to a destination. A\r\nsecond challenge is avoiding congestion in the network, much like\r\navoiding automobile traffic congestion at rush hour. The investigation\r\nwill develop new methods of monitoring the status of the routers and\r\nlinks in the network so that network messages can route themselves\r\naround network hotspots, improving network latency and bandwidth for\r\nall traffic. An important outcome of this research would be a public\r\nrepository of network traces for different types of on-chip network traffic that will help improve the experimental methods of all NOC researchers.",
