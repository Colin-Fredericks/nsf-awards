 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to use general numerical simulation and quantum-mechanical\r\nmodeling to guide the development of new paradigms for making materials with an ever-larger nonlinearoptical\r\nresponse that can apply to a broad range of technologies. The approach is to study how to\r\noptimize the response of individual molecules, determine how to combine molecules into particles to\r\nachieve optimized synergism, study arrangements of particles that yield a bulk material with enhanced\r\nproperties, and generate ideas for optimizing material structures to make them most suitable for specific\r\napplications.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research focuses on building a fundamental understanding of how to control\r\nlight?s interaction with matter with the goal of defining guidelines for making improved materials for a\r\nbroad range of applications. In addition to contributing to the fundamental Physics of nonlinear optics,\r\nthe results will guide chemists in processing and synthesizing new materials; will provide novel\r\nparadigms for physicists/materials scientists for making complex structures; and will give engineers a\r\nbroad pallet of systems that impact many applications.\r\nBroader Impact: This work will train undergraduate and graduate students to be the next generation\r\nof interdisciplinary researchers at the cutting edge of science and technology that could, by the breadth of\r\npotential applications, have a large positive impact on the economy. The theoretical techniques are\r\ngeneral, and are appropriate to any applications that are based on light-matter interaction. Potential spinoff\r\napplications include medical imaging/diagnostics, novel cancer therapies, three-dimensional\r\nphotolithography, high-density memories, ultra-fast internet switches, and new computer architectures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe interaction of light with materials is a fundamental process that is the basis of a broad range of applications.  For example, the interaction of electricity with semiconductors is the basis of the transistor, a device that is found in most of today's high-tech gizmos.  Replacing wires with optical fibers and semiconductors with nonlinear-optical materials could enable the next generation of applications in which light replaces electricity, leading to smarter computers, perhaps even machines that think.  Other applications would include new imaging technologies that are applied to medical imaging as well as optically-based cancer therapies.  All of these applications require materials with large \"optical nonlinearities\" that have yet to be made.\n\n \n\nThis project used general numerical simulation techniques to guide the development of new paradigms for making materials with an ever-larger nonlinear-optical response that is broadly useful to many applications.  We studied how to design the properties of a single molecule to enhance its effectiveness in interacting with light, and developed general principles that have been used by chemists to make better materials.  In addition to guiding the synthesis of new materials, our work has shown how molecules can be placed near each other to enhance their collective response relative to their individual strengths.  Also, our work is providing design criteria to make new materials based on nanowires, in which tightly confined electrons can be manipulated by adding kinks to the wire.\n\n \n\nThe conceptual tools that we have developed will provide novel paradigms for making new and  complex artificial materials that are targeted for specific applications.  Perhaps more importantly, the work is broadening the scientific foundations that will undoubtedly lead to applications that go beyond what can be imagined today.  Potential spin-off applications include medical imaging/diagnostics, novel cancer therapies, three-dimensional photolithography, high-density memories, ultra-fast internet switches, and new computer architectures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark G Kuzyk"
