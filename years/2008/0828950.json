From the engine designer's standpoint, the concern about soot goes beyond these regulatory issues. High soot concentrations in combustor primary zones contribute to high thermal radiation loads on combustor liners. Soot coatings on liner surfaces drastically increase underlying metal temperatures. These issues are exacerbated by the high pressures at which new combustors are operated, because soot production is very sensitive to pressure. If soot and the problems associated with it are to be controlled, quantitative understanding of the soot growth and oxidation mechanisms is essential.\r\nIn this collaborative research award, groups at Yale and George Washington University are studying molecular-growth chemistry in forced, time-varying flames. Major species concentrations, small radical concentrations, velocity, and temperature are determined using a suite of laser-based techniques. Both major and trace hydrocarbon species are sampled using a novel pulsed microprobe coupled to a mass spectrometer. They are also performing new optical diagnostics to quantify the concentration of acetylene in regions inaccessible to probe sampling and to follow PAH molecular growth and aggregation. The experimental work will be complemented by time-dependent computations of flame structure that include molecular growth chemistry. The proposed work will provide critical insight into the subtle interplay between molecular growth chemistry and the time-temperature history experienced by a packet of fluid. The goal of the work is not only to obtain experimental data for a rigorous test of competing soot growth models, but also to guide the development of our intuitive understanding of the process. \r\nWithin the team, each PI leads specific project areas: Marshall Long coordinates the optical diagnostics activities, J. Houston Miller supervises the extractive sampling and line-of-sight optical diagnostic activities, and Mitchell Smooke leads the computational efforts. Data \"mining\" and interpretation proceed collaboratively.\r\nAn essential component of the proposed work is education of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and mechanical engineering. Results of this work will feed into educational outreach activities in their communities, including (1) the six-week Frontiers of Science program, designed to expose high school juniors and seniors to leading-edge scientific research, (2) the Yale-New Haven Futures in Science Research Fellowship, which supports a summer research collaboration between a New Haven high school student and a Yale graduate student or post-doc supervised by a Yale faculty member, and (3) the Piedmont Environment and Education Foundation, a newly-chartered nonprofit incorporated in the State of Maryland, established to promote environmental science educational programs for middle and secondary schools in the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nContext\n\n The formation of \"soot\" in flames is important in energy production from both fossil and bio-derived fuels, to the development of continuous processes for the manufacture of carbon-based materials, and in the production of combustion emissions that impact the global climate, leads to smog formation and, indirectly, to acid rain.  Further, emitted particulate from combustion systems have been implicated in the direct health effects (from both the particles and adsorbed  polyaromatic hydrocarbons-PAH) that lead to premature deaths in urban areas.  This project encompassed a combined experimental and computational modeling effort aimed at elucidating the nuances of molecular growth chemistry in well-defined model flame systems burning under both steady and unsteady conditions.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit of the Results\n\nIn our laboratory at George Washington University, our emphasis in this grant was two-fold.  First, the quantitative determination of concentrations for flame species from the dominant flame species down to trace hydrocarbon molecules that are thought to be the chemical seeds of particulate.  These measurements used a variety of optical and non-optical tools, most of which were developed in our laboratory for these measurements. These instruments include many variations of laser light absorption using both near and mid infrared sources and a homemade, direct-sampling mass spectrometer (Figure 1).   We applied these techniques  to both steady, laboratory flames (Figure 2) and those that were acoustically forced.  The latter flames have unique flow-chemistry interactions that form structures usually associated with turbulent combustion (eddies, vortices, flame pinch-off and detachment), but do so reproducibly in time. \n\nOur second focus was in the development of models and measurements aimed at elucidating the mechanism for the transition from planar, PAH molecules into three dimensional structures (Figure 3) .  Calculations were performed to model the interaction potential between these molecules.  (Subsequent to our publication, our potentials have been used by researchers around the globe in their own modeling efforts.)  We then used the laser-based diagnostic of Raman scattering to determine the characteristic size of the PAH incorporated into young particles extracted from the flame and found consistency in this answer with what was expected from our calculations. Finally, we used another technique using a \"white light\" laser to measure this size directly in the flame using their absorption spectra.  Again, a consistent answer for the minimum size of PAH for aggregation was found: roughly 500-600 atomic mass units, or 10-12 aromatic rings.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n In addition to the societal relevance outlined in the opening statement above, a significant outcome of this project was the education of next-generation scientists including several students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields.  George Washington University is ranked among the top few universities in the country in the population of women in science and engineering graduate programs. During the funding period for this grant, the Miller research group\u00c6s graduate student population was approximately 80% female.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
