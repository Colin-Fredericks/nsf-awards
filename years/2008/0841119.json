 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe objective of this effort is to investigate a hybrid bacteria-microsystem in which two-way communication between the cells and a chemical interface chip enables two-dimensional patterns of gene expression. The investigators will demonstrate a) direct activation and inactivation of gene expression on the chip and b) a genetic Turing reaction-diffusion system driven by the microchip.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nIn this work, initially identical cells will be grown on a solid, two dimensional layer of nutrient, supported by, and in contact with, a microfluidic system designed to control pH or other environmental parameters.  The microsystem will perturb the environment of selected cells or subpopulations under precise programmable control to enable local changes in gene expression.  Growth and production of desired compounds in individuals or small sub-populations will be monitored independently from an optical device positioned above the active substrate.  The technique will enable the fabrication of a new class of organic constructs built from co-operating cell populations in a manner analogous to differentiation schemes in developmental biology.  Chemical microsystems are a fundamental component of this vision, as they will allow for the control and patterning of such multi-cellular synthetic systems.  Micro-interfaces of this kind will open the door to a revolution in the biofabrication of microsystem-addressable multi-cellular systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThis project has very high interdisciplinary scope. For synthetic biologists and microsystems engineers, these chemical interfaces would be providing revolutionary new tools in their ability to control the development of their synthetic systems.  In addition to its research outcome, it promises to be a good vehicle for teaching students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  The research results will be disseminated through classroom instruction and workshops.",
