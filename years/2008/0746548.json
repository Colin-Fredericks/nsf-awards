 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has confirmed what scholars and laypeople have long suspected - that fathers play a critical role in young children's development. But, even though our society has placed increased emphasis on fathers' active involvement with their young children, fathers continue to spend less time than mothers caring for children. Furthermore, there are vast differences among fathers in their levels of involvement. Some fathers are highly involved with their children whereas others are not, and researchers have been unable to agree on the reasons for these differences. Without understanding why these differences between fathers exist, it is difficult to design effective education and intervention programs to promote greater father involvement. Some have proposed that mothers, because of their typical roles as primary caregivers, play an important role in encouraging or discouraging fathers' involvement with their young children, a process called maternal gatekeeping. However, little research exists to back up that claim. Thus, this study will examine the roles of mothers and fathers in the development of fathering behavior over the transition to parenthood. With the support of this NSF CAREER award, Dr. Schoppe-Sullivan will study 170 dual-earner couples who are expecting their first child. Couples will be surveyed, interviewed, and observed interacting together prior to their child's birth. At 3, 6, and 9 months postpartum, these new parents will again be surveyed, interviewed, and observed interacting together with their infants. The primary goals of this study are to (a) determine whether mothers' encouraging or discouraging behavior toward fathers is a likely influence on fathers' involvement with their infant children, (b) investigate factors that may explain why some mothers encourage fathers whereas others actively discourage them, and (c) increase understanding of the processes through which mothers' behavior towards fathers may affect fathering behavior.\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributing to knowledge about the factors that affect fathering behavior, this project will also further the education of community members as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Dr. Schoppe-Sullivan and her team will conduct several educational activities made possible through a partnership between The Ohio State University and the Center of Science and Industry (COSI), a renowned science museum in Columbus, Ohio. First, Dr. Schoppe-Sullivan and her team will work to establish a long-term relationship between study families and COSI by providing complimentary COSI memberships to participating families and collecting data from families at COSI. Second, Dr. Schoppe-Sullivan and her team will create a new component about mothers' and fathers' parental roles for a parenting program for new fathers that COSI will host (Boot Camp for New Dads). Third, Dr. Schoppe-Sullivan will work with undergraduate and graduate students within the context of a new Research Methods course to make study and related research findings accessible to families through the creation of informational posters displayed at COSI and presentations for families during COSI's Family Friday Nights program.\r\n",
