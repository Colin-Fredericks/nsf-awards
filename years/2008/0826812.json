 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the United States, husband-to-wife violence is widely prevalent and causes great physical and psychological harm.  One in five women has been hurt by intimate partners in their lifetimes.  Among them, 42 percent receive injuries and 12 percent require medical care.  Despite the devastating impact that husband-to-wife abuse has on the wives and society, little is known about the day-to-day dynamics of this abuse.  The scientific understanding of patterns of husband-to-wife abuse centers around three long-established theories: The Cycle Theory of Violence, Family Systems Theory, and the Power and Control Wheel.  These three theories of violent behavior each predict different dynamic patterns with distinct implications for predictability and intervention.  The Cycle Theory of Violence asserts that violence occurs in three phases (tension-building, explosion, and then respite) which would yield cyclic or periodic patterns. Although the frequency of the periodicity may vary due to variable phase length, within each couple the periodicity would remain fairly constant.  Under the Systems Theory, the violence is dependent upon the feedback loops between victim and batterer.  The feedback, variable in strength and direction, may lead to chaotic patterns in violence.  Finally, in the Power And Control Wheel, the constant force of abuse produces constant stress in the relationship, occasionally erupting in violence.  Use of multiple associated strategies for control resembles the interdependent components with varying response predilection seen in critical systems under constant stress, leading to occasional random violent catastrophes of varying intensity--the dynamics of criticality.  To improve understanding of the dynamics of intimate partner violence, this study will document daily patterns of domestic violence as it happens, in the context of the changing environment surrounding that violence, and use dynamical modeling to tease apart the three theories and their predicted patterns.  The objectives for this basic theoretical study are to determine 1) the dynamics of intimate partner violence, 2) the personal, household, and relational context of violence, 3) determine the dynamical patterns of violence and degree of nonlinearity observed, 4) whether dynamic patterns of violence reflect underlying theoretical models that explain violence, and 5) the impact of study participation.  To achieve the objectives, this study will recruit 200 Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white adult women from six primary care clinics during routine office visits.  Women who report being abused within the past month but do not intend to leave the relationship will complete an interview at intake and a telephone survey every day for 90 days.  Questions will address the previous day's level of violence, arguments, hassles, distress, marital harmony, life events, and husband's and wife's alcohol intake. Weekly telephone discussions with the women and end-of-study interviews will assess additional relationship factors and women's sense of safety during the study.  Analysis will determine the specific dynamic pattern of violence seen as well as same-day and previous day(s) triggers of violent events.  This work will advance the scientific understanding of husband-to-wife abuse by identifying dynamic patterns and the processes that underlie these patterns, which in turn may enhance the predictability of these violent events and inform possible interventions.",
