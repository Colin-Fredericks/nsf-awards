 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astrophysical plasmas are rarely observed to be static.  Instead they\r\nvary strongly in both time and space, a phenomena known as turbulence.\r\nSuch plasmas are also typically endowed with magnetic fields, just\r\nlike the Earth and the Sun.  An understanding of turbulence in\r\nmagnetized plasmas (known as MHD turbulence) is thus required to\r\nunderstand a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, from the solar\r\nwind in our solar system (and how the solar wind impacts Earth) to\r\nrotating disks of gas falling into black holes (which produce some of\r\nthe brightest sources of light in the Universe).  Our proposed\r\nresearch is aimed at understanding the behavior of MHD turbulence on\r\nsmall scales where the energy is converted into heat.\r\n\r\nWe propose to carry out large-scale numerical calculations of the\r\nproperties of MHD turbulence on small scales.  These calculations will\r\npredict observable properties of the turbulence that can be directly\r\ncompared to measurements in the solar wind, and ultimately to\r\nmeasurements in the laboratory on Earth.  The same calculations will\r\npredict how plasmas are heated when the energy contained in the\r\nturbulence is dissipated -- one of the major unsolved problems in our\r\nunderstanding of turbulence.  These results will be compared to\r\nmeasurements in the solar wind; they will also be used to predict the\r\nlight we see from plasma falling into black holes -- our primary\r\nobservational window onto black holes in nature.  More broadly, the\r\ncalculations proposed here will advance the state-of-the-art in\r\nnumerical modeling of turbulence in magnetized plasmas and will have\r\nimplications for a wide variety of laboratory, space, and\r\nastrophysical plasmas.\r\n\r\n",
