 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks NSF support to bring together scientists, engineers, resource managers and policy makers across NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions in a workshop format. The objectives for the workshop include (i) sharing information among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions on the nature of water resources issues (management, policy) and the state-of-the-art in research (science) on water in the NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions, (ii) exploration of collaboration and outreach strategies for researchers, managers and policy makers, and (iii) identification of opportunities across NSF directorates for research support in water dynamics that will align with the expertise of scientists and engineers in NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions in order to improve funding competitiveness.\r\n\r\n \r\nWorkshop speakers will highlight and share ideas on emerging scientific innovations in water dynamics. These talks and poster presentations will profile new studies that focus on examining the dynamics of change in water systems and new research tools available to scientists and engineers to document and model these changes. The workshop is specifically designed to build collaborations among NSF EPSCoR researchers, thereby strengthening the nation?s research capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop participants will address the relevance of research to water resource management and policy. Speakers will highlight the opportunities for STEM educational outreach and workforce development through community based research. The social dynamics of the hydrological systems will be explored, as will strategies for bringing the diversity of water researchers and students in line with national demographics, engaging all jurisdictions and special populations in our national research mission.\r\n",
