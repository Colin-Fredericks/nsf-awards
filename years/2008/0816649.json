 "awd_abstract_narration": "CHEMISTRY (12)\r\n\r\nNew electronic curricular materials for undergraduate analytical chemistry education are being developed and implemented. These modules focus on equilibrium chemistry,\r\nseparations, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The materials all incorporate active learning approaches and utilize electronic resources from the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL, http://www.asdlib.org) collection. The modules are designed to be used in a variety of formats (e.g., classroom activities, homework assignments, laboratory projects) or modified to suit the particular needs of an instructor or institution. The modules include cooperative classroom activities and problem-based exercises and laboratory experiences. Also included is an instructor's guide to help faculty implement these materials into their courses. Active learning components will include guided inquiry activities for classroom instruction as well as problem-based learning exercises and laboratory experiences. Evaluation of the materials will inform future revisions. The curricular materials developed under this proposal will be disseminated through ASDL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
