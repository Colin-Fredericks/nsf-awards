 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Boise State University under the supervision of Dr. Denise Wingett to support biology and nanotechnology research at the biological interface.   This grant from the National Science Foundation will enable the purchase of a state-of-the art scientific instrument with advanced capabilities that are currently unmatched elsewhere in the state of Idaho. The fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) is useful for a wide array of biological and nanomaterials science applications.  This instrumentation allows researchers to identify, analyze, and collect rare subpopulations of cells from many different origins and species or engineered materials in the nanometer to micron size range.   Research projects that will benefit from this instrumentation include studies of fundamental mechanisms of cellular response, growth, death, and differentiation to natural and chemical stimuli or materials from the fast developing nanotechnology sector. This instrument also allows for the collection of chromosomes, subcellular components including mitochondria from individual cells, or bacteria starting from complex mixtures of cell populations.   \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this instrument will support more than nineteen collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects at institutes of higher education in the Treasure Valley region including Boise State University, College of Idaho, and Northwest Nazarene University, as well as numerous research programs at surrounding government and hospital research institutes and private industry partners.  Availability of this cutting-edge instrumentation will be used to advance educational opportunities for hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students by efficient integration of research and education through hands-on training as well as the development of a new PhD program in biomolecular sciences at Boise State University.\r\n",
