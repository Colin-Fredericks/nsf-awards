 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current observations of supermassive black holes in the early Universe pose serious questions on our understanding of the formation and growth of these unique astrophysical objects. Dr. Dimitrios Psaltis (University of Arizona) will determine whether supermassive black holes can grow in the early Universe solely by accretion. This will be achieved by simulating accretion flows onto black holes using the spectral, 3D, magnetohydrodynamic algorithm recently developed by Dr. Psaltis and his group, which will be further enhanced by incorporating a detailed treatment of radiative processes. The result of this investigation will be the first ab initio calculation of the limiting rate of mass accretion by a supermassive black hole.  This project will also assess the viability of performing tests of gravity using accreting black holes. Moreover, it will establish, using a parametric theoretical framework, whether the astrophysical black holes are described by the Kerr metric of General Relativity.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of this research project will be the development of modules for the visualization of particle and photon orbits in arbitrary curved spacetimes. These modules will become valuable tools in educating students in the various geometric aspects of the theory. Dr. Psaltis, assisted by several undergraduate students, will develop a self contained, web-based, visual tool for the teaching of relativistic concepts.  Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will be educated during the research program in various aspects of relativity, computational astrophysics, and transport methods, both of which are important for a number of disciplines of physics research other than astrophysics.",
