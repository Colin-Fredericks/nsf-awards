 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research agenda is divided into two related parts.  The first part proposes new inference methods with non-experimental data. Identification of some important parameters is achieved by finding instruments that are correlated with the endogenous variables. Since data often do not result from a controlled experiment and most methods are not reliable for weak instruments, there is a need for new econometric tools in most applied fields, such as labor economics and macroeconomics.  The second part develops reliable methods to conduct inference in panel data models. Industrial organization and labor economics models often have unobserved firm and individual characteristics. Commonly used econometric methods are either not robust or dismiss relevant information in the data. Developing more reliable methods when some characteristics are unobserved offers a direct contribution to those fields.\r\n\r\nBoth parts propose new econometric procedures that are more reliable in practice when the usual approximations to the distribution of commonly used statistics fail. To achieve the research goals, finite-sample results from classical statistical literature are extended to overcome limitations in the currently used econometric procedures. This interdisciplinary theoretical work is buttressed by extensive computer-generated simulations, which help assess the overall properties of each procedure.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This proposal is motivated by situations in which standard asymptotic theory provides poor approximations, such as when the number of parameters is large or when the parameters are weakly identified. Obtaining reliable econometric procedures can benefit related academic fields and impact policy making. For example, educational reformers depend on accurate statistical methods to judge alternative schooling policies. Policy makers employ models with large numbers of parameters. The econometric methods in the current proposal, together with computational tools to be developed, can help support the decision-making process in each of these areas.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be shared with a broader public in several important ways, not only by teaching and mentoring, giving seminars at academic and governmental institutions, and publishing papers in widely-read journals, but also by developing computer code. This critical aspect of the proposal will enable others to implement procedures related to each of the two projects outlined above. The code will help disseminate these new ideas, and will foster interdisciplinary research and education.\r\n\r\nEducational objectives related to this work involve training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and including them in the research projects of the investigator. All courses taught by the investigator encourage students to actively participate in research and utilize improved econometric methods. As each new course is developed and refined, it also stimulates new directions in research.",
