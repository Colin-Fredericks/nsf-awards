 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaborative Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project is to explore an innovative fabrication approach and to study fundamental nano-scale phenomena in multifunctional nanofoams from polymeric nanocomposites. Such nanocomposite nanofoam materials will have many desirable properties, such as ultra-high strength-to-weight ratio, high electrical conductivity, and high acoustic damping coefficient, which have not been attainable using the state-of-the-art foaming technology. Although nanofoams from polymer nanocomposites promise unprecedented material properties, a manufacturing process that can be scaled up to produce multifunctional nanofoams for large scale applications is not currently available. This research will explore a cost-effective and environmentally benign approach to creating multifunctional nanofoams from polymer nanocomposites using a stress-induced gas foaming technique. This project is a well-planned interdisciplinary effort toward scientific discovery. Researchers from both academia and industry will work closely together to ensure its success. This research is greatly significant for the science and engineering of nanomanufacturing, as well as many industrial applications that are crucial to the national economy. Polymer nanocomposite nanofoams will lead to a class of novel materials that are critically needed for many industrial applications, such as new generation commercial airplanes that are far more fuel efficient and critical windmill structures for renewable energy. The material enhancements offered by nanocomposite nanofoams would enable great weight reduction and multifunctionality, while still maintaining or even improving the overall structural performance. The added attractiveness of nanocomposite nanofoams is that they can be tailored to perform multiple functions, such as load bearing, electro-static preventing, electro-magnetic shielding, acoustic damping, and eventually even sensing.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the industry competitiveness, creating new job opportunities, and benefiting society at large. It will also provide great opportunities to establish long-term collaboration between academia and industry, develop research infrastructure across campuses, and involve students at all levels, including K-12, undergraduate, and graduate, as well as woman and minority students.",
