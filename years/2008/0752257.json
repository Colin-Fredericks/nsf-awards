 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) will develop an integrated model of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flare emissions that fully accounts for the energy released during such eruptive events. This will make it possible to relate the observed properties of emissions in the lower corona to the velocity and acceleration of resulting CMEs. This project will improve upon the PI's previous work by using a sophisticated numerical CME model developed by SAIC to gain new insights into CME energy release, reconnection physics, and dynamics. Flare emission from simulated events will also be modeled, allowing connections between CMEs and flares to be explored. This project will elucidate the fundamental physics underlying eruptive phenomena on the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe PI will create an interactive, hands-on solar physics exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science, and she is currently developing content for an exhibit on solar astronomy at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. During this project, the PI will also serve as a mentor to three young women scientists at the beginning of their careers. This research effort will benefit society by developing diagnostic tools to aid in forecasting the space weather conditions that can damage satellites, power grids, and oil pipelines, as well as disrupt telecommunications and navigation.",
