 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nObjective \r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a new biochip technology based on spin valve sensor arrays and magnetic nanoparticles, which may eliminate the need for sample amplification, and make rapid pathogen detection possible.  The approach is based on two technical components: (1) a DNA fragment detector with a sensitivity of ~100 femto-molar that is at least 10-fold better than the present technology, and (2) a sample preparation system allowing rapid and efficient concentration of the DNA (or protein) samples. Both components utilize monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles (nanotags) with a mean diameter ranging from 10 to 100 nm to label pathogen targets.\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is that the magnetic biochip allows greater specificity and sensitivity for pathogen detection and quantitation. In particular, the intrinsic multiplexing capability of magnetic DNA chip will create what economists call a ?disruptive? technology.  Because it is cost-effective and easy to use, the magnetic DNA assay can define a new standard of healthcare for infectious diseases.\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe broader impact extends well beyond magnetics, spintronics, nanotechnology, and biology. It will eventually make it possible to detect, and in some cases treat, diseases such as cystic fibrosis, cervical cancer, sickle-cell anemia, and diabetes. The same magnetic chip can be adapted for use in genomics, forensics, biodefense, and cancer detection. The fundamental knowledge of magnetic biosensors and nanoparticles would have wide-ranging implications for micromagnetic and nanomagnetic devices in microelectronics as well as medicine. The research will attract and train undergraduates and under-represented minorities. \r\n\r\n",
