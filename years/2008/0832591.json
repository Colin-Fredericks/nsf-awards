 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Martin Zanni at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and collaborators James Skinner (UW-Madison), Daniel Raleigh (SUNY at Stony Brook), and Sean Decatur (Oberlin College) are supported by the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program to devise and test methods based on two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy for characterization of protein structure and function.   The techniques are particularly important for studying systems for which NMR and x-ray crystallography are difficult to apply, such as proteins in cell membranes and protein aggregates.  The work brings together a diverse and complementary team of researchers to develop a rigorous protocol for calculating 2D IR spectra from atomistic structural models through a novel combination of theory, experiment, and synthesis.  To develop the theoretical methodology, well-characterized proteins are either isotope-labeled or mutated at individual residues so that the linewidths and/or couplings of specific residues can be measured with 2D IR spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\nWhile the work is primarily directed toward developing 2D IR as a tool for protein kinetics, it can be applied to other systems as well.  Undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs involved in this study are being trained to work in a collaborative interdisciplinary and inter-institutional environment.   Participation of underrepresented groups derives from exchange programs among Oberlin, Howard University, Stony Brook, and Wisconsin.  Cyber-infrastructure components include web-conferences to discuss research progress and dissemination of user-friendly software for the theoretical calculation of spectra.  An undergraduate physical chemistry lab experiment is being developed to show how FTIR spectroscopy can be used as a tool for protein secondary structure determination; the experiment will be tested in the physical chemistry lab courses at Wisconsin, Stony Brook, Oberlin, and Howard, and then made available to the broader academic community.  Institutions that lack the needed instrumentation will be able to incorporate this experiment into their curriculum by taking advantage of the web-based remote access features being developed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding of biological systems, including the understanding of human diseases, relies upon detailed structural information about proteins, the biological molecules that underlie all biological function.  While techniques such as x-ray crystallography have been applied to elucidate the structures of thousands of proteins, many systems (including some proteins with the greatest biological interest) are not amenable to these techniques.  This includes protein aggregates, which are implicated a range of important biological activities, but very difficult to describe structurally.\n\nWe have aimed to develop new tools of protein structure elucidation, based on the analysis of molecular vibrations.  All atoms in molecules vibrate around their bonds; these vibrations contain valuable information on the structure and environment of the molecular system.  Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is a tool to characterize these molecular vibrations in detail.  We have used biochemical techniques to create novel protein aggregates; measured the two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to analyze their structures; then use computational tools and theoretical physical chemistry to refine these models further.\n\nThe primary focus of the collaborative work between Oberlin and the University of Wisconsin-Madison has been on the study of human gamma-D-crystallin, a protein found in the lens of the eye that is responsible for maintaining lens clarity and helping to focus light into the eye.  Under stress, the crystallin protein degrades and forms aggregates, which eventually lead to cataracts.  Using our novel biochemical and spectroscopic techniques, we have been able to elucidate the structure of these crystallin aggregates for the first time.  This work not only demonstrates the power of the experimental approaches we have developed, but also gives new and important insight into the molecular structures and mechanisms that underlie cataract formation.\n\n \n\nIn carrying out this work, we have involved undergraduate students from Oberlin, who have been active participants in all aspects of the work.  The experience on this project has been invaluable for their scientific training.  Of these students, two are now enrolled in PhD programs; one is in the chemical workforce; one is in medical school; and one is still completing his undergraduate degree (but with plans to attend graduate school).  In addition, this work has played a role in a new outreach program at Oberlin College, aimed at introducing Cleveland-area high school students to research in biology and biochemistry.  This program has served about 15 students per summer for two summers, exposing them to the topics of protein structure and physical studies of biological molecules.\n\nOverall, we have made significant progress in developing a new approach to the study of protein aggregates; demonstrated this techniques feasibility in a system of significant biological importance; and through this work advanced the training and education of undergraduate students as well as the exposure to science of high school students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean Decatur"
