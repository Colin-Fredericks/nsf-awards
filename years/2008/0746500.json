 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workflow-based systems have emerged as an alternative to ad-hoc\r\napproaches to data exploration that are widely used in the scientific\r\ncommunity. Workflows can capture computational tasks at various levels\r\nof detail and systematically record the provenance (history) information\r\nnecessary for reproducibility, result publication and\r\nsharing. Although the benefits of using scientific workflow systems\r\nare well known, the fact that workflows are hard to create and\r\nmaintain has been a major barrier to wider adoption of the technology\r\nin the scientific domain.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to produce new algorithms and techniques\r\nfor exploring and re-using useful knowledge embedded in workflow\r\nspecifications and in the provenance of the data they manipulate.\r\nThis project addresses key limitations in existing workflow\r\nsystems. First, it develops a set of usable tools that enable casual\r\nusers (who do not necessarily have programming expertise) to perform\r\nexploratory tasks and solve problems through workflows. These include\r\nintuitive user interfaces to manipulate collections of workflow and to\r\nquery workflows by example. Second, it builds a scalable provenance\r\nmanagement infrastructure to support the efficient execution of these\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe research results of this project advance the state of the art and\r\nbuild fundamental knowledge in storing, querying, and re-using\r\nprovenance of computational tasks.  This project has the potential to\r\nimpact a variety of applications where the creation and maintenance of\r\nworkflows is currently a major bottleneck. This includes large\r\ncomputational science projects and portals. Furthermore, it makes\r\nworkflows and workflow technology more accessible to casual users.\r\nThrough our interdisciplinary collaborations, this project will have\r\nimmediate impact in helping improve the scientific discovery process.\r\nThe involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the project\r\nwill provide mentoring opportunities. The PI is committed to\r\nrecruiting minority students. The results of this project will be\r\ndisseminated as research papers and as freely available tools at the\r\nproject website:\r\nhttp://www.cs.utah.edu/~juliana/projects/NSF-IIS-0746500\r\n\r\n",
