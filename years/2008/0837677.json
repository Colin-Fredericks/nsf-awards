 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) Computer, electrical, industrial, materials, and mechanical engineering students enrolled in an interdisciplinary, collaborative senior capstone design project are employing an integrated technology High Altitude Balloon (HAB) system launched into the near-space region (85,000 - 100,000 ft above sea level) of the earth's atmosphere.  The HAB system is a systematic integrated project that involves team investigation of a system with multiple elements such as wireless communication; working with alternative energy devices; control system design; data analysis for computing; payload material design; flight path prediction and aerodynamics; wind data studies, shape memory composites, heat transfer analysis; and developing a balloon tracking system. Through working on this project, students delve into a complex engineering system that (1) exposes them to applied and cutting-edge design projects; (2) encourages them to participate in an integrated, inter-disciplinary curriculum that facilitates engagement by working across all engineering disciplines; (3) involves them in methods of applied technology and skills necessary to transition from academic to professional environments.\r\n\r\nThe project provides students with meaningful experiences and insight into industry standards by introducing them to the state-of-the-art technologies and design clinics in inter-disciplinary projects; and encouraging them to work on technology transferable designs and determine success by creating new projects for engineering curriculum.  A longitudinal study on the value of the proposed approach is being conducted by systematically evaluating the preparedness and ability of engineering students engaged in the interdisciplinary senior design approach compared to students in the traditional design program.",
