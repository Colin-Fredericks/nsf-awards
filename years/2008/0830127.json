They will establish a laboratory with an-hoc network capabilities consisting of several wireless enabled computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a sensor network of 50 motes. The PI's will conduct experimental research on topics such as: (i) detecting misbehavior in ad-hoc networks, (ii) identifying and isolating malicious nodes in ad-hoc networks, (iii) distinguishing congestion from misbehavior in ad-hoc networks, (iv) quality of service routing in ad-hoc networks, (v) secure routing in ad-hoc networks, (vi) energy-efficient information dissemination in sensor networks, and (vii) receiver initiated MAC for sensor networks. The infrastructure will allow them to do performance testing and validation of their research in a realistic testbed. Broader impacts of the research include addressing the growing applications of sensor networks in research and societal applications. The facilities will be available for education and course work, including courses that Washington State University offers jointly with the nearby University of Idaho in Moscow, ID.\r\n\r\n",
