 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET- 0829027\r\nDoty, Sharon L.\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\n\r\nThe proposed research considers phytoremediation of TCE using fast-growing cottonwood and willow trees; endophytes (microorganisms) living within these trees will be used to enhance the remediation processes. Since many of the poplar and willow endophytes isolated in the PI's laboratory can both induce rapid root growth and fix atmospheric nitrogen, the presence of these endophytes may have a vital role in the survival and successful establishment of these tree species. This project is the first comprehensive study of the beneficial role of endophytes on TCE metabolism by two tree genera most suitable for phytoremediation. Development of methods of improving the ability of trees to remediate polluted sites that do not involve genetic engineering will aid in making this greener technology more accepted for widespread use. \r\n\r\nThe PI and seven of her ten lab members are female scientists. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through the UW Minority Program. As an active member of the International Poplar Commission and part of the Working Group on environmental uses of poplar and willow, the PI has direct connections to users of poplar and willow around the world to ensure that the knowledge generated in this project will be utilized promptly to improve remediation of pollutants in an environmentally sustainable way.",
