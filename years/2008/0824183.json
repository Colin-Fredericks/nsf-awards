 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop an opto-fluidic hybrid miniaturized flow cytometry.  The approach is to implement an integrated, fully functionalized on-chip system, which is capable of (1) three-dimensional (3D) focusing of cells, (2) flexible manipulation of light in both X-Y and X-Z planes, and (3) simultaneous collection of all three types of light signals (forward scattering, side scattering, and fluorescence). \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research will address two major problems in the existing miniaturized flow cytometry chips: lack of flow focusing in the vertical (Z) direction and lack of on-chip focusing of light.  Its functionality and simplicity of fabrication and assembly will make the proposed system attractive for both fundamental biomedical research and clinical applications.  Moreover, it will shed light on our understanding in the light and fluid interactions at microscale, providing momentum to the emerging field of optofluidics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nIn addition to its technical contributions, the project will impact society by implementing vigorous education and outreach programs that are closely integrated with the proposed research and designed for groups at all levels (general public, undergraduates, and graduate students).  Underrepresented students will participate extensively in the proposed research and be recruited through the Penn State WISER and MURE programs.  Results and expertise developed during the course of this project will be incorporated into the PI's teaching activities. To obtain the broadest possible impact, the PI will partner with the Penn State MRSEC to develop a suite of demonstrations in MEMS/NEMS and deliver them to the general public.",
