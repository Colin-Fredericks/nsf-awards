 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to advance our understanding of material removal and surface smoothening mechanisms for creating components with nanometric form accuracy and sub nanometric surface finishes. This will be achieved by applying frequency response analysis techniques, as used by the machine tool industry, to precision polishing to experimentally measure and define the relationship between polishing tools, process vibrations and dynamics, temperature, and the final polished workpiece quality. Unique elements of the research include 1) measuring the dynamic moduli of polishing pitch used on polishing tools through frequency sweep and impulse excitation testing, 2) prediction of the tool's dynamic behavior by finite element modeling, 3) quantification and isolation of process vibrations through instrumentation of a polishing machine, 4) modification of process vibrations through tool design considerations, 5) isolation of vibration threshold values affecting surface finish and material removal rates and 6) collaboration with industrial partners to further validate the process assessment, monitoring and tuning methodology. Research deliverables, centered on advanced understanding of process fundamentals, will include a novel quantitative method of process assessment and a validated, deterministic algorithm for optimized polishing tool design. The objective of the educational program is to provide enhanced material on precision manufacturing, give graduate students exposure to industrial considerations, involve undergraduate students in the laboratory and provide K-12 students with a hands-on engineering experience through existing programs at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research will ensure better quality polished surfaces and a higher degree of process automation. This will positively impact the costs associated with fabricating optical components for laser fusion systems, lithography systems, lasers for military and medical applications, and X-ray optics. The integrated circuit manufacturing industry can apply the knowledge to their chemical mechanical planarization processes. Integration of the results into current educational programs, combined with additional outreach efforts, will help improve the quality and number of engineering students available to US companies in a competitive manufacturing environment.",
