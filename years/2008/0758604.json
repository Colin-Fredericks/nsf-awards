 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the phenomenon of atomic stick-slip friction, including the newly discovered transition to stable sliding with ultralow energy dissipation. The research will be conducted through a closely-coordinated experimental and modeling effort. The experiments will use advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) with well-defined samples and tips to measure atomic-scale friction. This will be synergistically coupled to an atomistic modeling effort that will employ physically representative potential models and accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) to match the time scale of the experiments. \r\nThis research will provide an understanding of atomic-scale friction and energy dissipation at a new level of insight. It will also help to provide new, fundamental, and widely applicable principles that govern the sliding motion of nanoscale devices such as nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) and ultrahigh density probe-based data storage devices. The project will leverage highly effective educational outreach programs at both Purdue University and the University of Pennsylvania. Specific priorities include hosting ?research experience for teachers? fellows, development of multi-purpose demonstration modules based on AFM, and active participation in international collaborative cyber-network communities. \r\n\r\n",
