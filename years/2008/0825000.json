 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to combine atomic force microscopy (AFM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomistic modeling to: (1) explore the scientific basis of wear at the nanoscale; and (2) test the hypothesis that macroscopically strong carbon-based materials can be used to form wear-resistant nanotips. The science of wear is largely unexplored, yet is critically needed for enabling nanotechnology applications including all tip-based nanomanufacturing (TBN) processes (e.g., nano-scale machining, lithography, manipulation, data storage). Carbon-based materials may be ideal for TBN due to their high strength, low friction and wear, and stable surfaces. We will leverage collaboration with industry and national laboratory partners for this work.\r\nThe societal impact of this work is twofold. From a technical standpoint, it will aid in the implementation of TBN processes for industry, and in the broader development of a scientific understanding of wear at the atomic scale. From an educational standpoint, this research will train engineers at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels in interdisciplinary concepts in nanomanufacturing. The PIs will integrate lectures and labs on TBN processes into undergraduate and graduate courses, and will widely disseminate the results of this work to science and engineering professionals through presentations, publications, cyber-infrastructure, and discussions with industrial collaborators. A high school teacher will be supported through established research experience for teachers (RET) programs. Women and underrepresented minorities will be recruited to be part of the research team and as participants and beneficiaries of the outreach efforts.",
