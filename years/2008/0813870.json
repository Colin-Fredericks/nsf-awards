 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) for novel\r\nradiation detectors will be investigated. The team draws upon their expertise in the synthesis of PbSe/PbS NQDs and their integration in optoelectronic devices to advance the technology of NQD-enhanced radiation detection. Nanostructure hererojunctions containing conductive polymers and PbSe NQDs will be investigated to develop gamma-ray PN-diode detectors. The proposed project will be groundbreaking as it will be the first time that the gamma-ray detection with PbSe QDs is investigated. The high-Z PbSe/PbS NQDs in the &#947;-ray detector configuration will provide the ultimate solution to the desired sensitive, high resolution, and room-temperature detection of low-level radioactive signals.\r\nThese meta-metal materials do not exist in nature.  Overcoming barriers to the growth of sensitive, room-temperature radiation sensor technology by employing colloidal compound QDs in the PN-diode device structure is a major step. A technical breakthrough such as low-level gamma ray detection will have a profound impact on national security and radioactivity-monitoring. The proposed studies will also provide focused research and learning experience to graduate and undergraduate students by involving them in experimental laboratory work, and bridge the fundamental nanoscience and engineering with the real-world applications.",
