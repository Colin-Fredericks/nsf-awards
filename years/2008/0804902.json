Unraveling the details of this interplay will consolidate our understanding of the physics at play behind the functionality of complex materials. This project pursues two main objectives, namely the carrying out of 1) the growth with Molecular Beam Epitaxy and in-situ Angle Resolved Photoemission studies of binary oxides, Fe3O4, VOx, EuO and V2O3, which will function as models systems for studying the many-body physics at play in more complex materials, and 2) time-resolved photoemission experiments on well-characterized systems, either with ultrafast optical techniques and/or x-rays, or whose nature of the interactions has already been extensively investigated with static measurements. The accomplishment of these goals on well-characterized systems will form a solid body of experience for extending the project to more complex materials.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn complex electron systems, electrons interact among each other giving rise to spectacular and unconventional phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity.  Electrons interact either via their charge, lattice, or spin, a quantum mechanical property at the heart of magnetism in materials.  Unraveling the details of these interactions holds the key for a sound understanding of the fundamental principles behind the possibility of exploiting the properties of complex materials for revolutionary technological applications.  A major challenge in the study of complex electron system is the problem of being unable to establish a cause-effect relationship among the interactions.  For example, does magnetism foster a material to become metallic, or is the fact that a material becomes metallic that induces magnetism?  This reminds of the old \"chicken and egg\" problem: who came first, the chicken or the egg?  Our funded Proposal has addressed a unique experimental approach promising the possibility of overcoming this challenge.  It is based on combining a technique known as Angle Resolved Photoemission (ARPES), which is based on the famous \"photoelectric effect\" explained by Einstein in 1905, with modern laser techniques.  In an ARPES experiment, ultraviolet photons promote the emission of electrons, whose analysis provides important information about how electrons interact in a material.  The use of modern laser techniques allows the productions of ultraviolet pulses of extremely narrow time duration, less than a billionth of a second!  This is a time even shorter than atomic vibrations.  These short pulses offer the possibility of exciting electrons so quickly to instantaneously destroy their interactions.  Photoelectron spectra are then monitored for times following these initial excitations.  When the interactions start to re-form following the initial excitation, it will be possible to observe their signature in the electronic spectra.  Since different interactions exhibit different response time following a sudden excitation, the interactions will thus be disentangled by probing the response in time of the excited electron states.  By analyzing the different time responses, the interactions can be sorted out with the possibility of establishing a time hierarchy among them, thus constituting a promising new possibility of disentangling the complicated interplay of the key interactions in complex materials.  \n\nThe majority of the activity supported by this grant has focused on building the experimental set-up for laser-based ARPES and interfacing the ARPES chamber with another vacuum chamber dedicated to the in-situ growth of binary oxides with Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE).  This unique experimental set-up allows the growth of controlled systems and their analysis with ARPES without contaminating the surface.  At the moment the pump-probe laser system is completely functioning and we started the collection of optical pump-probe data on manganites, a class of material which exhibit a drastic change in resistance when a magnetic field is applied.  The activities carried out in collaboration with Dr. R. Schoenlein at LBL have established the possibility of inducing a photo-induced insulator-to-metal transition in the prototypical manganite La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. Upon irradiation with ultrafast optical pulses of 800 nm, the fractional changes in the sample reflectivity at room temperature displays signatures very similar to that of Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3, for which an optically-induced first-order insulator-metal transition has been demonstrated.  These data suggest that the possibility of inducing the transition to the ferromagnetic-metallic state optically is not exclusive of Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3, but is rather a general property of the manganites.  We are at the moment trying to repeat these experiments at the liquid nitrogen temperature in order to establish whether it is possible to reach the paramagnetic-insulating state by optical pumping.
