 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gunnells proposes to work on problems in number theory and\r\nrepresentation theory in three broad areas.  First, he will focus on\r\ntopics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas,\r\nsuch as geometry of locally symmetric spaces and connections with\r\narithmetic geometry.  Second, he will study multiple Dirichlet series\r\nattached to Weyl groups and affine Weyl groups and their connections\r\nto combinatorics, representation theory, and automorphic forms.\r\nThird, he will investigate the geometry of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in\r\nCoxeter groups and their connections with combinatorics and\r\nrepresentation theory.  As a major writing project, he will continue\r\nto work with Hirzebruch and Zagier on the updating of their book \"The\r\nAtiyah-Singer theorem and elementary number theory.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with number theory and representation theory.\r\nNumber theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, and\r\nis the oldest branch of mathematics.  Representation theory is the\r\nsystematic study of symmetry, through the development of simple\r\nmathematical objects that encode the fundamental irreducible pieces of\r\nsymmetry.  A principal aim of the proposal is to explore relationships\r\nbetween these two subjects in the spirit of the \"Langlands\r\nphilosophy,\" which predicts deep connections between number theory and\r\nrepresentation theory.  Today the questions and phenomena addressed by\r\nthese subjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary\r\nmathematics research.  Moreover, the subjects have contributed many\r\napplications in such diverse areas as codes and data transmission,\r\nchemistry, physics, and theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\n",
