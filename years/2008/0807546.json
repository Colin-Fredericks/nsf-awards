Electrocapillary surfaces\r\nare capillary surfaces, i.e., surfaces which minimize surface\r\nenergy subjected to a volume constraint, that are placed in an\r\nelectric field.  Electro-elastocapillary systems are\r\nelectrocapillary surfaces that are additionally constrained to\r\nreside on a flexible elastic body.  Mathematical models of these\r\nsystems are developed via a variational principle.  The resulting\r\nsystems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations are\r\nstudied using tools from perturbation theory, nonlinear dynamics,\r\nand numerical analysis.  In addition, experiments are carried out\r\nin the investigator's laboratory and the mathematical theory is\r\ncompared with experimental data. \r\n\r\n     Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) operate at a scale\r\nwhere forces common to everyday experience, such as gravity and\r\ninertia, hold no sway.  Rather, in the microworld, behavior is\r\ndominated by less familiar forces such as surface tension and the\r\nelectrostatic force.  Inspired and informed by recent advances in\r\nMEMS technology, this project develops the mathematical theory of\r\nsystems dominated by the unique balance of capillary,\r\nelectrostatic, and elastic forces.  The development and analysis\r\nof this mathematical theory allows MEMS researchers to improve\r\nand optimize the design of MEMS devices.  In turn, improved MEMS\r\ndevices can be used in areas ranging from automotive safety to\r\nbiomedical engineering.  This project also focuses on outreach to\r\nmathematics faculty and students from local high schools.  As\r\npart of this project, the investigator strengthens existing ties\r\nwith several local high schools and help develop novel lab-based\r\nexercises to be integrated into the high school mathematics\r\ncurriculum. \r\n",
