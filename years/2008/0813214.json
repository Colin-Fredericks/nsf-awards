 "awd_abstract_narration": "Go Figure is a new multimedia project targeting 3- to 6-year olds, with a secondary audience of parents and caregivers.  The intended impact of the project is to support the development of mathematics literacy for the pre-school audience and to help the secondary audience to support young children's informal mathematics education.  This award supports pre-production development and evaluation of project elements including the continuing design of characters and locations, creation and test of interstitials, animatic and script, development and testing of scaffolded math game prototypes and piloting real-world extensions.  The project will be produced by WGBH, with the support of advisors and a third-party evaluator.  The project is being designed for broadcast on public television, with an extensive educational outreach component focused on improving parental attitudes toward math.",
