 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to restore biological diversity and ecosystem services often fail because ecologists lack detailed information on the intricate workings of the ecosystems to be restored. This study combines ecological theory with large-scale restoration for endangered plant species of vernal pools in California. Vernal pools are temporary wetlands that produce large displays of purple, gold and white flowers in the spring. Project investigators will track yearly success of restored plant communities, will conduct greenhouse studies to estimate how seeds stored in the soil affect yearly plant production, and will construct models to project future growth of plant populations. The study is novel in that it combines a long-term field experiment with state-of-the-art mathematical modeling to estimate success of habitat restoration.  \r\n\r\nThis study is especially relevant to resource managers and conservation practitioners involved in habitat restoration. The research has societal benefits, since vernal pools harbor many federally protected species and habitat restoration will be a key aspect of their recovery. The project involves training sixth-graders to graduate students, and the research will continue to contribute to conservation and restoration actions for vernal pools in California, including plans generated by regional governments, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and environmental consulting firms. \r\n",
