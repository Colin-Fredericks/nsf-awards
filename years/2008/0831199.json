 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, government  \r\nagencies, and universities, collect and use personal information from  \r\na range of sources, shared with specific expectations about how it  \r\nwill be managed and used. Accordingly, they must find ways to comply  \r\nwith expectations, which may be complex and varied, as well as with  \r\nrelevant privacy laws and regulations, while they minimize  \r\noperational risk and carry out core functions of the organization  \r\nefficiently and effectively. Designing organizational processes to  \r\nmanage personal information is one of the greatest challenges facing  \r\norganizations (see, e.g. a recent survey by Deloitte and the Ponemon  \r\nInstitute [TI07]), with far-reaching implications for every  \r\nindividual whose personal information is available to modern  \r\norganizations, i.e. all of us.\r\n\r\nThis project responds to these challenges by developing methods,  \r\nalgorithms and prototype tools for integrating privacy, compliance,  \r\nand risk evaluation into complex organizational processes. It  \r\nexplores, articulates and characterizes formally the scope and nature  \r\nof privacy-expectations of stakeholders as well as those of key  \r\nregulations, such as HIPAA, GLBA, COPPA, BASEL 2, and Sarbanes-Oxley  \r\n(SOX). It incorporates the diverse perspectives and areas of  \r\nexpertise of its multidisciplinary research team, which includes  \r\nthree computer scientists, one philosopher, and collaborating  \r\nresearchers from IBM. This industry connection facilitates  \r\ninteraction with product teams that have served complex organizations  \r\nconcerned with business process integrity, information security,  \r\nprivacy, and information risk management. The research builds on  \r\n\"contextual integrity\" (a philosophical account of privacy) as well  \r\nas language and risk-based methods for privacy policy specification  \r\nand enforcement. Extensive training and educational opportunities are  \r\nprovided to undergraduate and graduate students and research results  \r\nintegrated into courses at CMU, NYU, Stanford, and UPenn.",
