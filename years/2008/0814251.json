The goals are to (1) develop the state?s research and education infrastructure with a focus on environmental science; (2) develop a large, diverse workforce of scientists and technologists, and strengthen scientific literacy statewide; (3) capture the educational, social, and economic benefits of the research by developing an EPSCoR Integrative Process; and (4) manage the grant in an efficient and effective manner to achieve sustainability.  The project?s focus on achieving a sustainable biogeochemical environment while ensuring a prosperous economy is aligned with the Delaware State Science & Technology (S&T) Council?s strategic roadmap.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe project will substantially advance knowledge of the biogeochemical processes that occur at heterogeneous interfaces in the Critical Zone (CZ), which is Earth?s life-sustaining, near-surface environment.  This is of vital importance to Delaware because of the state?s delicate coastal ecosystem and its history of intensive industrial and agricultural usage.  Critical Zone research will be conducted in three theme areas:  (1) Metal-Microbe-Carbon Interactions, (2) Particle Transport and Release, and (3) Environmental Observation and Sensing.  The overarching research question is ?How do important biogeochemical processes, occurring at Critical Zone interfaces and over a range of spatial and temporal scales, govern the long-term sustainability and ecosystem health of land and water resources??\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nResearch results will be broadly applicable to management of coastal environmental systems and water resources regionally, nationally, and globally.  Integration of research and education will enhance workforce training and diversity of students at all levels, and engage the public in dialog on the science and ethics of environmental issues.  Graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education will be enhanced through multidisciplinary graduate programs, research internships, professional development of teachers, science summer camps, Science Saturdays, and early research experiences.  Development of the EPSCoR Integrative Process will promote interactions with stakeholders in ecosystem health through analysis and communication of the impact of the research in ethical, social, political, business, regulatory, and legal arenas.\r\n",
