 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade, new nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations (PDEs) have been developed for various image processing\r\napplications, such as noise reduction, edge detection, image\r\nsegmentation and restoration.  While the attention of the\r\nscientific community in this area predominantly focused on\r\ncreating the new PDEs, very little attention was paid to\r\ndeveloping numerical algorithms that approximate their solutions.\r\nThe few numerical algorithms that are currently used suffer from\r\na variety of problems: they are not accurate enough, too slow,\r\nand not fault-free.  In this project, the investigator develops\r\naccurate, efficient, and robust numerical algorithms for\r\nnonlinear PDEs in image processing.  The research activities are\r\nbased on the investigator's extensive work in the field of\r\nhyperbolic conservation laws, and include numerical methods for\r\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi equations, fast algorithms for high-order\r\nnonlinear PDEs, algorithms for computing steady-state solutions,\r\nnumerical homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and\r\nmulti-resolution analysis, analysis of nonlinear diffusion\r\nequations, constrained morphing active contours and geodesic\r\nflows, and \"non-blind\" algorithms for image processing.  A\r\nportion of the research activities focuses on improving existing\r\nalgorithms in order to solve a specific imaging problem in\r\nradiation oncology treatment planning.\r\n     The investigator develops novel mathematical techniques for\r\nimage processing and uses these techniques for solving problems\r\nin the field of radiation oncology imaging.  Radiation oncology\r\ntreats cancer by delivering relatively small doses of radiation\r\nto tumors in order to eliminate cancer without destroying or\r\nchronically damaging healthy tissues in and around the growth.\r\nCT and MRI scans are used as three-dimensional anatomical models\r\nto ensure that the treatments conform geometrically to the tumor\r\ntarget.  This process depends critically upon identifying the\r\nlocation of the tumor as well as the healthy organs (in order to\r\nminimize the dose of radiation in these areas).  Despite extended\r\nresearch, the existing mathematical tools for image processing\r\nare unsuitable for clinical medical applications.  The\r\nsegmentation of the CT and MRI scans is still carried out by\r\nmanual tools, and consumes about one-half of the time required to\r\nplan the treatments.  The investigator designs accurate and\r\nreliable automated algorithms that would significantly shorten\r\nthis time and have a big impact on radiation oncology.  He\r\nintegrates into his work educational activities that demonstrate\r\nthe importance of applied mathematics in a broad spectrum of\r\nsciences.  Special emphasis is given to applications of\r\ncomputational mathematics in biology and cutting-edge\r\ntechnologies.  The planned educational activities include\r\nprograms for junior-high, high-school, undergraduate, and\r\ngraduate students.  The investigator works to increase the gender\r\nand ethnic diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging\r\nunder-represented groups to study applied mathematics and choose\r\nit as a future career.\r\n",
