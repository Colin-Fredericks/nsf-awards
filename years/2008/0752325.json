These mini-conferences represent the continuation of a longstanding series of meetings (thirty-six at last count), most of which have been held at Auburn.\r\n\r\nAt the Fall 2008 meeting, 40-50 participants from about thirty regional universities as well as from other institutions are expected. The program will feature three principal speakers, who will deliver one-hour lectures, and a number of twenty-minute talks. Significant participation by graduate students from both Auburn University and other institutions typifies this conference series. The programs for the later meetings, still in the planning stages, will have a similar structure. \r\n\r\n",
