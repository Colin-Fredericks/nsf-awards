 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the Credibility of MANET Simulation Scenarios\r\n\r\nAd hoc networking involves computers, typically wireless mobile nodes (MNs) that cooperatively form a network without specific user administration or configuration.  In other words, ad hoc networking allows an arbitrary collection of MNs to create a network on demand. There are numerous scenarios that do not have an available network infrastructure and could benefit from the creation of an ad hoc network: rescue/emergency operations, law enforcement activities, and tactical missions.\r\n\r\nResearch in the mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) field typically uses simulation in order to imitate the appearance or character of the MANET being studied; indeed, most of what is known about MANETs has been discovered through simulation. A simulation study involves several steps, each of which must be carried out properly in order to obtain reliable results. Unfortunately, much of the MANET simulation research that has been done is seriously flawed.  In many cases, simulation scenarios provide environments that are not rigorous enough to provide meaningful results; in some other cases, the environments provide more stress than is desirable. As a result, published MANET simulation studies generally lack credibility. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to enhance the credibility of MANET simulations. \r\nThe intellectual merit of this work is to develop tools and methods for the MANET research community that will improve the credibility of simulation-based studies. The broader impact of this work is to assist the MANET community in moving from incredible simulation studies to credible simulation studies.\r\n",
