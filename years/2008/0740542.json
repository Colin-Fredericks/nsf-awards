 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of Analytical Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIIBS), a breakthrough method of material analysis that will allow for heretofore unattainable process control capabilities in metal and glass production.  This research will result in new plant instruments capable of rapidly measuring materials' chemical composition, a major factor in metal and glass quality.  The proposed Phase I research will include development of a new method to accurately measure key physical constants of important chemical elements in metal and glass production.  Insights into the fundamental physics of this measurement method will be gained, as well as new mathematical techniques to compute material compositions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity will impact manufacturing plants that produce glass, metal alloys, and other materials by allowing plant personnel to continuously monitor the composition, and thereby the quality, of their material for the first time.  Increased plant output, reduced waste, and reduced energy use will result from optimizing the plant operation.  There will also be benefits in other fields that that can utilize the on-site measurement technique; including the environment, planetary science, agriculture and food science, and explosives detection and other security applications. \r\n",
