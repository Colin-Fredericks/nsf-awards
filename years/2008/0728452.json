 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting students in Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Physics for careers in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and information technology, which are important growth areas in the \"Tech Valley,\" New York State's Capital Region. The program builds on existing experience with cohort programs and ongoing undergraduate-focused projects in nanotechnology curriculum development and research in chemistry, biochemistry, bioinformatics, physics, and computer science. Seminars on Tech Valley research and internship opportunities are regularly conducted, and mentoring throughout the student scholars' undergraduate careers is provided by an interdisciplinary cohort of faculty. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its focus on key interdisciplinary fields of inquiry which form some of the most rapidly developing and intellectually challenging areas of science. Furthermore, the project strengthens academic-industrial interactions that are situated in regional economic development. The broader impacts of the project are seen in its formal partnerships with two local community colleges to work with their students from the start to help prepare them for smooth transitions to the four-year science programs at the PI's institution. The student population at these \"feeder\" schools has a significant portion of minority and first-generation college students thus providing another aspect through which the project is able to exercise broad impact. Specific activities include mentoring and tutoring programs at the two-year college sites, joint science fairs, and participation by community college students in summer research opportunities. Finally, on-going relationships are in place with numerous local high-technology industries where graduating students have the opportunity to gain employment upon graduation.",
