Minimal systematic research has been conducted at the micro-level to investigate how individual researcher, organizational, and institutional factors explain patenting behavior of academic scientists. This study funded by the Science and Society Program develops a theoretical model of the emergence of a university patent consisting of multiple decision stages, mediated by individual, disciplinary, and organizational constraints and the resulting motivation to undertake commercially relevant research leading to patents. Data for the study were generated through a national online survey to a random sample of university scientists who are listed as inventors of patents assigned to US universities in 2006 and to a random sample of departmental colleagues of inventors who have never patented an invention. The survey electronically embedded patent data as a means of receiving patent-specific responses. The results of the project improve knowledge about the complex patent decision context that exists in universities and identify specific contextual elements that encourage or constrain patenting activity. The characterization of the university patents in terms of common patterns of behaviors and activities contributes to future policy debates about whether and how to encourage patenting activities on university campuses.\n\nFindings to Date\n\nPatenting decisions of academic scientists tend to be determined by the following factors:\n\n\n\nIndividual factors:\n\nScientists who perceive higher returns (monetary and non-monetary) from patenting are more likely to engage in patenting activities.\nScientists with stronger open science attitudes are less likely to involve in patenting activities.\nSenior faculty who achieve a certain level of stability in their career trajectory are more likely to engage in patenting activities than junior faculty. \nScientists who demonstrate increased publishing activity will be more likely to patent. \nScientists who have patenting experience are more likely to patent.\nMale scientists are more likely to engage in patenting activities than female scientists. \n\n\nField of science\n\nIn general, engineers are more likely to engage in patenting activities than scientists in other fields.\nScientists who conduct medical research are more likely to be involved in patenting activities.   \n\n\nOrganizational factors\n\nScientists with knowledge of the university royalty distribution policy are more likely to engage in patenting activities.\nScientists who work in departments in which promotion systems value patenting are more likely to patent.\nScientists who work in an departmental environment where patenting norms are widely accepted are more likely to involve in patenting activities.  \nHigh perceived organizational barriers from university Technology Transfer Organizations (TTO) are associated with lower likelihood that scientists produce a first patent.\nScientists who work with TTOs that frequently visit their departments and communicate with them are more likely to engage in patenting activities.\n\n\nResource factors\n\nAs the proportion of industry support of a scientist\u00c6s research funding increases, he or she is more likely to be involved in patenting activities. \nScientists having strong personal connection with industry are more likely to engage in patenting activities.  \n\n\nThere are three main decision points identified in this research: selection of research projects, disclosure of inventions to the university as they occur, and involvement in post-invention activities to bring the invention closer to commercialization.\n\nDeterminants of the patenting decisions of academic scientists tend to vary across decision points. Individual factors - scientists\u00c6 perceptions and attitudes towards patenting - have grea..."
