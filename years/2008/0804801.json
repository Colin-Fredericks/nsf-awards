 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: A key issue in materials science and condensed matter physics is to understand the reasons for bulk glass formation that occurs in some alloys and not in others. The time is now right to expand on the fundamental study of metallic alloys as recent discoveries of bulk amorphous metals have opened up the possibilities for new industrial applications. The objective of this project is twofold: 1) Combine experimental structural characterization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation- Measurement and modeling of amorphous metals to determine the atomic and nanoscale structures; and 2) Understand structure-property relationships - Relate results from modeling to thermodynamic properties; investigate brittle-ductile properties to structural features observed in the amorphous phase. For example, the amount of free volume in the amorphous structure may determine the ductility of the amorphous metal. The goal is to define the essential features of the driving mechanism of the glass forming ability and to understand the competing mechanisms among the thermodynamic, kinetic and structural processes that take place at a local level. Through an integrated research and educational program, the project will be realized by involving the active participation of students in implementing theoretical modeling and experimental tools to understanding glass forming ability in new amorphous alloys. The bulk glass capabilities of these alloys will potentially lead to new technological applications that make use of their properties that far exceed those of pure metals, conventional metallic glasses and crystals. Representative amorphous metals of Fe-based alloys that exhibit different glass forming abilities and crystallization behaviors will be investigated by scattering techniques to obtain their local topological arrangement. These will be combined with ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations addressing fundamental issues that can lead to important revelations about glass formation ability and predictions of new bulk metallic glass compositions. NON-TECHNICAL: Scientifically, the study of novel amorphous metals could accelerate the development of a new approach to modeling complex alloys. Additionally, it could also lead to new predictions of glass forming ability and structure-property relationships for guiding as well as stimulating the design of new structural materials. The nature of the program is interdisciplinary and collaborative. It involves sample characterization through the use of neutron/x-ray probes for the investigation of atomic structures that will allow students to understand structure-property relationships. The project also involves ab-initio modeling and simulation that includes collaboration with another university. Project goal is to bridge the gap between large-scale modeling and experiment by constructing a foundation for direct validation of models from the experimental output. The combination of both approaches will provide valuable training and research experience for undergraduates and graduate students. This project will become the PhD thesis of at least one graduate student. The long term plans include expanding the collaboration with other groups from other universities that work on similar systems to develop a program where the local structure-modeling capabilities of amorphous materials become widely available.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunding from this project was used towards understanding the structural properties of several classes of bulk alloys, from amorphous steels, to Ca-based and Zr-based glasses and Zr hydride glasses.  Initially, the project focused on the local atomic topology and how it changed with alloying.  The project gradually evolved to incorporate mechanical testing, in our quest to understand the mechanism of plastic flow from an atomistic point of view.  The pair density function (PDF) analysis has been the main technique employed to determine the local atomic structure as it neither assumes nor requires a lattice periodicity.  This is one of the main techniques implemented in the current project and for the proposed project as well.  It has become clear from the alloys surveyed thus far that although metallic glasses plastically deform by forming shear bands and the structure is clearly important in the plastic flow, \"when\" and \"how\" it happens are still poorly understood.  Thus we have turned our attention to this particular problem but not only by looking at the static atomic structures but included the dynamics as well in order to understand fragility.   Their brittleness, which is reminiscent more of ceramics instead of metals, is a contradiction to their high strengths.  Although glass fragility has been hotly debated in glass-forming liquids, a link between the low temperature glassy (solid) state and fragility has been provided through the nonergodicity factor, as defined by the mode coupling theory in the last decade or so.  Thus in question here, and the central theme of the our project, is the relation between the fragility and the atomic properties leading to plastic flows under mechanical testing, be it tension or compression fatigue.  For this purpose we used inelastic neutron scattering techniques to look  at the dynamic structure factor and how it evolves under fatigue.   Added to this is the quest to understand the unusual low temperature characteristics that are distinctly different from any crystalline equivalent i.e. the observation of an excess vibrational density of states manifested in the so-called Boson peak and observed by neutron and Raman scattering, a universal attribute in glassy systems.  The intensity of the Boson peak has been directly related to fragility and to the local free volume.  However, little is known regarding the nature of the Boson peak in metallic glasses with isotropic structures and even less so under the influence of mechanical deformation.  We will continue to work on this problem in order to fully understand what happens to the structure and how atomic vibrations are afftected under fatigue.  With only a few of the alloys discovered thus far exhibiting good mechanical properties, it is important to investigate the relation of static disorder, its dynamics, the free volume and fragility in the solid state.  The Zr-based glass system is a very good system for this purpose\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Despina Louca"
