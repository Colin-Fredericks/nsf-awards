The scholars are academically talented and financially needy individuals planning a career teaching science in a community college.  Starting with the second year of the project, three successive cohorts of five students each receiving annual scholarships of $10,000 during the three years that they are studying science and earning a Masters of Science degree while enrolled in the five year long dual degree program.  To enable the third cohort to receive three years of scholarship support and graduate with a Masters degree during the five year project period, the university has committed to providing scholarships to the third cohort during their third year of study. All scholars receive financial support from the university's Mallinson Institute of Science Education as they serve in a mentored teaching role during the fourth and fifth years of the program while also conducting their doctoral dissertation research. \r\n\r\n",
