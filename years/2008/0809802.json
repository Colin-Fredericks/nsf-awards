 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Arthur Utz of Tufts University will conduct detailed studies of the chemical reaction dynamics for gas-surface reactions using laser preparation to perform quantum-state resolved reactivity measurements on metal surfaces.  These studies will be carried out by combining laser excitation methods with ultra-high vacuum techniques. \r\nOne set of experiments will investigate methane reactivity at surfaces, while another group will test the size limit for mode specific effects by using larger gas reactants for which intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) is observed for the isolated molecule in the gas phase.  These experiments are designed to understand the role of internal energy in gas-surface reactions and test the limits of bond-selective surface chemistry. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of the important variables that influence gas-surface reactivity, with an aim towards designing better theories and improved practical applications.   The results of this study will provide theorists with much useful data to test the latest theories. The results will also provide important guidance in designing practical catalytic reaction schemes, which are important to industry.  Students and postdoctoral research associates who participate in this research acquire new knowledge and skills in preparation for advanced studies or entrance into the scientific/technological job market.\r\n",
