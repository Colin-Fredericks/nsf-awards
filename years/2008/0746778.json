The\r\nproposed shearlet approach encompasses the mathematical framework\r\nof affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to\r\ncombine optimal sparsity (few coefficients to compute), fast\r\ntransforms through the power of multiresolution analysis (fast\r\ncomputation) and full mathematical justification and framework\r\n(great flexibility and versatility).  The sparsity of the\r\nproposed shearlet representation is a direct consequence of its\r\ngenuinely multidimensional multiscale character, and its fast\r\nimplementation a consequence of its affine mathematical\r\nstructure.  The project is organized into three main directions\r\nof investigation, with several specific goals.  First, the\r\nmathematical framework underpinning the shearlets is investigated\r\nto set the foundation for the construction and analysis of\r\noptimally sparse multidimensional representations.  Next these\r\nrepresentations are applied to the decomposition of functions\r\nspaces and operators.  More specifically, the shearlets are used\r\nas building blocks of anisotropic function spaces.  This step has\r\nsignificant implications in approximation theory, in the study of\r\nFourier integral operators, and for various nonstandard\r\nregularity spaces associated to partial differential equations. \r\nThird, shearlets are applied to problems from image processing\r\nand image analysis.  Specifically, improved algorithmic\r\nimplementations are developed and applied to image denoising,\r\nedge detection and shape recognition.  Tests are conducted on\r\nbiomedical data to address specific application-driven problems,\r\nincluding geometric reconstruction of neuronal morphology from\r\nconfocal images and neuronal classification. \r\n\r\nOver the past twenty years, multiscale methods and wavelets have\r\nrevolutionized signal processing and stimulated an impressive\r\namount of research in mathematics and engineering.  In fact,\r\nwavelets provide optimally efficient representations of\r\none-dimensional data and have fast numerical implementations.  As\r\na result, wavelets are successfully employed in a number of\r\nstrategic applications, including the new FBI fingerprint\r\ndatabase and JPEG-2000, the new standard for image compression. \r\nIn spite of their remarkable success, wavelets are far from being\r\noptimal in general.  Even though they outperform other\r\ntraditional methods, they fail to capture intrinsic geometrical\r\nfeatures of multidimensional phenomena.  For instance, they do\r\npoorly at dealing with features such as the edges of an image or\r\nthe boundary surfaces of a solid object, and, as a consequence,\r\nthey are unable to handle efficiently the ever larger\r\nmultidimensional data sets which are required by many modern\r\napplications.  By contrast, the approach addressed in this\r\nproject is truly multidimensional and opens the door to a new\r\ngeneration of highly efficient methods for the storage,\r\ntransmission and processing of data.  The applications arising\r\nfrom this research facilitate technological advances in sensitive\r\napplications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data\r\ntransmission and classifications, video surveillance, and storage\r\nof data. \r\n",
