 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. The discovery of the phase transition in Mg-silicate perovskite (Pv) to a new phase (post-perovskite, PPv) at lowermost mantle conditions has influenced the interpretation of seismic observations and the understanding of the dynamic role of this region of the Earth's interior. Because there are discrepancies between recent experiments and theoretical calculations regarding the PPv transition, new and more sophisticated experimental work is needed. The PI's recently conducted XRD measurements on (Fe0.1Mg0.9)SiO3-PPv to 136 GPa captured the complete transformation from Pv+PPv mixture to pure PPv at in situ high P-T, which enables reliable determination of the phase boundary. This work also makes possible an accurate determination of the equation of state (EOS) for PPv. Further work is proposed to for pure and Al-bearing Mg-PPv. Combined work on pure, Fe-bearing, and Al-bearing Mg-Pv, the proposed measurements will allow self-consistent evaluation of density and compressibility across the PPv transition - thereby defining phase relations for the lower mantle.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. A long term goal is to understand the structure and dynamics of the mantle using experimental approaches, and taking advantage of rapid developments in synchrotron XRD techniques to study important geophysical problems. The most significant educational activity of this proposal is to provide research opportunities in mineral physics to MIT undergraduate students who will participate in the proposed project during summer. This project will also support Ph.D. research of K. Catalli. The outcome of the proposed research will also be incorporated into courses at MIT, \"Structure of Earth Materials\", \"Introduction to Mineral Physics\", and \"The Core-Mantle Boundary\", for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe structures and dynamics of the Earth's mantle have strong influences on the chemical evolution of our planet.  Deep subducting slabs appear to transport materials formed at the surface of the Earth to the mantle and hot spot volcanoes, such as Hawaii, may have their roots in the mantle.  For more than three decades, geophysicists had believed that the lower mantle (700-3000 km depth from the surface) is a homogeneous layer.  However, recent seismic imaging studies have shown large scale variations in this layer.  In mineral physics, recent studies have discovered previously unknown changes in the dominant material (magnesium silicate) in this layer.  However, it has been unclear how these changes (spin transition and post-perovskite transition) can influence the seismic variations found in the lower mantle.\n\nSupported by this grant, we have conducted a series of experiments by combining the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron X-ray techniques to understand how these transitions can affect the seismic properties of the lower mantle (density and seismic velocities).  This knowledge is important in extracting the dynamic and structural information on the lower mantle from seismic observations.  We found that the depth and detectability of these transitions are very sensitive to compositional variations (such as changes in iron and aluminum contents).  Our study under this grant improved our understanding on the compositional variations in the lower mantle and advanced our knowledge on the evolution and dynamics of the Earth's interior.  Under this grant, we have published a total of 12 papers, including one paper in journal Nature and two papers in journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The PI has given a total of 12 invited talks on the research results obtained under this grant in international meetings, including American Geophysical Union meeting, Japan Geophysical Union meeting, International Mineralogical Association meeting, and International Geological Congress.  Under this grant, we support one postdoc, one graduate student, and trained a total of two undergraduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sang-Heon Shim"
