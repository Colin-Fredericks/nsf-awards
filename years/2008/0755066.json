 "awd_abstract_narration": "SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a 4-5 week education and research program in field-based applied geophysics.  The program has existed for 25 years and involves about 25-30 graduate and undergraduate students per year.  The program includes instruction in applied geophysics, and seismic, gravity, magnetic, and electromagnetic field data collection.  Students at SAGE participate in every phase of a geophysical research program including data collection, data analysis, processing, modeling and interpretation; and they present their results in both oral and written form.  This 5-year project supports the NSF REU students (15 per year) in the summer field program (4 weeks) and in a one-week follow-up workshop designed to extend and enhance the students? research experiences through additional analyses of the data collected during the summer.  REU students at SAGE come from a variety of institutions ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities.  Student career goals are solidified from information and experiences included in SAGE through the significant participation of industry, government, national laboratory and academic professionals. The follow-up workshop is also used to provide additional professional development of the REU students through assisting them in preparation of an oral or poster presentation of research results to be given at a future professional meeting.  Support for about ten of the REU students to attend a professional meeting is included in the project.",

The core program is held for four weeks each summer in New Mexico and for an additional week in the following academic year for U.S. undergraduates supported by NSF.  Each year 25-30 students participate in SAGE after being selected from a wide range of large and small colleges and universities.  Since SAGE was initiated in 1983, 790 students have participated in the program.  NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) funding for SAGE began in 1990 and 360 REU students have completed SAGE through 2013.  The SAGE program is conducted by the SAGE faculty &ndash; 8-10 university professors and scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and industry.  In addition to the NSF REU funding for SAGE, significant support is provided to the program by industry affiliates and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Foundation.  The main goals of SAGE are: 1) teach students the major geophysical exploration methods (seismic, gravity, magnetics, electromagnetics), 2) engage the students in meaningful research projects in the Rio Grande rift area of northern New Mexico by applying the geophysical methods to the solution of specific research problems (environmental, archaeological, hydrologic, geologic structure and stratigraphy), 3) integration of the geophysical results with geology, 4) provide the students with geophysical field data collection and teamwork experiences, 5) present career options and opportunities for networking with professionals in geophysics, and, 6) provide students with opportunities for additional professional development through presentations of their research results at professional meetings.\nFor the project period 2008-2013 (five years of NSF REU funding plus a one-year no-cost extension), 113 undergraduate REU students completed the SAGE program.  These students were selected for the program though competitive applications and came from 55 different colleges and universities, including both large and small institutions.  All except two of these students have now successfully completed their undergraduate degrees, and the two that have not graduated are expected to by May, 2015.  About 75% of the students have continued their studies in graduate school and many who completed the program in the earlier years are now employed in geosciences careers or are continuing their graduate program toward a PhD degree.  During the project period, sixty eight of the REU students were coauthors on published abstracts reporting their research results and fifty five of these students attended a professional meeting to present their work in talks or poster presentations.  \nFrom 2008-2013, SAGE has conducted seismic, electromagnetic, gravity, and magnetic studies each year in the Rio Grande rift area of northern New Mexico.  Since 2012, the SAGE program (with NSF and Department of Energy funding) has also investigated the geothermal potential of the study area.  In these geophysical studies, the participants in the program have imaged significant geologic faults (fault offsets as large as 3000 meters) in the area using processed seismic reflection data, and electromagnetic and gravity data computer modeling.  These techniques have also been used to study the sedimentary basins associated with the RGR and been used to delineate b..."
