 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing demand on memory performance by multi-core processors, the memory subsystem has become a new thermal concern along with the processor and the hard disk drive.  To address this emerging issue, this project addresses several new, system-level Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) schemes that coordinate the DRAM thermal management with the processor performance throttling, such as dynamically adjusting the number of active processor cores or scaling the processor's frequency and voltage level based on the memory thermal status.  The project also studies coordinated thermal management schemes that consider the thermal requirements from both the processor and the memory subsystem.  Thermal-aware OS job scheduling is further considered to smooth memory traffic and DRAM heat generation over time by mixing jobs with different memory demands appropriately.  In addition, thermal-aware page allocation is proposed to avoid unbalanced overheating from some memory chips by considering the location of each chip and the memory access demand of each application. These schemes will first be evaluated using simulation and then implemented in OS kernels and evaluated on real systems.  To support the memory thermal studies, a simple and accurate thermal model is proposed to estimate the dynamic temperature changes of DRAM memory subsystems. A two-level simulator will be developed to emulate the thermal behavior of memory subsystems. Successfully addressing the thermal concern of memory subsystems will not only ensure safe system operations but also improve the overall system performance, reduce the system manufacturing cost, and improve the system power efficiency.",
