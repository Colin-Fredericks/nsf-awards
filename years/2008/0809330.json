 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI will investigate the nature of point defects and related transport properties in (Mg,Fe)O such as diffusion and electrical conductivity. (Mg,Fe)O is one of the major minerals in the Earth's lower mantle and these properties are key to the understanding of the dynamics of the lower mantle. A particularly important issue is the role of oxidation state and of hydrogen in controlling these properties. A review of existing literature suggests that the role of hydrogen in controlling these properties in (Mg,Fe)O is likely very different and pressure dependent. Through a systematic study of point defect-related properties, the PI and his team will obtain the first data set to understand the transport properties of the largest part of Earth's mantle.\r\n",
