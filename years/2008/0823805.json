 "awd_abstract_narration": "From: Gerry Lucovsky\r\n10 June 2008\r\nRef: Proposal 00823805\r\n\r\nShort Abstract \r\ni) Objective and Approach: The objectives of this research are to provide a science base for optimization of scaled Ge CMOS devices by reducing defects at Ge dielectric interfaces, and to minimize low-K interfacial transition regions that limit equivalent oxide thickness scaling. The approach includes optimization of wet chemical pre-deposition cleaning, nitride passivation of Ge surfaces to prevent subcutaneous oxidation during high-K dielectric depositions, advanced spectroscopic techniques to monitor evolution of N from buried interfaces during post deposition anneals, and spectroscopic and electrical studies comparing interfacial and bulk defects. \r\nii) Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will extend nano-CMOS devices to the 11 nm 2022 processing node by developing device-quality Ge-dielectric interfaces without native Ge oxide, nitride and oxynitride interfacial transition regions. Integration of nano-scale Hf Ge oxynitride interfacial layers will reduce attainable EOT scaling by eliminating lower-K SiON interfacial layers on Si substrates. In-house cathodoluminescence and spectroscopic ellipsometry plus synchrotron XAS and XPS will distinguish between pre-existing, and processing and stress induced defects. Exploratory studies will evaluate a similar approach for compound semiconductor substrates.\r\niii) Broader Impact: This project will expand the Research Experience for High School Women program to include women from Columbus area high schools, including summer research opportunities on the OSU campus. With support from the College of Engineering, the Women in Engineering Program, and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, an expanded program will include local high school junior-level science teachers, selecting highly motivated and talented women and pairing them with OSU engineering faculty. Similar programs will be implemented at NCSU. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
