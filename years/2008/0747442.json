 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participatory  sensing  is  a  revolutionary   paradigm  where\r\npeople sense  their  environment, and  voluntarily share  this\r\ninformation using  pre-existing  communication  infrastructure.  It\r\nhas tremendous potential to  advance  knowledge   in  diverse fields\r\nincluding urban  planning and  intelligent  transportation by enabling\r\nlarge-scale sensing without dedicated infrastructure. Achieving this\r\npotential hinges on  encouraging  sensor  data  sharing  between users\r\nwho may not trust each other. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to design and implement a trustworthy\r\nparticipatory sensing  system, encompassing algorithms for (i)\r\ncertifying the integrity of published sensory content, so users can\r\ntrust it, (ii) sensory content protection, so more users contribute\r\ndata, and (iii) anonymous content sharing between producers and\r\nconsumers. It explores a novel  approach  for  trustworthy\r\nparticipatory  sensing  with a trusted  hardware  platform for each\r\nsensor, which besides the main processor, has a tamper-proof trusted\r\nhardware element that only executes code signed by a trusted third\r\nparty. This recasts the integrity and privacy problems in a new way,\r\nallowing for simple, scalable and versatile solutions. Such a system can\r\ncurb potential abuse, encourage user participation and thereby enable\r\nparticipatory sensing.\r\n\r\nExpected project results include a new system model and algorithms for\r\ntrustworthy participatory sensing, an implementation on the Intel AMT\r\nplatform, and system demonstration in a real-world intelligent\r\ntransportation application. The results will be disseminated via\r\nopen-source software, conference publications and exhibits at the Oregon\r\nMuseum of Science and Industry.  The project also consists of\r\nmulti-level educational activities to promote under-represented groups\r\nin computing.\r\n",
