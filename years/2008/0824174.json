 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to help transform the power grid into a smart and controllable grid, helping to regulate the voltage at select nodes, and the current in specific branches, while improving the grid stability margin. The approach is through the use of a new type of Flexible AC Transmission or FACTS device - the Controllable Network Transformer, a device that can provide dynamic amplitude and phase-angle control capability for existing generators and load-tap changing transformers on the grid by using a newly proposed concept of Virtual Quadrature Sources. The techniques will be explored using analysis and simulation, as well as through experimental validation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe basic mechanisms of grid control have remained unchanged for over 70 years. Significant operating margins are needed to assure grid stability under dynamic operating conditions and during system faults. It is anticipated that Controllable Network Transformers based on Virtual Quadrature Sources will provide a new method for achieving dynamic control of amplitude and phase angle for node voltages on the grid. This will improve controllability and stability of the system. The use of computational intelligence and conventional state-estimation based techniques will be compared. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nGrid control is a key factor in improving asset utilization and reducing energy cost. It is anticipated that broader deployment of smart and controllable devices on the power grid will improve the reliability, controllability and utilization of the grid, supporting economic development, allowing increased penetration of renewable energy resources, and reducing the overall cost of electricity.",
