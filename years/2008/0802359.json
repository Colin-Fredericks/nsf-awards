 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposed here seeks (1) to undertake a rigorous and thorough analysis of the issues invlved in delevolping an adequate supply and demand profile for middle and high school mathematics and science teaching; (2) identify the estent to which the currewnt research base is adequate or inadequate to inform that profile; and (3) develop a protocol, grounded in the research to the extentpossible, to help states and post-secondary institutions gauge the true curretn and projet need for mathematics and scienceteachers and the ability to the state's institutions and teacher supply practis to meet those needs.  This work needs to be delveloped as soon as possiblein order to help states and institutions derive maximum benefit from their stepped up efforts to address the shrotage of science and mathematics teachers, as well as from new federal funding that will flow from the america COMPETES act that has nowbeen signed into law.  In addition, the proposed project is seen as a core element of a more comprehensive National Association of State Universities and Land Grant colleges (NASULGC) initiative on science and mathematics teacher education, and the timely commencement and omptletion of the work envisioned in the project is critical to the progress and ultimate success of that initiative.  The larger initiative also provied important leverage, asnotedbelow, for the dissemination and application of the tools and analysis the project aims to develop.",
