 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, state-of-the-art scanning probe microscopy (SPM) will be employed to advance current understanding of structure-property relationships in organic semiconductors. Specifically, new SPM techniques under development at the University of Minnesota will allow correlation of structural and electrostatic complexity in polycrystalline organic semiconductor films. This information will be critical for understanding the impact of structure on charge transport and for defining strategies to improve the performance of organic semiconductors in plastic electronics applications. In terms of human resources, this project will result in the training of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdocs in the materials science of organic semiconductors, thin films, structure characterization, electronics, and scanning probe microscopy. The PIs will also undertake outreach and education activities, including the development of new undergraduate laboratory exercises emphasizing materials characterization by SPM, and the organization and hosting of SPM workshops at the University of Minnesota for representatives from local industry. These significant outreach efforts will expand the impact of the proposal beyond the specific scientific accomplishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, high resolution scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) will be used to image films of so-called \"organic semiconductors\". These materials are essentially plastics that conduct electricity and can be used to fabricate flexible electronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), transistors, and solar cells. The new microscopy studies will determine the link between electrical performance of the films and film structure on lengths scales spanning 10 nanometers to 1 millimeter. This kind of microscopy information is critical to understanding how to improve the organic semiconductor films for plastic electronics applications. In terms of human resources, this project will result in the training of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral fellows in the materials science of organic semiconductors, thin films, structure characterization, electronics, and scanning probe microscopy. The PIs will also undertake outreach and education activities, including the development of new undergraduate laboratory exercises emphasizing materials characterization by SPM, and the organization and hosting of SPM \"hands-on\" workshops at the University of Minnesota for representatives from local industry. These significant outreach efforts will expand the impact of the proposal beyond the specific scientific accomplishments.\r\n\r\n",
