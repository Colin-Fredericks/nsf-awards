The methods and analysis will focus on the control of non-point source pollution of Cannonsville watershed which provides freshwater supply to New York City.  The intellectual merit of this proposal is derived from a very well characterized watershed. The PI and her group are well-qualified to carry out this ambitious project. The optimization routines are extensions of their previous work and may provide tools that speed up and reduce the cost of management procedures one of the major strengths of this excellent proposal is that the time frame extends significantly in the future (2078) so that long term trends are taken into account. The efforts to develop and extend their modeling approach are easily justified considering the need to apply such models nationwide (and likely a major effort in the Water Network).  The dynamic modeling of Cannonsville watershed as proposal will also provide a test bed for future efforts as climate change affects the region. It is possible that with time the water input functions (rain) will change as may the vegetative cover. Therefore, I could envision that this modeling effort will evolve with time, as it should. In particular, the Cannonsville watershed area might provide the 'model' watershed to study so that when the model is exported to other area, the water quality monitoring can be optimized (that is the minimum number of monitoring sites employed) to maximize the data necessary for watershed modeling. If this proposal is only successful for this on watershed then it will be a success. The section of broader impacts of the proposal is also excellent and could serve a model for others.\r\n",

This brief report will focus on algorithms and only on the application to the Cannonsville Watershed, a 1200 km2 basin, which provides a large fraction of New York City\u00c6s drinking water (Figure 1). As in many lakes, algal growth is promoted by phosphorous.\n\nIf the algal concentration is high in the Cannonsville Reservoir, NY City needs to build an expensive (at least $8 billion) filtration plant to remove the algae from the drinking water.  Because of the great economic impact, we need to quantify the impact of different management methods in whole watershed system.\n\n The first step is to select a model and gather watershed data including land use/soil type distribution, weather time series, current management schemes, and time series of pollutant concentrations in contributing rivers.  This information is input to the model (like SWAT by USDA scientists) that describes how watershed water moves and carries or stores phosphorous.  Figure 2 uses colors to describe spatial distribution of different land uses, which vary greatly in the amount of phosphorous produced per acre.\n\nThe analysis of a watershed includes attempts to: a) understand the hydrologic processes, b) forecast the future, and c) evaluate alternative management schemes for phosphorous controls.   This requires we calibrate the model to provide a good description (e.g. similar to historical data) of the phosphorous load as a function of a time series of precipitation and other weather factors and the management schemes.\n\nPhD student Josh Woodbury and PI Shoemaker did the primary work on the analysis of the Cannonsville watershed done in this project.  In the first paper, we developed (with two colleagues) a variable source area hydrology model of the Cannonsville watershed and compared it to a standard SWAT model. This resulted in a journal paper that compared the traditional SWAT model versus our model that incorporated soil wetness classes to approximate variable source area flow (Woodbury et al, JWRA, 2013).

We also used the mixture model to assess value of management practices for reducing phosphorous pollution. Our models indicated that phosphorous loading will increase over time even with a constant population of people and cows in the watershed.  (Woodbury and Shoemaker, ASCE JWRPM2013)  Figure 3 indicates the differences between alternative management practices.\n\nAll the analyses discussed above require that the model parameters be adjusted so that the model forecasts are appropriate for the specific site being modeled.  This  requires thousands of simulations of the model, which can take months of  computer calculations  if a direct trial and error approach is used, which is often not feasible for practical management problems.\n\nPart of the effort in this project has been to develop computer algorithms which perform optimization more quickly and accurately so that model parameter estimation (as well as other engineering problems) can be solved much more quickly.  Those methods were used extensively in Cannonsville watershed analyses discussed above.  The work in this project by Singh (PhD thesis, 2011) developed single objective optimization algorithms and by Akhtar (PhD thesis in progress, 2013) developed mul..."
