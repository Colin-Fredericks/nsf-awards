 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Program: MRI PI: Pallavi Dhagat\r\nMRI: Acquisition of a Laser Lithography Tool\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop low-cost electronics, sensors for medical diagnostics and environmental safety, and novel solid-state memory devices. The approach is to use direct write or maskless lithography techniques for rapid and inexpensive prototyping of device designs. Thus, the acquisition of a laser lithography tool capable of directly writing patterns on a photo-resist coated substrate is proposed. Presently, there is no equivalent tool at any of the Pacific Northwest universities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research spans diverse areas, including fabrication of transparent and printed electronic circuits, investigation of electrical properties of carbon nanotubes, and understanding of the physics of surface acoustic waves in magnetic thin films. The equipment proposed for acquisition is ideally suited to support research needs at a university - it provides economical, sub-micron lithography with ease of use and maintenance.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The tool will be designated as a shared resource, available to regional academic institutions and small businesses for research and education. It will facilitate a broad range of research activities in the microfabrication of electronic, fluidic and mechanical devices. Graduate and undergraduate students assisting in the cleanroom will gain experience in mask design, layout and fabrication. The equipment is also indispensable to the educational innovations, including micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication, planned in the undergraduate microprocessing laboratories. The principal investigators will participate in the summer outreach programs coordinated by Oregon State University to expose high-school and under-represented minority students to microfabrication tools and techniques.",
