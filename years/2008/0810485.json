 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research project will demonstrate the feasibility of inexpensive high-resolution tunable terahertz (THz) receivers based on electron-heating in semiconductor nanodevices. The nanosensor will be composed of a low-mobility channel shaped from a Aluminum Gallium Arsenide/Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs/GaAs) two-dimensional electron gas. The proposed tunable inexpensive heterodyne detector (mixer) will operate at moderate cooling temperatures (~77K) within the 0.3-30 THz range. The proposed device will have the advantages of low noise, broad spectral coverage, technological compatibility of the detector with available solid-state local oscillators. The proposed system will provide critical information on the status of atmosphere, aid in the demarcation of pollutions, and monitor the progress of cleanup efforts. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the concept of the proposed system is that it is very flexible and could be applied to a variety of chemical and biological contaminants. Besides environmental monitoring, the proposed receiver can be used for screening of personnel and handheld materials. THz screening is non-invasive and non-destructive for living beings. Explosives and biological agents can be detected and identified even if concealed in clothing and suitcases because the THz radiation is transmitted through clothing and luggage.\r\n",
