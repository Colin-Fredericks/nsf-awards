 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the design and building of\r\na knowledge base (KB) system that\r\nlearns to more accurately integrate the many heterogeneous sources of\r\ninformation that are relevant to a single scientist's research needs.\r\nThe system works by loosely integrating data of many sorts (including\r\nunstructured text) into a single typed directed graph, and then\r\nquerying the graph using a query language that allows \"schema-free\r\nsimilarity queries\".  These queries specify a set of query terms\r\n(e.g. keywords, entities in the KB, etc) and constraints on the\r\ndesired output (e.g. a target data type). The result of a query is a\r\nranked list of KB entities, ordered by similarity to the query terms.\r\n\r\nAfter a query, a user can optionally label any subset of the ranked\r\nlist of suggested answers as ``relevant'' or ``non-relevant''.  These\r\nlabels drive a learning phase, the goal of which is to produce a\r\nbetter ranking.  Types of learning currently being investigated\r\ninclude EM-based parameter turning, learning to discriminatively\r\nre-rank, and learning to restructure the graph (by adding or deleting\r\nedges or vertexes).  Queries collected in the laboratory of working\r\nbiologists are used to evaluate these learning methods.\r\n\r\nThe broadest impact of this project is on the problem of learning to\r\nintegrate heterogeneous data sources (including free text and\r\nstructured data). However, if successful, the KB system will have\r\nbroad impact in the biological research community; in particular, we\r\nbelieve that adaptive personal KB systems of this sort will be a\r\nvaluable complement to existing biological KBs.\r\n\r\nFurther information on this project can be found at\r\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/querendipity/\r\n\r\n",
