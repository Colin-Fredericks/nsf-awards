 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Computational Models for Evaluating Long Term\r\nCO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key goal of this project is to produce a prototypical\r\ncomputational system to accurately predict the fate of injected CO2\r\nin conditions governed by multiphase flow, rock mechanics,\r\nmulticomponent transport, thermodynamic phase behavior, chemical\r\nreactions within both the fluid and the rock, and the coupling of all\r\nthese phenomena over multiple time and spatial scales.\r\nTo tackle this grand challenge effort, a multidisciplinary research\r\nteam has been assembled of senior researchers M. F. Wheeler,\r\nT. Arbogast, and M. Delshad of the Center for Subsurface Modeling\r\nand I. Duncan from the Bureau of Economic Geology  at The\r\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, as well as M. Parashar of\r\nthe Applied Software Systems Laboratory at Rutgers University. This\r\ngroup has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computational\r\nscience that includes multiscale and multiphysics algorithms, solvers,\r\nuncertainty, and optimization (2) computer science\r\nthat includes dynamic adaptivity, model/code couplings, and data\r\nmanagement and transport (3) compositional modeling and\r\nCO2 injection processes and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.\r\nIn each of the third and fourth years of the project, we will\r\nhost a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high school\r\nstudents, and undergraduate students with an interest in high school\r\nteaching. We will provide training in the use of a sophisticated groundwater\r\nsimulator, to be used as a tool to engage and pique the interest of\r\nhigh schoolers, perhaps leading some to careers in mathematics, the\r\nsciences, and interdisciplinary work.  In addition, two postdoctoral\r\nstudents and roughly two graduate students will be supported\r\nthroughout the project.\r\n\r\nGeologic sequestration is a proven means of permanent CO2 greenhouse gas\r\nstorage, but it is difficult to design and manage such efforts.  Predictive\r\ncomputational simulation may be the only means to account for the lack of\r\ncomplete characterization of the subsurface environment, the multiple scales of\r\nthe various interacting processes, the large areal extent of saline aquifers,\r\nand the need for long time predictions.  This proposal will investigate high\r\nfidelity multiscale and multiphysics algorithms necessary for simulation of\r\nmultiphase flow and transport coupled with geochemical reactions and related\r\nmineralogy, and geomechanical deformation in porous media to predict changes in\r\nrock properties during sequestration.  The work will result in a prototypical\r\ncomputational framework with advanced numerical algorithms and underlying\r\ntechnology for research in CO2 applications, which has been validated and\r\nverified against field-scale experimental tests.  The multidisciplinary\r\nresearch team has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computational\r\nscience, (2) computer science and engineering, (3) compositional modeling and\r\nCO2 injection processes, and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.\r\nIn each of the third and fourth years of the project, we will\r\nhost a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high school\r\nstudents, and undergraduate students with an interest in high school\r\nteaching.
