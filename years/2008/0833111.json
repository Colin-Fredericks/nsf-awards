 "awd_abstract_narration": "This scholarship program is recruiting freshmen and sophomore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors to become credentialed secondary STEM teachers through a collaborative effort by the WV University College of Human Resources and Education, Eberly College of Arts and Sciences, the WV Center for Professional Development, and the WV Regional Education Service Agencies (RESA) III, V, VII, and VIII. The project provides scholarships for 20 students to complete the Benedum Collaborative Five-year teacher education program. Scholarship recipients earn a STEM bachelor's degree, as well as a master's degree in education upon completing the program. The program objectives are to: 1) Increase retention of students who traditionally leave STEM majors; 2) Attract freshmen and sophomore students to elementary and secondary STEM teacher certification; 3) Provide a continuum of mentoring services through collaborative advising from STEM content mentors and STEM education mentors; 4) Increase the number of graduates with 5-12 STEM education certification, and 5) provide a supportive environment for the new teachers. The pedagogical strategies, specifically teaching science content in the context of societal issues through Science, Technology and Society (STS) approaches, appeal to underrepresented groups, thus expanding the pool of those who could potentially become interested in STEM fields. A focus on the need for 5-12 STEM teachers, along with assignments to encourage STEM students to \"think like teachers\", are utilized to encourage these students' interest in teaching as a career.",

Students received $10,000 per year (up to three years) and agreed to teach for two years per each year of funding (up to six years) in West Virginia middle or high schools, all of which qualify as high need. The project supported students in two programs: the Benedum Collaborative Five-year teacher education program (a 5 year master&rsquo;s program) and the Post-Baccalaureate Program in Secondary Science Education (generally students received a master&rsquo;s). As part of their Noyce program, the TEACH-WV Scholars engaged in a mentoring project with faculty in the math, biology, chemistry, physics and women&rsquo;s and gender studies departments in the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences and the science and math teacher training programs in the College of Education and Human Services. The projects trained the Noyce Scholars in one or more of the following areas: aligning K12 and college science and math teaching, interdisciplinary teaching to link science and math, enhancement of active learning, linking science and math with issues of societal relevance, encouraging interest in teaching as a career and other best practices to enhance student outcomes. Scholars&rsquo; projects included collecting survey data to identify high school students&rsquo; readiness for and perceived barriers to college; conducting literature reviews and examining teacher use of interdisciplinary teaching strategies; designing and implementing &ldquo;Math In the News&rdquo; segments; partnering with a microbiologist to develop an active learning exercise, implementing a NASA rocket building activity with Upward Bound students, assisting in an &ldquo;Art and Bots&rdquo; outreach program, surveying high school and college math instructors on their perceptions of student needs to transition to college, and providing NASA based professional development for in-service teachers in aviation and 3D printing. The program supported twenty-seven students (the original goal had been twenty). As of June 2015, twenty-three had successfully completed the Noyce program, their teacher training programs and became certified, one anticipates graduation and certification this year and another three did not fulfill the requirements (one left the program due to medical reasons, one did not meet requirements for completion, and one completed her program and became certified but did not complete a science major). Fifteen are currently teaching in WV, potentially impacting the education of over 14,000 students. Another three are teaching out of state and seeking employment in WV. At the end of the program, an evaluator interviewed the Scholars to examine the impact of the program. She found that fourteen of the fifteen teaching in WV would have taught in the state without the award but that the Scholarship validated this choice, added prestige and made it easier financially as neighboring states offer higher salaries. She also found that some continued to apply things they learned in the mentoring projects to their teaching and many valued the relationships they developed with WVU faculty through the program. Interviews with the Noyce project team revealed that the project had catalyzed the development of other programs to enhance science and math education at both the college and K12 levels, including development of a four year science and math certification program expected to enable WVU to produce more science and math majors certified to teach K12.
