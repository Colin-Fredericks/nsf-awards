 "awd_abstract_narration": "Towards a neuro-mechanical memory element\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to explore whether a neuro-mechanical synapse can be formed by interfacing a neuron cell with a silicon substrate. It is based on our recent finding that mechanical force applied at a neuromuscular synapse of Drosophila (fruit fly) embryos produces neuronal memory. This mechano-sensing ability of neurons is likely rooted in evolutionarily conserved properties of cells. It has thus the potential to apply to neuro-silico interfaces. The approach to this goal are: (1) investigate whether mechanically applied tension on a neuron using a silicon probe can be transduced into information that can be captured, e.g., as an image; (2) functionalize the probe to explore whether synapse can be engineered, and (3) explore whether engineered synapse can attain usage dependent force sensitive memory. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The study will shed light, for the first time, on whether (and how) nature employs mechanical tension to store and process information in an analogue fashion. It then attempts to translate the knowledge to engineer a neuro-mechanical synapse. If this possibility is realized, it will be a breakthrough in the engineering of learning and memory into synthetic systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: This study will lay the foundation for creating networks of synthetic cells that could learn and remember patterns and share that knowledge with devices and sensors. The knowledge will be integrated with education through (1) development of a new course on neuro-mechanics (2) student seminars, (3) hands on teaching modules at the local Children?s Science Museum, and (4) web page development. \r\n\r\n",
