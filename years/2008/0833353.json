 "awd_abstract_narration": "California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) in partnership with three local school districts (Santa Maria Bonita School District (SMBSD), Santa Maria Joint Union High School District (SMJUHSD), Lucia Mar Unified School District (LMUSD) is supporting 30 Noyce Scholars recruited from the large pool of science and engineering undergraduates at Cal Poly.  The Cal Poly Science Noyce Scholars program is collaborating with a Noyce Scholars program in Mathematics at Cal Poly, adding value to the experience for both math and science Noyce Scholars and creating a community of Noyce Scholars at Cal Poly focused on issues related to teaching in high-need school districts.  The Scholars are mentored by university faculty and experienced classroom teachers to prepare them for success in teaching in high-need school district settings. The project is also promoting the creation of undergraduate cohorts of Noyce Scholars who prepare for teaching much sooner in their academic careers by tutoring students, helping to teach inquiry-based modules in science classrooms, and helping students with science fair projects. The broader impact of this program is that Science Noyce Scholars leave Cal Poly to teach throughout the state of California strongly committed and better prepared to serving as science teachers in high-need school districts. Noyce Scholars serve as role models and educational leaders who ultimately encourage many of their own students to pursue degrees and careers in STEM disciplines.  Noyce Scholars from this program motivate and recruit students from within high-need districts to become the next generation of Noyce Scholars.",
