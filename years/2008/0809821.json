 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will yield new fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry of electroless metallization onto polymeric surfaces (EMPS). Despite widespread industrial use, the surface chemistry of EMPS remains poorly understood, so its application is largely confined to bulk-part fabrication. In particular, it is not known how chemical and physical parameters affect and may be used to control the nano-scale morphologies and properties of electrolessly plated metal. The investigation will enable EMPS to be developed beyond its current status of \"dark art\" into a precise enabling process for emerging micro and nano-scale technologies with quantitative predictability and control. In addition to these intellectual merits, the project is focuses on a single EMPS system the deposition of silver onto the cross-linked epoxide \"SU8\" and involves an integrated program of preparative chemistry, nano-scale surface analysis, and simulation. This approach will allow the team to generate deep fundamental understanding of silver EMPS, yet the understanding gained will apply broadly to other electroless metallization systems.\r\n\r\n    The project will broadly impact science, engineering, and education by contributing significantly to our quantitative understanding of fundamental surface chemical and dynamical processes. This knowledge will elevate EMPS to a widely applied, enabling process for myriad emerging and high-impact technologies, including micro and nano-scale device fabrication, heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and even diagnostic and clinical medicine. The project provides an outstanding context for interdisciplinary research training, teaching, and outreach. Young scientists will develop a unique set of skills, ready to increase the competitiveness of the United States in chemistry, surface science, materials science, and nanotechnology. The program directly supports the growth of a new chemistry PhD program at UCF. The PIs have built diverse groups that actively involve graduates and undergraduates from varied backgrounds, including historically underrepresented groups. These students will bring their excitement for science directly to Central Florida schools through a newly established peer-to-peer outreach program that will help attract middle school and community college students to science and engineering careers.\r\n",
