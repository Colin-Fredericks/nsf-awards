 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary:  \r\n\r\nUltrafast laser spectroscopy is increasingly becoming an indispensable tool for studying the properties of materials.  However, currently available instruments are still limited in their ability to routinely probe the diversity of materials used in multidisciplinary studies over a broad spectral range with sufficient signal-to-noise and temporal resolution to detect small changes which underlie fundamental processes. This project aims to develop a broad spectral range, ultra-low noise, ultrafast optical spectroscopy instrument suitable for multidisciplinary research.   The instrument will incorporate many innovations including significant improvements in signal-to-noise (over 10-fold), wavelength range (far-IR to UV), and temporal resolution (less than 35 femtoseconds).   The new laser spectroscopy instrument will be applicable to a broad range of multidisciplinary problems including quasiparticle dynamics in multifunctional materials, band gaps in carbon nanotubes, molecular events in biological energy conversion, ultrafast response of heme proteins to light, and the structure of biological polymers such as mucin.  The proposed instrument will be developed and operated out of the Boston University Photonics Center, a national resource for development of advanced photonic prototype devices for commercial applications as well as providing a center for excellence in teaching and training in advanced photonics technology.  The core faculty involved in this project will use the instrument to enhance outreach programs to assure the maximum opportunity for training and research by a diverse population of students.  \r\n\r\nLayman Summary:  \r\n\r\nUltrafast lasers produce pulses which are short enough to monitor the motion of electrons and atoms in materials. Such fundamental motions, occurring on a timescale approximately one million times faster than the operating speed of modern desktop computers, determine the functional properties of materials. Hence, ultrafast laser spectroscopy is increasingly becoming an indispensable tool for studying the properties of materials.  However, currently available instruments are still limited in their ability to probe the diversity of materials used in multidisciplinary studies. This project aims to develop a next generation ultrafast optical spectroscopy instrument.  Several innovations enabling significant improvements in speed and sensitivity will make it possible to explore a range of important multidisciplinary problems including the behavior of advanced multifunctional materials, the properties of carbon nanotubes, molecular events in biological energy conversion and the structure of biological polymers such as mucin.  The proposed instrument will be developed and operated out of the Boston University Photonics Center, a national resource for development of advanced photonic prototype devices for commercial applications as well as providing a center for excellence in teaching and training in advanced photonics technology.  The core faculty involved in this project will use the instrument to enhance outreach programs to assure the maximum opportunity for training and research by a diverse population of students.",
