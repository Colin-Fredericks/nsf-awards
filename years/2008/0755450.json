 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at the University of Wyoming will host a three-year REU-site program for sophomores and junior engineering, science, or mathematics majors.  The site will create a stimulating environment for in-depth  exploration of significant mathematical problems, and will encourage  students to pursue graduate education and/or careers in mathematically oriented fields through an extended field trip to  the  National Center for Atmospheric Research,  presentations and activities from representatives of the National Security Agency,  and discussions with graduate students and \r\neach REU-participant  will  engage a significant mathematical problem in depth, practice communicating technical ideas orally amongst team members and in formal presentations, and  produce a well-written  report.  It is expected that in some cases the student teams will produced refereed journal articles as a result of their summer projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed REU-site will  (a) broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by actively recruiting women and minorities, and by  will provide new opportunities for  students in the Rocky Mountain  region who currently have few regional REU opportunities, and many of whom are schools without a strong research or graduate program emphasis, (b)  encourage student participants to pursue graduate education and/or careers in mathematically oriented fields through meaningful research experiences, and professional development, and (c) strengthen existing collaborations between universities and   colleges in the Rocky Mountain region, and relations between  the University of Wyoming and both NCAR and NSA.\r\n",
