 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Donald Land of the University of California at Davis. Prof. Land's research program focuses on the development of an overlayer-enhanced attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (OE-ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy technique for the study of solid interfaces that are immersed in aqueous fluids.  This technique offers unique complementary capabilities to currently used surface spectroscopic methods like surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) and Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) Spectroscopy.   Prof. Land and his students will perform detailed experimental and modeling studies to optimize the performance of this unique spectroscopy to facilitate its applications for the characterization of biomolecules that are adsorbed to the surface of thin films. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a spectroscopic method development project with the potential to greatly impact studies involving interactions between biomolecules on surfaces and at interfaces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            After several years of optimization using small and well-defined systems (self-assembled monolayers - SAMs, avidin/biotin, IgG, etc.), we turned to the study of supported lipid films with incorporated membrane-bound biomolecules.  The method produces vibrational spectra of exceptional quality for small fractions of a monolayer of material, while immersed in aqueous solution.  Because lipid films are well-ordered, even in the \"liquid\" phases, the absorption bands are relatively narrow compared to other solution species.  This allows one to resolve very subtle changes in peak position, bandwidth, and intensity, which, in turn, yields information about rather subtle, but important changes in the films and to biomolecules bound to them.\n\n Of primary importance, we show, for the first time anywhere, vibrational spectra for biomolecules bound in the phospholipid membranes of supported unilamellar vesicles.  We show changes to the structure of the beta barrel of pore proteins with changing lipid structures (bilayers, rHDLs, vesicles), including varying cholesterol concentrations.  We show changes to lipid structure upon incorporation of gangliosides.  And we show how one can use surface modification along with kinetic stabilization to produce metastable (half-lives of many hours), intact vesicles on supports that would otherwise cause rupture and formation of planar bilayers. \n\n Additonal results show the spectroscopic technique can also be used to monitor the growth of polymer chains from initiator molecules tethered to the metal film optic. Polystyrene films growing by atom transfer radical polymerization are observed to grow at a rate limited by diffusion, initially, but later, mass transfer through the growing film limits the growth rate.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald P Land"
