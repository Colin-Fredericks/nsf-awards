 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit.\r\nBy providing the opportunity for participating undergraduate students to display the\r\nresults of their creative academic activities at the national level, the Symposium, which is\r\nspecifically dedicated to recognize and celebrate the students' exceptional work, is one of the\r\nmost effective means to motivate these students and intellectually stimulate their further interest\r\nin graduate education. The symposium will give participating students a chance to discuss their\r\nresearch projects and exchange ideas with other students, graduate researchers, faculty and\r\nprofessional scientists. In addition students will practice presentation skills and gain invaluable\r\nexperience presenting research at a premiere, national level, professional scientific conference.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.\r\nThe symposium will serve to provide recognition to outstanding undergraduate students\r\nin polymer science and engineering, to foster networking and exposure, to introduce\r\nopportunities in graduate research and education and to help develop the careers of future leaders\r\nin both academia and industry. The symposium will also offer an occasion for students and\r\nsupervising faculty to witness how student projects enhance faculty research and also serve the\r\ngreater community. Additionally, it will provide motivation for future generations of\r\nundergraduate students. Those who are not engaged in these pursuits as yet can learn how their\r\nfellow students developed their research interests.\r\n\"When does a scientist become a scientist? It is not when a person knows many facts and\r\neven understands in depth some aspect of the natural world. I would suggest the transition\r\noccurs when curiosity about a phenomenon leads to an inquiry for new knowledge. This can\r\noccur in a person with little or lots of knowledge about a subject. It is an attitude of inquiry\".",
