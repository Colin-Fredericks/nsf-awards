In particular, support is provided for three of the track at the conference: Assistive Technology, Smart Homes, and Robotics. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the conference arises from the multi-disciplinary approaches to supporting people as they age to maintain community integration and independent living through eight conference tracks: (1) Transportation; (2) Livable Homes and Communities; (3) Injury Prevention; (4) Robotics; (5 ) Smart Homes; (6) Telehealth; (7) Assistive Technology; (8) Work and Aging. Within each of the eight tracks, presentations and posters will reflect one or more of the following: (1) research and development, (2) policy, (3) practice and services, (4) business perspectives and (5) consumer perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of ICADI have been and continue to be synthesizing and translating knowledge about disability and aging, and approaches to maintaining independence and quality of life, while fostering collaborations to support future research in this area. ICADI includes a mix of invited and submitted presentations, poster sessions, and networking opportunities with experts from around the world.  ICADI-2008, as with previous ICADIs, will provide investigators, including those from the NSF Quality of Life Technogy ERC, the opportunity to present their research and development work. At the capacity-building level, ICADI will enhance opportunities for cross-disciplinary and advanced research training in disability and engineering, and rehabilitation-related fields through participation of graduate students, including 20 scholarships, and their mentors. ICADI, through scholarships, provides opportunities for graduate students to present their research, and opportunities for people with disabilities to both present their perspectives and learn more regarding technologies to support independence.\r\n\r\n",
