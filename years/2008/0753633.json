 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of Meso 2008 is to apply Multiscaling and Mesomechanics for the\r\ndevelopment of energy efficient and environment friendly structures and materials. Particular attention will be given to large structures such as buildings, housing and civil engineering structures where much of the primary energy is being consumed by conversion to useful energy such as electricity, heating oil, etc. A selected number of experts with design and construction experience will be invited to lecture on ways for improving the current practice. The interaction should provide an atmosphere of collaboration that is needed to mitigate some of the problems related to the waste of resources causing detrimental effects to the environment. Multiscaling has shown that the behavior of the very small to the very large can be addressed on a common ground by understanding the relations among the bulk and local properties of the materials. The segmented results at the atomic, nano, micro and macro scale appear to be unconnected because the physical laws in each one of the scale ranges can be different. Hence, there are transitional regions where Mesomechanics attempts to fill in the gaps. Co-searching, co-designing and co-producing the best available\r\nsolution for the design and construction of structures and materials is the aim of Meso 2008.\r\n",
