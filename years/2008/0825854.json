 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is aimed at detecting and distinguishing virus serotypes inside silicon capillaries using light interacting with free electrons on structured arrays of nanoparticles.  Arrays are formed by a \u00a1\u00a5bottom-up\u00a1\u00a6 method to provide unique spectral sensitivity and heat dissemination.  Arrays will be tuned to control light-electron interactions using new solution to Maxwell\u00a1\u00a6s Equations and a novel calorimeter to detect viral DNA at ?T10 femtomolar (fM) in ?T10 minutes using ?T10 mW.  The proposed research is expected to develop rapid, inexpensive, virus/DNA sensors to replace existing immunoassays or genotyping methods that are slow, insensitive and capital-intensive. Its technical impact arises from applications of light-electron interactions to develop photonic circuits, high-density magneto-optic data storage, near-field optical microscopy, and terahertz imaging.\r\n\r\nThis investigation will educate two underrepresented graduate students in active nanostructures and biophotonics in a campus-wide initiative to fabricate and analyze nano-scale devices and materials.  Its social impact includes having undergraduates demonstrate sensors in hands-on instructional modules prepared for classroom and hands-on lab experiences for community-college and high-school students as part of a 5-year NSF-sponsored collaboration co-initiated by the PI to double enrollment and retention of students underrepresented in STEM courses.  \r\n",
