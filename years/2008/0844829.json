 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks that have the capabilities of sensing, computation and communication make\r\nan ideal solution for emergency warning systems. Appropriate authorities expect immediate warnings\r\npredicted by such systems. This research designs, implements, and evaluates an energy-efficient and\r\nreal-time data delivery model which can be employed in wireless-sensor-network-based emergency\r\nwarning systems. With the new data delivery model being used in an emergency warning system,\r\nwarnings can be obtained in real time, and network lifetime can be extended.\r\n\r\nDifferent from the traditional 'data collection' and 'data aggregation' methods, this research focuses on\r\nthe stringent requirement of delivering warnings in real-time. Instead of managing a large amount of\r\nraw data, a simpler mechanism for event detection and reporting that can reduce energy consumption as\r\nwell as notification delay is investigated. In addition to the impact on practice, the theoretical analysis\r\non the bounds of energy consumption and notification delay has a strong impact on the theory aspect.\r\nMoreover, this project is a starting point to integrate research and education for the purpose of\r\nattracting both undergraduate and graduate students to the area of wireless sensor networks.",
