 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nXu\r\n\r\nThe project involves studying problems in noncommutative geometry using tools\r\nfrom operator algebras, in particular groupoid C*-algebras. Xu proposes to\r\ncontinue the study of twisted K-theory over differentiable stacks using\r\nKK-theory of C*-algebras, based on the theory developed by Tu,\r\nLaurent, and himself. The problems include studying the periodic cyclic\r\nhomology of convolution algebras of proper Lie groupoids, investigating the\r\nrelation between the twisted K0-group and the Grothendieck group of twisted\r\nvector bundles over groupoids, studying the Chern-Connes character map for\r\ntwisted K-theory, and studying the ring structure on global twisted\r\ncohomology. The project also aims to study C*-algebras associated to\r\nnon-abelian gerbes and 2-groupoids.\r\n\r\nThe idea of noncommutative geometry in the sense of Connes is to study geometry via algebras of functions on ?noncommutative manifolds.?  On such a ?noncommutative manifold,? the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather an associative algebra, which may not be commutative. Nevertheless, many notions in classical (commutative) geometry including vector bundles, connections, K-theory, (co-)homology, elliptic pseudo-differential operators, Chern characters, and measures can be generalized to noncommutative settings arising naturally from geometric situations.  In string theory, space-time is modeled by a new kind of mathematical structure called gerbes. A very useful way to think of the stringy space-time is to consider it as a ?noncommutative space? in the sense of Connes.  Such a noncommutative space can be constructed using the convolution algebra of a certain groupoid.  The project, which is centered on the application of noncommutative geometry and operator algebras, is to investigate questions motivated from mathematical physics by a combination of ideas from algebraic and differential geometry, noncommutative geometry, operator algebras, and KK-theory, and thus the project promotes further interaction between these fields.",
