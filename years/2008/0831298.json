 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber threats have escalated rapidly over the past decade. \"Zero-day\r\nattacks\" have become significant, delivered increasingly through\r\nseemingly innocuous means such as web pages, images, and documents.\r\nMalware is rampant, being installed surreptitiously on millions of\r\ncomputers around the world using a combination of spam, phishing,\r\nmalicious shareware and freeware. \r\n\r\nToday's defenses use techniques such as signature-based scanning and\r\nfile integrity monitoring to detect the presence of malware, and then\r\nremove them. Unfortunately, clever adversaries can quickly develop\r\nmalware that conceals itself from these detection mechanisms, and\r\nhence defeat such reactive defenses. In contrast, this project will\r\ndevelop an approach that dramatically improves defenses against\r\nmalware, and put a computer owner back in control over the\r\nattackers. This approach, based on synthesizing and enforcing\r\nlow-level information flow properties from generic high level\r\npolicies, will be used to identify components of a computer system\r\nthat are critical for its trustworthiness, and preserve their\r\nintegrity. In doing so, the approach will enable users to continue to\r\nuse popular operating systems, applications, and add-on software, while still\r\nassuring system security.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will develop techniques to protect (a) the OS\r\nand critical applications from untrusted code or data, (b) critical\r\napplications from modules and extensions (e.g., browser plug-ins and media\r\nplayer codecs) that run within the same address space, and (c) the OS kernel\r\nfrom damage due to untrusted kernel extensions such as device drivers.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impact, this project will train several graduate\r\nstudents, the research will be integrated into the teaching activities of\r\nthe PIs, and finally, the solutions developed will be distributed as\r\nopen-source software and/or tools.\r\n",
