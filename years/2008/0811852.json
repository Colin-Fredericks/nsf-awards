 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving programmer productivity is a crucial challenge,  \r\nespecially with the emergence of multi- and many-core processors.   \r\nHigh level mathematical equations serve as declarative specifications  \r\nfor a large class of compute- and data- intensive parts of programs.   \r\nThe expressivity of such equations is greatly enhanced when users are allowed to specify collective operations called \"reductions:\"  \r\nassociative and commutative operators applied to sets of values.   \r\nAnother common feature of such equational programs is \"reuse:\" at different points in a set, the same intermediate value is (re)- computed or used.  Certain extremely effective program optimizations are possible when equational programs have both reductions and reuse.   \r\nThese optimizations yield new equations with lower computational complexity (e.g., a quadratic time equation can be transformed into one with linear complexity).  This project investigates how to perform  these simplifications automatically and optimally.    The PIs will develop   and deploy a tool called Reduction Simplification Engine (RSE) that implements such optimizations techniques.  Traditional compiler optimizations simply seek a few percentage points of performance gains, at best a small, constant factor.  On the other hand, the optimizations performed by the RSE have significantly more benefits since they reduce the asymptotic complexity of the program.\r\n",
