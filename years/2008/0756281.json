 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to grow and characterize single crystals of rare earth intermetallics, correlate their structure and properties, and look for new phenomena. The synthesis of these materials in single crystalline form will be addressed as one of the primary driving forces of basic research in the chemistry of new materials. To understand physical properties of novel materials clearly, it is essential to grow crystals that are large (at least 2-5 mm3) and of high quality for the measurement of properties. Training future crystal growers to interact with collaborators in national labs as well with international scientists is vital to advancing materials research. Students involved in this project will continue to be involved in educational activities such as doing hands on demonstrations and developing materials-related demonstrations. The PI will also continue with outreach efforts to under-represented minorities at the high school, undergraduate and graduate level.  \r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThe exchange mechanisms and spin correlations mediated by itinerant electrons have attracted much interest due to the emerging field of spin electronics.  A goal for this project is to grow single crystals of cerium and ytterbium and ytterbium intermetallic phases in the lanthanide-copper-X (X = gallium, tin, antimony) systems in which the phenomena and/or implications of heavy fermion behavior, superconductivity, magnetism and/or magnetoresistance  may be observed and studied.  New families of intermetallics will be investigated with the motivation of correlating structure and properties, in particular uncovering emergent ordered phases arising from quantum fluctuations.  Students will perform hands on demonstrations and will develop materials-related demonstrations for incorporation into Chem Demo programs.  The PI will also develop outreach projects for under-represented minorities at the high school, undergraduate and graduate level.  Students will interact with collaborators in national labs as well with international scientists.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The goal of our research is based on understanding crystal growth process, materials characterization, and the electrical and magnetic properties of Ln-M-X (Ln = lanthanide, M = transition metals; X = main group elements), and has extended to the study of quantum materials.  Using the self-flux synthesis and crystallization method, many new compounds have been discovered.  Single crystals and structures of a number of ternary Ce&ndash;M&ndash;X intermetallics (M = Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, and Pt, and X = Ga, In, Sb and Sn) have been studied:  LnnMIn3n+2, CePdGa6, Ce2PdGa12, Ce2PdGa10, LnNiSb3, LnNi1-xSb2, and Ln3Co4Sn13.   Some of these rare-earth intermetallics display signature behavior such as superconductivity and/or heavy fermion behavior, enhanced magnetic susceptibility with local-moments at high temperatures, intermediate valence, or large magnetoresistance (MR), concepts important in the future of our technological goals.  In addition to intermetallics studied in this group, we have also begun to work with several 1-d antiferromagnetic and frustrated materials.  We have shown in our work that self-flux growth has the potential to grow new materials that enable detailed magnetic, electrical and transport study of novel materials.  In addition to doing chemistry demonstrations at local high schools and elemental schools, we have accomplished our proposed plan and results of this grant supported 8 PhD and 4 undergraduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julia Y Chan"
