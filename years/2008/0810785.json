 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides the scientific foundation for a paradigm shift in insect pest control away from traditional insecticides toward products that alter insect behavior by directly manipulating insect chemosensory proteins. A rational design approach is used to isolate compounds that bind to critical chemosensory proteins, and those compounds capable of altering insect behavior will be further selected. These compounds are referred to by the trade name, Arometics. In response to citrus grower demand, small molecules that should affect the foraging behavior of the agriculturally and economically significant insect, Apis mellifera (European honeybee) are being isolated. The final products will be repellents capable of protecting citrus from unwanted pollination. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will alter insect control practices by avoiding the use of insecticides and the need for complicated pheromone synthesis. The initial insect targeted, the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), provides essential pollination that adds an estimated $14 billion annually in value to US crops. This research will lead to better honeybee management strategies that will protect the honeybee, a critical crop pollinator. This project will have broad scientific and societal impact, as it introduces the technologies necessary to develop novel, environmentally responsible insect control methods that are compatible with modern integrated pest management schemes.\r\n",
