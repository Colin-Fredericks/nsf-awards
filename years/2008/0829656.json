 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CPATH award funds a collaborative Transformative Implementation project between SUNY Stony Brook and Hofstra University to integrate entrepreneurship and leadership components into the undergraduate curricula at both institutions. The project includes development of modules about innovation, entrepreneurship, and global aspects in several required courses and development of an entrepreneurial computer science minor.  In addition students work in global entrepreneurial teams with students at targeted universities in Germany, Romania, and Korea.  The project includes community building activities with faculty in the greater New York area to promote adaptation and adoption of the curricula models and resources developed.  \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the importance and currency of the topic and clear need for such changes in computing education to prepare the upcoming generation of computing professionals.  The project has a strong collaborative team with entrepreneurial and educational experience and an enhanced evaluation component that should clearly demonstrate the impact of this innovative approach to the research and education community. The project also includes testing of methodologies for handling associated intellectual property issues that could be of value to many other researchers in the future.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project lie in the potential to prepare a diverse student and faculty population to pursue entrepreneurial activities in high-technology. The project includes dissemination to a broad community and opportunities for sharing of resources.  There is potential for national models that can help to develop a technology-savvy workforce which is vital to the nation?s continued prosperity and security.",

To attain this goal, the project aims at providing an educational model that will produce well-rounded computing graduates who are adaptable to the business world and who have the ability to thrive on new challenges. The project is a collaborative one between Stony Brook University and Hofstra University.  \n\nIn Stony Brook University, the following is the summary of major outcomes:   \n1. Engineering and Technology Entrepreneurship (ETE) Minor\nThe minor has been established since Dec 2009 and currently have about 10 students.\n2. New Courses: Two new courses were introduced to the ECE curriculum:\nESE 201: Engineering and Technology Entrepreneurship\nESE 301: Engineering Ethics and Societal Impact\nESE 201 is an elective course but required for the Engineering and Technology (ETE)\nminor. ESE 301 is a required course for all students in Electrical and Computer\nEngineering majors.\n3. Entrepreneurship Modules for existing course: ESE 123, ESE 231, ESE 344, ESE\n358, ESE 366 and ESE 440/441. The E-modules are developed for courses throughout\nthe electrical and computer engineering curriculum. These courses ensure students\nhave exposures to engineering entrepreneurship.\n4. A Combined BE and MBA program &ndash; A combined 5-year program for BE\n(Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering) and MBA degree is now approved\nby the NY SED (State Education Department).\n5. Engineering Summer Camp for High School Students &ndash; Prof. Monica Bugallo at\nElectrical and Computer Engineering has organized a summer camp for high school\nstudents for the last three years.\n6. Freshmen/Sophomore Seminar Courses for Honors Students &ndash; A series of\ncomputer science, engineering and technology entrepreneurship seminars are available\nto Honors students.\n7. Long Island Systems Applications and Technology Conference (LISAT) - Prof.\nWendy Tang is on the Annual Conference Technical committee and continue to serve\nas a liaison to promote the conference to undergraduate engineering students. For the\npast four years, there are four or five papers published annually in this conference with\nundergraduate students as the lead authors.\n8. Annual Business Competition (DARE Competition): An annual business\ncompetition with a panel of venture capitalists has been institutionalized for more than\nfive years under the leadership of Dr. Anne-Marie Scheidt. We work closely with Dr.\nScheidt\u00c6s office to encourage computer science and engineering students to enter the annual competition.\n \nIn Hofstra University, the following is the summary of major outcomes:  \n&bull; Four students graduated from the new Entrepreneurship programs.\n&bull; One of the students, Julian Bulies, is currently participating with his team in a Global\nStart Up competition, after winning the Startup Weekend in Kansas City.\n&bull; Mike Seiman, one of the E-board members, a CS alumnus and a successful entrepreneur\ndonated $75K for an entrepreneurship competition (CPX Competition) in Fall 2012 for\nall STEM students at Hofstra.\n&bull; We continued the seminars series in Computing Entrepreneurship and organized four\nmore seminars open to all students and faculty.\n&bull; We implemented the Entrepreneurship modules developed previously in Fall 2011 classees.\n&bull; Dr. Currie taught the third time the CSC 194 course (developed as part of the grant) in\nSpring 2012. All students presented their business ideas and plans at the Business Plan\nCompetition organized on May 10th. A panel of judges made up of local entrepreneurs\ngave feedback to all stud..."
