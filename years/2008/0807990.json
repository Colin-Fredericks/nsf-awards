Z-Spec is a grating spectrometer that uses 160 bolometers spanning the complete 1 mm atmospheric window from 195-305 GHz.   The scientific goals are to 1) Use multiple CO lines to measure redshifts of a sample of the luminous dusty galaxies that make up the far-IR/submillimeter background; and 2) Conduct broad-band line surveys of nearby galaxies measuring CO isotopes, density tracers, and photo-dissociation tracers in a single spectrum.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include hands-on training of students and postdocs in millimeter-wave instrumentation and techniques, and availability of Z-Spec to the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe universe has undergone tremendous evolution since its birth 13.7 billion years ago, from a time when there was nothing but undifferentiated diffuse gas, to a sky now richly populated with the majestic pinwheels and glowing orbs of enormous galaxies with their hundreds of billions of stars.  The story of these galaxies is the story of the formation of stars within them, which form from cold massive clouds of gas shielded from ultraviolet radiation by thick shrouds of dust.  It has come to be appreciated in the last 20 years that much of the star formation that occurs early in the history of the universe is so deeply cloaked by this dust as to be unobservable to telescopes observing in visible light.  Electromagnetic radiation at longer wavelengths can, however, escape from these clouds and is detectable by a new generation of detectors at millimeter wavelengths.\n\n Z-Spec is such an instrument: a spectrometer designed to sample the \"colors\" of light at a wavelength near 1 mm, a wavelength more than 1000 times longer than that to which our eyes are sensitive.  Much as individual atoms will emit characteristic colors of light at visible wavelengths, molecules will also emit characteristic colors that allow us to identify not only their type, but also the temperature and density of the gas of which they are a part.  Furthermore, by measuring the amount by which the light has been stretched by the expansion of the universe as it has traveled to us, we can infer the distance to the galaxy and the time in the universe\u00c6s history when it was emitted.  This stretching leads to the light having a longer wavelength when it reaches us than when it was emitted.  Since longer wavelengths of light are \"redder\", this stretching is referred to as redshift.   Astronomers use the variable z to denote redshift, and so Z-Spec is short for \"redshift (z) spectrometer\".  Because light travels at a finite speed, we see these galaxies as they were in the distant past, and the redshift is a measure of how long ago the light left the galaxy.\n\n The goal of our project was to use Z-Spec, an instrument designed and built by our collaboration, to determine the distances and star forming conditions for a variety of galaxies in the early universe which are nearly invisible in ordinary light due to the large quantities of dust present in them.  We were aided in the detection of these very faint, distant galaxies by a remarkable phenomenon: the bending of light by gravity, referred to as gravitational lensing.   If a massive object (such an another galaxy or cluster of galaxies) is lined up nearly along the line of sight in front of a background galaxy, the background galaxy\u00c6s light will be bent by gravity and more of it will end up at our detectors than would otherwise be the case.  This boost in the brightness of the galaxy (up to nearly 100 times in some cases) makes it much easier to see. \n\n For a sample of galaxies detected by the Herschel Space Telescope, Z-Spec determined the redshift, showing that the brightest galaxies at millimeter wavelengths were indeed lensed, a result reported in the article \"The Detection of a Population of Submillimeter-Bright, Strongly Lensed Galaxies\" in the journal Science.  This was written up in numerous press releases, including http://phys.org/news/2010-12-penn-astronomer-window-universe.html (and see the Figure).  Another exciting discovery has been the detection in a surprisingly large number of galaxies of vast quantities of water in a warm, dense gas phase.  Water is difficult to study from ground-based telescopes due to absorption of the characteristic emission lines by water in the earth\u00c6s atmosphere, but the redshifting of the light makes it possible to observe from the ground for distant galaxies.  The emission from this water is a sign of intense star formation and / or the accretion of material by a supermassive black hole in the galaxy\u00c6s center.  Most previous detections of molecular emission in distant galax..."
