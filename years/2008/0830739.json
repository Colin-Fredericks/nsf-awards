 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for survivable routing \r\nin next generation networks. Current research in this area are either heuristic based that \r\nlacks performance guarantee, or computationally intensive that lacks scalability. The PI \r\nconcentrates on efficient survivable routing in a very important class of network topologies \r\nknown as minimum isolated failure immune networks. Efficient algorithms will be designed for \r\nsurvivable routing in such networks. This transformative research will provide a solid \r\ntheoretical foundation for survivable routing in next generation networks.\r\n\r\nThe INTELLECTUAL MERIT of this research lies in exploring a new dimension of research in \r\nsurvivable routing in next generation networks, using combinatorial optimization and \r\nalgorithms as tools of investigation.\r\nThe research will extend the frontiers of knowledge in survivable networks in the following \r\ndirections: (1) improving heuristic based or integer linear programming based algorithms \r\nfor survivable lightpath routing in mesh network to polynomial time optimal algorithms for \r\nsurvivable lightpath routing in minimum isolated failure immune networks; (2) extending \r\nheuristic based QoS-aware redundant tree schemes to QoS-aware redundant tree schemes with \r\nprovably good performance; (3) extending heuristic based double-failure protection to \r\nguaranteed double-failure protection.\r\n\r\nIn terms of BROADER IMPACTS, this research will lead to (i) integration of research into \r\neducational experiences of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, especially \r\nstudents from underrepresented groups;\r\n(ii) unification of seemingly diverse disciplines which have common underlying mathematical \r\nfoundation; (iii) dissemination of research results through presentation and publication \r\nin high-quality conferences and journals.\r\n",
