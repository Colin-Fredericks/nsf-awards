In atomic nuclei the single-particle orbitals are expected to change as a function of neutron and proton number, and in addition are very sensitive to the presence of deformation.  Single-particle characteristics can be probed in single-particle transfer reactions. Light-ion transfer reactions have been studied with beams of rare isotopes near the Coulomb barrier at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Studies concentrated on neutron-rich nuclei near the N=82 neutron shell closure and light nuclei important to understand nucleosynthesis in stars. The purity of the single-neutron excitations in 133Sn, with spectroscopic factors consistent with unity, highlights 132Sn (N=82, Z=50) as one of the best examples of a doubly-magic nucleus, with closed shells of both neutrons and protons.  Similar structure was observed in 131Sn, which impacts the rapid neutron capture process of nucleosynthesis in stars. Elastic deuteron scattering with 7Be rare isotope beams was used to search for a resonance in the 7Be+d system; no strong resonance was observed.  Therefore, a solution outside of nuclear physics is needed to resolve the discrepancy between calculations and observations for 7Li abundances.\n\nAnother challenge in nuclear structure physics is to understand the microscopic components of the nuclear wave function, as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum and in nuclei away from stability.
