 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magneto-mechanical behavior of magnetostrictive composites is of great interest to researchers and engineers in science and engineering disciplines. However, the inferior mechanical response of the matrix severely impedes their wide applications. The proposed research is aimed to develop a new type of magnetostrictive elastomer nanocomposites reinforced with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, a combined experimental and multi-scale modeling investigation is proposed to study the effective magnetic-field-dependent dynamic mechanical behavior of magnetostrictive nanocomposites embedded with mixed multi-walled carbon nanotubes and magnetostrictive microparticles. This project will focus on the fabrication process and property testing, multiscale modeling, and eddy current-induced magneto-mechanical coupling of magnetostrictive nanocomposites. \r\n\r\nThis project is among the first attempts to combine the advantages of nanocomposites and magnetostrictive materials to produce novel magnetostrictive nanocomposites. The success of this work is expected to lead to significant advances in the development of smart composites with applications such as adaptive vibration control and magnetoelastic sensors for civil infrastructures monitoring. In addition, the project provides an opportunity for performing interdisciplinary research and cross-disciplinary education. Two graduate students will be supported and trained to carry out a significant component of the research. Priority will be given to underrepresented minority students in participation of related experiments and demonstrations. This multidisciplinary nature of the project will attract and retain minority students and expose them to the state-of-the-art research. \r\n",
