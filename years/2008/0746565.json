First, I will examine and improve the reliability and validity of measures of conceptual and procedural knowledge for each topic. Then, I will evaluate how self- and instructional explanations support growth of each\r\ntype of knowledge. The overall goals are to develop an information-processing framework for the iterative development of conceptual and procedural knowledge and to provide guidance on how to use explanations as instructional tools. I will also teach an undergraduate course on mathematical cognition.",
