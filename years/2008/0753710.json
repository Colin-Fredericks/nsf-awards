 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award establishes Ohio State University (OSU) as a research site of the Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Center for Experimental Research and Computer Science (CERCS) at Georgia Institute of Technology.  The mission of this center is to lead the innovation of new information and computing technologies to construct the information grids of the future and to create the intellectual capital that can further advance this technology and fuel future advances.  The primary focus of the proposed site will be to develop Adaptive Complex Enterprise (ACE) architecture knowledge for enterprise transformation and innovation.  The objective of the ACE architecture knowledge is to provide widely-applicable methods for planning and execution of an environment-business aligned IT strategy.  As a research partner, the OSU site will complement the CERCS center at Georgia Tech.  The OSU team brings a significant track record and diverse and complementary strengths to the center.  CERCS will benefit from the expanded research expertise and involvement of various companies that OSU will bring to the table. \r\n\r\nOhio State University will make significant contributions to the mission of CERCS. The quality and quantity of research conducted will expand the impact of CERCS in technical, educational and outreach activities. Key to success and growth at OSU is broader participation not only from university faculty, but also from experts from business and other academic institutions.  OSU has a clear plan to involve students in its research, and the nature of the proposal ensures that the proposed research will have significant impact on industrial practice through close collaboration with industrial partners. \r\n",
