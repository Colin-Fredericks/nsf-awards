 "awd_abstract_narration": "Articulatory inversion is the problem of recovering the sequence of\r\nvocal tract shapes that produce a given acoustic utterance. \r\nArticulatory representations are useful for automatic speech\r\nrecognition, speech production research, language therapy, and\r\nlanguage learning. Articulatory inversion is a hard problem because\r\ndifferent vocal tract shapes can produce the same acoustics, yet the\r\narticulatory trajectory must obey the mechanical constraints of the\r\nhuman vocal tract. Other examples of inversion problems over a\r\nsequence, which share the multivalued nature of the mappings and the\r\nexistence of constraints, are: the recovery of facial gestures\r\nassociated with a speech utterance; the inverse kinematics of a robot\r\narm; and the recovery of 3D motion from video.\r\n\r\nThis project approaches articulatory inversion from a machine learning\r\nstandpoint, based on a framework introduced by the PI. The\r\nlow-dimensional manifold in articulatory-acoustic space is represented\r\nin a probabilistic way by a density model estimated from data\r\n(recorded using a microphone and electromagnetic articulography). \r\nMultivalued mappings are explicitly represented by the modes of\r\nconditional distributions of this density, and the articulatory\r\ntrajectory is disambiguated using a continuity constraint.\r\n\r\nThe project introduces new problems in dimensionality reduction,\r\ndensity estimation and regularization (such as multivalued regression\r\nand graph-learning from noisy data), and new models and algorithms. \r\nThe expected results of this work are: performing basic research in\r\nmachine learning, and introducing mapping inversion problems to\r\nresearch and education; improving articulatory inversion (for which\r\ncode will be made freely available); and advocating data-driven\r\napproaches in speech production research and education.\r\n",
