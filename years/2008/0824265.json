 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to formulate design principles for and demonstrate, via prototyping, the feasibility of a new sensor network of everyday objects based on radio frequency identification (RFID) system components.  The vision exploits the advantages of RFID while addressing two key challenges, namely the lack of sensor integration onto RFID tags and the need for careful redesign of the transceivers (i.e, down and up links as well as the multiple access protocol).  Central to the success of the proposed research are two key advances already in place at University of Washington-Intel Research Labs.  First, a new class of passive RFID tags, called wireless identification and sensing platforms (WISPs), integrated with appropriate sensors and designed for enhanced power harvesting are available.  Second, a software-defined reader (SDR) that allows innovation of link and medium access control (MAC) protocols is available.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, the research pursues an integrated systems solution to RFID network design at various interacting levels of abstraction.  As an example, the research considers coupled circuit and electromagnetic simulation that characterizes the back-scattered uplink signal at the reader, which in turn can suggest link and MAC layer components, such as modulation and coding as well as collision avoidance dedicated to interference mitigation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, the research has the potential to accelerate academic research into RFID networks via freeware distribution of the SDR code and limited availability of WISPs as well as dissemination via topical tutorials.  Successful execution of the project can move RFID technology from its intended application of reading tag IDs within a supply chain environment toward the more ambitious goal of realizing a ubiquitous \"internet of things.\"",
