Each such code processes data at a \u00afxed rate and with a \u00afxed delay, so that\r\nthe fraction of errors (called average distortion) in the reconstructed data will be acceptably\r\nsmall. The primary problem of linear convolutional code design is to \u00afnd an optimal code,\r\nwhich is a code yielding the minimum average distortion among codes in a \u00afnite set of feasible\r\ncodes. In most cases, with past techniques, this problem could only be solved approximately,\r\nyielding an almost optimal code (a code with near minimum average distortion), the set of\r\nfeasible codes being too large for the average distortion of codes to be examined individually.\r\nIn this project, we investigate a new technique, called perturbation theory, which reduces the\r\nset of feasible codes to a much smaller set of codes called perturbation codes. In many cases,\r\nan optimal code will be one of the perturbation codes, and it can be found in a reasonable\r\namount of time.\r\nEach linear convolutional code in the set of feasible codes is described via a parity check\r\nmatrix over the binary \u00afeld, consisting of a \u00afxed number of rows and columns. A perturba-\r\ntion class of codes consists of codes whose parity check matrices can be arranged so that a\r\ncertain number of rows at the top remain \u00afxed. Any code will lie in more than one pertur-\r\nbation class of codes, depending upon which rows of the parity check matrix are held \u00afxed.\r\nUnder certain conditions, there will be a natural group acting on the parity check matrices\r\nof a perturbation class of codes. Using the group structure, a subset of each perturbation\r\nclass of codes is selected. A code will be declared to be a perturbation code if it is among the\r\nselected codes in a certain number of perturbation classes containing the code. There is \u00b0ex-\r\nibility in the de\u00afnition of perturbation code. In this project, we investigate how to properly\r\ndelineate the perturbation code concept so that an optimal code can be found from among\r\na small set of perturbation codes, for source and channel models of su\u00b1cient symmetry.",
