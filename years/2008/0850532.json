 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Professional Development Program (PDP) is designed to prepare science and engineering graduate students for designing and teaching inquiry-based laboratory modules. Led by Dr. Lisa Hunter (University of Hawaii), the PDP includes workshops followed by a practical teaching experience, usually at the college level. In addition to training for teaching, a major outcome of the program is the innovative, inquiry-based laboratory units developed and taught by PDP participants. Laboratory units developed through the PDP have been very successful in Hawaii college courses and programs, and are an essential element of the recently launched Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI), which includes curriculum development for a new electro-optics program at Maui Community College. This award will support, in part, the workshops held within the PDP and will ensure the inclusion of  Hawaii-based graduate student participants in the program, maintaining the momentum and educational partnerships established by the NSF Center for Adaptive Optics, and now being transferred to AWI, managed by the University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy. \r\n\r\nThe PDP is specifically designed to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to teach in a way that engages students from all backgrounds in the processes and practices of science. The integration of research and education is an essential part of the PDP. Included within PDP are sessions on addressing diversity and equity in the classroom.  All PDP participants are required to consider how they will engage all students in their teaching. In addition to the overall focus on diversity and methods for broadening participation, this work will have a significant impact on the Maui community. PDP participants will teach in courses and programs that include significant numbers of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and other underrepresented groups.",
