 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technology and Innovation in Manufacturing and Engineering (TIME) Center is continuing its transformational activities and broadening its focus on manufacturing and engineering technology at the secondary and postsecondary levels. Center partners are pursuing a comprehensive strategy to: \r\n     1. Develop secondary and post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology curricula in demand-driven program areas. \r\n     2. Provide professional development opportunities for secondary and post-secondary manufacturing, engineering technology and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty. \r\n     3. Collaborate with partners and key stakeholder groups to enhance the visibility and image of manufacturing and engineering technology as viable career options. \r\n     4. Explore innovative instructional methodology to support more effective delivery of manufacturing and engineering technology education. \r\n\r\nThe target audiences for these strategies include students from middle school through college, parents, K-12 teachers, college faculty, high school and college career counselors, adult learners, incumbent workers, and members of the employment community. In order to reach these diverse constituencies, the TIME Center is working with a wide variety of local, regional and national partners. Among the collaborators are seven community colleges, three universities, state and local K-12 educational systems, state and local workforce and economic development agencies, six business organizations, and individual companies. The objectives of the TIME Center build upon its many successes to date, continue the transformation in manufacturing and engineering technology education already begun, and expand involvement and expertise into new areas that enhance capabilities to address these changes. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Activities systematically build upon successes and lessons learned to date by continuing the redesign and restructuring of secondary and post-secondary manufacturing and engineering technology programs in Maryland; identifying new, emerging areas for coursework and possible degree options that continue to meet the industry's need for trained technicians; ensuring that faculty have access to current instructional materials, technologies, and state-of-the practice professional development; exploring innovative instructional delivery approaches; and institutionalizing products and expertise into partner programs at various educational levels. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Activities continue to involve the Center in regional and statewide workforce development partnerships and initiatives; maintain close interaction with the employer community; broaden the participation of underrepresented groups; advance efforts to create systemic educational change at the secondary and post-secondary levels; more effectively assess the impact of collective efforts on student learning; collaborate with other ATE Centers on professional development and research on alternate instructional delivery options; and ensure sustainability and institutionalization of products and services.",
