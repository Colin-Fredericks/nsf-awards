The purpose of this meeting is to bring together a strong, international group of researchers in the field of computational heat transfer to discuss the current state-of-the-art in thermofluids computing, and to help identify emerging trends.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, a broadly interdisciplinary assembly of researchers is anticipated, representing disciplines such as mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mathematics, physics, atmospheric and oceanographic sciences, and computer science.  Given the ubiquity of thermal processes, and the necessity of computational simulation to achieve new research advances, the stimulus provided by bringing together a diverse group of computational researchers remains extremely important.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include allowing a number of junior researchers, as well as some from underrepresented groups, to attend the meeting and to interact with their peers.  The conference has already attracted a number of co-sponsors, which indicates a broader impact beyond what can be provided by direct NSF support.  All papers presented at the meeting will be available on a website, and selected papers will appear in a special issue of a new journal on Computational Thermal Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
