 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building from self-determination theory, this study will examine how instructor choices affect a range of student outcomes related to their development as self-directed and lifelong learners (SDL). Drawing on existing research that suggests strong correlations between student autonomy support and outcomes related to SDL, the proposed study examines three research questions. First, in what ways do engineering instructors assist students to become self-directed learners, and are there instructor practices and behaviors that lead to greater student involvement in and ownership of their own learning? The second question asks about students? behavioral and affective responses to different ways autonomy is supported in undergraduate engineering settings. Finally, what effect does a sense of autonomy have on students? perceptions of their own learning? Lifelong learning requires the development of capacities consistent with those of SDL who may be characterized as curious, motivated, reflective, analytical, persistent, flexible, and independent. They possess skills in information seeking, retrieval and metacognitive awareness. Instructors clearly play a critical role in influencing outcomes related to SDL through their design and implementation of courses that foster students? transitions from controlled to autonomous learning behaviors. Participants in this study will be engineering faculty and undergraduate students at four collaborating universities. Education faculty with expertise in motivation and assessment will coordinate the mixed method evaluation plan. \r\n\r\nThe need for student-centered learning approaches that foster a capacity for lifelong learning is recognized by educators and accreditation agencies as vital for success in today?s engineering environment. The current emphasis in the engineering education community has been on assessing students? lifelong learning capacity by measuring outcomes associated with SDL, rather than on understanding the complex relationship between instructor practices and SDL outcomes. This project will have broad impact since all engineering programs are required to demonstrate that students are gaining the skills needed to be lifelong learners. Broad dissemination of the work through a variety of mechanisms, including national workshops, will aid the development of faculty expertise, contribute to the epistemology of engineering educators, enable the design of more effective teaching environments, and provide a model for implementation of autonomy-supportive engineering curricula that have the potential for direct impact on a diversity of student populations.",
