 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative project focuses on the deployment of a complete, scalable, multi-tiered and integrated wireless mobile infrastructure at urban scale that addresses: 1. at-scale design and evaluation of network protocols; and 2. the compilation and analysis of medical health data collected via the integration of medical health sensors into the wireless network. This collaborative project team will develop, deploy, and operate an information technology infrastructure that serves as a platform for research and societal change. The key innovations of this project and platform are: \r\n1. A multi-tier wireless access network with fully programmable and observable nodes that serves 4,000 users over 4 km2 (an at-scale density surpassing existing deployments), \r\n2. A fully instrumented and deployed mobile computing platform that enables joint assessment of user behavior and end system performance, providing energy-efficient and user-friendly access to the network, and\r\n3. A deployed wireless health-sensing platform that monitors and processes physiological data and seamlessly interconnects it with the mobile-computing and wireless network platforms to enable radically new low-cost treatments for chronic diseases.\r\n\r\nThe research infrastructure will be deployed in an under-resourced area, Pecan Park, a community in the heart of Southeast Houston with 4,760 residents per km2, a density that is unprecedented for research and has not been reached even by commercial mesh deployments. This scale provides a replicable and sustainable template of what is possible in similar communities world-wide. The infrastructure serves as both a platform for societal change and a platform for research innovation and proof-of-concept system design.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith many cities planning wireless network deployments, our project has served as a proof-of-concept of the transformational capabilities of broadband access, low-cost IT tools and healthcare resources to underserved, underinsured, low-income urban communities. The goal of this NSF project was threefold: develop integrated network management tools using our multi-tier wireless testbed; develop and deploy experimental mobile devices for data collection; and manufacture and deployment of health sensing boxes for monitoring and education of the user community. This project included real-world trials of network protocol design, sensor node communication strategies, high-uncertainty healthcare data analysis, and mobile platform usability and energy efficiency studies. Our infrastructure enabled unique experiments that could only be performed on a fully observable and highly programmable infrastructure operating at-scale with a large user community.\n \nThe BlueScale Field Testing involved installation in users' homes for testing under Rice's multi-tier wireless access network in Pecan Park. This study evaluated the BlueScale devices' IT components and data communication and processing capabilities under Rice's multi-tier wireless access network. To enable more frequent, timely (CHF) congestive heart failure monitoring, we previously designed and implemented a handheld device called BlueBox that allowed daily self-measurements of electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG). Although BlueBox yielded promising preliminary results, it suffered from usability and connectivity drawbacks that limited applicability in larger scale studies. A second-generation device, BlueScale provided a friendly interface and improved physiological sensing. BlueScale can lead to early detection of degrading cardiovascular health and can assist in early intervention before an acute cardiac event occurs. BlueScale, a free-standing device consisting of a modified bathroom scale and a vertical pole with hand electrodes and an optical sensor embedded in the handlebars. The self-measurement is guided by instructions displayed on a large touchscreen and it takes less than one minute to complete. BlueScale measures 3-lead ECG, PPG, whole-body bioimpedance, and weight.  \n \nFollowing a measurement, the raw dataset was transmitted to a central database where ECG and PPG waveforms were processed into meaningful metrics, such as RR variability, QRS time, and PTTs. The BlueScale paradigm for CHF management was based on the analysis of individual historical data to detect a significant deviation from that patient\u00c6s daily norm. Three prototypes of the BlueScale system were deployed at a local university, an urban community center (Technology for All) and a private residence. Twenty-two healthy volunteers took daily measurements with the scale for one to four weeks. Results indicated a much improved usability of BlueScale, a high adherence rate, and higher quality of physiological signals over the handheld device. These factors established each subject\u00c6s individual baseline and successfully tested preliminary algorithms of cardiac anomalies simulated artificially. Management of CHF through a comprehensive infrastructure including ubiquitous cardiovascular sensing/monitoring, case management center and caregivers has the potential to improve outcome and reduce disease related costs.\n \nThe deployment of the infrastructure in the under-resourced Houston community has brought low-cost access to IT and healthcare resources to its residents as well as neighborhood schools and libraries. Our use of low-cost sensors for health monitoring could yield economically-viable preventive healthcare for under-resourced communities, which will be more effective than emergency-room driven treatment that underinsured and uninsured patients usually receive. In our research, we designed, implemented and evaluated an 802.11-based protocol without control messages which yielded effi..."
