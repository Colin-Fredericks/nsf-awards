 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nDriven by new discoveries and advances in biotechnology, the nature of research in life sciences has changed from qualitative, observational, and descriptive to quantitative, analytical, and predictive. These fundamental changes in life sciences have made educational reform in these areas a top priority at many American universities. A common approach to this problem is to offer intensive mathematical training to students in life sciences through seminars, summer training programs, workshops, and crash courses. These courses include as many mathematical and statistical methods applicable to biological research as possible. Although those programs and courses provide mathematical tools for students, this project is developing a more permanent solution to the problem by revolutionizing the whole mathematics curriculum for life sciences majors, starting with entrance level calculus. It is asking what mathematical skills students in the life sciences need and how to best deliver the appropriate material. \r\n\r\nRather than covering all mathematical methods applicable to biology or focusing on a single mathematics subject, this project is developing a platform for students upon which they can build a mathematical background that will be most beneficial in their future studies and careers. It is redeveloping two basic subjects, calculus and differential equations, as the key for modeling and analysis in quantitative biology. Calculus is the foundation of higher mathematics and differential equations, built on calculus, is one of the two powerful tools for biological modeling (the other is statistics). The new sequence of courses moves almost seamlessly from calculus to differential equations and serves as a bridge between mathematics and biology. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This project builds a new path for mathematical training in the life sciences, which encourages more students to learn mathematics and strengthen their mathematical background. New teaching strategies are promoting mathematics studies beyond calculus among undergraduates with life sciences majors. New course materials, including computer-based and web-based materials, are being developed. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: The newly designed sequence of courses is having an immediate impact on a large student body at one of the largest public and land grant universities in the country. The computer-based and web-based course materials are being made available to over 100 institutions through the LON-CAPA system and the internet. The project is making a special effort to include female and minority students in the program, in particular by linking with the university's Drew Enrichment Laboratory and the Emerging Scholars Program.",
