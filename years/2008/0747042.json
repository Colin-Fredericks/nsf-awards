 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of today?s most challenging design issues is the threat of radiation-induced soft errors in CMOS digital systems. In nanometer technologies, the frequency of soft errors affects the markets of consumer electronics and networking, not just aerospace or military applications. This research aims to develop mitigation strategies that reduce the overall soft error rate while minimizing traditional cost metrics such as silicon area, power consumption, and performance degradation. Both technology scaling and system complexity have motivated designers to rely upon cell libraries and reusable cores in their design flow. This work investigates the fundamental fault generation and fault transport of radiation-induced soft errors within those building blocks. By identifying the fundamental characteristics of soft errors, design principles can be developed to improve the starting point for reliability of all types of integrated circuits, from avionics and space applications to enterprise servers, network routers, and control systems. This work includes simulation of irradiated individual circuits as well as experimentation to analyze the full hardware implementation of a microprocessor. The research leverages and integrates traditional domains such as computer architecture, VLSI design, fault tolerance, and radiation effects.  Another critical component of this effort is the recruitment and retention of students in science and engineering from traditionally underrepresented groups. The PI has partnered with the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program at Vanderbilt University to provide summer undergraduate research opportunities and professional development seminars to help students prepare for and succeed in graduate school. \r\n",

Our technological society relies upon the products of the electronics industry for commerce, communication, and entertainment. The ubiquity of ICs for mission-critical, safety, and communication applications has highlighted the need for enhanced reliability. ICs in nanometer technologies have become more vulnerable to faults and errors, such as those induced by ionizing radiation (e.g., alpha particles, terrestrial neutrons, muons, protons, heavy ions).While the effects of radiation have long been a significant concern in space applications, they are now an important reliability issue for nanometer technologies in terrestrial applications. This work investigated the fundamental fault generation and fault transport of radiation-induced soft errors within ICs. By identifying the fundamental characteristics of soft errors and translating those characteristics across layers of design abstraction, design principles were developed to improve the starting point for reliability of all types of ICs. Using that information, this project developed mitigation strategies that reduced the overall soft error rate while minimizing traditional cost metrics such as silicon area, power consumption, and performance degradation.\nIntellectual Merit:\nThe research focused on reliability-aware logic synthesis to reduce the baseline soft error rate for a synthesized circuit while still allowing the incorporation of other mitigation techniques previously used for error detection and correction. Logic synthesis is the process in which the hardware description of the design is converted into a netlist. In an IC, this netlist represents the design with detailed logic cells and connections based upon a standard cell library for a selected process technology. The research made the following contributions:\n\n Identification of design characteristics that can be used by electronic design automation (EDA) tools to estimate reliability during the logic synthesis step.\nIdentification of the impact of optimization algorithms during the logic synthesis step on the reliability of a circuit.\nDevelopment of an approach to minimize circuit vulnerability based on library cell selection.\n\nThese contributions extend the ability of a circuit designer to both estimate and improve the reliability of combinational logic in a large system (e.g., microprocessor) at an early design stage. Using a cell-level netlist and a table of error generation probabilities for each cell as inputs, a designer can: (1) estimate which cells have the highest probability of propagating and latching a fault, and (2) determine which cell-replacement strategy is most cost-effective at improving the reliability of the vulnerable cell.\nBroader Impacts:\nThe research spanned traditional domains such as computer architecture, VLSI design, fault tolerance, and radiation effects to enhance reliability within the electronics industry. The reliability techniques of this research apply to the EDA tools used by designers that develop semiconductor intellectual property (IP), a key part of electronics design because semiconductor IP reduces IC development costs and accelerates time-to-market. The educational approach used research-based activities to enhance the experience of students both inside and outside the classroom while providing mentorship to guide and encourage students towards careers in engineering. A new graduate course called Computer Architecture Reliability was developed, using the textbook Architecture Design for Soft Errors, authored by Shubu Mukherjee. The course co..."
