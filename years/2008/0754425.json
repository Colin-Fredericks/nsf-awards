 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the renewal of the UnIPhy-REU site program at Hampton University.  The award will support the summer research residential program for undergraduate physics and science majors along with its summer research program for teachers - TIRP-RET.  The main focus of the UnIPhy-REU site program is to offer a research experience in the areas of nuclear, particle, optical and medical physics or atmospheric sciences to students from groups normally underrepresented in physics.  Eight students will conduct research in labs on the campus of Hampton University and at the nearby Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  Four students will participate in the UnIPhy-REU/MIT Summer Program for Undergraduate Research with an Electron Ion Collider at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The TIRP-RET program will provide research opportunities in experimental nuclear or particle physics for two high school teachers.  The main focus of the UnIPhy-REU and TIRP-RET programs is to introduce undergraduate students and high school teachers to the process of conducting advanced scientific research, specifically in the field of physics.  Students conduct research under the guidance of a mentor; they are in daily contact with the mentor, researchers, and graduate students.  Additionally, students participate in seminars and social activities.  At the conclusion of the program, students give a thirty-minute oral presentation and submit a written research report.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.",
