 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at advancing resonant microelectromechancal (MEMS) mass sensors such as those used for detecting specific chemical or biological agents. Two investigative themes are proposed: (1) mass sensors utilizing array-type detection single-input-single-output device configurations which is simpler than existing array-based approaches and would allow designer to minimize on-chip electronics, and (2) mass detection using parametrically resonance sensors. Methods will be developed for assessing sensor metrics for performance comparison with traditional resonance-based mass sensors. Nano scaled material modeling and assembly for synthesis and performance enhancement will be investigated.  The development and simple single-input-simple-output design would allow minimization of on-chip electronics and enable packaging of the resonators in vacuum and enhancement of overall system performance and sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative multi-disciplinary research between a theorist and experimentalist will  advance the graduate education programs across the departmental and institutional boundaries, and address outreach at the junior high and high school levels through art, the internet, and interactive activities, all of which are enhanced by computational components.\r\n",
