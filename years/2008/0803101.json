 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fort Belknap College (FBC) is a tribally controlled community college located on the Fort Belknap Indian \r\nReservation in northcentral Montana.  The overall goals of the proposed project are to increase student participation \r\nand success in FBC?s STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses and degree programs.  \r\nThis Phase II project will build upon the documented successes of FBC?s Phase I project, while addressing \r\npersistence challenges identified through the collection and analysis of Phase I evaluation data.   In order to achieve \r\nthe project?s dual goals, project personnel will carry out an integrated implementation strategy designed to \r\naccomplish eight student-centered objectives associated with: (1) enrollment in STEM degree programs, (2) \r\nparticipation in STEM summer academies, (3) performance on college placement exams, (4) participation in \r\nresearch and internship programs, (5) performance in STEM gatekeeper courses, (6) retention rates, (7) graduation \r\nnumbers, and (8) transfer numbers.  Primary project strategies for accomplishing these objectives include: (1) \r\nextensive outreach and recruiting programs, (2) pre-college summer STEM academies, (3) summer research and \r\ninternship opportunities, and (4) supplemental instruction and tutoring for STEM courses. In addition to supporting \r\nthese student-centered project activities, project funds also will be used to support: (1) the establishment of a data- \r\ndriven annual review process for STEM programs, (2) comprehensive mathematics curriculum reform, and (7) \r\nongoing faculty development opportunities.  Evaluation activities will provide project personnel with the \r\ninformation needed to effectively monitor the project?s progress, improve its ongoing effectiveness, assess its \r\nsuccess in achieving project goals and objectives, and communicate its outcomes to a variety of stakeholders.",
