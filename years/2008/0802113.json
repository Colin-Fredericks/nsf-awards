 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal 0802113 -- Abstract:  (248 words)\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of random medium access control protocols.  The approach is to employ efficient scheduling to amortize the high control overhead of medium access over a longer sequence of data frames.  Fully distributed protocols will be developed to implement this approach.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This proposal outlines a research and education plan focusing on the theory and system design of efficient random access protocols.  The theoretical and algorithmic thrust includes: (i) developing a general analytical framework, (ii) exploiting multi-user diversity under fading channels, and (iii) extension to multi-hop and multi-channel wireless networks.  The experimental thrust includes (i) formalizing the protocols and prototyping open source device drivers, and (ii) testbed experiments.  The proposed approach has the potential of solving the low throughput problem many wireless networks suffer, as demonstrated in our preliminary studies.  The proposed theoretical study will provide underpinning for the proposed protocol as well as existing standard components.  The proposed field experiments will yield useful experimental experience and insights under a realistic wireless network setting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Integration of education and research is an important goal of this project.  Graduate students will gain useful theoretical and experimental research experience from this project.  The PI will actively involve undergraduate students by advising senior projects and participating in the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate program. Research outcomes will be incorporated into the curriculum of Auburn University?s Bachelor of Wireless Engineering program, the first Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology-accredited program of its kind in the nation.",
