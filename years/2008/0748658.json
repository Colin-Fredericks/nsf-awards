 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacillus anthracis is an important pathogen that is sensative to many antibiotics. Yet it, curiously, carries genetic coding for resistance to many of these antibiotics.  This research will determine which of the loci identified as penicillin, tetracycline, or macrolide resistance genes in strains of B. anthracis actually encode a resistance determinant and to correct each genome annotation based on the verified data. DNA sequences upstream and downstream of the resistance determinants will be analyzed to determine if mobile genetic elements are present. This research will improve the quality and usefulness of B. anthracis genome annotations.The potential for developing a resistant phenotype when the organism is exposed to antimicrobial agents will  be investigated. All corrections to genome annotations will be made available to the scientific community by submission to public databases. Data on gene identification, expression, and associated antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes will be published in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide student training in bacterial genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular laboratory techniques. Validated information on antimicrobial resistance genes in biothreat agents is of particular importance to national biodefense. Any potential for resistance must be confirmed and taken into consideration when selecting an antimicrobial agent for widespread distribution and mass treatment. Any diversity detected and verified in antimicrobial resistance genes or associated DNA sequences will be extremely important in identifying and tracking B. anthracis strains for microbial forensics.",
