 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MIND Alliance for Minority Students with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics is designed to bring together the expertise and resources of two minority-serving institutions of higher education, Hunter College, City University of New York in New York City, NY and Southern University in Baton Rouge, LA, to increase the quantity and quality of students with disabilities receiving community college and baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines and entering the STEM workforce or graduate education.  The MIND Alliance is addressing the following objectives:\r\n\r\n(1) To successfully retain, graduate and transition secondary school students with disabilities for entry into community college and baccalaureate STEM degree programs. \r\n(2) To successfully retain, graduate and transition students with disabilities from community college degree programs to STEM baccalaureate programs or the workforce.\r\n(3) To successfully retain, graduate and transition students with disabilities from STEM baccalaureate degrees to STEM graduate degrees or the workforce.\r\n\r\nStudent interventions, which emphasize culturally sensitive student experiences and a career assessment and counseling approach, are combined with traditional promising practices:  Summer Institute Programs; Tutoring, Mentoring and Role Modeling; High School Counselor and Teacher Workshops; Research Opportunities and Internship Programs; Student Scholarships and an Annual Science Conference.\r\n\r\nThe project is being evaluated by a Dr. Allen Lewis, an Associate Professor of Rehabilitation Counseling at Virginia Commonwealth University. Dissemination will focus on the use of web-based diffusion with an emphasis on sharing the partnering model and culturally sensitive career planning approach with a national post-secondary audience.",

The MIND Alliance brought together expertise, experience, and considerable institutional, programmatic, and personnel resources of two minority institutions of higher education Hunter College-CUNY and Southern University, Baton Rouge.

The three broad goals of the MIND Alliance were to: (a) develop high school partnerships with public schools, and with community colleges and universities in New York City, Newark, and Baton Rouge in order to provide motivational enhancement and academic support services to minority students with disabilities. Partnership activities included career assessment and counseling, summer/fall institutes, training workshops for teachers and school counselors in high schools, counselors in the student with disabilities service offices in community colleges and universities, workshops for parents, mentorship for students, and STEM internships and research opportunities for minority students with disabilities; (b) develop a website with career materials to be used by parents, teachers, and school counselors to motivate high school students with disabilities to pursue academic training and careers in STEM; and (c) disseminate evidence-based capacity-building strategies through peer reviewed journals and presentations at National conferences to other entities engaged in improving STEM-related educational and employment opportunities for people with disabilities from minority backgrounds.</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual Merit </em></p>\n<p>A culturally inclusive and disability-sensitive framework for organizing career development concepts and interventions for minority students with disabilities was used to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of the efficacy of MIND Alliance STEM capacity-building strategies and services.
