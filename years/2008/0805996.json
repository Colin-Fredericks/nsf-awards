 "awd_abstract_narration": "A classic example of a discrete combinatorial structure is a graph, and graph theory, including its enumerative aspect, is one of the most developed parts of combinatorics. Back in the sixties, in a series of pioneering papers Erdos and Renyi created what is now known as random graphs theory, a fast growing research area remarkable for fruitful interplay of enumerative combinatorics and modern probabilistic models and techniques. While Erdos-Renyi random graph process is based on assumption that a new edge location is chosen uniformly at random, it has been recognized that in some applications (internet networks) a more realistic assumption is of a bias toward more \"popular\" vertices (nodes), a so-called preferential attachment hypothesis. The proponent has proved that in this counterpart of the E-R process the random graph undergoes a rapid transformation, from a sea of small components (clusters) to a giant cluster in a sea of small clusters. The proponent plans to study the subsequent phases of the graph process, such as formation of a k-core, and the moment the graph first becomes connected. The proponent will study vertex and edge percolation processes on random graphs with a given degree distribution, and solvability of the random Boolean equations based on his previous studies of the E-R process at the critical stage. The program includes joint research with Alan Frieze (\"mixing\" time of a random walk on an incipient giant component of the E-R graph), and Nick Wormald (directed version of the E-R process). Among other problems are (i) a detailed asymptotic study of the expected coalescing time for a \"m balls into n boxes\" combinatorial scheme, motivated by problems in population genetics (\"most recent common ancestor\")and computer science (\"coupling-from-the past\" algorithm by Propp and Wilson);(ii) enumerative-probabilistic study of \"sorting networks\"; (iii) probabilistic study of \"hard-to-solve\" combinatorial problems, such as integer partitioning problem and a k-SAT problem, on satisfiability of a random Boolean function with clauses of length k > 2.\r\n\r\nImportantly, besides its intrinsic mathematical value, the proposed research program is motivated by problems arising in related areas of operations research (two-sided labor markets), probabilistic modeling of growing information networks, percolation processes in statistical physics, and average case analysis of combinatorial algorithms. Some of these problems seem particularly suitable as research topics for the proponent's partnerships with PhD students. The past beneficiaries of such a collaboration were Adam Hammett and Craig Lennon who successfully defended their PhD theses on problems from the program funded by the NSF in 2004&#8722;2007. The proponent is confident that systematic interaction with his current students, John McSweeney and Jia Yeum, will lead to solving two problems included in the proposed program, one on the expected coalescing time for the allocation model,and another on probability of solvability of the random equations.",
