 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott Sternbach (0739800)\r\nAntarctica in Black and White\r\n\r\n\"Antarctica in Black and White\" is a photographic project undertaken by Scott Sternbach, centered on creating a series of photographs that encompass both the human element and the struggle and interaction between the magnificent yet harsh Antarctic environment. Sternbach will take environmental portraits of researchers, scientists and support staff going about their daily activities in and around the U.S Antarctic Program's Palmer Station. The lyrical documentary work will focus on \"the heroes of the effort to help save the earth.\" As a professor and active contributor within his community, Mr. Sternbach will share his Antarctic experiences and images with students and citizens in the urban centers of New York and its environs and through the galleries and museums in New York and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe public audiences reached through his work as an artist and educator is significant.  His quest to impart his urban students with direct exposure to Antarctic research and the continent through his photography will have lasting impact. Of particular significance is the audience that will be reached via this project, which is in accordance with the NSF's Strategic Plan and the core value of being \"Broadly Inclusive\" defined in part as \"...reaching out especially to groups that have been underrepresented...\" In keeping with this goal, his project emphasizes the broader impacts of both the scientific discovery as interpreted by the artist and subsequently the resulting artistic and literary works which will be made available to a sizeable underrepresented public audience, thereby increasing public understanding of the Antarctic research and the region.",
