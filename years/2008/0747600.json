 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this CAREER proposal is to develop a new gas chromatographic architecture on a credit-card-size platform, named \"GC Matrix,\" aimed at highly efficient separation and detection of complex volatile mixtures (>100 compounds) in only a few seconds. The approach is to: 1) develop a predictable single-etch-step three-dimensional buried channel technique, 2) develop GC columns having on-chip heaters, temperature sensors, flow meters, and thermal conductivity gas detectors (TCD), and 3) integrate the columns into a matrix architecture with minimal dead volume and fluidic transfer lines and demonstrate the GC Matrix separation efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed GC matrix, once the sample is injected, it will be simultaneously analyzed in all rows of the matrix; however, each row is configured, based on the volatility range of the analytes, to separate only a subset of the mixture. The serially coupled MEMS columns in each row will have different stationary phases and can be temperature programmed independently, providing a high degree of flexibility to rapidly separate compounds within each subset based on their boiling points and polarities. Analyte identification will be performed by analyzing the separation results of each column intercepted from its on-chip TCD. \r\n\r\nBy involving industry in curriculum activities, creating a \"Microsystems Laboratory\" course, and establishing the High-School Microsystems Engineering Program (HMEP) through collaboration with VT's National Society of Black Engineers and IEEE's Teacher in Service Program, this proposal will help students discover the societal benefits of electrical engineering which is an important factor in their recruitment and retention in engineering. \r\n\r\n",
