This study will extend that prior work by developing, piloting, and then evaluating the impact of comparison on students' learning of mathematics in a full-year algebra course. Sixty Algebra I teachers will participate in a randomized controlled trial of the contrasting-examples instructional approach, using a delayed treatment design.",

In the large main study that was the centerpiece of this project, we found that teachers did not use our materials as frequently as we had hoped, and this may have prevented us for finding larger effects.
