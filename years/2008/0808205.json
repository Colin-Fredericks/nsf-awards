 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of the Pacific (PACIFIC) Department of Earth and Environmental Science and Office of Student Life are collaborating to develop a Residence for Earth and Environmental Living and Learning (REELL) community and supporting curriculum. This residential learning community (RLC) will focus on learning outside the traditional classroom boundaries. RLCs are commonly developed around small, relationship-driven units that foster a sense of community between students, faculty, and the institution. The fundamental goal of the REELL community is to increase interest and participation in the geosciences and awareness of environmental issues. Undergraduate residents of the REELL community will conduct five core activities each academic year, including: (1) an inter-campus exchange with a neighboring university with an Earth and Environmental program (CSU Chico); (2) a proposal-driven research project; (3) a guest speaker series; (4) outreach to local, minority-serving K-12 schools and the Sly Park Environmental Education Center; and (5) the dissemination of project results and materials. This project is expected to lead to the establishment of a self-sustaining RLC that will enhance the research and education infrastructure and complement PACIFIC's long-term goals and generate results and materials that will assist in the development of other Earth and Environmental RLCs beyond PACIFIC.",
