The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues aim to redefine the way in which modeling and analysis\r\nare developed in such systems by introducing some fundamental\r\nphysical processes that were not included in presently employed\r\nmodels.  More specifically, the team of researchers plans to:\r\n (a) develop a new model for two-component BECs, by augmenting\r\nexisting models to account for processes such as inter-atomic\r\ninteraction losses and higher-order magnetic (Zeeman) effects;\r\n (b) benchmark the model, by testing it in a variety of\r\nsituations where the total number of atoms or ratio of atoms\r\nchanges between the two components and comparing it against the\r\nnewly developed partial differential equation model;\r\n (c) analyze the model mathematically by means of Galerkin\r\nprojections and Lyapunov-Schmidt reductions to study finite\r\ndimensional approximations of the dynamics, whereby the existence\r\nand stability of solutions are studied and control strategies are\r\nemployed to stabilize potentially unstable solution\r\nconfigurations;\r\n (d) produce a computational platform that enables the study of\r\nexistence, stability and nonlinear dynamics of multi-component,\r\nhigh-dimensional variants of the nonlinear Schrodinger equations\r\nthat are the key mathematical ingredient in the modeling of such\r\natomic systems.  In the process, spatially/temporally adaptive\r\nand/or parallel integrators are produced for time-stepping\r\npurposes and iterative methods are developed in order to analyze\r\nthe linear stability problem around steady state solutions. \r\n\r\n     This project presents a route to systematically quantify the\r\nquantum dynamics at the lowest temperatures that arise in the\r\nUniverse, namely in the recently created new form of matter\r\nrepresented by Bose-Einstein condensates (whose formation was\r\nawarded with the 2001 Nobel prize in Physics and whose\r\nproperties, such as superfluidity, were intimately connected to\r\nthe Nobel prize in Physics in 2003).  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues form an interdisciplinary team to directly monitor\r\nthis state of matter in the laboratory, to model the system at\r\nthe physical level, to explore the resulting features at the\r\nmathematical level, and finally to fully visualize the\r\nthree-dimensional dynamics of such complex systems.  A continuous\r\nfeedback between all the above stages is intended to ascertain\r\nnot only a qualitative but also a quantitative understanding of\r\nsuch atomic physics systems, such as gases of rubidium, sodium\r\nand other alkali vapors.  The multi-species systems under study\r\npresent a wealth of opportunities for future applications,\r\nranging from the controllable formation of ultracold microscopic\r\npatterns (in a form of \"quantum lithography\") to the realization\r\nof quantum gates and switches, that, in turn, aim towards the\r\nlonger term goal of enabling quantum computation. \r\n",
