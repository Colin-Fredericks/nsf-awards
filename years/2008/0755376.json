 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \r\nis hosting a Summer Information Technology Research Experience for Undergraduates \r\n(SITe-REU) under the direction of Professor W. Richards (Rick) Adrion. We are \r\nrecruiting students in community college pathways, i.e., students planning to \r\ntransfer or who have transferred to 4-year programs. Minorities and women are \r\nproportionally better represented in IT associates degree programs than they \r\nare in bachelors programs. These students often are the first in their families \r\nto attend college, may lack family and community mentoring and role models, \r\nfrequently are focused on job opportunities, and seldom think about graduate \r\nprograms or research careers. Reaching out to this diverse student population \r\nto attract, retain and nurture them in upper division and graduate programs is \r\nthe primary goal of our REU Site. We are partnering with three NSF BPC, two \r\nLSAMP, and one EGEP alliances and others to cast a wide net and bring a diverse \r\nset of students into positive research experiences. \r\n\r\nEach spring we will select 10 rising juniors or seniors to participate in a \r\n10-week summer research experience. We identified research projects for the \r\nstudents that emphasize fundamental computer science that is core to addressing \r\na broad set of IT challenges. Projects include: Robotics (sensor fusion for \r\nmanipulation, emergency detection of immanent collision); Bioinformatics and \r\nBiocomputing (memory, circadian, or tumor modeling, protein folding, gene \r\nregulation); Wireless Networks (the DieselNET location system, database, and \r\ndiagnostics, the TurtleNET wildlife tracking net); Learning Systems (pedagogical \r\nagents for intelligent tutors, jMANIC, Ubiquitous/Auto Presenter); Software \r\nengineering (medical error modeling, dispute resolution systems); Security/Privacy \r\n(medical Devices, RFIDs); and Data Mining (models for social nets).\r\n\r\n",
