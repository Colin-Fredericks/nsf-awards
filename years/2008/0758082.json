These highest energy particles in the Universe are very rare, and the elucidation of the mystery of their origin is one of the key challenges in modern astrophysics. They interact with the cosmic microwave background, as noted in 1966 by Greisen, Zatzepin and Kuz'min. As a result, cosmic rays with energies of ~10**20 eV are strongly attenuated over cosmological distances, and sources nearer than ~50 Mpc are expected to be dominant. The PAO, a large hybrid detector employing both the surface detector and air fluorescence techniques, is nearing completion in Argentina. \r\n\r\nThe Ohio State group has played a key role in the design, integration, commissioning, and management of the surface detector electronics chain and has played a leading role in the development of the detector trigger and the automated detector calibration scheme.  Their analysis efforts benefit from their detailed understanding of the design and operation of the surface detector and they plan to continue their activities in support of detector operation and maintenance, and participation in the analysis of the Auger data. \r\n\r\nThe group has been active in engaging the public and providing opportunities for understanding the fascinating science involved in cosmic rays, by conducting tours of facilities both in the U.S. and in Argentina for schoolchildren and others. They are engaged in a program of education and outreach through a partnership with a local high school, where they are introducing students to cosmic ray research.",
