 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the development and analysis of numerical\r\nalgorithms to simulate materials which exhibit intricate rheological\r\nbehavior or mechanical response due to their microstructural\r\nmakeup. For example, elastic properties of particulates, molecules, or\r\ncells of a material frequently influence the macroscopic properties.\r\nThese materials are modeled by formidable systems of partial\r\ndifferential equations, and it is important to develop numerical\r\nschemes to faithfully represent the mathematical structure of these\r\nmodels.  Tools from partial differential equations, continuum\r\nmechanics, and numerical analysis, will be used to analyze numerical\r\nschemes to simulate these systems. Past experience has shown that new\r\nmathematical tools can lead to numerical schemes which inherit\r\nimportant structural properties of these models, and that a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the current schemes frequently leads to improved and\r\nsimpler algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially all biological and manufactured materials exhibit complex\r\nmacroscopic behavior due to their fine scale makeup. Examples include\r\nmicro electromechanical systems (MEMS); biological fluids; ink for ink\r\njet devices; semiconductors; liquid crystals; and metals undergoing\r\nplastic deformation.  Predicting material response is an essential\r\ntechnology needed to determine biological or physiological function;\r\nor to design and manufacture these materials; or for the design of the\r\nmultitudes of devices which use their special properties. This\r\nresearch will improve our understanding of the mathematical models and\r\nthe computational tools used to accomplish these tasks.  The equations\r\nused to model such phenomena are complex and poorly understood, and\r\nmuch of the research is directed to revealing the theoretical\r\n(mathematical) properties of these models. This work complements the\r\nmore practical approaches undertaken in the engineering community and\r\nat the national laboratories.",
