 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the production of a flexible, low cost, solar cell which can be used for the conversion of solar radiation to electricity or hydrogen.  The proposed work will involve working on increasing the efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cell by increasing the connectivity of the anatase network in a low temperature scalable process. Over the course of this work, solar cells with power conversion efficiency greater than 5% will be developed.  Concurrently optimization of these electrodes for use in a photoelectrochemical cell for hydrogen production will occur. \r\n\r\nDye sensitized solar cells have not become a major player in the solar market partly because of the low efficiencies that have been achieved to date with low-cost flexible substrates. The technology being pursued will both increase the efficiency of the cell and reduce the cost of production, a combination that will directly compete with other solar harvesting platforms.  In addition to the use in electricity production, the proposed technology has the potential to expand quickly to hydrogen generation for transportation needs. \r\n",
