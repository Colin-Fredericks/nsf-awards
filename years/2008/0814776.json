The investigators will design new assessments to gather evidence of complex science learning that incorporate recent changes in the practice of science and mathematics.  They will conduct research on how to apply a new generation of dynamic science assessments, their construct validity and compare student performance on tasks and items in static, active, and interactive modes. The project will provide new information on the construct validity of technology-enhanced assessment tasks and items designed to measure complex science learning.  The investigators compare the construct validity of dynamic (both active and interactive) assessment tasks to those of static formats intended to measure the same complex learning.  They hope to be able to identify principles for types of science assessment task design structures that incorporate technology to elicit knowledge of science systems and inquiry abilities.  The investigation is in collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).   \r\n",
