 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nSang Wu Kim\r\nIowa State University\r\nFault-Tolerant Cooperative Communication in Large-Scale Wireless Networks\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a fundamentally new cooperative communication architecture that is inherently self-scalable, robust in the presence of transmission errors and malicious attacks, and allows decentralized network operation with flexibility for topology changes in large-scale wireless networks with noisy channels.  The approach is to concatenate the parities of previous hops with those of the next hop such that the error correction capability grows with the number of hops in a multiplicative manner, generate parities randomly independent of other relay nodes, and exploit node cooperation using cross-layer design to obtain mutual benefits beyond those of traditional cross-layer cooperation within individual nodes.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, this work considers practical cooperative communication methodologies that promote efficient and secure data transmission in noisy, large-scale wireless networks.  Because of analytical challenges, much of the prior research in this area has been limited to capacity bounds for small-scale networks.  Thus, the existing body of knowledge is limited with respect to delivering the benefits of cooperative communication, providing error probability results, and accounting for the complexity of large-scale networks.  This research attempts to address this limit.\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, the research has the potential to improve the design and operation of many types of wireless networks, including embedded networks, wireless sensor networks, ad-hoc networks, mesh networks, and cellular networks.  These networks have a wide range of applications, including surveillance, health and environmental monitoring, public safety, and emergency response.  Research outcomes are integrated with undergraduate and graduate education.  Research outcomes will also be used in a demonstration program for local high school students with the goal of broadening participation in engineering.",
