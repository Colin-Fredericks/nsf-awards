One component of this project focuses on the\r\nevolution of gravitational and surface tension induced free\r\nsurface instabilities in viscous fluids, which give rise to\r\ncoherent structures like fluid droplets, ridges and jets. \r\nPerturbative techniques and computational studies lead toward a\r\ndescription of large-scale condensation and geophysical\r\nprocesses.  A second component of the project involves dynamical\r\nmodels of material microstructures.  Patterning in systems with\r\nnonlocal interactions, such as block copolymer mixtures, is\r\nstudied from the point of view of dynamical development,\r\nutilizing formal and numerical approximations, and homogenization\r\ntechniques that yield statistical descriptions.  The motion of\r\ngrain boundaries in crystalline surface evolution and pattern\r\nformation equations also is investigated, seeking to characterize\r\nthe singular structures that emerge both from energetic and\r\ngeometric perspectives. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies how fluid and solid interfaces move\r\nand interact in complicated, large systems.  Models and\r\nsimulations are developed that are used to explain laboratory\r\nobservations and that have capabilities to predict and control\r\ndynamics for design and manufacturing.  Fluid flows that are\r\nstudied have applications ranging from industrial coatings to\r\ngeophysical morphology, such as cave formations.  The solid\r\nsystems of interest include block copolymers, \"designer\"\r\nmaterials that hold considerable promise for nano-engineering. \r\nThe project also includes educational aims that expose\r\nundergraduates to modeling and computation and train graduate\r\nstudents for scientific careers.",
