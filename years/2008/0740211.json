 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to develop novel protein scaffolds for the targeting of specific molecules in vivo. The technology, based on site directed mutagenesis of specific residues, would enable the creation of a diverse library for screening against targets of interest.  Specific targeting of molecules on the surface of cells is one of most powerful methods for delivery of drugs, or disruption of disease associated binding events.  \r\n\r\nHuman monoclonal antibodies are currently used to target cell surface receptors in order to treat some cancers and autoimmune disease. Use of aptamers is also showing promise for targeting specific molecules that are involved in disease processes. Yet, other methodologies are being developed to target molecules of interest.  The proposed technology would provide a complementary therapeutic modality that could broaden the repertoire of the presently available target-specific, immunoglobulin-based, as well as other therapeutic modalities.  As such, the technology may open the door to the treatment of many other types of diseases where molecule specific targeting is desirable.  \r\n",
