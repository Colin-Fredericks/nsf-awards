 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient signal representation is critical in virtually all \r\ndisciplines of science. Sparse representations have recently drawn much \r\nattention from the signal processing community. The basic model \r\nconsists of considering that natural signals admit a sparse \r\ndecomposition as a combination of very few atoms in some redundant \r\ndictionary. Recent results have shown that learning overcomplete \r\nnon-parametric dictionaries for image representation, instead of using \r\nclassical off-the-shelf ones, significantly improves numerous image and \r\nvideo processing tasks. This research aims at developing a \r\ncomprehensive theoretical, computational, and practical framework for \r\nlearning sparse representations for numerous signal analysis tasks.\r\n\r\nFirst, the research concentrates on learning sparse representations for \r\nglobal and local robust image classification tasks, proposing \r\nformulations with both sparse reconstruction and class discrimination \r\ncomponents, jointly optimized during dictionary learning. Multiscale \r\ndictionary learning and investigating a number of critical optimization \r\nchallenges are integral components of this project as well. The \r\nframework of learning multiscale sparse representations is then \r\nextended to multimodal data. As in the work with images and video, the \r\nenergies proposed for multimodality consider both reconstructive and \r\ndiscriminative terms, learning the optimal representations both for the \r\ngiven data and the given tasks. In addition to image, video, and audio, \r\nother signal modalities studied include tensors, which are critical in \r\ndiffusion MRI, and bring the additional challenge of developing sparse \r\nrepresentations for non-flat data. The proposed work is also extended \r\nto learning to sense, where combined with the learning of the optimal \r\ndictionaries, the learning of the best linear sensing procedures is \r\nstudied.\r\n",
