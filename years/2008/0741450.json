 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in support of a project will produce a complete list of the aquatic animal species of the Alto Pur\u00fas National Park, a poorly known and vulnerable region of tropical rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon. The main goals are: (1) Discovery of species new to science; (2) research and teaching collections deposited in museums of natural history; (3) internet and printed field guides with illustrated identification keys, photographs and associated databases; (4) data for testing hypotheses on the origins and maintenance of species in a complex tropical ecosystem; and (5) a long term biodiversity monitoring plan. \r\n\r\nThis project will coordinate efforts of scientists from North and South America and Europe, provide multiple student training opportunities, and advance knowledge of the biodiversity a region with rich but threatened biological resources.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in advanced methods of molecular and morphological analysis. The approximately 6,000 species of Neotropical fishes represent over half of the world's freshwater fishes, and about 10% of all vertebrate species. The results of this detailed species-level inventory will directly address hypotheses on the origins and maintenance of species-rich tropical aquatic faunas, and help illuminate the structure of Amazonian aquatic diversity. The Office of International Science and Engineering is assisting in funding this award in recognition of the strong international collaboration and international experience for US students.  \r\n",
