 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Siwy and her group at the University of California, Irvine will study single nanopores therefore 'holes' whose diameter is 100,000 smaller than the thickness of a human hair. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Prof. Siwy and coworkers are addressing questions to understand the transport of ions and charged molecules through nanopores whose geometry and surface characteristics will be fully controlled. Transport properties of nanopores differ greatly from those of micrometer-sized pores. It is because the increased surface to volume ratio causes ions and molecules passing through the nanopore to be strongly influenced by the properties of the pore walls.  The researchers will examine interactions of transported ions with the pore walls and study the relation between structure of nanopores and their transport properties. New methods will be developed to pattern surface charge of nanopores so that a maximum control of ionic transport is achieved. \r\n\r\n         Success of this project will lead to the development of new and improved devices that would be applicable in biosensing, lab-on-a-chip, and nanofluidic systems. The project will help us to understand interactions of ions and charged molecules with surfaces in nanopores. These nanopores have a volume domain that is below femto-liters. The research of Prof. Siwy will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in surface chemistry, nanofabrication, biophysics and biotechnology. The education program of this Career Award is focused on organizing visits of middle and high school students to UC Irvine combined with research experience in nanotechnology. The outreach activities for high schools will be done in collaboration with the UCI School Partnership in Research and Information Technology (SPIRIT) program.",
