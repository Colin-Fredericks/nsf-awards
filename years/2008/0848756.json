 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is aimed at closing the gap between the relatively new\r\nautonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) hardware and\r\ncontrol system technology, and the design conceptualization tools needed to\r\nassess their impact on unit load storage and retrieval ULS/R operations.\r\nThe proposed research will advance the analytical foundations of AVS/RS\r\nmodeling through development of a new class of specialized queuing network\r\nmodels and lead to creation and deployment of analytical conceptualization\r\ntools comparable to those available for crane-based automated storage and\r\nretrieval system (CBAS/RS's). The models developed through this research\r\nwill capture several unique features of AVS/R operations such as vehicle\r\nand lift interfacing, storage and retrieval interference effects, selective\r\ntransaction dispatching, consolidated load buffering, and explicit linkage\r\nof S/R operations with in-process material flows. The proposed research\r\nwill be conducted as a joint effort between Rensselaer Polytechnic\r\nInstitute and University of Louisville, with active participation of\r\nindustry. In terms of educational activities, this project will lead to\r\nmultiple doctoral theses and undergraduate student research opportunities\r\nat the two participating universities. The project will lead to the\r\ndevelopment of media-rich multimedia based educational modules that can be\r\nused in universities and industry. \r\n\r\nThe conceptualization tools developed in this research will enable accurate\r\nand efficient prediction of AVS/RS performance and direct comparisons of\r\nCBAS/R and AVS/R technologies with respect to cost and performance. The\r\nmodels will be deployed through decision support tools that integrate the\r\nsystems level problems of ULS/RS design with several operational level\r\ndecisions for these systems. The project will also lead to the development\r\nof web based instructional modules summarizing the findings of this\r\nproject. Prototype versions of the conceptualizing tools will be\r\ndisseminated to universities and industry with the help of the Material\r\nHandling Institute of America (MHIA).\r\n\r\n",
