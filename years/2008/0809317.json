The conversion has left a highly fragmented and modified ecosystem.  Biodiversity, defined here as genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, is highly influenced by spatial and temporal changes in land cover and land use and has led to extensive hypothesis generating research on atmospheric, soil, and water resources at ASU.  A GK12 theme was developed based on Environmental Sciences Graduate Program faculty research addressing regional biodiversity across ecosystems and organisms.  \r\n\r\nThis project places 8 doctoral Fellows per year in 5 east Arkansas schools to teach 6th ? 8th grade students lessons based on the Fellow?s research.  The four main goals of the project are: 1) Fellows will receive training in best practices pedagogical methods and will gain experience in teaching to a broad range of education and age levels. The Fellows will receive in-depth training in inquiry based education methods that can be applied across the K16 curriculum; 2)  Teachers will receive professional development via workshops covering pedagogical methods, development and implementation of lesson plans and gain a deeper understanding of science content and inquiry based teaching and learning;  3)  Students? will become more interested in STEM and STEM careers and receive an enriched STEM environment; 4)  Partnerships between ASU and school districts will be strengthened.  The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposal are: 1) Fellows also will receive training that will add greatly to their skill set increasing their success of future outreach and educational activities; 2) increase STEM interest, excitement, and career choice of K-12 students; 3) provide teachers exposure to the Fellows? methods and analyses exposing them to the latest techniques; and 4) linkages between higher education and school districts being strengthened and becoming more accessible, especially to underserved populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes from this grant include, but are not limited to, the following accomplishments.\n\nOverview:  In the 5 years of the GK12 grant 6,812 middle school students in 9 rural school districts in the Arkansas Delta were served by ASU graduate Fellows.  Teachers enhanced thier science knowledge and engaged the students in science with the hands-on experiences.  In total, 45 teachers gained knowledge from this experience and were saddened to see the program end.\n\n1. To improve graduate students' communication skills and increase their understanding of their own research.  Over the 5 years of the grant, the Fellows who felt they improved their communication skills was 88%.  All Fellows felt that their communication style had changed and provided specific incidences when they felt this improvement (rating 4.5-5.0 on a scale of 1-5).  An experienced classroom observer also noted good Fellow communication skills in the classroom and noted they werwe able to break down their research into small components and to consider the audience's potential lack of subject knowledge.   \n\n2.  To increase teachers' knowledge and experience working with the Fellows.  Virtually all the teachers felt they gained current knowledge and ideas to improve their science teaching.  During the 5 years no teachers had a negative comment regarding the Fellow in his/her classroom.\n\n3.  Peak student interest in STEM careers through enriched STEM experiences.  The hands-on activities provided by the Fellows provided a 'fun' experience for the students and the fresh face of the Fellow asa Resident Scientist in the classroom allowed the students to realize a STEM career was something they could achieve.  Many of the students in the impoverished Delta had not met adults with a science background outside of their family physician or dentists and they realized there are other science careers that are offered.  Teachers noted that the students looked forward to the Fellows' visits and there was jealousy from classes without Fellows.  \n\n4.  Strengthen partnerships between ASU and school districts and communities.  Visits to ASU were common during the 5 years of the grant and field trips to ASU field stations also allowed the students, teachers and parents to observe what ASU has to offer.  A few of the teachers even decided to continue his/her education at ASU and many of the students insist that they will be attending ASU following high school.  Many of these students do not come from families with college degrees and some stated the only person he/she knows with a college degree is a teacher and physician.  The Fellow gave a young diverse face to let the student realize college and STEM goals can be achieved.  Communities were also very impressed with the program and random letters were received throughout the 5 years providing accolades about the Fellow and the GK12 program. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer Bouldin"
