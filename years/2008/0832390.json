 "awd_abstract_narration": "Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Health Organization Transformation \r\n\r\n0832439 Texas A&M University System (lead institution); Larry Gamm \r\n0832390 Georgia Institute of Technology; Eva Lee \r\n     \r\nTexas A &M Health Science Center and Georgia Tech propose a center \"Center for Health Organization Transformation\"(CHOT)to conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change. The proposed work can result in improved health care quality and more effective use of financial and system resources in the delivery of health care. The research is designed to produce transformation in a critical industry, and the proposed team makes a credible case that the scope of the problem indicates a need for whole-system, transformative change.\r\n\r\nSince the health care sector is a significant segment of the US economy, enabling more effective use of resources within this sector could positively impact the economy. More specifically, the proposed research will benefit quality of patient care, operations efficiency of the healthcare delivery systems, and workforce transformation. These successes will be propagateda cross the practicing health systems in the nation through the center's industrial partners as well as the center directors and investigators.Research teams for the proposed center are made up of a diverse set of research faculty and graduate students,working closely with health system leaders. The center activities will support improvements in both masters' and doctoral level education and research.  Broader dissemination will occur via professional and academic associations and conferences,and other mechanisms.  Both schools are committed to inclusion of a diverse faculty and student body.",
