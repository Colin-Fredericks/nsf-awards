 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research introduces team incentives to incentives pupils in developing countries in order to compare team incentives with individual incentives.  This research answers the following questions: Are team incentives better than individualized incentives? What are the pupils' interactions under the team incentive treatment?  What is the impact of team incentives on the gender gap in educational achievement?\r\n\r\nA randomized experiment is designed in Benin (West Africa) to compare team incentives and individualized incentives in two settings:  a target based scheme and a tournament scheme. Pupils are randomly assigned into four different treatment groups.  In the first treatment, a set of teams are promised a prize if the team realizes a specified target of achievements. The target is a composite of criteria including the number of students in the group who passed the national examination, the scores in selected subjects such as math and history. In the second treatment, the teams compete over three big prizes. The top three teams with the highest achievements are rewarded. Similar incentives are also provided to two other groups of students on an individualized basis. A fifth group will receive no treatment and serves as a baseline comparison group.\r\n\r\nThe randomization permits to disentangle the causal effect of the treatment from other factors. A baseline survey allows the controlling for unbalanced observables across groups where necessary. \r\n\r\nBy ranking these different methods in terms of their cost effectiveness, this research serves as a tool for education policy makers in developing countries.  Beyond the research questions of interest, this research will benefit pupils monetarily and presumably in terms of academic achievement. More importantly, this work could point to an affordable incentive scheme that can be adopted by poor countries in many domains. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
