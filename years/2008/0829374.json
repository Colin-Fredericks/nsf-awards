This project will conduct statistical analysis of a large international survey, PISA, to describe student understanding of environmental topics.  The goal is to advice the development of curriculum policy, teacher education and science education.  The analysis will include a description in variations in students' knowledge of, and attitudes towards the environment.  The OEDC's PISA 2006, a testing and survey of 15 year-olds in over 50 nations, is a yet to be analyzed rich source of information on the outcomes of secondary school education in environmental sciences.",
