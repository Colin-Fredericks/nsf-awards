This is a holistic project that concentrates on all stages of a STEM student's undergraduate experience and combines the strengths of the University's support infrastructure with efforts and expertise of faculty, staff, students, administrators, and the professional community, while building on research, best practices, and local lessons learned.  The major strategies incorporated in the STEP program plan of activities are: a Calculus Bootcamp Summer Bridge Program; an Undergraduate Research Program; Peer Learning and Mentoring Initiatives, Faculty Development Efforts, Development of Learning Communities; and Engagement with professional student organizations on campus.",
