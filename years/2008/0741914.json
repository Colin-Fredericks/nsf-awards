 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the model of an RCN for NMR of Biological Solids (RCN-NBS) established in 2003, this RCN project on Emerging Methodologies for Molecular Structure Determination of Biological Solids will coordinate technique-intensive application of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), cryoelectron microscopy (CEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy with the goal of advancing knowledge on the molecular structure and mechanical properties of biomacromolecular assemblies that are not amenable to study by traditional crystallographic methods.  The RCN-SCN community will establish open and frequent communication among groups of university, government, and industrial researchers across the United States and worldwide in order to address fundamental questions regarding the molecular architecture and interactions of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, pharmaceuticals, plant polymers, and soil organic matter.  The specific strategies used to broadly share and disseminate technical expertise and scientific results will include: (1) member recruitment using informal meetings, poster presentations, and brochure distribution at scientific conferences; (2) hands-on user workshops hosted by network participants and focused on specialized methodologies or biological applications; (3) short 'fundamentals' courses introducing nonspecialists to ssNMR, CEM, and SPM of protein assemblies, lipid membranes, and plant surfaces; (4) research-inspired undergraduate laboratory exercises focusing on SPM and ssNMR of biological solids; (5) cyberinfrastructure development for remote access to SPM; (6) annual symposia held at the New York Structural Biology Center, Texas A&M University, or major national meeting sites for the biophysics and nanotechnology communities; (7) a yearly laboratory course on plant macromolecular assemblies for high school students; (8) research collaboration roundtable events to explore CEM, SPM, and ssNMR synergies for understudied biological solids such as soil organic matter; (9) a community website that will announce events, facilitate registration, permit distribution of course materials, and provide a technical clearinghouse for researchers and instructors located at the various institutions.  A Steering Committee will evaluate progress by periodically setting and assessing goals for the number and balance of activities and attendees, with particular emphasis on activities that cross methodological boundaries and encourage participation of early-career and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this activity will include the establishment of essential infrastructure to achieve a comprehensive molecular understanding of the macromolecular assemblies under study by the participating scientists and enhance research training in scanning probe microscopy, cryoelectron microscopy, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of biological solids for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  Through dissemination of technical information to the larger biological scientific community, this RCN  activity will also foster heightened awareness and cross-communication regarding the molecular information that is beginning to emerge using these sophisticated experimental techniques at the participating institutes and their counterparts worldwide.  The students and faculty who host RCN-SCN workshops and courses will acquire improved leadership and teaching skills that are fundamental to their career development.  Finally, these activities using SCN methodologies will foster the participation of female structural biologists by emphasizing informal professional contacts and will welcome undergraduates and high school students from underrepresented ethnic populations by offering innovative laboratory programs.\r\n",
