 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monocots (including such groups as grasses, palms, orchids, and philodendrons) include more than 65,000 species of flowering plants, occur in almost all habitats, and provide the great majority of the human diet.  A definitive family tree for this group will be developed and used to understand the broad-scale evolution of monocots over geologic time. A total of 23 genes in 601 species, whole chloroplast genomes in 175 species, and all genes expressed in 50 species will be sequenced and used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this group. Additionally, phenotypic data from living and fossil species will be collected, and all data will be analyzed integratively to provide a comprehensive understanding of monocot evolution.\r\n\r\nThe resulting family tree will provide the foundation for many new studies in physiology, ecology, biogeography, and genomics of flowering plants. Web access to all data and results will be provided to researchers and K-12 teachers and students.  Several post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates will be trained, and four young faculty will be supported. A museum exhibit on the evolution of flowering plants will be produced for high-profile venues in New York, Chicago, Denver, and Berkeley, and a children's monocot garden exhibit will be developed at the New York Botanical Garden.  Posters illustrating monocot diversity and evolution will be distributed to colleges, and staff will give talks at public high schools.",

Using sequences of entire chloroplast DNA complement (plastome) of over 100 monocots representing several dozen families, we identified the closest relatives of the economically paramount grass family and resolved relationships among all families in its order Poales (which contains the grasses, sedges, and 13 other lineages).  We showed that wind pollination in the order Poales has arisen five times independently, and characterized some additional factors promoting wind pollination and its frequent evolution in this order.\n\nWe demonstrated that the bromeliad family &ndash; whose affinities have long been obscure based on both morphology and DNA sequences &ndash; are sister to the remainder of the order Poales, and with its ancestor having diverged from the others roughly 100 million years ago.  Within the bromeliads, we and our international collaborators produced a new phylogeny showing that the present-day genera and subfamilies began diverging from each other only 23 million years ago.  Our data support a deductive model for bromeliad evolution, helping account for the sequences in which several key traits (epiphytism, the tank habit, avian pollination, life in montane habitats) evolved and in which several biogeographic areas in the New World Tropics were colonized.  We found that the net rates of species diversification in bromeliads were most closely tied to life in geographically extensive cordilleras (the Andes and the Serra do Mar in Brazil), to the evolution of epiphytism and the tank habit, and to adaptation to hummingbird pollination.\n\nWe produced the first fully resolved, strongly supported family tree (or phylogeny) for the orchids based on over 60,000 aligned bases from the coding regions of the chloroplast genome.
