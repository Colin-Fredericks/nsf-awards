 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gottlieb\r\nDMS-0802974\r\n\r\n     The overall goal of this project is to prepare undergraduate\r\nmathematics students for, and engage them in, a sustained\r\nresearch experience in computational mathematics.  The PI and her\r\ncolleagues at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth integrate\r\nresearch in scientific computing into the undergraduate\r\ncurriculum by designing research-based courses from the Freshman\r\nlevel upwards, and engaging upper-level students in a sustained\r\nand significant research experience.  The project creates an\r\nintegrated undergraduate research experience by engaging students\r\nin research from the introductory level through graduation,\r\ncompletely embedding research into the undergraduate curriculum. \r\nThe essence of this approach is to mentor students into genuine\r\nresearch problems and research methods in computational science,\r\nbeginning with senior high school students for recruitment\r\npurposes, freshman and sophomore students for orientation to\r\nresearch in computational science through carefully selected\r\nresearch topics, and culminating in major senior undergraduate\r\nresearch projects where an expected outcome is professional\r\npresentation at a SIAM, AMS or MAA meeting, and preparation of a\r\npublishable research paper.  An integral part of this project\r\ninvolves the identification, training, and support of students\r\nfrom groups not normally well-represented in scientific\r\ncomputing, to encourage and support diversity in this field. \r\nThis project engages students in an integrated program that leads\r\nthem from the use of computational tools in course work to the\r\ndevelopment and use of computational tools in research projects. \r\nIt serves as a model for a curriculum that stimulates research\r\nactivity in computational science as an integral part of a\r\nmathematics degree program, from the freshman year onwards. \r\n\r\n     The overriding goal of this project is to include and\r\nintegrate research activities into the undergraduate mathematics\r\ncurriculum.  This program revolutionizes the teaching of\r\nmathematics at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth by\r\nincluding research-based activities in courses across the\r\nundergraduate mathematics curriculum.  This project has a\r\nsignificant impact on the structure of undergraduate courses by\r\nintroducing research seminars from the freshman year, linking\r\nstudents across year levels in common goals and cohorts, and\r\nstimulating new research-based courses in computational science. \r\nFurthermore, outreach to high school students and their\r\nmathematics teachers has an impact on awareness of the field of\r\ncomputational mathematics and careers in computational science. \r\nThe approach of this project recognizes that students can be\r\nattracted to and prepared for a career in scientific computing by\r\nengaging in genuine research-based activities throughout their\r\nundergraduate education.  The benefit of this approach is that it\r\nbuilds a stronger and more diverse population of computational\r\nscientists by attracting talented students to the field of\r\nscientific computing and training them in the tools and analysis\r\nof numerical methods for solution of various real-world problems. \r\nThe project is supported by the MPS Division of Mathematical\r\nSciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the\r\nEHR Division of Undergraduate Education. \r\n\r\n",
