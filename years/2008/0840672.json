 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the effects of morphology on the crystallization of silicon carbide nanowires and the performance of field effect transistors based on the same. Nanowire transistors are of interest for use in high speed computers among other applications. The nanowire dimensions will be systematically varied to investigate the effect on recrystallization temperature. Transistors will then be fabricated with these nanowires and performance characteristics will be evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is an increased understanding of annealing and crystallization in nanostructures. This work expands on what is known through a systematic exploration of the effect of diameter and length on such thermal transitions. In addition, it will elucidate the roles of morphology and dimensionality in controlling nanostructure crystallization, and extend our knowledge beyond nanostructures based on elemental solids to those based on compounds. The results of this can be applied to numerous other nanostructures.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact is to enable the incorporation of nanoelectronics into integrated circuits without requiring significant and costly redesign of existing manufacturing lines. The combined performance advantages of nanowire transistors vs. conventional devices and the ability of silicon carbide to operate at high power levels and high temperatures would be of substantial benefit to the aerospace, automotive, defense, power and telecommunications industries. The demonstration of a method to easily enable commercial scale implementation would have a significant impact on the competitiveness of the semiconductor industry internationally. Students involved in this project will gain exposure to advanced nanoelectronics fabrication techniques.\r\n",
