 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professors Diana Aga, Jochen Autschbach, and Frank Bright of the University at Buffalo are developing stable and highly selective molecularly imprinted xerogel sorbents for clean-up and pre-concentration of environmental samples for analysis.  Synthesis and selection of sorbents with high selectivity and affinity is based on a high-throughput combinatorial production and screening approach, augmented by ab-initio and semiempirical quantum chemical computations.  The work includes fundamental studies of the environmental fate of residues of pharmaceutical contaminants in soil using a combination of mass spectrometric techniques and 14C-labeled tracers.  Results from this research will improve analytical capabilities for accurately identifying and quantifying unknown antibiotic degradates in the environment. \r\n\r\nResults from these studies will provide decision makers with information to accurately assess and, if necessary, mitigate aquatic and human exposure to other pharmaceutical contaminants.  Further, this project will provide unique research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students because they will be exposed to various aspects of quantitative and qualitative analysis, theoretical chemistry, and issues in environmental chemistry, government regulations, and agricultural sciences. \r\n",
