 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bradley University is recruiting six undergraduate students to participate in a 10-week summer research experience in ecology. Students will be exposed to molecular, physiological, organismal, community and ecosystem approaches. Although individual students will be responsible for a particular project, they will also work collaboratively with other REU students and faculty mentors on related projects. REU participants will be expected to submit a final report and to present their results at an end-of-program research symposium. Participants will be immersed in a culture that (1) integrates research and educational activities throughout and beyond the classroom, (2) fosters and supports multi-investigator, multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary collaborations, (3) introduces students to the broader scientific community through multiple university collaborations and research at multi-investigator research sites and (4) shows the highest commitment to supporting faculty-student research. Selection criteria include (1) a minimum grade point average of 3.0 and the successful completion of two years of Biology and one year of Chemistry; (2) letters of recommendation; (3) a statement of research interests; and (4) a statement of career goals. Applicants not meeting the stated criteria will also be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minority students are encouraged to apply. REU students will be provided on-campus housing and will receive a stipend and meal allowance. More information is available at http://www.bradley.edu/academics/las/bio/summerreu.html or by contacting Kelly McConnaughay at kdm@bradley.edu.",

Additionally, the laboratories\nstudents were placed in hosted high school students in Bradley University\u00c6s\nBEST (Building Excellent Scientists for Tomorrow) program or supported by NSF RAHSS supplements.  The melding of the REU and BEST programs provided a research community that allowed the REU students to engage as both researchers and peer-mentors, and encouraged the development\nof communication and leadership skills needed by professionals in scientific\nfields.  These activities are designed to foster workforce development and retain youth in science and engineering fields.\n\nDuring our four-year program, we engaged nineteen students in research, including eleven students from outside our campus.  Four of these students were from community colleges and one was from an HBCU.  Of our nineteen students, we worked with twelve female students, six African American students, two Hispanic students and one Native American student.  All of the students in the program were provided experience in experimental design, hypothesis testing, and data analysis.
