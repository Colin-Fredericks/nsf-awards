 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a pathfinder system for the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), a next-generation array of very many antennas that will be used to probe many large-scale facets of the universe. One project of the MWA is to attempt to make sensitive, low-frequency observations from its radio-quiet site in Western Australia, to search for redshifted hydrogen from near the earliest epochs of the universe. As part of the project, much will be learned about observing at low frequencies with large arrays of individual antennas. This project will fund a the acquisition of a large (500 terrabyte) archive to store much of the raw data obtained from the MWA, which can then be studied and reprocessed at later dates to refine the design of similar future instruments.",
