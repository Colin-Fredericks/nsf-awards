 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research program will develop high power, large area, deep ultraviolet LEDs based on a novel vertically conducting geometry that is arbitrarily scalable. AlInGaN based deep ultraviolet LEDs have recently been developed and commercialized. The performance of these UV LEDs has increased resulting in external quantum efficiency of the devices being approximately 2% with 1-2 mW of output power generated in continuous operating mode. Despite this initial success, the output power from these devices is far below that which is required for penetration of some of the largest UV market segments (e.g. water and air purification). This research will develop vertically conducting large area LEDs with expected minimum output powers of 10 mW per 1 mm x 1 mm device. This performance will allow for penetration into large existing UV market segments. \r\n\r\nDeep ultraviolet light emitting diodes represent a new opportunity for commercialization of semiconductor products for component and systems use. U.S. based manufacturers have succeeded in competing globally in the visible LED market with two of the five largest LED manufacturers being based in the U.S. with two in Japan and one in Germany. This optoelectronic field continues to grow each year and the expertise gained through this program will contribute to the advancement of a novel light source.\r\n",
