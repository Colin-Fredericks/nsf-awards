 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate proof-of-concept of an innovative processing method for yielding commercial-grade plastic (polymer) materials derived solely from biobased resources such as plant proteins.  The proposed method for conditioning and processing wheat gluten will lead to a hard plastic material that is fully biocompatible and biodegradable.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed production method is expected to result in cost-competitive biobased polymer products with mechanical and performance attributes comparable to, or better than, those of their synthetic plastic counterparts.  Plastic materials that are made entirely from plant proteins are natural, and will, therefore, reduce pollution of the environment caused by toxic chemicals used in synthetic plastic manufacture and by non-degradable plastic waste accumulation. The proposed study will have a strong educational component through Drexel's Co-op Undergraduate Education Program.",
