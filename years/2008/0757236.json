 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal in this proposal is to develop the mathematical foundations and\r\nassociated computational methods for the study of convex sets in real\r\nalgebraic geometry. This work requires a combination of ideas and\r\nmathematical tools from optimization, analysis, algebra and combinatorics.\r\nThe proposed program will lead not only to theoretical insights, but also to\r\nnew algorithms and software that will enable novel applications in\r\nmathematics, engineering, and beyond. The work is organized in five main\r\nthrusts: semidefinite programming and sums of squares, convex semi-algebraic\r\nsets, sparsity and graphical structure, numerical polynomial optimization\r\nand applications, and deformations and variation of parameters. The PIs will\r\nfocus on the development of a comprehensive theory and practical new\r\nalgorithms for convex sets defined by polynomial inequalities. Specific\r\nproblems and techniques include the formulation of semidefinite descriptions\r\nof convex hulls of real algebraic varieties, determinantal representations\r\nof hyperbolic polynomials, sparse polynomials and their symmetries, tropical\r\ngeometry and homotopy techniques, and geometric programming.\r\n\r\nMany areas in mathematics, as well as applications in engineering, finance\r\nand the sciences, require a thorough understanding of convex sets. This is a\r\nclass of geometric shapes, with several different but complementary\r\ninterpretations. The goal in this project is to achieve a better\r\nunderstanding of how these geometric properties emerge from their algebraic\r\ndescriptions in terms of polynomial equations, and the corresponding\r\ncomputational implications. One of the main motivations is the possibility\r\nof applying these results in the context of optimization. The proposed\r\nresearch will contribute to existing knowledge, both in algebraic-geometric\r\ntechniques as well as in mathematical optimization. It will create synergies\r\nbetween different branches of applied mathematics, and their engineering and\r\nscientific applications (e.g., in computational biology and statistical\r\nmodeling). Successful completion of this project should contribute to the\r\navailability of efficient and reliable computational tools for solving\r\npolynomial systems, which have clear technological and economic interest.\r\nOther key features of this proposal include its integration with curriculum\r\ndevelopment, undergraduate research projects, training of graduate students\r\nand postdocs, and the development of new software tools for computational\r\noptimization.\r\n",
