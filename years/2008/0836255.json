This preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting\r\nnew research results in the area of computer communications and is widely attended by\r\nresearchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as ICCCN is highly\r\nvaluable for graduate students? research and career development. Participants have the\r\nopportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, and interact\r\nwith many others performing state-of-the-art research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support approximately eight graduate students in the\r\nUnited States to attend ICCCN?08. The travel awards will target graduate students, in\r\nparticular female and under-represented minority students, since they often have limited\r\ntravel funds to attend conferences, which is an important part of their educational\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n",
