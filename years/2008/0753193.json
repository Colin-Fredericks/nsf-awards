 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in Elementary Particle Physics (TASI) during 2008 - 2012 will be held for a four-week period in June at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The aim of TASI is to introduce advanced graduate students to a much broader range of ideas and topics than they normally experience in their home institutions while working on their dissertation topics. TASI has been highly successful in achieving this by providing a series of lectures and seminars on topics of current research in theoretical particle physics and related experimental subjects. Each summer TASI focuses on or two broad topics in theoretical particle physics, the topics chosen (by the Scientific Advisory Committee including the general director) being timely and relevant both from experimental and theoretical point of view. One or two Physicists who are experts on these topics are invited to direct the program in concert with the director who is the PI. TASI-2008 will be held during June 2 - 27, 2008, and the topic is \"Phenomenology of LHC Physics\" and the outside program directors are Professor Tao Han of University of Wisconsin who is well known for his research in collider physics and Professor Robin Erbacher of UC Davis who is involved in CMS. It will cover various models beyond the Standard Model -- Supersymmetry, little Higgs model(s), physics of extra dimensions and string phenomenology -- and their experimental implications at LHC; there will be several mini courses of four/five lectures in each sub-field. Also, there will be several seminars. At TASI there is close interaction between the lecturers and the students, and student among themselves. This is further enhanced by more than half of lecturers staying in student housing and having meals with students; also, student organized seminars on their works leads to collaborative interaction among students.  The broader impacts of this proposal is that \r\nTASI is serving the very useful purpose of training next generations of theoretical high energy physicists to keep U.S.A. in the forefront of this research field in the world. As these trained personnel have a very versatile background in physics and mathematics, they have contributed and will continue to contribute in the task of keeping the country abreast in physical sciences and related fields. TASI has started having videos of lectures available to the worldwide audience, and this will certainly be useful to the high energy physics community at large.\r\n",
