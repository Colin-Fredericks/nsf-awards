 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two different hypotheses for the relationship between the Congo and \r\nKalahari cratons, during the Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinent cycles, \r\nwill be evaluated. Co-funding for this work has been provided by the \r\nOffice of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nCongo and Kalahari presently reside within Africa and are juxtaposed \r\nacross the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi orogenic system.\r\nThe primary controversy surrounding the assembly of these two cratons  \r\nin the supercontinent cycle centers on the extent to which Congo and  \r\nKalahari remained associated geographically throughout the cycle,  \r\ni.e., were the two cratons directly adjacent to one another in  \r\nRodinia, and, did they remain so until amalgamated in Gondwana, or  \r\nwas one (or both) not in Rodinia at all and were not joined until  \r\nGondwana formed?  The metamorphosed sedimentary detritus within the  \r\nDamara orogenic zone records the separation of these blocks from  \r\nRodinia and accretion within Gondwana.  The U/Pb age and Hf-isotopic  \r\ncompositions of detrial zircons from the metasedimenatry rocks, along  \r\nwith whole-rock Nd isotopes, will be measured to define the origin of the  \r\ncontinental detritus in the suture zone.  The significance of the  \r\nalternative hypotheses relates to the configuration of Rodinia, the  \r\namalgamation of Gondwana (E-W or N-S final suturing), and the degree  \r\nto which Rodinia was fragmented during break-up.\r\n\r\nThe accretion and dispersal of supercontinents remains one of the  \r\nmost significant problems in understanding global dynamics and motions \r\nof continents through time and the convection of rock in the mantle.   \r\nThe growth and break-up of two supercontinents in late Precambrian  \r\ntime ? Rodinia and Gondwana ? are particularly significant for  \r\nunderstanding the supercontinent cycle, because they overlap the  \r\ndevelopment and dispersal of complex life forms in the shallow oceans  \r\nalong their margins.  The hypotheses being tested in this project  \r\nhave implications for the dispersal and source of sediment in the  \r\nshallow seas, the initiation and proliferation of early life in those seas,\r\nthe evolving  paleoclimatic system of the planet, and the time that the\r\nyounger supercontinent cycle of Pangea initiated.",
