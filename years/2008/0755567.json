 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) with co-funding from the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) supports the renewal of a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at California State University Los Angeles (CSULA) for the summers of 2008-2010.  The site will be directed by Scott Nickolaisen from the Department Chemistry and Biochemistry at CSULA.  This program will provide ten undergraduate students with research experience for 10-weeks in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, environmental, and biochemistry.  The primary objective of this REU site is to provide a comprehensive research experience for community college students who have had little, if any, prior exposure to research activities. All students selected to participate in the program will be community college students who are in second year chemistry classes in public community colleges in the Los Angeles Basin.  Optional workshops will be held through out the ten week program, that cover ethics, applying to graduate school, SciFinder scholar training, and training in reading scientific literature.  A research symposium will be hosted by the CSULA Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at the completion of the program where each REU participant will present their research findings.",
