 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaul Mukamel of the University of California Irvine is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to continue his research program aimed at developing theoretical and computational methods for predicting the response of molecules to various external fields, such as light, electric current and other molecules.  New experimental approaches related to multidimensional coherent ultrafast laser spectroscopy and to electric current measurements on molecules in quantum junctions are suggested by this theoretical work.  A set of tools for their analysis in real space and real time is being developed in the course of the research:  signatures of exciton transport in coherent femtosecond optical spectroscopy of chromophore aggregates are being identified; the statistics of single electron transfer events in junctions and of photons emitted in single molecule spectroscopy are being predicted and will be used to explore quantum generalizations of fluctuation theorems connected with the distribution of work and entropy production of driven systems; fluctuations and response functions of quantum systems in nonequilibrium steady states and undergoing transitions between steady states are being studied; and techniques of quantum electrodynamics are being used to predict photon counting statistics and establish fundamental connections between time and frequency resolved nonlinear response functions. This is providing a microscopic description of the incoming and signal fields and allowing the PI and his students to develop new approximation schemes for optical signals.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of electrons and nuclei in molecules can be effectively probed by monitoring their response to external perturbations such as optical fields, electrical currents and even the response of the probed molecule to interactions with neighboring molecules.  Mukamel's work is providing the theoretical tools needed by experimental scientists for analyzing the data produced by different types of experiments.  The work is having a broader impact through its application by scientists around the world as well as through the highly interdisciplinary training received by the students in the group.  The results of this research have been widely disseminated through Mukamel's textbook, \"Principles of Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy,\" which he plans to update and expand in the next period of support.  This is expected to further broaden the impact of the funded work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElementary motions of electrons and nuclei in molecules can be investigated by their response to sequences of ultrafast laser pulses.  These can prepare molecules in specific electronic and vibrational states and provide a multidimensional view of their dynamics and correlations.  Multidimensional signals are obtained by studying the variation of the response with several time delay periods between pulses.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) uses similar concepts for studying spins in the radio wave regime.  Over the past 20 years laser technology had advanced to allow the extension of these ideas to probe femtosecond molecular processes using infrared and visible pulses. \n\nThis program focuses on the design of novel optical experiments for molecules in the condensed phase and the development of theoretical and computational tools for their interpretation.
