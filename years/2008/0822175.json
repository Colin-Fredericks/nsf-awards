 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Algebra Project in Cambridge, MA is developing and conducting research on what it describes as the Cohort Model for addressing the mathematics education of students that perform in the bottom quartile on state and district tests.  The model has the following characteristics: 1) each cohort school commits to four years of reduced class size of 20 students and a common planning period for the teachers; 2) cohort students commit to take mathematics classes every day for 90 minutes for four years and to participate in summer institutes; 3) students use Algebra Project instructional materials for all four years; and 4) teachers agree to 2-3 weeks of professional development per year and classroom visits by Algebra Project team members.  The predicted outcome is that most students will remain in the cohort for all four years and that almost all of those who do will perform well enough on college entrance exams to be admitted and will test out of remedial mathematics courses.",

Nearly all students performed BELOW \"proficient\" in math on the Grade 8 state test.    \n\nIntellectual Merit \n\nGraduation:  In 4 of 5 schools in the multi-site study, Cohort students had 4-year graduation rates (federal formula) above 70% (from 71-80%) (Table 2).  In 3, their graduation rates were 11-32% higher than the non-project students, matched for race, gender, math proficiency and language status. At the 4th school, rates were similar (~75%).

Five graduated, approximating the &lt;70% rates of the other Cohorts. \n\nGrowth in Mathematics Proficiency:  (a) Concept of Function:  Mathematicians Ed Dubinsky (FIU) and Robin Wilson (CSU/Pomona) studied Algebra Project Cohort students\u00c6 development of the function concept at three schools.

This project had an impact both locally and nationally, and in universities as well as schools.  For example, a model materials development site was created at FL Hamer Freedom High School in Bronx, NY, where internationally-known Cornell Geometer David Henderson collaborated with two teachers to implement an innovative sequence in algebra-geometry.
