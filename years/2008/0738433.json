 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of the Tibetan plateau has profoundly changed the Earth's atmospheric\r\ncirculation and climate. For this reason, it has been the prime site to understand the link\r\nbetween tectonics and climate change as well as the processes of continental collision.\r\nThere are several competing hypotheses for the rise of the Tibetan plateau: a rapid and\r\nbroad increase in the elevation of the plateau, an expansion of the plateau by\r\ncontinuous viscous flow of lower crust, or an expansion of the plateau by sequential and\r\nlocalized shear between coherent crust and mantle blocks. At the center of the\r\ncompeting scenarios is the question whether the plateau has grown upward en masse\r\nor outward over time. The best place to address this question is the northeast Tibetan\r\nplateau, where the plateau is at a nascent stage with features and dynamic processes\r\nin the crust and shallow mantle that are keys to the understanding of the mechanisms\r\nthat may have operated for the entire Tibetan plateau.\r\nThis collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese institutions acquires seismic data\r\nfrom the northeast Tibetan plateau. The research includes detailed studies to image the\r\ncrust and mantle structures in the region, to test the current hypotheses against seismic\r\nobservations, and to develop new models that integrate seismic observations and other\r\ngeological constraints. The research also includes focused studies to analyze regional\r\nearthquake activity, which helps to mitigate earthquake hazards in one of the\r\nseismically most active areas in the interior of a continental plate.\r\n",
