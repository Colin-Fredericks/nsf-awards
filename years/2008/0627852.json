Allison, professor of biostatistics and nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, operates broad and interdisciplinary scientific programs that include statistical genetics, clinical nutrition research, genomics, obesity and longevity. Underrepresented trainees are attracted to Allison's academic research areas because of the high visibility of the subject matter and because of the disproportionate prevalence of obesity and related co-morbidities currently evidenced in the African American community as compared to other ethnic groups. Beyond his professional accomplishments and scientific leadership in his field, Allison has mentored 64 scientists, the majority of them from underrepresented groups.",
