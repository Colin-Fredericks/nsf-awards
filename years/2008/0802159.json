The approach is to integrate theoretical development with the design of a hardware architecture such that practical high-performance systems can be developed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  In this research, algorithms and hardware are jointly designed to allow the implementation and evaluation of novel soft-decision decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes.  Equalization designed to work in tandem with the soft-decision decoding algorithm is another focus.  The work falls into three areas:  (1) design of a soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding algorithm that combines algebraic soft-decision decoding with generalized minimum distance decoding; (2) integrated hardware architecture and algorithm design for high-performance and hardware-friendly soft-decision decoding and equalization; and (3) design of efficient algorithms tailored to magnetic recording channels rather than to simplified channel models for more general applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The research has the potential to help the recording industry make the critical choice of whether to retain the use of Reed-Solomon codes for read channels or to use other codes.  The collaboration with a disk drive manufacturer provides opportunities for technology transfer to industry.  The project also creates opportunities for students to interact with industry collaborators through internships and regular meetings.  The research has the potential for impact other applications where Reed-Solomon codes are used, such as optical recording, compact disk and DVD players, deep-space communications, and high-speed modems.\r\n",
