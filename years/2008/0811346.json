 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on the design and synthesis of \"universal\" polymer backbones for use in simultaneous multi-recognition of functional groups.  The central theme is to produce a polymer backbone that can be modified as required by the attachment of binding functionalities of interest.  Monomers bearing various transition metals and chelating groups, as well as functional groups bearing hydrogen bond donor and acceptors with various patterns will be polymerized to produce polymers capable of subsequent modification.  In terms of broader impact, the modified polymers are expected to be useful for a wide range of biological, optical and electronic applications.  The focus of the educational effort will be the development and introduction of a new campus-wide interdisciplinary laboratory course for undergraduates.  \r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Marcus M. Weck in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Professor Weck will focus his research on the production of polymers capable of modification to suit various purposes in biology, optics or electronics.  The educational component of the award will center on the development of a new laboratory course designed to introduce college students from many different disciplines to the uses of polymers, and a workshop to introduce polymer chemistry to faculty at undergraduate institutions.\r\n",
