 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first project, quantum disordered systems and random matrices, aims to explore the connections between the random matrix and random Schrodinger equations. The fundamental questions in these subjects are the Wigner-Dyson universality for the  eigenvalue gap distribution and the extended state conjecture for the  random Schrodinger equations. Since the extended state conjecture is out of the reach of the current technique, we propose to estimate the mean square displacement for the random Schrodinger equations in long time scaling limits in two cases: 1. The random potential is time dependent and has a short time memory. 2. The random potential is given by a phonon field in equilibrium.  Inspired by the same extended state conjecture, we propose to study the localization/delocalization property of eigenvectors of random matrices. Finally, as the first step toward the Wigner-Dyson universality, we propose to estimate the difference between the density of eigenvalues of random matrices in microscopic windows and the Wigner semicircle law. The second project, dynamics of Bose gas, concerns the derivation of the the phenomenological Gross-Pitaevskii equation from the many-body Schrodinger equations. We also propose to estimate precisely the errors between the Gross-Pitaevskii  equation and the many-body Schrodinger equation. The third project,  regularity of axisymmetric incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations, aims to  prove  the regularity of the INS for the axisymmetric flow under certain  mild assumptions.\r\n \r\nThis first project of this proposal is aimed to establish the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems. The mathematical model for these systems in the simplest form is given by matrices with random entries. Our first project is designed to provide rigorous proof that conduction does occur in the random matrix models. The second project aim to establish the Gross-Pitaevskii equation---the fundamental equation governing the dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate (a recent discovered material but was theorized by Bose and Einstein almost a century ago). This project aims to lay rigorous foundation for the description of the dynamics of these systems. The third project concerns regularity of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for axisymmetric flow. This project will not only lead to deeper understanding of the INS equations in general, but the axisymmetric flow is important for modeling atmospheric events such as hurricanes and tornados. Most problems covered in this proposal were studied in their own traditionally fields such as random matrix, mathematical physics, condense matter physics or partial differential equations.  This proposal aims to establish connections between these subjects and to train students and postdoctors with interdiscipline technique and broad scientific perspectives. It will also lead to collaborations of researchers in these diverse disciplines.",

Yau\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\n \n\nWigner\u00c6s grand  vision that the local spectral  statistics of large correlated  quantum systems are modeled by random  matrix  statistics is a groundbreaking idea in the history  of probability theory and statistical physics.  Classical probability theory was built upon modeling systems with no or weak correlations;  however, random  matrix  statistics are the only known general laws for highly correlated  systems.   These  laws appear  in large classes of random  matrix  ensembles,  in the spectral  statistics of random  Schr&uml;odinger operators, zeros of Riemann  zeta functions,  and in many other examples.  The fundamental mystery  is why the random  matrix  laws are ubiquitous. A special  case of this  grand  vision is the  Wigner-Dyson  universality conjecture,  which  states that the local spectral  statistics of random  matrices  are independent of the matrix  laws.\n\nThe  main  outcome  of this  project  was successfully solving this  universality conjecture  for both  Wigner  ensembles  and  &beta;  ensembles.   The  main  intellectual merit  was the  establishment of the  link between  the  universality conjecture  and  Dyson\u00c6s conjecture,  which states  that the time scale of the Dyson Brownian  motion to reach local equilibrium  is of order N &minus;1  with N  the size of the matrices.  We proved Dyson\u00c6s conjecture  to be correct  and from this result  we solved the  Wigner-Dyson  conjecture.   Our  analysis  of Dyson  Brownian  motion  was derived  from the classical ideas of De Giorgi-Nash-Moser  on the regularity of parabolic  equations.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \n\n \n\nThis project brought together  experts  from the fields of probability theory,  statistics, combi- natorics,  mathematical physics, and partial differential equations.
