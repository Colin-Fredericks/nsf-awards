The workshop will attract up to 100 scientists with approximately 20% international participation. The main goal of the workshop is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise from senior to early-career scientists. Objectives of this meeting, beyond building collegial ties and collaborative relationships between early-career and senior scientists, are to 1) discuss state of the art instrumentation, 2) present novel techniques, 3) host within-meeting work shops and training sessions, 4) promote interdisciplinary exchanges, and 5) evaluate future development of instrumentation.  NSF funds will be used specifically to attain this goal and will be awarded as travel stipends to 12 early-career scientists and 6 senior scientists.",
