 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA recent synthesis suggests that the role of grazing in seagrass ecosystems is generally under-appreciated and that our understanding of these critical marine communities would be greatly enhanced by long-term experimental studies that determine the impact of grazing by multiple guilds, especially megagrazers (green turtles, sirenians) that have declined dramatically in most coastal systems. Furthermore, given the steep declines in populations of marine predators, an understanding of how upper trophic levels structure spatio-temporal patterns of grazer impacts is needed to be able to predict how anthropogenic changes to marine environments will influence seagrass ecosystems. \r\n\r\nA predictive framework of community ecology in general has been hampered in part because non-lethal effects of predators, both direct and indirect, often are overlooked. Behaviorally mediated indirect species interactions (BMII) occur when a predator causes a change in the behavior of its prey that is transmitted to lower trophic levels. While BMII appear to be important in shaping community dynamics, most studies of BMII have been carried out in small-scale experiments, and have not considered that top predators might initiate multiple BMII that could either attenuate or amplify their indirect effects in natural communities. \r\n\r\nIn this study, Dr. Heithaus will expand on previous investigations on one of the world's most pristine seagrass ecosystems (Shark Bay, Australia) to determine whether multiple BMII initiated by tiger sharks attenuate or amplify their indirect effects on seagrass communities. During previous NSF-funded research, the results show that tiger sharks can indirectly influence seagrass communities through two parallel non-lethal pathways rather than just one. In the first, well-established three-step BMII, tiger sharks cause shifts in megagrazer foraging locations, shielding seagrasses in dangerous microhabitats when sharks are present. In a second possible BMII, tiger sharks cause shifts in piscivore (dolphin, cormorant) microhabitat use that could result in enhanced grazing by herbivorous fishes in the microhabitats that megagrazers have abandoned. Depending on the nature of herbivorous fish interactions with seagrasses, these BMII could result in attenuation or amplification of tiger shark impacts on seagrass communities. \r\n\r\nIn this new award, further monitoring visual and video surveys, experimental herbivory trials, underwater video monitoring, and turtle-borne video cameras will be used to determine whether and how spatiotemporal patterns of grazing vary.  Experiments, in the field, will be employed using two types of exclosure and seagrass transplants to determine the relative importance of the BMII initiated by tiger sharks and whether they result in attenuation or amplification of shark effects on seagrass communities. \r\n\r\nThis project will support some of the most comprehensive long-term studies of a relatively pristine community of highly interactive marine species (sharks, turtles, sea cows), extending the datasets to 15 years. This will enable Dr. Heithaus and collaborators to address new questions about how patterns of abundance are influenced by large-scale oceanographic and climatic factors. The project will also develop a broad education and outreach program that is integrated into the research program. This includes:  1) 5th-8th grade biology teacher research experiences in Shark Bay, 2) graduate student interactions with middle school students, 3) talks by graduate students and the PI at schools and regional and national science teacher conferences, 4) the development of lesson plans based on species in Shark Bay, 5) the development of DVDs for use in secondary school classrooms, 6) the development of video labs, 7) video content for National Geographic's online and on-demand channel - NGC Wild, 8) research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and 9) the enhancement of an educational website. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nSince 1997, the Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project of Florida International University has investigated the ecological importance of marine top predators.  During this award, we were able to use a combination of ecosystem-scale surveys, manipulative experiments, and long-term behavioral observations across a range of environmental conditions to show that tiger sharks play a critical role in structuring Shark Bay\u00c6s relatively pristine seagrass ecosystem.  Interestingly, tiger sharks play this role not by consuming large numbers of prey, but instead by modifying the behavior of key prey species &ndash; especially large plant-eaters like sea turtles and sea cows (dugongs) and fish-eating dolphins and cormorants.  When large tiger sharks are abundant (most of the year and in most years) their prey avoid dangerous shallow seagrass habitats and spend more time in safer deeper habitats.  This results in high herbivory on seagrasses, including destructive removal of seagrass stems by dugongs, in deeper waters.  In contrast, in shallower waters that are preferred by tiger sharks, destructive grazing by large plant-eaters is limited.   Fish-eating dolphins and comorants also avoid tiger sharks, and since many of the fish that they eat in turn consume seagrasses, fish grazing of their preferred seagrass species is higher in the habitats that dolphins and comorants avoid because of tiger sharks.  The net result of these \"behavioral cascades\" is that the presence of tiger sharks promotes the existence of dense, valuable seagrass meadows in dangerous shallow habitats and heavily grazed low-biomass seagrass beds in safer habitats.   By extension, the loss of tiger sharks would likely result in substantial losses of ecosystem services due to unrestricted grazing by herbivores no longer constrained by predation risk.\n\n \n\nIn the final year of our work, Shark Bay experienced a \u00e6marine heatwave\u00c6 that resulted in massive (&gt;80%) declines in the foundational seagrass species.  Based on our past work and opportunistic field experiments, we are determining whether tiger sharks, through their influence on the behavior of their prey, help determine the way that Shark Bay\u00c6s seagrasses recover from the heatwave.\n\n \n\nOverall, our NSF-funded work in Shark Bay has provided the most in-depth empirical investigation of the ecological role and importance of large sharks in coastal ecosystems and suggests that ongoing declines in these species may trigger trophic cascades with detrimental impacts to ecosystem structure and function, including the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon (\"blue carbon\").  Importantly, these impacts may operate largely through anti-predator behavior of prey rather than death rates inflicted by predators- suggesting that traditional ecological models may underestimate the effects of top predator declines in the oceans and on land. When viewed in light of changes in other ecosystems, where sharks have declined and their prey (sea turtles) have been protected, it is now apparent that restoration of large shark populations should be a management priority. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis project has produced substantial broader impacts.  We developed a comprehensive project website (sberp.org) that provides details on our research methods, projects, and results, species fact sheets, image and video galleries, and teacher resources.  Video vignettes and clips are disseminated through the website, a YouTube Channel, and Heithaus lab blog (heithauslab.blogspot.com).  Perhaps most importantly, we developed a new style for using high production-quality video and science-based activities for use in K-12 classrooms.  These \"video-based projects\" present a compelling scientific question, challenge students to develop hypotheses, and then take students through a scientific investigation where they observe videos of researchers at work and then do data-analysis activities to test the hypotheses and predictions they had made..."
