Horton\r\nU of VA \r\n\r\nA special one-day Academy for Software Engineering Educators & Trainers will be offered on the day prior to the start of the 2008 Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T). The purpose of the Academy is to provide an opportunity for software engineering educators and trainers to learn from master instructors in a highly dynamic, hands-on, interactive environment. The Academy is especially designed as a unique learning opportunity for PhD students who will be entering academic careers in the near term, for new faculty members, and for mid-career faculty members who are beginning to teach software engineering course(s). Subsequent to the Academy, attendees will participate in CSEE&T'08 conference sessions, providing further educational opportunity and exposing them to the software engineering education community and to integrating research and education in their careers.",
