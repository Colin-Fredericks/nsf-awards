 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a theoretical study of important problems in the many body\r\nphysics of cold atoms and related systems. Building on previous work, the investigator\r\nwill explore several topical subjects, including (1) properties of a Fermi gas near a\r\nFeshbach resonance; (2) spectra of atomic hydrogen on Helium surfaces and\r\nembedded in a molecular hydrogen matrix; and (3)dynamics of tuning the interaction\r\nstrength for atoms trapped in a strong optical lattice. These projects are motivated by (i)\r\ninterest in fundamental physical properties of cold atoms, (ii) desires to use cold atoms\r\nas a model system to understand other many body systems, and (iii) puzzles found in\r\nongoing experiments. Studying cold atoms has impact on many body problems in\r\ncondensed matter and nuclear physics.",
