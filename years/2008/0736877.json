The project enhances communication and interaction among faculties of these schools by having a synergistic effect on collaborative activities, promoting effective instruction, and supporting rapid dissemination and adaptation of successful educational innovations in IAS.\r\n\r\nThree courses are being revised that incorporate this integrative approach: Computer Communications (in a School of Engineering), Data and Process Modeling (in a School of Business Administration), and Cybercrimes (in a School of Law).  Interdisciplinary educational materials on security, business, and law are also being developed, incorporating lecture notes, presentation slides, experiments, demonstrations, and course projects.\r\n\r\nHands-on experiences in IAS are supported by means of the Portable Educational Network (PEN) platform developed in a prior NSF-supported project.  The PEN platform provides a realistic training and education environment for students in engineering and a concrete experience in protecting computer systems from attack for students in business and law.\r\n\r\nThis project will be made available to a broad collection of constituencies, including educators, government information assurance officers, industry information professionals, undergraduate students, and pre-college students and their parents.\r\n",
