These experiments, such as searches for WIMP dark matter, neutrinoless double beta decay, and detection of solar neutrinos, are some of the highest priority directions in nuclear and particle physics, and understanding the backgrounds in which they must operate is essential to their success.  \r\nThe spectrometer proposed here will use a technique called capture-gated spectroscopy, with a lithium-loaded liquid scintillator, and will be able to measure both the fluence and energy of neutrons up to 50 MeV.  \r\nThis technique also has important applications in homeland security and neutron dosimetry.\r\n",
