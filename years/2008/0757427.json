 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultraslow light propagation in Bose?Einstein condensates (BECs) represents an extreme example of resonant light manipulation with cold atoms. The PI and her group have observed that a light pulse slowed, stopped, and extinguished in one BEC can be revived from a different condensate, 160 microns away. Building on these new capabilities, the existing apparatus will be modified to facilitate demonstration of novel schemes for processing of optical information with trapped BECs.   Specifically, the setup will form the basis for creation of one-bit and two-bit-conditional phase gates which are fundamental building blocks in quantum and optical computation schemes.\r\n\r\nThe slow and stopped light techniques developed by the PI offer a unique capability to transform information encoded in light to matter form, and once in matter form the information is easily manipulated. The research represents a new paradigm in optical quantum control and could have major importance for quantum information processing that can be utilized for example for secure encryption. The research has also spurred the interest and imagination of many and is getting wide exposure in media and at events that target very diverse audiences. Such exposure is important for attracting young people into the sciences, and for stimulating the development of practical applications.\r\n",
