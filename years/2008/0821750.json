The testbed satisfies the need for frequent iteration on algorithms and experiments required by researchers in the areas of MAC protocols, networking, and applications. Two kinds of acoustic modems are planned allowing future modems from external users to be added later. Although the fixed testbed cannot represent all kinds of acoustic channels, the capability to support different and future modems enables researchers to explore how the acoustic channel affects upper layers and to compare protocols over different modems. A pluggable software architecture is envisioned permitting algorithms to be dropped into an existing protocol stack and reuse components that are outside the research focus. Standard APIs will be defined for different layers and at least one reference protocol; implementation will be provided at each layer, allowing, for example, a researcher with a new transport protocol to leverage routing or MAC protocols contributed by other researchers. A library of protocols will be built over time, enabling comparative study of alternatives. At present there is lack of common means to evaluate and compare protocols. Since no consensus currently exists on analytic and simulation models, this project provides a better experimental tool that enables community collaboration, protocol comparison, and reuse of prior work through experimental iteration and researcher iteration.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis project provides an essential infrastructure to the underwater networking community that is likely to rebound in benefit to society overall. The always-on nature of the testbed instrument also enables significant educational impact. At present, students can only carry experiments on occasional deployments. Hence, this project will accelerate research and education in underwater networking.\r\n",
