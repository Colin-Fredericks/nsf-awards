To this end, the project focuses on posttranslational modifications of newly synthesized histones (histones are the major chromosomal proteins), and the mode(s) of H3/H4 tetramer assembly in human cells. The manner in which H3/H4 tetramers are assembled in vivo will be examined by immunoprecipitating mononucleosomes containing radiolabeled, epitope-tagged H4 and H3 variants in synchronized cells. Experiments will also be performed to determine the complete acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation states of newly synthesized human histones H4 and H3 variants as a function of the cell cycle. This will be accomplished by purifying nascent H3/H4 predeposition complexes during G1 and S phases. Newly synthesized histones will analyzed by tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry, to uncover all of the modifications of human H3 and H4 prior to deposition onto DNA.  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide essential information on the manner in which nucleosomes (the fundamental subunits of eukaryotic chromosomes) are assembled, onto both replicating and non-replicating DNA. The research will have a broader societal impact in three major areas: (1) It will provide excellent research experience for undergraduates, thereby fostering their scientific development; (2) it  will offer research opportunities for high school students, through participation in the Research Science Institute; and (3) cell lines developed in the course of the project will be made available to other researchers in the field, thus helping to stimulate further research at other national institutions.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that genetic inheritance does not only involve the copying of DNA sequence, but also depends on factors that regulate gene expression in a heritable fashion.  Such mechanisms are termed \"epigenetic.\"  In cells of higher organisms (i.e., cells with nuclei, in contrast to bacterial cells), DNA is associated with specific proteins (termed histones) to form the complex known as \"chromatin.\"  The histone proteins themselves are divided into distinct subtypes, termed H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.  Moreover, histones can be modified by a host of chemical additions that regulate how specific genes function in specific cell types.\n\nThe basic structural and functional unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is composed of eight histone proteins and about 166 base pairs of DNA.  Nucleosomes are modular in organization, and contain a four-protein tetramer (two each of histones H3 and H4), and two H2A/H2B dimers.  Of fundamental importance is how histones behave during DNA replication, when the two parental (or \"old\") strands of DNA separate to allow for their copying, and eventual segregation to two new progeny cells.  Does the H3/H4 tetramer also \"split\" into H3/H4 dimers, thus mimicking the behavior of the DNA?  The answer to this question is crucial to our understanding of epigenetic inheritance patterns, which can have a direct influence on the transmission of heritable diseases.\n\nOur experiments addressed the question of H3/H4 tetramer splitting during DNA synthesis in dividing cells.  Our results demonstrate that the tetramer does not split, but instead is passed as a unit to either one or the other of the newly copied DNA molecules.  Thus the recapitulation of epigenetic histone modifications must involve processes that accommodate the transfer on the tetramer as a unit, perhaps through nearest-neighbor histone-histone interactions and signaling.\n\nDuring the course of this project several researchers were trained and mentored, including a postdoctoral fellow (now a university educator), a graduate student (now working in the biotechnology industry) and several undergraduate students (now in either medical school or graduate school).  Moreover, we have generated reagents such as novel cell lines that will be of use to future researchers studying histone and chromatin dynamics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Annunziato"
