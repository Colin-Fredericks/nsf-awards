 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe main goal of the proposal is the development of a network of three short-range dual polarized X-band Doppler radars for the Puerto Rico's west coast. This weather-sensing network will achieve breakthrough improvements in sensitivity and resolution for sampling storms, thermodynamic state, and other critical variables throughout the entire troposphere.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nIn Puerto Rico, where complex orography limits the use of traditional long-range radar systems, the deployment of a network of short range radars is an attractive alternative to observe the weather.\r\nWhile current technology has been successfully used for many years to provide weather forecast, better coverage and resolution of the lower atmosphere is desired to help the scientists to understand weather phenomena that is undetected under the long-range radar beam. To achieve this goal, a network consisting of three X-band radars that will have the ability to monitor the earth's lower troposphere is proposed. The network will provide precise weather forecast to a region in Puerto Rico plagued by intense rain and flash floods, but the lack of precise data and the complex orography of the Island has lead to poor prediction of these events.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe proposed instrument will help fill the coverage gaps in the lower troposphere currently undetected by NEXRAD in Western P.R. As a result this will help in the protection of life/property in the West of the Island in the event of severe weather conditions.  This technology can then be used in regions in the World with similar geographical and weather conditions as in Puerto Rico.\r\n",
