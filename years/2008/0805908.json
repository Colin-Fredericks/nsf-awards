Walsh\r\n\r\nTwo n-manifolds are commensurable if they have homeomorphic\r\nfinite-sheeted covers.  This notion is particularly useful for\r\n3-manifolds. For 3-manifolds which admit a geometry,\r\ncommensurability respects this geometry. In light of the recent\r\nproof of geometrization for 3-manifolds, classification into\r\ncommensurability classes is a refinement of the classification of\r\n3-manifolds by which geometry they admit. This applies to\r\n3-manifolds which have been decomposed along 2-spheres and\r\n2-tori.  Questions concerning virtual properties of\r\n$3$-manifolds, such as if a 3-manifold is virtually Haken or\r\nvirtually fibered, are also questions about its commensurability\r\nclass.  Commensurability also respects certain number-theoretic\r\nproperties of 3-manifolds.  A classification of hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds up to commensurability would be very useful for the\r\nfield.  A first step towards understanding commensurability\r\nclasses of hyperbolic 3-manifolds is understanding\r\ncommensurability classes of hyperbolic knot complements.  The PI\r\nproposes to work on the conjecture that there are at most 3\r\nhyperbolic knot complements in a given commensurability class,\r\nand to understand how these commensurabilities can\r\noccur. Commensurability is also a useful equivalence relation on\r\nhyperbolic surfaces, with the definition that two hyperbolic\r\n2-manifolds are commensurable if they have isometric\r\nfinite-sheeted covers.  The PI proposes to further develop this\r\ntheory, in particular to understand commensurability classes of\r\nsurfaces with large symmetry groups.\r\n\r\n3-manifolds are spaces which locally look like a 3-dimensional\r\nball.  In particular, our universe is a 3-manifold and we do not\r\nknow which one it is.  A deeper understanding of\r\ncommensurabilities amongst 3-manifolds would significantly refine\r\ngeometrization for 3-manifolds.  Knot complements are a naturally\r\noccurring class of 3-manifolds, and thus good candidates for\r\nstudy.  2-manifolds, or surfaces, are spaces which locally look\r\nlike a 2-dimensional disc. Hyperbolic surfaces are the most\r\ncommon type of surface and are used in an extremely wide variety\r\nof scientific contexts.  The study of symmetry and\r\ncommensurability is very useful for these surfaces. The PI\r\nregularly speaks on her work to diverse audiences.  Any results\r\nfrom this research will be described in research seminars, posted\r\non the arXiv, and broadly distributed.\r\n",
