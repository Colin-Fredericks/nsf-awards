 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe increasing importance of biochemistry in the world of analytical chemistry is due in part to the development of micro-scale total analysis technology.  Micro-scale total analysis technology allows detailed analysis of large numbers of samples.  This project brings the innovations of biochemistry-based analysis and micro-scale analysis to the undergraduate teaching and research laboratory.  The project assists chemistry faculty in incorporating current and emerging biochemical analysis technology into their courses.  \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on further developing analytical undergraduate education by first creating learning materials and teaching strategies. Engaging laboratory and research exercises are developed for the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and are based on cutting edge, emerging micro-scale total analysis technology.  The student laboratory experiences demonstrate real world examples of detection of genetically engineered foods using Polymerase Chain Reaction facilitated DNA analysis, classical and micro-scale total analysis of protein.  Through the laboratory work, students explore the advantages of micro-scale instrumentation in quality control and optimization of experiments.  The project also incorporates micro-scale analysis technology in undergraduate research.  In developing faculty expertise, the project brings biochemistry methods into the undergraduate analytical curriculum, promoting a synergistic cooperation between biochemistry and analytical chemistry faculty.  This sharing of disciplines improves education in modern chemical analysis, and further establishes a community of faculty.\r\n",
