 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how energetic particle precipitation affects the electrical conductivity and fields in the upper and middle atmosphere.  It will examine how solar energetic protons access the middle atmosphere and will utilize the gamma rays emitted by the incoming protons to determine the energy spectrum of the incoming particles.  It will also investigate the mechanisms which accelerate, transport, and precipitate relativistic electrons.\r\n\r\nThe project will analyze data from two balloon data sets that contain multiple episodes of energetic particle precipitation.  Models will be constructed to describe the effects these energetic particles produce in the upper and middle atmosphere.  Model results will be compared with measured middle atmosphere radiation, conductivity, and electric fields.  To determine the mechanisms which accelerate, transport and precipitate relativistic electrons the balloon observations will be combined with ground and spacecraft observations to test wave-particle interaction theories for precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe results from the project will improve our ability to predict energetic precipitation events that can affect a variety of satellites and can alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere.  The project is a collaborative one involving faculty and students at Dartmouth College, the University of Washington and the University of Houston.",

Results from an atmosphere-ionosphere conductivity model that includes ionization from energetic particle precipitation and rigidity cutoffs suggest that proton-induced ionization was responsible for the observed conductivity increase at the balloon.  Model results for this event were extended to higher and lower altitudes (20 -150 km).  These results show a maximum conductivity increase near 60 km of more than 600-fold directly after SEP event onset.    \n\nThe resultant interplanetary shock impacted Earth ~36 hours later.  Near Earth, two impulses with a staircase structure in density and pressure were observed by the ACE spacecraft.  During this period, three MINIS balloons were aloft; one in the north and two in the south.  Mega-electron Volt (MeV) relativistic electron precipitation (REP) observed by all three balloons is coincident (&lt;3 minutes) with the impulse arrivals and appears to be a result of magnetospheric compression observed by both the GOES 10 and 12 spacecraft.  Balloon electric field data from the south show no signs of the impulse electric field directly reaching the ionosphere.  Enhancement of the balloon-observed convection electric field by as much as 40 mV/m over less than 20 minutes during this time period is..."
