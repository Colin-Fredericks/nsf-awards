 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of the project is the design of a photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system for remote rural health clinics in Egypt. The work encompasses data collection of load and weather parameters, selection and comparison of PV grid-connected system configurations, modeling and simulation of PV-grid-connected operation, design of power management system, economic assessment of the proposed system and specification of the proposed system.\r\n\r\nThis project is being supported by the U.S.-Egypt Joint Board For Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe project represents a natural continuation of the scientific cooperation between the Electronics Research Institute and the University of Nevada in the new research area of photovoltaic (PV) energy as an alternative and clean energy source. The project will focus on a detailed study of PV-grid connected energy system configuration, components, mode of operation and control, and costs. The second main objective of the project is to study the utilization of PV grid-connected energy systems to supply remote rural emergency health clinics in Egypt with electrical energy. This includes assessing the required size of the PV system. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe project's objectives are to develop new approaches to energy systems that will provide reliable service to remote hospitals in Egypt where grid power is currently unreliable. Moreover, the approach to PV grid-connected energy systems will encourage government and private investment in PV energy in Egypt. This will provide currently underserved areas with access to reliable clean energy while saving fossil fuels and protecting the environment from harmful emissions. In addition, some of the developed solutions will benefit states with remote sparsely populated areas, like Nevada. As part of the effort young Egyptian scientists will be trained in the use of sophisticated software for power system analysis that is not available in their institutions.",
