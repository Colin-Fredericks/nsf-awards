 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Richard D. Adams at the University of South Carolina to design, synthesize, and characterize new, unsaturated heterometallic complexes for the reversible activation of hydrogen.  The exceptionally-active targeted complexes contain platinum or palladium and highly sterically crowded phosphine ligands to induce electronic saturation and reversible hydrogen bonding. This hydrogen activation occurs at mild temperatures and may be important in hydrogen storage as well as in catalytic hydrogenation reactions for the chemical industry.  The generation and utilization of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is of growing importance in the emerging hydrogen economy.  As Professor Adams contributes rare expertise in both the synthesis and characterization new materials, the graduate and postdoctoral students in his group will gain unique, relevant, and highly valuable learning experiences.",
