In many birds, leaving the nest (1) ends parental care, (2) requires an abrupt transition from immobility to sustained flight, and (3) requires learning to forage.  In light of these requirements, it is not surprising that age and condition at departure can influence future survival and reproductive success.  What proximate triggers do fledglings use to time this important life-history transition?  Past studies have focused either on morphological, energetic, or endocrine correlates of fledging. This proposal addresses proximate triggers of fledging, integrating measures of morphology, energetic reserves, and endocrine physiology in a long-lived seabird, the Laysan Albatross.  Further, hormone levels and food availability will be manipulated to experimentally address interactions between energetics, body mass, food delivery, and glucocorticoid hormones.  The combination of strategies will allow for experimental evaluation of fledging behavior within a physiological framework.  Broader impacts include strong conservation biology implications. Laysan Albatross have been identified as one of a number of indicator species for the seabird colonies of the NWHI and are a major consumer of marine resources, so their reproductive success is reflective of the health and status of the oceans.  Knowledge of the mechanisms and effects of physiological changes during fledging will aid in both understanding the mechanisms of behavior and the informed management of long-lived oceanic seabirds.\r\n",
