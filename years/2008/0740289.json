 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing robust, high temperature resistant ionic polymers by utilizing \"Green Chemistry\" approach. Robust high temperature tolerant ionic polymers are needed for the development of efficient structural components for automobiles, aircrafts, engines and propulsion systems. For example, the new Airbus 380 is using 22% of its structural weight in composite while the Boeing 787 is using 50% of its structural weight in composites. Resistance to high temperature and fire are highly desirable characteristics of these materials. The primary hazards during fires are toxic gases, smoke and heat. Production of life threatening levels of these hazards depends on the rate of heat release of toxic materials.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be a lightweight and high temperature resistant coatings and structural components; the use of green chemistry approach in the manufacturing process will enhance the quality of life for workers and citizens in general. The proposed ionic polymers can be used in transportation vehicles, firefighter garments, printed circuit board, cabinets and housing for electronic and electrical components, construction materials, household items such as mattresses, carpets, upholstery and furniture, and paper-thin coating for protecting important paper documents such as bonds securities and stock certificates, real estate titles and deeds.",
