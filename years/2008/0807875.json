 "awd_abstract_narration": "Domestic dogs are thought to be the source of infectious diseases that threaten wild African carnivore populations including the critically endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).  This project seeks to understand the role of domestic dogs and African carnivores in pathogen transmission dynamics and to apply this knowledge towards carnivore conservation efforts.  Jackals (Canis mesomelas) and hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) living in areas with low or high levels of exposure to domestic dogs will be tested for evidence of exposure to specific pathogens.  Findings from this and a concurrent study in African wild dogs will be used in the development of a predictive model that will help guide conservation management decisions for African carnivores at risk.\r\n\r\nConservation of top predators such as African wild dogs, jackals and hyenas is critical for maintenance of healthy ecosystems and for their intrinsic value, which brings tourism income to developing countries. Pathogens, such as rabies and canine distemper virus, may have a significant impact on the survival of these top predators, leading to disruption of ecosystems. In addition, rabies presents an important human health risk.  By understanding the ecology of these and other infectious diseases that threaten these animals, appropriate conservation management and human health policy can be developed and implemented. \r\n",
