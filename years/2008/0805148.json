 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to develop methods to control electron/energy transfer processes at interfaces involving chemically synthesized nanoscale inorganic materials. This control will be achieved through the solution-based assembly of multiple inorganic components (metallic, semiconducting, and/or insulating) with, in some cases, functional organic molecules. For initial study, three systems of fundamental scientific and commercial importance are targeted: (1) ionic surface coatings for controlling doping and interfacial electric fields in nanoparticle assemblies; (2) organic-functionalized semiconducting nanoparticles to drive spatially controlled photochemical polymerizations; and (3) nanoparticles with multicomponent nanoscale inorganic coatings for solar-to-chemical energy conversion.  These research efforts will be student-driven, with continued focus on scientific career training for female and minority students, and will take place in the scientifically rich, cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary environment at UC Santa Barbara. The graduate students working on the project will serve as mentors to undergraduate students, high school teachers, and high school students through NSF- and DoD-funded outreach programs and informal collaborations.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nNanoscale materials with useful electronic and light-absorbing properties, made using inexpensive and scalable chemical methods, could positively impact important industries ranging from energy conversion, electronics, and catalysis to use in chemical sensing, biotechnology and health care. In order to achieve the societal benefits associated with such a transformation, we are working to synthetically control, using molecules and inorganic coatings, the way in which electrons move and interact in this emerging class of materials.  These research efforts will be student-driven, with continued focus on scientific career training for female and minority students, and will take place in the scientifically rich, cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary environment at UC Santa Barbara. The graduate students working on the project will serve as mentors to undergraduate students, high school teachers, and high school students through NSF- and DoD-funded outreach programs and informal collaborations.\r\n\r\n",

A common theme of many of the specific projects was to enable the creation of sustainable and efficient energy conversion and storage systems using earth-abundant materials.  We explored, for example, synthesis of high-surface-area semiconductors and metals with nanostructured inorganic coatings for total solar spectrum-to-chemical energy conversion as well as system validation of high-capacity, chemically stable, porous, metallic binary/ternary transition metal nitrides for electrochemical energy storage and as anode materials for advanced battery types. \n\n \n\nWe succeeded in creating a plasmonic water-splitting cell in which 95% of the effective charge carriers derive from surface plasmon decay to hot electrons.

Biological tissues are relatively transparent to infrared radiation of certain frequencies (650 to 950 cm-1 and 1000 to 1350 cm-1).  Upconversion luminescent materials are able to absorb infrared radiation and emit visible light.  For their potential use in applications in bio-imaging, we synthesized biocompatible heterostructured nanoparticles with efficient two-photon infrared upconversion-induced luminescence. This enables bar-code, multiplex sensing with optimal biomarking capability through the human-tissue infrared transparency window.  We demonstrated the integration of upconversion labeling with controlled drug delivery of an antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) using a magnetic hollow sphere with room for the drug transpo..."
