Jones, University of North Carolina\r\nPI Joachim Ulhrig, University of Koln\r\nCo-PI Ralph Panstruga, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding- Koln\r\n\r\nBackground and Scientific Goals/Merit:  A variety of signaling networks in Arabidopsis utilize one or both of the two heterotrimeric G-protein complexes to couple signals that are perceived at the cell surface by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), that have  a seven-transmembrane spanning (7TM) domain, to enzymes called effectors.  The plant heterotrimeric G protein complex is a central node in an exemplary signaling network.  To date, neither the downstream effectors nor the upstream GPCRs have been unequivocally identified.  This paucity of information stands in contrast to humans and C. elegans G protein-coupled pathways, where 950 GPCRs and more than a dozen known effectors have been identified; thus, representing the most extensive signaling network in metazoans.  None of the metazoan GPCRs and almost none of the canonical effectors are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome; thus, non-biased approaches are needed to fill this knowledge gap. To address this problem, a high through-put interaction screen to identify proteins that interact with the heterotrimeric G protein complex is descirbed.  \r\nURL:  Additional information and progress is located at http://www.bio.unc.edu/Faculty/Jones/lab/2010Project/\r\nGene Set: The central core is defined by the following genes: GPA1 (At2g26300), AGB1 (At4g34460), AGG1 (At3g63420), AGG2 (At3g22945), and AtRGS1 (At3g26090). Selected interactors with this core that  meet the defined criteria for priority are being pursued more thoroughly.  For those selected, reverse and molecular genetic approaches are applied to determine on what branches of the G-protein signaling network these elements operate.   Up to 100 genes encoding confirmed interactors will be knocked out either by insertional mutagenesis or a RNAi technique in order to determine the loss of function phenotype with regard to known phenotypes of G-protein mutants.   A smaller subset will be pursued in great depth by examining in vivo interactions. Interactors are tested for in vivo interaction and those confirmed interactors are used as bait to initiate additional rounds of screening. Note that the gene set expands as progress is made.  \r\nGene Function: The physiological processes involving Arabidopsis G protein have been characterized. G protein interactors will be placed genetically in one or more of these pathways.  \r\nData dissemination: Data will be made public through a project website, TAIR, and interaction data repositories such as IntAct, DIP and bioGRID. Public data will include frequency of identification in the screen, screen conditions, gene expression patterns, protein type, homologs, interlogs, and links to the individual genes and other gene-specific resources.  The data will be subjected to bioinformatic and graph-theoretical meta-analyses to identify the main signal transduction pathways and protein complexes (signalosomes) in the interaction network. Key functional signal mediators (hubs) as well as abundant regulatory patterns will be identified.\r\nRelevance to the NSF 2010 and AFGN programs: This research activity substantially aids NSF's goal for \"Benchmarking Gene Function.\" The research has as its aim to identify the complete interacting set of elements in the G-protein signaling network; thus, it meets the need for \"exploring exemplary networks and systems.\"  This project coordinates efforts with two other 2010 projects that are focusing on the global interactome of Arabidopsis proteins. \r\nBroader Impact:  A broader impact of this work will be realized through the training of undergraduate, pre-, and post-doctoral students.  In addition, UNC and Shaw University will jointly mentor 3-6 minority students in a 10-week summer research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlant to human cells percieve signals that commincate specific behaviors.  For example, hormones in the body communicate to certain cells to contract or relax.  Another example is that light in certain eye cells commincate a portion of an image sent to the brain.  Think of the cell as an engine made of parts.  To determine how the cell communication system works, one first goes about by identifying the parts and then determining which parts work with other parts.  By doing so, an assembly diagram is constructed.  A nexus to this cellular machine is a molecular cog called a G protein complex.  Signals outside the cell are percieved by a protein on the surface of the cell membrane.  Perception means the protein changes shape like a movement of an engine piston.  This molecular movement acts on the G protein complex just inside the cell which in turn changes shape to act on other cellular components in orchestration.  The culmination is the change in cellular behavior.  We know a lot about the G protein complex in humans and a few of the cellular parts, we know less about G proteins in organisms other than  humans and nothing about the cellular parts.  This project was designed to identify all the parts of this G protein complex machine  It is called a G protein Interactome, meaning all the proteins that interact together with G proteins. The model organism chosen was Arabidopsis.  There are many reasons why Arabidopsis was chosen as the critical  organism to advance our understanding of G protein communicaiton.  The major outcome of this project is the identity of most, if not all, the working parts to the G protein engine in Arabidopsis.  These parts were assembled into a working diagram and linked to many important functions such as disease resistance, proper development and stress (e.g. drought, temperature, salt) behavior.  The results of this project represented by a large database was made public on line with a web tool that enables researchers to query the database for conncetions to their own work.  These results have spawned several dozen other hypotheses to test and new on going. projects.    The interactome this project generated is the highest quality interactome to date.  Although small and focused around one nexus (the G protein), the protein-protein interactions discovered were confirmed by multiple techniques, unlike any other public interactome to date.\n\n        This collection of parts in the interactome is the equivalent of a collection of genes encoding the parts, therefore genetic approaches were applied.  Mutations in the genes encoding the proteins that  make up this G protein interactome were created and the resulting mutant plants were screened for abberent phenotypes.  For example, during the last year of this project, the PI went to an Australian lab that is expert at fungal resistance to screen 250 mutants of the interactome for resistance to the agronomically-important fungus, Fusarium.    \n\n         The project involved international collaboration; at least five countries participated.  Over 35 peer-reviewed publications resulted from this project.  Considerable college, post graduate, and mid career level training resulted from this project. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/04/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan M Jones"
