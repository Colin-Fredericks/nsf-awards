Other studies in this area have been unable to create such intricate architecture, at the submicron scale, and within 3D hydrogel systems. This project is truly unique and will provide an important platform for developing scaffolds for regenerative medicine and for more physiological, 3D in vitro culture systems.  In addition, this research is particularly targeted for guiding axonal growth, which has potential implications for promoting regeneration in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research is at the intersection of chemical and biomedical engineering, materials science, chemistry, optics/physics, and biology. Two graduate students and several undergraduate students will conduct the proposed research. The PI and Co-PI will work one-on-one with all students and each undergraduate student will also be paired with a graduate student mentor who will help guide research and oversee training. Furthermore, the PI and Co-PI's research groups are active in K-12 outreach programs (e.g., women and minority-based programs) as a means to educate young students about bioengineering, in addition to other scientific mentoring programs such as the Beckman Scholars Program and the Welch Summer Scholar Program.",
