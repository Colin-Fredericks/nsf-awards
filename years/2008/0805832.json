While many black hole masses have been estimated, spin measurements have only recently become feasible.  The largest systematic error in the spin estimates arises from uncertainties in the disk model, particularly the assumption of a vanishing torque at the innermost stable circular orbit.  This project will carry out two- and three-dimensional numerical general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the inner regions of accretion disks.  It will provide clear guidelines for reliable spin estimation, both by fitting the continuum spectra of X-ray binaries and by fitting relativistically broadened iron lines.\r\n\r\nPublic interest in black hole research continues high, and this work will showcase the intellectual excitement of science in a way easily appreciated by the public, and by the junior researchers actively involved in the study.  The PI has a strong record in such mentoring activities.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences and NASA?s Astrophysics Theory Program.",
