 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) recognizes outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.    \r\n\r\nGayle R. Slaughter, assistant dean for graduate education at Baylor College of Medicine, pioneered the college's Summer Medical Research and Training (SMART) program, which has enrolled 80-100 students each summer over the past 16 years. During that time, 439 underrepresented minority students have participated. Slaughter has been a leader in Baylor College of Medicine's (BCM) success in recruiting and retaining graduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, and her work with the SMART program has more than tripled the number of minority Ph.D. students achieving success at BCM. Overall, she has mentored more than 500 minority students. Slaughter has also established collaborations with the United Negro College Fund to increase interest in molecular biology among K-12 students.\r\n\r\n",
