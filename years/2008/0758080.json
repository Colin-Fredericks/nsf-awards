This group has played a leading role in managing the construction and commissioning of the CMS detector and in having worked directly on the muon chamber alignment hardware and the development of radiation-hard readout electronics for the calorimeters.\r\n\r\nThe group plans to study relatively model-independent searches for new physics as deviations from expected behavior based on Standard Model predictions. They also plan to maintain their responsibilities for the calorimeter readout and for software and computing.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of their studies include using technologies developed or inspired by their CMS work for applications ranging from biophysics to quantum optics and maintaining a vigorous outreach program with regular appearances in the media including newspapers, science magazines, radio and television.\r\n",
