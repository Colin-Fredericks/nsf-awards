 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using a theme of urban hydrology, eight to ten hands-on laboratory experiences that employ a constructivist approach, project-based learning style are being developed by researchers at The College at Brockport State University of New York, in collaboration with teachers from the Rochester (NY) City School District.  The urban hydrology theme is both one of interest and concern to scientists investigating environmental issues and one that students see on a daily basis.  This approach is expected to capture students' attention using a relevant topic, easily transferred to other urban settings, and increase the skills and achievements of a diverse population of urban students in using inquiry-based hands-on science focused on geoscience topics.  The overall project, and curriculum development efforts, are addressing three overarching goals: 1) to engage students in 'doing' science, to better enable them to understand the nature of science, 2) to have students better understand the realities upon which scientific theories are built, and 3) to provide students with experiences using modern equipment that enables them to build their own robust data sets, develop ownership of a project, and make science fun.  Data are being collected to evaluate both teacher and student response to the project and newly developed curricular materials.",
