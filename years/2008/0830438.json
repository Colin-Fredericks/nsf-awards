 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\r\nCutset Sampling and Processing\r\nD.L. Neuhoff (P.I.)\r\nThis research project is focused on the development of efficient new methods for sampling and\r\nprocessing multidimensional data such as images, video, or spatially distributed sensor data,\r\nespecially the first and last. Traditional methods of digital image processing rely on the taking\r\nand processing of regularly spaced samples (pixels), typically at the sites of a lattice, for example\r\na square grid of points. In contrast, this project is investigating digital image processing\r\nbased on samples taken in a cutset, the simplest example of which is a square grid of lines that\r\nspans the image. More generally a cutset is defined in terms of a set of neighborhood relations\r\namong a discrete set of potential sample sites. Cutset sampling is expected to be especially\r\neffective when the capturing of image edge information is important.\r\nThe principle motivations for cutset sampling derive from the facts that two-dimensional data\r\ncan often be well modeled by Markov random fields and that unsampled pixels of Markov\r\nrandom fields can be efficiently estimated with belief propagation algorithms. This research\r\nproject is investigating different forms of cutset sampling, and it is developing reconstruction\r\nalgorithms tailored to cutset sampling, image compression methods based on cutsets, distributed\r\nsensor network algorithms for scenarios in which sensors are deployed on cutsets, and analysis\r\ntechniques to determine the strengths and weakness of cutset sampling, and to enable comparisons\r\nwith conventional lattice-based sampling.",
