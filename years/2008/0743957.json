 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, or MPK) cascades are conserved signaling modules that play vital roles in all eukaryotic organisms. Arabidopsis MPK3 and MPK6, as well as their functional equivalents in other species, are implicated in plant disease resistance. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Recently, it was discovered that activation of MPK3 and MPK6 induces cyanide accumulation, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts and cell death during the hypersensitive response. In this project, the investigators will use a combination of physiological, biochemical, and molecular genetic approaches to understand the regulation of cyanide accumulation during plant defense response and to generate plants with either elevated or reduced cyanide accumulation. Phenotypic analyses of these plants will provide in vivo gain- and loss-of-functional evidence to establish cyanide as a new regulatory/signaling molecule in plants. Cyanide is a co-product of ethylene biosynthesis. As a plant hormone, ethylene has been the focus of much study, its role in plant physiological and developmental processes, as well as the mechanisms of ethylene action have been investigated extensively. However, cyanide as a regulatory molecule in plants has been mostly ignored, despite its obvious biological effects on a number of critical enzymes and processes in cells. \r\nBroader impacts. The use of a combinatory approach in this project will provide an excellent training environment for students and post-docs. Students (both graduate and undergraduate) and post-docs from under-represented groups will be actively recruited though participation in institutional programs which reach out to such scientists. Cyanide is a potent inhibitor of various activities in chloroplasts and mitochondria, two organelles known as cellular 'power plants'. Understanding the regulation of cyanide accumulation and its functions in energy conversion, ROS generation, and HR cell death may lead to the generation of crops with enhanced yield under stress conditions. This is important for agriculture to produce enough food/feed and harvestable energy to meet an increasing demand. \r\n\r\n",
