 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe research explores connections between gauge theory and quantum aspects of gravitational physics, particularly the concept of emergent geometry and emergent strings in the AdS/CFT correspondence. \r\nSome of the topics to be studied are aspects of higher dimensional geometry as seen from gauge theory. Part of this program is to study states that preserve some supersymmetries. The other part is to study non-commutative structures. The PI will focus on aspects of integrability in Yang Mills theories. The PI is also interested in exploring the non-commutative Geometric Aspects of emergent gravity in gauge theory.  He  plans to work on various condensed matter physics problems where the phase transitions are of a topological nature.  Using topological quantum field theory techniques, the PI proposes to study the properties of graphenes and the spin Hall effect. As to the broader impacts, The PI has several collaborators in China and in the Asia-Pacific region. Support of ongoing collaborations with them will make it possible to bring top students, postdocs and professors, including those from under-served demographic groups and those from Asia Pacific and Latin America, to Utah, to promote international exchange of scientists.\r\n",
