Whang    \r\n  \r\nAbstract \r\nThe organization of movement is a complex and difficult problem, in part because of a \"degrees of freedom problem\" in motor control. The richness of an animal's movement possibilities makes its choice of movement controls complex. However, unlike current robots, animals cope efficiently with their degrees of freedom. A newborn wildebeest calf walks with the herd within a few hours of birth. A frog or a turtle, using just its spinal cord, can control complex goal-directed trajectories. The spinal cord can also rapidly correct such movements if they are perturbed. It has been argued that these remarkable capacities are modular, constructed with small sets of primitives or motor building blocks. How such primitives arise and are used is the focus of this project. \r\n\r\nThe concepts of modularity and motor primitives have provided useful descriptions of the organization of spinal motor systems. Modular organization has been shown to support spinal behaviors, and may help to \"bootstrap\" motor learning. Nonetheless, modularity is controversial at many levels. Spinal primitives might need to be supplanted or augmented in order to perform complex, voluntary behaviors. This project attacks this problem in frog prey strike behaviors, a voluntary and adapted behavior in a system that is fundamentally important to the animal, and has also been well characterized in previous studies of modularity. The neuromechanics of prey strike is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The importance of modular organization in neuroscience and behavior extends well beyond biological motor control, with ramifications in evolutionary and cognitive psychology. Biological strategies and solutions are also highly relevant to future technologies and robotics. \r\n\r\nA computer model of prey strike will be developed using a novel approach based on Cosserat strand-elements. The model will be developed by a team of four investigators: Simon Giszter (neurophysiology) and Jonathan Nissanov (anatomy, imaging) at Drexel University, Dinesh Pai (computer science, biomechanical modeling) at the University of British Columbia, and Kiisa Nishikawa (neuromechanics) at Northern Arizona University. Cryoplane microscopy will be used to reconstruct bullfrog sensorimotor anatomy in detail. These structures will be modeled using a strand-based approach to incorporate this detail. Experimental and model analyses of prey strike using these data will inform one another to establish the benefits and limits of fixed or adaptive modular mechanisms, and the biological implementation used in frogs. \r\n",
