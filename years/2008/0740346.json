 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will develop a technique to capture CO2 gas from a combustion exhaust stream and transform it into a water soluble form for sequestration. Enzyme-loaded particles are seeded through the combustion exhaust to absorb CO2, and convert the CO2 into a water soluble form. The CO2 is then washed from the particles, which are recycled to repeat the process. Removing a specific gas from a large, quickly-flowing volume of gas rapidly and at low cost is a difficult problem, but an important one to solve because of the contribution of CO2 release to global warming. Enzyme-laden particles will be developed, together with modeling of the CO2 capture process to define concept potential and guide experiment design, fabrication, and analysis. A Phase 1 particle gas absorber device will be designed together with an experiment that can be used to test the CO2 removal device. The Phase 1 CO2 gas absorber experimental test device will be fabricated and used to perform experiments to measure the performance of a CO2 capture device and to compare its performance with modeling. Commercial application will target CO2 emissions from power plant exhausts. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from this technology could create a practical method of capturing and storing CO2 released from combustion processes. A CO2 absorber particle will be developed, together with a technique to use the particles to efficiently remove CO2 from a combustion gas exhaust stream. Not only do the particles absorb the CO2, but they convert it to a storable, water soluble form. This program seeks to lessen the costs associated with global warming. The cost of global warming to the global economy include the costs associated with rising ocean levels, increasing weather disturbances, decreased animal and crop production due to climate changes, and the power costs needed to offset increased temperatures. Commercial value will come as utilities recognize that CO2 removal is a necessary business expense of producing electric power. The decrease or elimination of global warming will provide a fundamental and far-reaching benefit to all humanity, by maintaining our current climate so that we can continue to develop and live out our lives without the constraints of severe climate change.  \r\n",
