 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0755763, Han\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the design, synthesis, and characterization of molecule-based magnetic polymers having high Curie temperature (Tc).  A series of monomers having tetracyano units or stable radicals (e.g., verdazyl radical or thioaminyl radical) for electron acceptor will be synthesized and each of the monomers will be reacted with a ferrocene- and biferrocene-containing monomer with long flexible side chains to obtain molecule-based magnetic polymers. Such polymers will form intramolecular exchange interactions through covalent bonding between the strong electron donor of ferrocene or biferrocene units along the macromolecular chains with the strong electron acceptor of tetracyano unit or stable radical.  The intermolecular super exchange coupling will occur due to the polarization of both ferrocene (or biferrocene) units and tetracyano units (or stable radicals), and the entanglement of macromolecular chains will facilitate the expansion of one-dimensional spin coupling into a three-dimensional one.  The magnetic properties of the polymers synthesized will be characterized using a magnetometer.  X-ray diffraction will be employed to confirm that the polymers synthesized do not contain any impurities such as iron oxide, and electron spin resonance spectrometry will be employed to confirm the presence of spin interactions in the polymers synthesized.  Owing to the presence of long flexible side chains on the ferrocene- or biferrocene-containing monomers used, such molecule-based magnetic polymers are expected to be soluble in common solvents.  Such a prospect will ?open the door? to the development of a new generation of homogeneous magnetorheological (MR) fluids, quite different from the conventional MR fluids in current industrial use that are suspensions of very heavy magnetic particles (iron oxide or ferrite) in a light carrier liquid which are subject to serious problems of sedimentation and aggregation. The PI will investigate the fundamentals of the rheological behavior of a new generation of homogeneous MR fluids that will be prepared from the polymers synthesized in this research.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\n\r\nAlthough small-molecule organic magnets having low Curie temperature (Tc) (much lower than room temperature) have been reported, during the past three decades many research groups have tried to develop truly molecule-based magnetic polymers having high Tc (much higher than room temperature).  This research, if successful, will pave new frontiers in polymer synthesis, electronic structure chemistry, and materials chemistry, as well as stimulate theorists to develop new theory for magnetisms of macromolecules, since the currently available theories of magnetism deal with small-molecule organic magnets.  High Tc molecule-based magnetic polymers may exhibit numerous desirable properties, including solubility, processability, and synthetic tenability, and could have practical applications.  This project could provide new insights into how to design molecule-based magnetic materials having high Tc. It could also fundamentally advance the coordination chemistry of stable free radicals.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe research could have a broad impact on several scientific engineering disciplines including polymer chemistry, organometallic/coordination chemistry, condensed matter physics, and rheology for the development of a new theory for homogeneous MR fluids. Successful completion of the research project could lead to new method(s) for the synthesis of novel molecule-based magnetic polymers having high Tc, which do not exist at present, and can have an impact on manufacturing processes for a new generation of novel magnetic polymers and also the automotive industry that makes extensive use of magnetorheological fluids.  The research will be highly interdisciplinary; graduate students will be exposed to a wide range of research experiences in the design and synthesis of novel polymers and their characterization, which will provide breadth and flexibility for their future careers.",
