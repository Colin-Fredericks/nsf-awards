 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown University is awarded a grant to support student and young scientist participation in a workshop titled \"Q&A Boot Camp at Brown University: Asking Tough Scientific Questions\" to be held in the Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University on December 8-12, 2008. This is second of a two-part series entitled \"The Genome and the Computational Sciences\". The workshop will bring together, in the post-genome-sequence phase of genomics, influential entrepreneurs, leaders, andvisionaries from academia and industry who will build the next paradigms in genomics and biotechnology. It is our belief that the interaction among these participants, from diverse segments of the research and industrial community who share the same goals, will lead to new, perhaps unexpected insights and exciting collaborations. Participation by undergraduate and graduate students and newly minted young researchers to this group of world-class research workers will fire their imagination and enthusiasm for this new and immensely promising field.",
