 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Waterjet Technology project is developing an effective training program in state-of-the-art waterjet cutting processes for machine tool technicians and other programs in manufacturing.  Waterjet processes have experienced many improvements in design and function during the last decade, and its industry usage has accelerated rapidly so that it is quickly becoming a standard tool in machine shops around the world.  The project's activities consist of developing faculty expertise, acquiring equipment and resources to build training capacity, identifying competencies and developing curriculum components to teach skills in waterjet technology. In addition, the project provides training opportunities and informative seminars to college faculty members, secondary-level teachers and students throughout the region, industry representatives and incumbent workers. The project identifies competencies and develops curricula for effective training in waterjet technology. Newly developed curriculum components are adopted throughout the statewide community and technical college system, and are disseminated to a larger audience.   The training provided by this project enhances job opportunities for graduates and expands opportunities for regional businesses.\r\n\r\n",
