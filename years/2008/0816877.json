 "awd_abstract_narration": "Darwin?s Finches of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are one of the most famous examples of evolution by natural selection.  Unfortunately, several species of these evolutionary icons have recently come under serious threat from an introduced species of parasitic fly (Philornis downsi).  This pest, which was probably accidentally introduced from mainland Central or South America, may have devastating effects on host reproductive success.  The endangered Mangrove Finch and other species may be at risk of extinction if a way to combat the fly is not found.  The goal of our study is to carefully measure the impact of this invasive parasite on Medium ground finches, and test whether the birds are able to mount immune responses to the flies, or defend themselves in other ways.  \r\n\r\nThis study will provide critical data to inform decisions by management personnel of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, which is responsible for the welfare of Gal\u00e1pagos native fauna and flora.  The project will provide interdisciplinary training for a postdoc, a Ph.D. student, Ecuadorian volunteers, and several undergrad students in host-parasite evolutionary ecology, behavior, immunology, and conservation biology.",
