Project Flowing Waters is a collaboration between Texas State University Departments of Biology and Geography, and the San Marcos, Texas CISD 6-12th grade teachers and students.  Faculty and graduate students from Texas State University will work hand-in-hand with San Marcos CISD teachers to develop 6-12th grade student skills and knowledge of physical, chemical, and biological aspects of aquatic systems in order to improve interest and performance in STEM areas.  In turn, Texas State graduate fellows will obtain teaching skills necessary to transmit knowledge and expertise to broader audiences.  A focal point of the program is the San Marcos River, which flows through Texas State University and the San Marcos community.  This watershed is a precious and unique natural laboratory that permits integration among several disciplines, including aquatic ecology, geology, fluvial geomorphology, and conservation biology.  \r\n\r\nPrincipal benefits and broader impacts of Project Flowing Waters include graduate fellow development of communication, collaboration, team building skills, and understanding of inquiry-based teaching.  Inquiry-based teaching and participation in the graduate fellows' cutting-edge research will be used to convey the excitement of the scientific process to >4000 San Marcos CISD 6-12th grade students, of whom 72% are ethnic minority groups and 54% economically disadvantaged.  An enduring impact of Project Flowing Waters is a strengthened university-community partnership that will lead to extensive and sustained collaboration and institutional commitment.\r\n",
