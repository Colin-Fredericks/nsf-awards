 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site program at the University of Illinois at Chicago will engage eleven undergraduate students each summer in cutting-edge research projects in novel advanced materials systems in engineering.  Specific projects will include independent research in materials science, bioengineering, biomedical engineering and nanotechnology. The participants' research experience will be broadened by their participation in the following complementary program activities: 1) oral communication and technical writing seminars; 2) tutorials on experimental design and safety engineering; and 3) introductions to recent developments and state-of-the-art science and technology. \r\n\r\nStudents will be recruited from regional community colleges, universities with high minority enrollments (i.e. Chicago State and the University of Puerto Rico) and universities across the nation.  The program aims to have 80% participation from students belonging to underrepresented groups and minorities. This REU program will expand participants' creativity, motivate them to consider graduate programs and promote interdisciplinary technical skills needed in the future engineering workplace.\r\n\r\n\"This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\"\r\n",
