Participants will discuss these\r\nissues at the workshop, and carry the results back to their home\r\ninstititutions for practical validation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThe workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a\r\ncommunity of scholarship about teaching  in Computational Linguistics\r\nand Natural Language Processing. The panel sessions and paper\r\npresentations are designed, in part, to disseminate experiences about\r\nthe strategy and tactics of teaching to the audience that will be most\r\nable to use them, in part, to elicit suggestions from industrial,\r\ngovernment and academic employers about the unmet needs they perceive\r\nfor training and education.",
