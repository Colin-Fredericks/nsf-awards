This is not always easy because the biological analytes often have very similar characteristics, such as their molecular charge and size. The objective of this project is to develop a novel method for the separation and sensing of biomolecules (large DNA fragments and proteins) by decoupling the electroosmotic transport of the fluid from the electrophoretic migration of the solutes. This will be accomplished by means of new elements which we developed recently - semiconductor diode pumps powered by an alternate current (AC) field. The analytes will be independently manipulated electrophoretically by a direct current (DC). In addition, we propose to explore the fabrication and properties of a new class of microscopic device-like particles that can move, sense and respond to biochemical stimuli on their own. The self-propelling particles will be microdiodes that harvest energy for their motion from a global AC field or mesostructured entities that are driven by osmotic gradients through a controlled solute release\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project involves fundamental studies of electrokinetic phenomena and transport, electrodynamics, surface science, and biomolecular solution dynamics. We will reveal the principles for using semiconductor elements powered by AC fields as smart particles and microdevices that autonomously move or pump water and respond to chemical stimuli. The successful execution of the proposed research program will open a completely new range of opportunities in the areas of biomedical engineering, proteomics and DNA sequencing, medical diagnostics, microfluidic reactor design, sensing and detection. We will establish the foundation for the design and operation of new actively controlled and dynamically reconfigurable fluidic-electronic chips for manipulating liquids and solutes. A major object for separation in the devices that we will develop will be megabase DNA, which is important for genomic applications such as genotyping and purification of clone libraries. DNA in the megabase range (109 Da) is commonly separated using slab gel electrophoresis; however, standard gels only resolve fragments up to 75 kb, since resolution for larger fragments is poor. Our technique will avoid this problem and can become a key in rapid prototyping on a chip. \r\n\r\nThe program will establish the foundation for the development of future engineering projects in the areas of chemical and bioengineering, lab-on-a-chip and microreactor design. It will help the education of generation of graduate students who will face the challenges of the emerging microscale and nanoscale technologies. The collaboration between UNM, NCSU and RPI will help expanding research and educational activities in all three institutions. It will allow for graduate student exchange and exposure to diverse research and academic environments. The PI's of the project will also visit the partner institutions to participate in seminars and present lectures on specific topics to graduate and undergraduate students The research proposed in this application will reinforce the educational and outreach activities at UNM, NCSU and RPI. It will provide research topics for graduate students. It will also enrich the existing undergraduate laboratory modules with new experiments and be used in innovative hands-on undergraduate research projects. In addition, it will promote teaching, training and learning through an update of the curriculum, participation in K-12 teacher's training workshops and outreach to other schools in the state.",
