To maintain sustainability, we need renewable and CO2-emission neutral fuels. One of the solutions is the use of microalgae that can provide both renewable energy and removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Such microorganisms could be used to generate a number of environmentally friendly fuels, including oil (biodiesel), hydrogen (H2) and ethanol. Microalgae generate biofuels in photosynthetic reactions using water (even wastewater) and sunlight as an energy source. To generate biofuels from these microorganisms we need simple, high-cell density, fully automated, cost-effective photobioreactors. \r\n\r\nThis proposal requests an acquisition of a photobioreactor for pilot-scale studies of biofuel generation and related capabilities of microalgae. A number of studies on biofuel generation by microalgae and other photosynthetic microorganisms using lab-scale photobioreactors were done in the past decade. The general aim of the proposed research activities is to examine the response of microalgal cells to scale-up in requested photobioreactor. Some examples of the research projects are: (1) Optimization of oil (biodiesel) generation by microalgae in a photobioreactor, (2) H2 production by microalgae mutants in a photobioreactor, (3) CO2 mitigation by microalgae, and (4) Wastewater treatment using microalgae in a photobioreactor: ammonium ion removal from water by microalgae. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a photobioreactor for microalgal studies will offer a number of considerable benefits for research program at Austin Peay State University (APSU). These research activities will demonstrate the effectiveness of microalgae and other photosynthetic microorganisms in photobioreactors for the conversion of solar energy and waste CO2 into biofuels such as biodiesel and H2 which are renewable, biodegradable alternatives to gasoline and diesel. In addition, use of microorganisms for production of biofuels does not rely on food sources. At the same time, such microbial technology will provide the means for utilization of CO2 which is generated by industrial plants. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project also includes integration of this research into education of the students. APSU students (most of them from underrepresented groups) will be involved in the research activities based on the requested photobioreactor, both during an academic year and summer period. In addition to publishing research findings in professional scientific journals, we will disseminate the results through popular journals, newspapers, and websites.",
