 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines the feasibility of novel controlled release methods of herbicide delivery that will significantly limit pollution due to agricultural runoff.  The research utilizes natural layered minerals that are able to sequester and later release herbicides gradually into soils or foliage; and will examine the feasibility of developing time-delayed release agents that will prevent dissolution and runoff of herbicides during critical heavy rainfall events.  Further, the research effort will examine the feasibility to utilize an intensified process to prepare the proposed composites, a process which is carried out at room temperature, involves only a single step, produces no by-products, and renders the proposed product highly cost-effective for its end customers.  \r\n\t\r\nThe broader impacts of this research will be development of cost-effective products that mitigate the environmental impact of agricultural runoff (one of our nations most significant sources of pollution), and will mitigate the concomitant collateral damage (both environmental and economic) to our nations fisheries. Customers, such as nurseries, greenhouse growers and farmers, will derive several benefits from products resulting from this research: a time-delayed, controlled-release product may potentially eliminate the need for multiple applications of herbicides, will minimize exposure of workers to harmful herbicides, may potentially limit or eliminate herbicidal runoff to adjacent watersheds, and may provide significant cost-savings.",
