 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging computing technologies have made it possible to manufacture\r\nlarge-scale embedded multi-agent systems, from vast sensor networks to\r\nmodular robots and smart materials. A key challenge is understanding\r\nhow to program such systems at the individual agent level in order to\r\nachieve system-level behavior that is complex, fault-tolerant, and\r\nadapts to the environment. One source of inspiration is multicellular\r\nbiological systems (tissues, organs, and simple organisms) that\r\nachieve complex self-adaptation in changing environments through the\r\ndistributed cooperation and sensing of vast numbers of cells. Such\r\nsystems can provide novel bio-inspired principles for the design and\r\nprogramming of multi-agent systems.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates new computational paradigms for programming\r\nmulti-agent robotic systems to achieve complex self-adaptation in\r\nresponse to the environment. The two main thrusts are: (a) the\r\ndevelopment of a global-to-local programming methodology for\r\ndescribing complex global adaptation goals and automatically deriving\r\nprovably robust multi-agent control (b) the development of a\r\ntissue-inspired modular robotic system that can demonstrate\r\nself-adaptive structures. A key source of inspiration is the\r\ndecentralized control strategies that cells use to achieve\r\nenvironment-responsive structures and functions, e.g. shape adaptation\r\nin plants and vascular networks, and locomotion in simple animals. The\r\naim is to harness these bio-inspired principles to create multi-agent\r\nrobotic systems that replicate the adaptability and responsiveness of\r\nliving systems. This work has broad application, from robust control\r\nin distributed sensor-actuator networks to the development of\r\nself-adapting architectural structures and prosthetics. This research\r\nsignificantly advances our understanding of how to design autonomous\r\nmulti-agent computing systems that can self-organize, self-repair, and\r\nrespond to the environment.\r\n\r\n",
