The purpose of this meeting is to engage a broad spectrum of the nanotechnology research community to address leading issues related to energy. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, a significant component of the conference is the Workshop on Nanotechnologies for Solar and Thermal Energy Conversion and Storage. The invited participants to this workshop will address current barriers to solar and thermal energy conversion and storage, which are emerging as the most significant barriers to widespread application of renewable energy. The output of this workshop will be a roadmap describing future research directions in this vital area. The workshop report will be published as a journal article, allowing for broad dissemination of the findings. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include support for women and underrepresented minority participants. The conference, including the workshop discussed above, addresses crucial research needs inhibiting sustainable energy conversion and usage, and thus may lead to reduced consumption of fossil fuel resources. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division, by the Energy for Sustainability Program, also of CBET, and by the Nanoscale Science & Engineering Program, all within the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).",
