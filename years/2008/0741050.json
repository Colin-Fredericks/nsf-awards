 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research develops high strength and flexibile fibers based on spider dragline silk for personal protective equipment for use in hazardous occupations and high strength membranes for water purification. The project resolves problems that have impeded making biosynthetic silk with the mechanical properties of the natural fiber. The project introduces new technology for aggregation of silk proteins into silk-like fibers that combines a molecular design of proteins through gene expression and a novel electro-hydrodynamic process for controlled generation and spinning of fibers.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are to provide superior personal protective equipment, improved fabrics, and filtration systems in markets important to the nation's security and the environment. Combining high strength and flexibility will restore full range of motion to individuals wearing protective clothing, such as police, military and others in hazardous occupations. Filtration is used in water purification, the beverage industry and the drug industry. The new, easily scalable process will enable an assortment of generic tools for design and creation of new molecular materials. Success in the project advances understanding of the science of silk protein structure and provides technology for using these proteins to develop nanomaterials with well controlled properties.",
