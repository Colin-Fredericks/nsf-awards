 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the development of an interdisciplinary climate change studies program at the University of Kansas, in collaboration with Haskell Indian Nations University.  The Climate Change, Humans & Nature in the Global Environment award addresses one of the National Academy of Sciences? \"grand challenges\" of the 21st century:  climate change and its impact on the planet?s ecological and social systems.  The program will provide Ph.D. students in the social and natural sciences and engineering access to the advanced scientific infrastructure at the University of Kansas?s remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, Biodiversity Institute, and Institute for Policy & Social Research, and the Haskell Environmental Studies Research Center.  Trainees will acquire the conceptual and technical toolkit, including remote sensing, modeling, and scaling across disciplines, needed to study the human and natural dimensions of climate change, strategies for mitigating its trajectory and effects, and the role of policy in shaping the drivers of and responses to climate change.  Broader impacts include multidisciplinary research training, collaboration with students and faculty at Haskell and a network of tribal colleges to assess the impacts of climate change in indigenous communities; participation in a climate policy internship; establishing a graduate certificate in climate change studies; developing a portable curriculum for interdisciplinary integrative research and education; and for trainees, learning the collaborative skills, problem-centered interdisciplinary training, and understanding of science policy needed by future leaders in climate change science, engineering, and policy.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Academies of Science have identified climate change and its impact on the planet\u00c6s biological, ecological, and social systems as one of the \"grand challenges\" of the 21st century.  Because climate change is a \"messy\" and complex problem involving the earth and all living systems, it is not a problem that can be solved only by individual specialists.  Researchers, policymakers, and practitioners must work together across specialties to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, For instance, no single technical expert can conduct successful research on the extent and timing of heat waves, droughts, melting permafrost, and wildfires associated with global warming, or the impacts and severity of storm surges, coastal flooding, salt water intrusion, and elevated high tides associated with sea level rise.  These events affect the land and the people, plants, and animals living there. \n\n \n\nUniversities have unique research capacities, resources, and technical expertise to study climate change and recommend approaches to minimize its negative impacts.  But, since universities are organized into disciplinary units, how can they prepare and organize researchers from multiple disciplines to work together on such complex problems? \n\n \n\nOur answer to this question of how to create interdisciplinary climate change studies was to focus on preparing the next generation of climate change researchers. We designed an exciting interdisciplinary research and training program for graduate students in the social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.  The C-CHANGE (Climate Change, Humans, and Nature, in the Global Environment) program at the University of Kansas offered a two-year program of classroom instruction and field research for 30 graduate students in anthropology, biology, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, environmental history, environmental policy, geography, geology, political science, and sociology.  Interdisciplinary teams of students combined knowledge and approaches to understand and offer solutions to some of the critical challenges of climate change. \n\n \n\nThe scientific merits of the C-CHANGE training program were reflected in the quality of the research conducted by the students and their faculty advisors.  Since climate change is not limited to one country, our students focused on research projects in several countries including group projects in the United States, Greenland, Mexico, and individual projects around the world.  In 2009, teams of students studied Monarch butterflies and their environments in the United States and Mexico in order to understand the impact of climate change on one of the largest scale migrations of the world.  They found that many existing Monarch preserves in Mexico visited by thousands of tourists each year likely would become increasingly unsuitable for the butterflies.  This kind of information is critical for preservation planning.  In 2012 students studied a variety of topics associated with global warming in Greenland and the Arctic.  They presented their research at the University of Greenland on the effects of climate change on fisheries in the Barents Sea, mineral resource development in Greenland, Arctic fox conservation programs, latrine design for remote Arctic regions, Arctic urban heat islands effects, and the release of methane from warming Arctic waters and melting permafrost.  In 2013, students organized a symposium on the current trend toward rising temperatures and declining precipitation, \"Beyond the Long Hot Summer: The Future of Water in Kansas,\" which included a variety of perspectives and was open to members of the university and the general public.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of the C-CHANGE program could be seen at the University of Kansas in the development of a graduate certificate program in environmental studies, one of several steps toward the development of interdisciplinary masters and doctorate programs in environmental s..."
