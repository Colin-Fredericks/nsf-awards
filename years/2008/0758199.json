 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to establish a novel strategy for diamond synthesis by laser resonant bond breaking in polymeric precursors and to develop a convenient and economically viable approach for patterning diamond films. The goal of this application will be accomplished through: 1) obtain high-quality diamond/diamond films through laser resonant bond breaking in precursor polymers; 2) study the transformation mechanisms and optimize processing parameters; 3) fabricate homogeneous diamond films on complex surfaces; and 4) fabricate diamond structures at micro/nanoscales using photolithography and laser strategy. Successful implementation of the proposed research will create a new direction for diamond synthesis and machining/patterning and significantly expand the horizon for diamond applications. By introducing polymers as precursors and using laser processing, the cost for diamond synthesis will drop considerably, while corresponding equipment will be significantly simplified. Meanwhile, an easy approach for diamond shaping and patterning will be established. \r\n\r\nThe research tasks and findings will integrate with educational activities, including integrating new knowledge gained in the research on diamond synthesis in a nanotechnology course, training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduates including those from underrepresented groups, and seminars for K-12 students and teachers. Results will be disseminated to scientific, industrial, public and educational communities in ways including online publications, journal papers, annual K-12 seminars, an animation kit, and conference presentations. This project will not only deepen understanding of diamond synthesis, but also benefit the industrial and commercial communities by significantly reducing the cost for producing and patterning diamond films. This project will ultimately benefit society through new and advanced electronic, biomedical, and mechanical applications and products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
