 "awd_abstract_narration": "NeTS-NECO: Robust, Delay-Tolerant Sketches for Aggregating\r\nSensor Data Streams\r\n\r\nEmerging data-intensive mobile sensor networking applications promise\r\na close observation of the world around us at a relatively low data\r\nacquisition cost. In these applications, it is a challenge to\r\naggregate observation streams from distributed sources, due to the\r\nbandwidth and delay constraints of the network, and the energy costs\r\nof data transmission. This project develops techniques for processing\r\nvoluminous sensor data streams within the resource constraints imposed\r\nby a distributed infrastructure-less network.\r\n\r\nTechniques are designed to summarize the observation streams into\r\nsmall space \"sketches\". By disseminating sketches rather than the raw\r\ndata, it is possible to trade-off reduced communication cost for\r\napproximate answers to user queries. The project investigates the\r\ntechnical challenge of making the sketches robust and suitable for\r\ntransmission over unreliable links. The sketches are delay-tolerant,\r\ni.e. they can tolerate long and variable network latencies. Various\r\nclasses of queries are supported including: basic aggregates of\r\nnumerical and categorical data, multi-dimensional temporal and\r\ngeographic aggregates, and time-decayed aggregates. The design of\r\nsketches is informed and inspired by the recent rapid progress made in\r\nthe area of massive data stream processing. The project will result in\r\nnew algorithms and data structures for sketching sensor data with\r\nprovable guarantees on the quality of answers. The research is\r\nexpected to benefit data-intensive sensor networking applications that\r\nare critical to our society, such as earthquake, pollution, and\r\ntraffic monitoring.\r\n",
