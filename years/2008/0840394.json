 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports  the Second IFIP Working Conference on \"Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments (VSTTE 2008)\",  Oct 6-9, 2008, Toronto, Canada.  The construction of reliable software poses one of the most significant scientific and engineering challenges of the 21st century.   Professor Tony Hoare of Microsoft Research has proposed the creation of a program verifier as a grand challenge for computer science and outlined an international program of research combining many disciplines such as the theory and implementation of programming languages, formal methods, program analysis, and automated theorem proving.   The VSTTE conference series was established by the research community in response to this challenge.  The VSTTE 2008 program includes three one-day workshops focusing on the three areas of focus:  theories, tools, and experiments.   This award is enabled through support provided by the NITRD High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS) interagency Coordinating Group.",
