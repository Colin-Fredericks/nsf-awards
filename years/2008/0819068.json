 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Nanotechnology for the Forest Products Industry,initiated in 2006, is the sole conference that is devoted to nanotechnology in the forest products industry. With over 150 national and international attendees from industry, academia, and national labs, this is the largest gathering of forest products professionals and decision-makers\r\nwith a focus on nanotechnology R&D, nano-manufacturing and business. This conference provides a forum for researchers and students to gain exposure of new advances in nanoscience and engineering applied to lignocellulosic biopolymers, and enable a research pathway that contributes to the next generation of sustainable and renewable nanobiocomposite materials.\r\n\r\nThe 2008 conference sessions cover several subject areas of resent work and new\r\nopportunities, such as, nanoscale characterization techniques (imaging, mechanical properties, chemistry, structure, interfaces, surfaces, etc.), nanoparticle self-assembly manufacturing techniques, nanocomposite processing techniques, relating changes at the nanoscale (chemistry,properties , and structure) to bulk properties, and health, safety and environmental implications.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this proposed project is to promote undergraduate and graduate student interest and involvement in nanoscience and engineering within forest produces sector by encouraging participation in a high level scientific forum, promote industry participation and promote high quality Keynote speakers.",
