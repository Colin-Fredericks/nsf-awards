 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike other oceanic archipelagos, Gal\u00e1pagos still retains most of its original species, but ecological degradation is proceeding rapidly. As in many other places, biological diversity of Gal\u00e1pagos is threatened by introductions of exotic species and reduction of continuous suitable habitat. Studying a group of closely related introduced and endemic weevils, this research investigates processes that can cause introduced populations to evolve rapidly, aiding their establishment and impact on native species. Additionally, it seeks to uncover the effects of reduced habitat connectivity on native species. Molecular tools will be used to assess the invasive potential of introduced populations and to measure potentially adaptive variation in both introduced and native populations. \r\n\r\n\tThe development of meaningful conservation measures requires scientific information, which often is scarce. This research will apply modern molecular genetic techniques to provide information needed to prioritize conservation management actions. With understanding of the root causes of the threats, the unique biodiversity of Gal\u00e1pagos can be protected and restored. Gal\u00e1pagos is a potential model region for biodiversity conservation, and effective management actions could be transferred to other less well-defined and well-studied ecosystems. Additionally, the project contributes to strengthening the work force of the future through high-quality mentoring and research-based training of many female and Hispanic undergraduates. \r\n\r\n",
