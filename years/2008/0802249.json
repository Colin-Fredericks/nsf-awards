 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides educational technology innovations that strengthen the engineering technology program and increases the number and diversity of students entering the field.  The project promotes a dual focus.  First, the project provides active learning tools for students.  Second, the learning tools are utilized to help middle and high school students become aware of and interested in career opportunities offered by the field.  The project includes a strong focus on attracting underrepresented students to the engineering and engineering technology fields.  The technology innovations include: creation of a sustainable energy 3D simulator and calculator incorporating four energy sources (wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal), incorporation of 3D Rapid Prototyping, and development of a feature rich interactive website entitled, \"Are You Ready?\"\r\n\r\nThe close linkage of this project with local middle schools, high schools, and other youth serving organizations improves student interest in careers in engineering and engineering technology fields and encourages and documents greater participation of underrepresented groups.  The project networks to local engineering technology industries and to a cutting edge 3D software development company.  All project outcomes are broadly shared with colleagues statewide and nationally.",
