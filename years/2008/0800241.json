 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal are (i) to conduct research on the study of the modeling of contact interface and stiffness-based biomedical diagnosis, and (ii) to perform experiments with sensing technology and applications with intelligent diagnosis.  The project aims at leveraging and complementing the expertise, research experiences, and infrastructure at both institutes in an international research collaboration between the PI at Stony Brook University and the collaborator, Prof. Makoto Kaneko at Osaka University, under the joint NSF-JST support.  The research and technology development are focused on modeling and applications towards \"better quality of life.\"  This collaborative US-Japan research strives to deal with research that focus on improving the quality of life by bringing about techniques which enhance the ability to reliably diagnose healthcare issues as well as the prevention of high-risk areas (for example, diabetes and glaucoma) for better quality of life, through the applications and modeling of both direct physical contact and non-contact interfaces.  Taking advantage of the international collaboration and exchange, the research project also invites participation of undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines in order to motivate them to choose a career in STEM.  The dissemination plan includes an annual symposium to increase the broader impact of this international research collaboration.\r\n\r\n",
