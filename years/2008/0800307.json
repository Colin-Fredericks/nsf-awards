 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent terrorist attacks in urban areas involving the use of explosives have exposed the vulnerability of buildings and other infrastructure to blasts. Structures directly in the path of the blast pressure wave are subjected to high-intensity and short-duration pressure loading. Because many important structures and facilities have been designed without considering such loads, developing and implementing blast mitigation strategies for existing buildings and other infrastructure, has become a critical priority. The central idea of this research is to study the concept of a protective system which provides dissipation to the energy of an incident blast pressure wave using geometric effects and irreversible compaction of material. A cementitious material, with continuously graded impedance (resistance) to the blast pressure wave propagation will be developed. It is proposed to engineer the material resistance to shock wave propagation to achieve optimum energy dissipation through geometric effects and irreversible compaction of the material. The outcome of the proposed research will form the basis for designing a cementitious material for use in blast mitigation strategies in practical applications. The work outlined in this proposal deals with three key issues: (a) experimental determination of the blast response of material; (b) numerical modeling of shock response of material; and (c) material production techniques for material with graded properties. \r\n\r\nThe educational component is primarily focused on minority students. The research will benefit from the presence on the campus of many programs already in operation to enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.\r\n",
