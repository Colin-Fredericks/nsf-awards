 "awd_abstract_narration": "The OASIS (Ocean/Atmosphere/Sea Ice/Snowpack) program aims to determine the importance of chemical, physical and biological exchange processes on tropospheric chemistry, the cryosphere, and the marine environment, and their feedback mechanisms in the context of a changing climate. As part of OASIS 2009, an integrated suite of instruments will be deployed at Barrow, Alaska, that will allow for the most comprehensive study to date of exchange processes and their impact on the overlying atmosphere. The deployment will consist of measurements of key chemical species active in the Arctic boundary layer photochemistry, including HOx, NOx/NOy, O3, halocarbons, organics and aerosols, as well as driving environmental factors such as actinic radiation. The project will result in a detailed study of the complex photochemical interactions between the relevant chemical families during background conditions and during periods of elevated halogen activity, using the most comprehensive set of measurements obtained to date. The data will also significantly advance the understanding of the overall oxidative capacity of the Arctic troposphere, of surface ozone depletion events, and of the nature and importance of aerosol production in this region. In addition, parameterizations of the emissions of halogens and NOx will be incorporated into CAM-Chem (a global chemistry-transport model) for studies of regional- and hemispheric-scale air quality impacts, and the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) will be used to conduct some of the first studies of the impact of climate change on OASIS processes. A major initial focus will be on changing sea ice characteristics, and in particular first-year sea ice which has been shown to correlate with halogen activation. The Broader Impacts include the participation of at least one graduate student and one postdoctoral fellow, and will contribute to the educational experience for other University students participating in the mission. The project will also fully include two SOARS (Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science) prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and a Denver-area high school teacher in the field measurement program, and will take part in outreach activities in Barrow and nearby communities on the North Slope of Alaska.",
