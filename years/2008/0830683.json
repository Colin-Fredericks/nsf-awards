 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex networks, including communication, economic and social networks,\r\nhave long been studied due to their fundamental technological, \r\nfinancial and societal significance. Over the last ten years, the dramatic\r\ngrowth of the Internet, the WWW and their applications,\r\nhas intensified the study of complex networks more than ever.\r\nThis work isolates parameters, including semantics and incentives,\r\nthat differentiate the structure and function of distinct applications. \r\nThis work also develops models capturing features of\r\ndynamic and evolving networks, such as online communities.\r\nOtbaining accurate models for complex networks is of fundamental \r\nsignificance in simulation, prediction and information retrieval.\r\nAll the above enhance performance and range of applications.\r\n \r\nThe first generation of models for complex networks involved topologies\r\nwith skewed statistics and the small world phenomenon. However, in several\r\napplications, these features are not adequate. This work develops \r\n\"flexible models\" which generate graphs with a wide variety of further \r\ncharacteristics. In particular, the work develops: \r\n(a) Topologies with very low assortativity, such as the ones observed\r\nin routing and biological networks. This is accomplished by an extension\r\nof the classical Erdos-Gallai and Havel-Hakimi graph algorithms.\r\n(b) Networks whose nodes and links capture semantics. In particular,\r\nnodes are associated with vectors (one dimension for each relevant attribute),\r\nand links are added with probabilities proportional to some vector \r\nsimilarity function (such as the inner product). This is a vast generalization\r\nof classical Erdos-Renyi random graphs.\r\n(c) Networks formed by selfish agents, which evolve according to \r\nincentive-based dynamics. The work also develops algorithms which exploit \r\nthe special features and structure of the network.\r\n",
