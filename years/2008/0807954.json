 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zheng\r\nDMS-08-7954\r\n\r\n     The investigator studies two important areas in\r\nnanocomposites: (1) homogenized effective dielectric constant of\r\nnanocomposites; and (2) percolation-dominated electrical\r\nconductivity of nanocomposites.  This project is focused on\r\nanisotropic systems with orientationally ordered nanoparticles,\r\nand is based on an accurate description of the nanoparticle\r\norientational probability distribution function from\r\nflow-processing databases, which we then map to effective\r\nproperties through volume averaging and percolation phenomena. \r\nIn the first part, the effective dielectric tensor is considered\r\nin two explicit systems of current interests: high dielectric\r\nconstant nanoparticles dispersed in polymers, and conducting\r\nnanoparticles dispersed in polymers.  Both systems are observed\r\nto lead to enhanced effective dielectric properties.  This\r\nrequires careful preparation, because the properties are\r\nextremely sensitive to details of composition and processing.  In\r\nthe second part, key aspects of salient electric properties are\r\nconsidered, such as percolation threshold modification by\r\nmechanical loading, multiscale homogenization method, and a\r\nmolecular-scale electron hopping model.  Numerical and\r\nmathematical homogenization and non-equilibrium percolation\r\ntechniques need to be developed to address these challenges.  The\r\nproposed projects modify, apply, test, and extend existing\r\nmathematical theory and numerical approaches for two-phase (or\r\nthree phase, if interphase is considered) composites, where the\r\nnumber of particles and new surface area simply overwhelm\r\nexisting tools. \r\n\r\n     The aspirations for extreme property enhancements through\r\ndesigner nanoparticles mixed into traditional materials are based\r\non prototype experiments.  However, there are new challenges\r\nunique to nanocomposites for which there are no predictive\r\nmathematical or computational tools.  This project is a response\r\nto these needs, through a coordinated combination of mathematical\r\nanalysis and scientific computation, ranging in scale from\r\nindividual particles to bulk properties.  Today, limitations\r\nimposed by particle numbers only allow low moments of the\r\nnanoparticle distributions to be measured, and the inherent\r\nmaterial sensitivity to the details of the distribution observed\r\nin experiments is unknown.  This project gives insight into the\r\nmechanism underlying extreme property gains, and thus provides\r\nkey input into design and control strategies. \r\n",
