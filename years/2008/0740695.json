 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to develop a novel detection system based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and common path interferometric detection (CPI), to detect binding events of biological relevance.  The investigators will use self assembled monolayer (SAM) chemistry, or a three dimensional binding surface comprised of polymers to bind the antibodies of interest that will in turn, capture antigens of interest from the blood or other biological fluids.   \r\n\r\nCurrent detection of binding events relies on labeling one of the molecules and subsequently monitoring the interaction of the labeled entity with the target of interest.  As such, the cost and effort associated with such measurements are high and could be significantly lowered if the need for labeling is obviated.  The current proposal addresses this crucial problem and may provide a solution that would be of use in medical and scientific applications.  An assay based on SPR and CPI has the potential to successfully achieve this important issue.  \r\n",
