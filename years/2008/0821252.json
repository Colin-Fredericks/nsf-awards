 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Texas State University-San Marcos to enable the purchase of a multiphoton-ready microscopy system consisting of a scanning confocal system that can be converted to multiphoton capability by future addition of an infra-red laser.   Confocal microscopes revolutionized microscopy by enabling scientists to see microscopic, fluorescing objects even when they are very close together (e.g. >1 ten-thousandth of a millimeter apart).  This feat is possible because confocal microscopes use optics to eliminate out-of-focus light, creating very narrow planes of focus. They use digital imagery to reconstruct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional images.  In addition to generating stunning micrographs, confocal microscopy enables scientists to examine the relationships among various proteins and large molecules in cells.\r\n\r\nThe new confocal microscope will promote teaching and research at Texas State University for diverse scientists.  Projects include investigations of nerve regeneration and the interactions among proteins involved in signaling relays in animals, plants and bacteria. Faculty and students from nearby Texas Lutheran (~24% Hispanic) and Saint Mary?s Universities(~51% Hispanic) will study evolution in bacteria and regulation of the development of neurons. Texas State?s Materials Science group will use confocal microscopy to better understand the structure of nanomaterials used in coating rocket motors. Education is tightly interwoven with research at the participating universities, and students will be performing most of the research. More than 20 graduate students (currently 17% minority, 50% women) will use the microscope at Texas State each year. Thus, this instrument will have a significant impact on the career aspirations of the next generation of scientists.\r\n",
