Therefore, the research goal is to understand the interaction of carbon nanomaterials with biomolecules, cells, and the whole organism.  New educational plans are proposed for establishing a biophysical nanoscience curriculum at Clemson University, and are complementary to fulfilling the research plan.  Establishing the proposed new thrust of biophysical nanoscience is driven by three critical needs: the need to understand the fate, transport, modification, and accumulation of nanoparticles in biological and ecological systems, the need to develop new strategies and methodologies to address the challenges of safe nanotechnology, and the need to update the physics curriculum and provide\r\nmultidisciplinary education for undergraduate and graduate students at Clemson University in the EPSCoR state of South Carolina. This proposed new thrust utilizes the established strength at Clemson in nanoscience, materials, and biophysics, and will foster collaboration opportunities in accordance with the priority areas of major funding agencies\r\n\r\n",
