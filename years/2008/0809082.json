 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate sediment transport and channel evolution in gravel-bed rivers\r\nin response to sediment pulses, taking advantage of the field-scale experiment that will be\r\ncreated by the removal of Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork of the Columbia River, MT. Through\r\ndata collection on pre- and post-dam removal channel conditions and on bedload and suspended\r\nload transport out of Milltown reservoir during high flow periods, this research will address\r\nfundamental questions about fluvial processes, sediment transport and deposition, and dam\r\nremoval. Several hypotheses will be investigated about how pulses of fine sediment infiltrate\r\ninto and affect the mobility of armored river beds, about spatial and temporal patterns of\r\nsediment transport and deposition, and about effective discharges for transporting sediment\r\npulses. This research will provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate how previous flume\r\nresearch or field studies of small channels, upon which much of what is known about sediment\r\ntransport and related aspects of fluvial processes is based, scale up to larger rivers. The\r\ndata collected here will also be evaluated in the context of the implications of geomorphic\r\nresponses and sediment geochemistry for habitat and biological processes.\r\nRemoval of Milltown Dam, which will begin in spring 2008 and continue the following winter,\r\nis especially notable because (1) it is the largest dam removal to date in the United States\r\nin terms of the volume of reservoir sediment potentially available for downstream transport\r\n(approximately 3 million m3; another 2 million m3 are being mechanically removed); (2) the\r\ndam is the downstream end of the largest Superfund site in the United States, the Clark Fork\r\nComplex, and reservoir sediments are composed largely of contaminated mine tailings; (3) it\r\nis occurring on a regionally important river that includes designated Critical Habitat for\r\nbull trout, a federally threatened species. Systematic study of this dam removal will therefore\r\nhave broader impacts on multiple levels, including for understanding the sediment and metals\r\ntransport associated with a significant dam removal, for the insights it lends to upcoming\r\nplanned removals of large dams, and for its broader contribution to understanding how gravel-bed\r\nrivers respond to increased sediment fluxes. Broader impacts will also derive from the project?s\r\ninterdisciplinary nature, whereby analyses of geomorphic processes, geochemistry, hydrology,\r\nand fish response will be combined to understand downstream effects of dam removal.\r\nThis project will help a new faculty member build a research program in fluvial geomorphic\r\nprocesses and will directly support one graduate and one undergraduate student. The project\r\nwill also foster ongoing collaboration efforts between University of Montana and Salish-Kootenai\r\nCollege, a tribal college in Pablo, MT, whose students will assist field data collection and\r\nanalysis under the guidance of the PI. Further, data collection and analysis related to Milltown\r\nDam removal will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate geomorphology and geochemistry\r\ncourses, an integration of teaching and research that will be facilitated by the project?s\r\nclose proximity to the University of Montana.",
