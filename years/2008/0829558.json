 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CPATH Community Building project develops a computing education community focused on introducing enterprise computing technologies into undergraduate computing education.  Marist College serves as the lead institution in partnership with Illinois State University, North Carolina Central University, University of Arkansas, and Widener University.  The team plans to bring together representatives from academia, industry, and non-profit sectors to develop and implement new curricula focused on skills needed to develop and maintain enterprise systems, integrate them into networks of technologically and geographically diverse systems, and design and implement applications that span a network of enterprise systems and distributed systems working together. Students should have the skills to set up and run data centers that minimize energy requirements and meet the ever increasing need for business continuity and disaster recovery. The project includes participation by a wide range of experts to develop cost effective undergraduate curricula based on nonproprietary standards that address essential computing technology principles encountered in predominantly large system environments.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in strong collaborative team and committed industry partners. The enterprise computing focus is innovative and important for the nation but also challenging both academically and practically.  The project has the potential to produce new research and models in an area of emerging importance to the country.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include the development of an educational community to share resources such as new courses and curricula. The implementation of new enterprise computing curricula could impact job prospects and capacity for students across the country through new innovative computing pathways open to a diverse student population in a range of academic disciplines.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report:\n\nThe Enterprise Computing Community (ECC) was founded in 2008 with nine academic partners and nine industry partners.  The goal of the community was to foster the study of large systems technologies in the undergraduate computer science curriculum across the US. \n\nThe problem the community wanted to address was the skills shortage caused by a retiring workforce whose members design and maintain the most complex computer systems in the world &ndash; systems that US financial institutions, retailers, airlines, non-profits, government, and military organizations depend on to run their daily operations.  In 2008,\nthese systems were rarely studied at the undergraduate level, so replacement technologists with the requisite skills were not coming into the workforce. \n\nThe ECC worked to highlight the problem and to form a team of experts from academia, industry, and non-profits to identify the technologies that were unique to enterprise computing, e.g. high speed transaction processing, high-volume business intelligence, enterprise resource planning systems.  Once the technologies were identified, the ECC prioritized the technologies, identified new growth areas, e.g. cloud computing, business analytics, and began to develop the undergraduate course changes that were needed.  The PIs completed the course curricula in 2010, presented it to the ECC community in their 2010 ECC Conference at Marist College, and made the curricula available to colleges across the US through the ECC website. \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nOver the grant period (2008 &ndash; 2012), the ECC community grew to over 1000 technologists (industry, faculty, and students) from more than 190 companies and 80  universities.  Through annual online forums and on-ground conferences, they engaged in a lively cross-disciplinary exchange with input from industry leaders and academic professionals (computer science, information technology, business, and engineering departments) as well as current undergraduates and and recently graduates. The community agreed to:\n\nDrive an all-out effort in 2009 and 2010 to survey undergraduate curriculum for enterprise computing content. \nHold online and on-ground workshops with academia, industry, and government participants to identify their most pressing skills needs.\nCreate an enterprise computing curriculum and make it available to all ECC members:   \n\nSix undergraduate courses were developed and the material made available to all ECC universities.\nThese courses are also now offered to working professionals through the Institute for Data Center\nProfessionals at Marist College http://www.idcp.org/\n\n\nDraw attention to the problem, by bringing world-renowned keynote speakers to annual ECC Conferences to highlight the many applications of enterprise computing, e.g., Jeff  Nick (Senior VP and CTO, EMC Corp.), Deputy Commissioner James Onalfo (CIO of NYPD and the NYPD Real Time Crime Center), Nicholas Donofrio (IBM Fellow and Retired\nExecutive VP for Innovation &amp; Technology),  and Dr. David Ferrucci (lead researcher on the Watson Jeopardy! machine)\nGain corporate sponsorships from industry leaders, including IBM Corp.

That conference was modeled after the ECC Conference held at Marist each June.\n\n\nBroader Impact:  \n\nThrough the efforts of the ECC, current enterprise computing skills requirements and opportunity areas were identified each year at the annual forums and conferences.  In addition to traditional enterprise computing technologies, the time period between 2008 and 2012 saw cloud computing and analytics rise in importance.
