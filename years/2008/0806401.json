In the past few years, he and his\r\ncollaborators developed a theoretical framework and numerical\r\nmethods (the string method) for dealing with barrier-crossing\r\nevents in complex systems.  In the first part of the project, he\r\napplies the string method to problems arising from material\r\nsciences.  In particular, the dislocation motions and the energy\r\nlandscapes of silicon will be studied at the atomistic scale. \r\nThe minimum energy paths at low temperature and the minimum free\r\nenergy paths at finite temperature are investigated.  In the\r\nsecond part of the project, the investigator studies the problem\r\nof mapping free energy landscapes in multiple-dimensional spaces. \r\nFor problems arising from theoretical chemistry and structural\r\nbiology, very often the interesting dynamics can be characterized\r\nby a number of collective variables.  For example, conformation\r\nchanges of bio-molecules are usually characterized by several\r\ntorsion angles or distances between different chemical groups. \r\nThe computation of the free energy associated with these\r\ncollective variables is of great practical interest. \r\nUnfortunately such a calculation has been limited to situations\r\nwhen there are only a few collective variables (typically no more\r\nthan 3), mainly due to the enormous number of grid points or bins\r\ninvolved in the calculation based on a regular grid.  In this\r\nproject, the investigator uses a sparse representation for the\r\nfree energy function based on sparse grids.  This to a certain\r\nextent overcomes the difficulty and allows the mapping of the\r\nfree energy landscape in spaces up to about 30 dimensions. \r\n\r\n     Many problems from structural biology, theoretical\r\nchemistry, and material sciences can be abstractly formulated as\r\na system navigating over a complex energy landscape.  The system\r\nspends most of time in metastable states (the local minima of the\r\nenergy landscape), with thermally activated transitions from one\r\nmetastable state to another.  The questions of interest are the\r\nmechanism of such transition and the transition rates.  These\r\ntransitions happen on a time scale specified by Arrhenius' law,\r\nwhich is much longer than the intrinsic time scale of the\r\ndynamical system.  For example, the individual atoms in a\r\nbio-molecule vibrate on the scale of femtoseconds (1e-15 s); in\r\ncontrast, conformation changes of the molecule (which is the\r\ninteresting event) typically happen on the scale of milliseconds\r\n(1e-3 s -- a trillion times longer than a femtosecond) or even\r\nlonger.  The disparity in the time scale makes traditional\r\napproaches (e.g. the direct simulation of molecular dynamics or\r\nLangevin dynamics) prohibitively expensive.  In this project, the\r\ninvestigator develops efficient numerical tools (the string\r\nmethod) for the study of such transition events and the\r\nassociated energetics.  The numerical method is applied to\r\ninvestigate the dislocation motions in crystalline solids at the\r\natomistic scale.  The mapping of free energy landscapes of\r\nbiological systems in multiple dimensions using sparse\r\nrepresentations is studied as well.",
