 "awd_abstract_narration": "West Virginia University is developing a two course sequence for in-service science teachers, aimed at providing the scientific content and applied scientific and technical skills necessary for middle to high school science teachers to lead an inquiry-based study of local watersheds. Modeled using the GLOBE Watershed Dynamics investigation and using new and established GLOBE protocols, the course content focuses on physical processes and interactions between land cover and hydrologic systems occurring within watersheds. Taking an Earth system science approach, geospatial technologies are applied in support of spatial thinking and spatial analysis; remote sensing, GPS, and GIS are used to explore, map, and analyze interactions between terrestrial and fresh water systems. The course sequence is an interdisciplinary partnership between the West Virginia University Eberly College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Human Resources and Education.",

DONT GUESS provided professional development experiences for two cohorts of K-12 science teachers from across West Virginia, supporting them as they taught physical and biological science in the context of local watersheds.  Local watersheds provide a meaningful spatial framework for studying science and mathematics in a state that has numerous water quality and water quantity challenges. Thus the idea of genuine, relevant science content, taught within a meaningful spatial framework, is central to DONT GUESS.\n\nThe DONT GUESS project is a direct outgrowth of the recognition of the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education to the economic and intellectual well-being of the United States.  K-12 education is the foundation for building future STEM capacity, but unfortunately many students, who early in their academic careers show an aptitude for STEM, lose interest in the subject as they progress through middle and high school.  Maintaining and even building new interest in STEM in the nation\u00c6s schools requires science teachers to have access to professional development experiences that they can draw on to re-invigorate their teaching, and re-connect with their students.  We find that by focusing on local environmental issues, such as water quality of neighborhood streams, and by using modern geospatial technology such geographic information systems (GIS), aerial and satellite imagery (remote sensing), and global positioning systems (GPS), students and teachers see new relevance for STEM in their everyday lives.\n\nThe focus on geospatial technologies is supported by National Research Council recommendations that spatial thinking and spatial reasoning should be incorporated in secondary education through the application of geographic mapping and analyzing technologies.  DONT GUESS also directly addressed West Virginia\u00c6s 21st Century Learning initiative. The DONT GUESS project also drew on the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program, an international program sponsored by NASA, NOAA, NSF, and the US State Department.  GLOBE promotes education through collaborative study of the earth\u00c6s environment by K-12 students, educators and scientists.  GLOBE recently developed a new focus area on Watershed Dynamics, and by being able to leverage the GLOBE infrastructure, the sustainability of the DONT GUESS project is greatly enhanced.\n\nThe outcomes of the DONT GUESS project include not only immediate benefit to the two cohorts of teachers who participated in the project, and their current students at the time, but also the many future students who will benefit from these teachers.  The development of the new STEM-education college curriculum is another important immediate outcome.  The project has also provided new insights regarding structural challenges within the K-12 education environment that limit the potential for incorporating new technologies in the classroom, which will be important to consider in planning future follow-on professional development opportunities.  Finally, an important strength of DONT GUESS is that it demonstrated the benefit of incorporating in curricular development both education scholars and scientists actively engaged in geospatial research.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rick E Landenberger"
