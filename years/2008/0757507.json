 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moore's work in infinite combinatorics concerns classification and basis\r\nproblems for uncountable structures and their connection with cardinal\r\nexponentiation.  On one hand, strong axioms such as the Proper Forcing\r\nAxiom and Woodin's Pmax axiom are invoked to build embeddings and\r\nmorphisms between structures such as linear orders and topological\r\nspaces.  Since these strong axioms themselves imply that the cardinality\r\nof the real line is the second uncountable cardinal, it is natural to\r\nask whether the classification theorems which follow from them already\r\nfix the cardinality of the continuum.  The research supported by this\r\ngrant aims to prove new classification results from these strong axioms,\r\nto better understand the relationship between these classification\r\nresults and the value of the continuum, and to improve our understanding\r\nof the strong axioms themselves.\r\n\r\nThe oldest results in set theory concern the rigorous development of the\r\n\"size\" of an infinite set.  The cardinal numbers provide a linear scale\r\nwith which one can measure the number of elements a set has --- also\r\nknown as its cardinality.  One of the earliest questions in set theory\r\nwas Cantor's Continuum Problem: Determine the cardinality of the real\r\nnumber line.  In the 1960s, this problem was shown to be independent of\r\nthe usual axioms of mathematics.  Still, it is unclear whether some\r\nother compelling mathematical statement, also undecidable, might settle\r\nthe Continuum Problem.  Moore's research aims to both establish the\r\nindependence of new classification results for infinite mathematical\r\nstructures and to relate these results to the Continuum Problem.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver 100 years ago, Cantor asked whether there was an order of infinity between that of the natural numbers {0,1,2,...} and the real numbers (any number such as &pi; or &radic;2 which is expressible as a decimal).  The assertion that no such intermediate cardinal exists became known as the Continuum Hypothesis.  More generally, one can ask which order of infinity corresponds to the cardinality of the set of real numbers; this is the Continuum Problem.  In the middle of the last century it was discovered that this problem was sensitive to how mathematics is formalized; that is, what basic axioms are used as the basis for formal mathematical proof.  The study of these foundational aspects of mathematics has become known as set theory.\n\nThe research project investigated the structural properties of models of mathematics in which the Continuum Hypothesis is true, classification problems for uncountable mathematical structures such as linear orders, and the relationship between such classification problems and the Continuum Problem.  It found that there is an inherent amount of logical complexity in mathematical universes which satisfy the Continuum Hypothesis which is not necessarily present in arbitrary mathematical universes.  This adds further evidence to the argument that the Continuum Hypothesis is not part of an axiomatic system for mathematics.  The project also completed the classification problem for a class of uncountable linear orders known as Aronszajn lines, which were considered in the 1930s and which have resisted understanding until only very recently.  When combined with work of Martinez-Ranero, we now know that any class of Aronszajn lines contains finitely many basic examples with the property that every other member of the class must contain a copy of one of these finitely many prototypes.\n\nThe project also aimed build a set theory research group at Cornell.  Historically, set theory has had no presence at Cornell.  The proposal supported graduate students and an active research seminar, bringing experts in the subject from around the US and Europe to speak about their work for the benefit of the research group and the mathematics department at Cornell in general.  The research seminar is now very active and set theoretic research at Cornell now has an international presence both within the field of set theory and within mathematics as a whole.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Justin T Moore"
