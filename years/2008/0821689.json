With this capability, the RSS will be able to simultaneously record spectroscopic data in the visible and the near infrared.  This capability will open a new window for the discovery and study of the most distant and earliest galaxies in the universe by measuring the onset of star-formation and the luminosity function of the first star-forming galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to the training of a new generation of astronomical instrumental scientists including postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students.\r\n",
