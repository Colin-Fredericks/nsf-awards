 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oklahoma State University (OSU) proposes to adapt the MIZZOU ADVANCE mentoring plan in order to increase the retention and advancement of women in science and engineering. The long term goal of this is project is aimed at identifying and developing changes to university policies and practices to better serve and represent its changing academic workers in terms of gender and ethnicity. The goals of the program are to bring awareness of barriers to women?s and underrepresented groups? advancement across STEM fields. The data gathered in this effort will help to institutionalize positive changes at the university level and identify department-specific barriers in order to increase overall participation and advancement of women and minority faculty to senior and leadership ranks. Activities targeting the culture, practices and structures that impede advancement of women faculty can only be successful through the intervention of the faculty within STEM departments, who are best positioned to collaborate with university leadership to improve persistent organizational problems. Through its partnerships with regional institutions in Oklahoma, OSU plans to expand the network of institutions and individuals from other STEM underrepresented groups, such as African Americans and Native Americans, to equip them with knowledge in order to empower them to begin addressing the under representation of women in academic science and engineering. \r\n\r\nProject activities will include (1) Mentoring and networking programs that span STEM departments, including a two-tier mentoring program to enhance career development for women and for faculty of color; (2) University-wide programs and workshops aimed at increasing career flexibility and culturally sensitive interventions; (3) Workshops for STEM faculty from OSU and regional institutions; and, (4) OSU ADVANCE website that includes best practices, research, electronic newsletter. Given OSU's partnership with a regional HBCU and three tribal colleges, this initiative will also contribute to the development of adapting these interventions to include underrepresented groups in removing barriers for women in STEM \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the OSU Advance Partnership are significant and wide ranging. In addition to addressing the under representation of women in senior faculty and leadership positions in STEM areas at OSU, we expect to enhance recruitment and retention of women in junior faculty positions as well. This program of actions and interventions will provide an important and tested model for wider applications in supporting and promoting the success and advancement of women in STEM fields. The scientific work force of the United States will be vitally enhanced by ensuring that women and people of color, two rapidly growing segments of the labor force, are positioned to assume positions of leadership in STEM fields at OSU and nationally. Students at OSU, both undergraduate and graduate, will be an important part of data collection and analysis. This will, in turn, both advance their academic experience and training, as well as providing them the opportunity to participate in transformational research and interventions. We are committed to ensuring the highest level of diversity in recruiting student researchers from traditionally under-represented groups. We would note that OSU has one of the largest Native American student populations in the United States in addition to other traditionally underrepresented student populations. The PI and co-PIs have worked closely with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program (OK-LSAMP), NABS (Native Americans in Biological Sciences), SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, and similar student and professional programs. \r\n",
