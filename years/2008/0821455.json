 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will provide funding for a high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR-ICPMS) to further the goals of interdisciplinary Earth and Environmental Science research at Texas A&M University (TAMU). The research applications afforded by the acquisition of this equipment will play a critical role in the PIs? research and teaching programs. The analytical applications offered by the HR-ICPMS are required for and will enhance and diversify future research capabilities. In addition, the instrumentation will benefit at least ten faculty members in five departments and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. Acquiring a HR-ICPMS will more fully engage TAMU researchers in cross-disciplinary research, and enhance the teaching, training, and learning of undergraduate and graduate students. The HR-ICPMS instrument will play a prominent role in the $2.6M geochemistry facility that is currently under construction and scheduled for completion in April 2008.  \r\n\r\nThe new HR-ICPMS instrument will make possible several lines of research: studies of the relationship between changes in past patterns of atmospheric and ocean circulation and past climate change, studies of past ocean chemistry and temperatures, tracer studies (isotopic and elemental) in the hydrosphere, and studies of the petrogenesis of igneous and metamorphic rocks. The instrumentation will benefit higher education through laboratory training for undergraduate and graduate students. Construction of a clean lab and acquisition of the HR-ICPMS will establish a wide range of opportunities for thesis and work experience as well as coursework and associated research projects. In addition, scientific results derived from the Texas A&M HR-ICPMS-related research will be incorporated into all levels of classroom instruction of geology and oceanography. This direct linkage between cutting-edge research and curriculum revision/innovation is one of the primary ways in which the geosciences can reach the broader public.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
