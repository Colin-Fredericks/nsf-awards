 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on significantly enhancing traditional laboratory instructional practices through the use of mobile experimentation and data acquisition devices. The targeted goals of the project include: 1) relinquishing a degree of control to students by providing them some flexibility in determining the subject of their experiments and in the development of experimental procedures and protocols; 2) implementing the use of mobile experimentation as a powerful and flexible tool in lecture-based coursework; and 3) expanding the concept of the laboratory to include virtually everything outside of the traditional laboratory room.  In addition, this project includes extensive use of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) by the students in completing the laboratory exercises.   The products resulting from this effort include: 1) PDA-based data acquisition system with commonly used sensors (i.e. velocity, temperature, light, sound); and 2) suites of experimental activities with customizable PDA-executables for various engineering and science courses.",
