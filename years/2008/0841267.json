These workshops are held in conjunction with annual and sectional meetings of the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and at the national meeting of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). They are designed to help faculty develop and sustain undergraduate research programs. This project is making these workshops available to a wider audience, as well as serving as a means of leadership development for rising and current geoscience faculty. Alumni of past GeoCUR workshops are now actively involved in leadership positions within CUR, and they are facilitators for this series of workshops.",
