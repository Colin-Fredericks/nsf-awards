 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Science Center will organize a one-day symposium linked to the Giant Screen Cinema Association (GSCA) International Conference and Trade show in September 2008.  The symposium will focus on the greater potential of gian screen experiences to connect society with science, building on the GSTA's symposium \"Giant Screen Films and Lifelong Learning held in 1999.  The program will bring together science and education experts with filmakers to stimulate and enhance more effective approaches to science learning in future giant screen films.  Symposium results will be disseminated through publication and the internet, as well prepared for submission to peer-reviewed journals.  An industry-specific listserv focused on lifelong learning will be created to serve as a new community-building tool for exchange among producers, distributors and exhibitors.  Emlyn Koster (Liberty Science Center) and Mary Nucci (Rutgers University) will serve as aymposium chair/PI and symposium manager/Co-PI, respectively; in partnership with GSCA staff, they will be responsible for symposium management, evaluation, and dissemination of results.",
