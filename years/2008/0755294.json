 "awd_abstract_narration": "We aim to attract a diverse pool of bright mathematically inclined rising juniors and seniors with demonstrated aptitude for modeling, imaging or cell biology and provide them with 1) a common grounding in existing and emerging neuro-imaging modalities and the subsequent computational challenges that arise from the analysis, synthesis and eventual guidance of such experiments, 2) a closely mentored experience of the joy of discovery in a field of research with clear intellectual reward (no one with a brain lacks in wonder of their brain) and potential for broader impact on the fields of biology, health, and mathematics, and 3) a common grounding in the best practices of oral and written communication of science.\r\n\r\nOur participants will receive an advance mailing comprising 1) a common reading text, 2) imaging and modeling tutorials, and 3) detailed project descriptions. They will spend the first of their 10 weeks in tutorials with ample time to interact with our mentor pool at Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. This will permit them to make an informed choice of mentor and project by the close of the first week. Sample projects include: 1) Mathematical modeling of the biochemical basis of memory, 2) Computational Modeling of Cochlear Mechanics, 3) Electrophysiological, computational and functional imaging approaches to processing of visual information in the cerebral cortex of alert behaving primates, and 4) Neural mechanisms of time perception.",
