 "awd_abstract_narration": "This S-STEM project supports scholarships for academically talented and financially needy students in mathematics, sciences and computing. This project builds on lessons learned from a previous CSEMS project to provide a learning environment producing highly qualified scholars who will contribute to a 21st century workplace. This project aggressively recruits scholars from area high schools, two-year colleges, and universities. In addition, the project supports a bridge program for scholars between the participating community colleges and the university. The project advertises the scholarships through brochures, posters, a website, and meetings with math and science teachers in regional high schools. The recruited student population has high financial need and includes a large percentage of underrepresented groups. An Advisory Committee of university and community college faculty from targeted disciplines selects the scholars each semester and serves as advisors for the scholars. The project creates community among the scholars through required participation in a tailored learning community and in a yearly one-hour project course where the scholars work for a mock company to produce a marketable product. Fields trips and speakers provide the scholars with exposure to industry professionals.",
