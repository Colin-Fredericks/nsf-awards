 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to develop and prototype an energy harvesting for sensor applications in civil engineering structures. An effective and efficient solution will be provided to the energy harvesting problem in sensor applications to civil structures.  \r\n\r\nA innovative method for vibration energy harvesting will be developed and implemented with novel device architecture. A non-linear pendulum-type architecture is proposed that will employ parametric resonance and nonlinear energy transfer. Prototypes of the proposed device, which is exp3ected to provide a high lever of electric output power under various conditions will be fabricated and tested both in laboratory and on selected highway bridges in Hawaii. Together with advances in other engineering fields, this research will help establish a solid foundation for developing truly autonomous and self sustained structural health monitoring systems. \r\n\r\nThe proposal addresses a very important problem - energy harvesting device to power wireless sensor. The proposed research program will also enhance education and outreach activities of University of Hawaii at Manoa, which is in a unique position as a minority institution with its student body represented by underrepresented groups with native Hawaiian ethnic backgrounds. \r\n",
