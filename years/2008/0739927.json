 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photographer, An-My Le, will travel to the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station to photograph the military support activities at the end of the summer research season when all resources and personnel are intent on preparing for the winter. Specifically, Ms. Le will focus her lens on the Air Force flight operations, the Navy offload of the containership, and the grooming of the channel by the Swedish icebreaker, Oden.  \r\nMs. Le's photographs will reveal to viewers, the integrated function of the military in the research work and life in Antarctica. It will also show the surprising web of connections that exist between the worlds of scientific research and the military, their intersecting cultures and disparities. Her examination of the military presence in the region will also give a visual resonance to the Antarctic Treaty. She expresses that the continuing peace and cooperation in the Antarctic region represents a beacon of light and inspiration.\r\nThe Aperture Foundation has committed to publishing a book on Ms. Le's Antarctic work and an exhibition of her photographs is scheduled at the Murray Guy gallery in NYC for late 2008.\r\n",
