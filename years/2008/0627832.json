K. Earle is associate dean for student affairs and associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Florida. He has participated in the University of Florida Minority Mentor Program for the past 18 years, and has started new mentoring programs in the college of engineering to attract and retain pre-college students and undergraduates in the field of engineering. Among these, the Successful Transition through Enhanced Preparation for Undergraduate Programs (STEPUP), a transition program for entering minority engineering undergraduate students, became the model for a university-wide program established to address the needs of incoming African-American freshmen across the campus.\r\n\r\n",
