The conference is devoted to an active branch of modern Algebra: groups generated by automata(transducers). The conference will focus on applications of groups generated by automata to other topics of Mathematics: automatic sequences, Galois Theory, dynamical systems, etc. It will bring together specialists of different areas, will be a venue for sharing ideas between them and provide a comprehensive introduction to the subject to all interested in it.\r\n\r\nGroups generated by automata where discovered in 1970's, as interesting examples of groups with exotic properties. An important recent development is a strong link with dynamical systems, which has made them an important tool in holomorphic dynamics and analysis on fractals. A thorough introduction to these topics will be provided at the conference, so that experts from different fields (in particular from Holomorphic and Symbolic Dynamics) may get quick in-depth knowledge of groups generated by automata.",
