This, its extreme axial tilt, and the unusual seasonal pattern it produces, set Uranus apart from the other giant planets.  Neptune, on the other hand, has a significant internal heat source.  Both planets, however, now show increasing levels of atmospheric activity, which might be due to variations in the solar heating affecting the atmospheric dynamics.  This project will use the Explicit Planetary Isentropic Coordinate (EPIC) general climate model to simulate the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune, including the effects of solar insolation on the zonal and meridional circulations, and investigating vortex stability and seasonally-altered zonal wind structure.  Such comparative modeling will elucidate the role that solar insolation plays in driving the atmospheric dynamics of ice giant planets, and contribute to understanding the origin and evolution of gas and ice giant atmospheres.\r\n\r\nThe work is interdisciplinary, linking the fields of atmospheric dynamics, computational physics, and observational astronomy, to promote synergy between the observational and modeling endeavors of planetary astronomy.  The program involves practical research by a graduate student and links the Astronomy Department at NMSU with the Comparative Planetology Laboratory at the University of Louisville.  It includes public outreach to a predominantly Hispanic community.",
