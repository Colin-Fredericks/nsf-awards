In the last three to five years, new potential applications have been proposed for non-equilibrium plasmas in the area of combustion, including strategies for reduction in pollutant emissions, improved-efficiency fuel synthesis, and high-speed ignition and flame holding.   While an array of non-equilibrium plasma combustion-related phenomena have been observed, the ability to predict the effectiveness of potential new processes and systems has lagged due to a distinct lack of fundamental kinetic data in this field.  \r\n\r\nThis research is an integrated experimental / modeling study of hydrocarbon oxidation mechanisms in plasmas under conditions of extreme thermal non-equilibrium.  Large, highly non-equilibrium pools of important hydrocarbon combustion intermediates and electronically excited air species will be created in a short pulsed fuel-air plasma, created using specialized discharge technology available at Ohio State University.  The time evolution of critical species will be measured experimentally using advanced laser-based optical diagnostic methods and then compared to theoretical predictions in order to validate and improve fundamental plasma kinetic models. \r\n\r\nThe major benefit to society will be to advance a truly different ignition methodology that improves combustion engine technology.  Furthermore, the combination of experiment and analysis provides excellent opportunities for teaching, learning, and training. As a result of this grant, one team member will incorporate a module on plasma aerodynamics, including plasma combustion, into his undergraduate fluids curriculum.",
