Primary support, for $25,000, is being provided by the Charlotte Research Institute.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nRecent advances in technologies for optical wavefront manipulation, optical detection and digital post-processing have stimulated new possibilities for imagining systems in the visible and IR regimes. This opens up the possibility of developing imaging systems which differ in form factor and capabilities from traditional imaging systems and camera designs.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together both hardware and software experts as well as mathematicians and physicists who are actively working on the fundamental issues of information theory and light-matter interactions, to bring new ideas to this emerging area.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\r\nThese different communities working together will identify new challenges for the optimal use of optical and electronic hardware that will impact applications that range from cell-phone cameras to noninvasive cancer screening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________May 27, 2008\r\nPaul J.
