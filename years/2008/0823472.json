 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peptide and neuropeptide hormones are potent signaling molecules that act in all animals to coordinate physiology, behavior, and development. Although new genetic techniques have identified many genes encoding peptides that may function as hormones, much remains to be discovered about how, when, and where peptide hormones are produced and what biological functions they serve. This project uses molecular genetic approaches in a simple model system, the fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), to determine how peptide hormones involved in regulating growth and developmental progression are produced by specialized processing enzymes called SPCs. The research will determine the requirements for SPC function in specific sets of neurons and will determine how processed peptide hormones contribute to development, growth, and the maintenance of normal glucose levels. Defects in peptide hormone signaling in humans lead to diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of peptide hormone production that results from this study will be of broad relevance and may contribute to therapies for diseases that involve defects in hormonal signaling. The project will also contribute to the preparation of the next generation of scientists by instructing graduate and undergraduate students in the use of cutting edge genetic and molecular techniques to address important research questions.",
