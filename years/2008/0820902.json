 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place August 3-14, 2009 in Pilar, Argentina. Organized by Dr. Orlando Auciello of the Argonne National Laboratory, the PASI will address the critical development of advanced neural prostheses that can make a major impact on improving the quality of life of groups of individuals, namely: 1) retinal prosthetic devices to restore sight to people blinded by inherited degeneration of retina photoreceptors, 2) cochlear prostheses to restore hearing to people impaired by degeneration of the natural sounds sensors in the cochlea, and 3) sensory nerve stimulations for restoration of motor function in people paralyzed by traumatic nerve degeneration. \r\n\r\nThe activity will provide the bases for developing advanced neural prostheses via improvement of electrode materials, design and integration with bio-matter to produce bio-inspired electrodes that will provide a bio-interface to cells.  Expected outcomes in this PASI will include:  the bringing together of researchers with interdisciplinary expertise (physics, chemistry, materials, science, electronics, biology, eye, ear, and nerve stimulation specialists, and surgeons) to discuss the science and technology of current neural prostheses and the approaches to develop new materials, prosthesis architectures, and bio-interfaces critical to the development of smart bio-inspired electrodes for advanced neural prostheses.  Results from this PASI will be disseminated through a website at Argonne National Laboratory.",
