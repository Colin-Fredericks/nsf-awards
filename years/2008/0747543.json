 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to the development of new methods for rapidly transforming inexpensive hydrocarbon starting materials into more complex biologically relevant compounds by direct introduction of nitrogen-containing functional groups.  New metal-catalyzed oxidative amination reactions of carbon-carbon multiple bonds will be a significant focus of this work.  Studies to understand the basic organic and organometallic mechanisms of the fundamental steps of these reactions will also be conducted.  \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Forrest Michael of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.  Professor Michael's research efforts revolve around the development of efficient methods for the formation of C-N bonds, specifically those that are tolerant of air, water, and complex functional groups, operate under mild conditions, and are highly stereoselective.  The successful creation of a toolbox of C-N bond-forming reactions will provide more efficient access to biologically active small molecules.",
