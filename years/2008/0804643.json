 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis collaborative award supports a program primarily directed towards issues that stem from recent experimental observations of a supersolid state. A supersolid is a new state of matter in which part of the atoms in the solid show frictionless motion with respect to the rest of the solid, or the container that holds it. This resembles such phenomena as superconductivity and superfluidity. The precise nature of the supersolid state is currently a matter of lively debate. A combination of mechanical and x-ray experiments aims at correlating phenomena observed at the macroscopic level with the microscopic structure of the solid. This will provide critical information for a more general understanding of supersolidity. The project is a vehicle for intensive and sustained collaboration between research groups at the University of Delaware, Western Michigan University, Northern Illinois University, and Pennsylvania State University focused on experiments at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. This setting gives both the undergraduate and graduate students involved a much wider view of the physics enterprise, and their potential role in it, than is usually the case. It also provides a mechanism for the students to build up a network of contacts among peers early on and forms an excellent preparation for a scientific career.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThe central goal of this collaborative project is to provide critical information necessary to interpret recent observations of a possible supersolid state in 4He. A series of combined x-ray diffraction, torsional oscillator (TO) and dielectric constant experiments will be used to investigate several questions: 1. Are there features in the x-ray diffraction directly indicative of a supersolid transition? E.g., a careful study of the Debye-Waller factor may provide limits on the Bose condensate fraction. 2. What aspects of crystal quality are important for the formation of a supersolid state? X-ray measurements will be used to determine the crystal quality, and will be combined with TO measurements in a simultaneous experiment. In addition, disorder will be introduced in a controlled way by growing the solid in porous media such as aerogels. 3.  Does 4He form a commensurate solid at T = 0, or is the zero-point vacancy concentration > 0? High precision measurements of the temperature dependence of the lattice constants at constant volume, can distinguish between thermal and non-thermal vacancy populations. The training of graduate as well as undergraduate students forms an important part of this project. Its collaborative nature, as well as the fact that part of the work is done at the APS/ANL, gives students a much broader exposure to modes of research than is normally the case, and will form an excellent preparation for a scientific career.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n                This project was a collaborative proposal between the University of Delaware, Northern Illinois University, Penn State, and Western Michigan University.  The purpose of this project was to use x-rays to study the properties of one of the more unusual types of crystals, a crystal of solid helium.  Helium is unique in that it is the only substance that will remain liquid down to absolute zero.  Even at the lowest temperatures, it requires a substantial amount of pressure to create a crystal of solid helium. X-ray measurements were carried out using the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, a high brilliance x-ray synchrotron source.  Eight students from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level were involved in various parts of this research.\n\n                This project had two purposes.  First, we were looking for signatures of a proposed supersolid state, which was thought to exist in low temperature solid helium.  A supersolid would be a sort of crystal where the atoms in the solid would not be simply fixed in place, but rather be extended throughout the solid in a quantum state.  Other measurements had shown signs of such a state in the solid, but we were not able to find any signature for a transition.  (These other measurements were later found to be due to a different phenomenon). \n\n                In addition, since solid helium is an unusual solid, we wanted to understand its basic properties.  We studied x-ray scattering from both the liquid and single crystals of the two isotopes of helium, as well as the crystal structure of the helium in porous media.  We found that the solid has an unusual liquid-like x-ray scattering pattern even when solid, and that the crystal structure of the solid is strongly affected by porous media. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clement Burns"
