Materials growth methods, electrical, chemical and physical characterization, pattern generation, device fabrication, and theory/modeling are invoked to ensure holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to the development and investigation of novel materials and devices.  The single Interdisciplinary Research Group on Graphene Science and Technology investigates fabrication and characterization approaches for the implementation of epitaxial graphene as an electronic material.  The MRSEC has extensive collaborations with corporations, national laboratories and universities world-wide.  Broad educational activities and outreach programs that integrate materials research into K-12, university and professional education are supported and fostered.  Shared experimental facilities at Georgia Tech and partner institutions ensure the ability to fabricate and characterize materials for use in a variety of applications.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMicroelectronic devices and integrated circuits (ICs) have established the ways in which we communicate, seek/use information, and plan/spend our personal time.  ICs are employed in large-scale computers, transportation vehicles, and consumer items such as microwave ovens, laptops, and phones.  Incorporation of these electronic devices into a myriad of tools and gadgets has been driven by miniaturization of electronics.  For more than 50 years, silicon has been the material of choice for the simultaneous fabrication of millions, currently billions, of devices such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and diodes that are interconnected to yield circuits that enhance our lives.  These phenomenal advances have been made possible by continued miniaturization of device sizes that allows higher speeds, improved capabilities, enhanced reliability, and continued improvement in circuit performance to permit new applications.  Due to the inherent physical properties of silicon, current silicon-based electronics will soon reach its fundamental limits for size reduction.  In order to continue the advances in ICs achieved to date, it is critical that alternative materials, processes and devices be developed. The Georgia Tech (GT) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) supplies the technical knowledge base, diverse workforce, leadership, and innovative materials processing expertise required to implement new electronic materials that enhance, complement and serve as the successor to silicon for future electronic devices and circuits. The GT MRSEC has developed a fundamental understanding of epitaxial graphene (EG) growth and properties, and has demonstrated how EG could be a foundational material for future electronic devices.  Graphene is a flat, single layer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional hexagonal (honeycomb) array; EG is graphene that has been grown on a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate to generate a unique high-purity and structurally high-quality graphene from which high-speed electronic devices can be manufactured.\n\nEG has been grown by high temperature treatment of SiC to evaporate Si and leave behind a carbon surface layer.  By appropriate furnace design and process sequence investigation, EG layers with electron speeds more than one hundred times the electron speed in silicon have been demonstrated.  Much of the work subsequent to that discovery focused on the fundamental understanding of the physical, chemical, and electrical properties of EG and processing methods for the fabrication of transistors.  For instance, techniques to form small (&lt; 50 nm width) ribbons of EG, control defects in EG, perfect the interface of EG with SiC, and alter EG electrical properties on SiC substrates, have been investigated, all of which are essential for the large scale manufacture of high speed, low power electronic devices.  A 10,000 EG transistor array was produced to demonstrate the feasibility of this novel approach to future device and circuit fabrication.  A total of 189 journal publications and more than 215 invited talks at conferences, universities, and corporations resulted from these studies.  A website (Graphene Times) was established as a news vehicle for publications/reports related to graphene science and technology; content was updated weekly from numerous data bases.\n\nIn addition to extensive development of the science and technology of EG, the GT MRSEC has integrated the science/technology developed with educational programs, student/postdoctoral/teacher training and mentoring, and industrial needs to ensure availability of the necessary workforce and technical transfer capabilities for electronic materials and processing, which enhances the U.S. economy.  These efforts also promote diversity of students and faculty involved in the development and fabrication of future electronic materials, devices, and circuits, by collaborative research with Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse Col..."
