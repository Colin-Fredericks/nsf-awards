Primary research activities will focus in the areas of micro/nano electro-mechanical system material and structure, micro sensor/actuator system and design, feedback control system for rapid assembly system, and micro-robotic arm kinematics/dynamics and motion control.  To enhance the hands-on laboratory research experience, a variety of additional activities are included in the program.  These include: a series of informative seminars; field trips; and social events designed to foster group cohesiveness as well as to hone the students' leadership skills. Students will also sharpen their communication skills through the writing of a research report and through presenting their research work to industry members of the manufacturing system consortium in the Central Texas area.  \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will target women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. The program intends to have more than 80% of the participants come from institutions that offer only undergraduate programs.  Students who participate in this REU program will not only contribute to the development of micro-manufacturing technology, but they will be more likely to remain in a technical field.  Successful development of micro-manufacturing systems opens endless application opportunities in homeland security, transportation, aerospace, biomedical, advanced manufacturing, and many other commercial applications.\r\n",
