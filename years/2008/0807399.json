 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bodmann\r\n0807399\r\n\r\n     The mathematical description of redundant linear\r\nrepresentations of analog signals is called frame theory, and it\r\nis central to open problems in many fields of applied mathematics\r\nsuch as approximation theory and numerical as well as statistical\r\nanalysis.  In short, a frame is an (over)complete set of vectors\r\nthat gives stable expansions.  Previous works have measured the\r\nerror correction capabilities of frames with means derived from\r\ngeometric or functional analytic formulations.  However, for\r\npurposes of signal communication and statistical analysis,\r\ninformation theory should provide the guiding principles for\r\noptimal design.  The goal of the project is to close this gap by\r\ncombining frame and information theory.  Applying\r\ninformation-theoretic optimality criteria to frame design is\r\nexpected to have a significant impact on all tasks that involve\r\nanalog signals being transmitted or interpreted in the presence\r\nof noise.  The investigator seeks to characterize and construct\r\nlinear signal encoding and decoding maps for two specific areas\r\nof applications: Find frames with associated encoding and\r\ndecoding maps that achieve the information-theoretic optimum for\r\n(1) error correction of digital streaming media and (2)\r\nclassification of signals in noisy microscopy images. \r\n\r\n     Digital signal transmissions have revolutionized our daily\r\nlives, from cellular phones and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol\r\ntelephony to high-definition television and other streaming\r\nmedia.  The use of digitization helps suppress distortions\r\ntypical for analog devices and allows seemingly faultless\r\ncommunication by incorporating redundancy, that is, repetetive\r\ninformation.  However, at times the digital nature of error\r\nsuppression leads to artifacts that do not resemble the graceful\r\ndegradation we recall from analog transmissions.  The reason for\r\nthis deficiency is that the general-purpose digital communication\r\nprotocols are not well-adapted to the properties of the encoded\r\nanalog signal.  The investigator aims to restore the possibility\r\nof graceful degradation to streaming media sent across the\r\ninternet, or to wireless communications in unreliable\r\nenvironments.  The optimal design of analog-digital encoding has\r\nsimilar implications for the decoding of analog signals, such as\r\nthe extraction of information from microscopy images in biology. \r\nThe reliable monitoring and classification of cell constituents\r\nin microscopy images is essential for measuring physiologic\r\nresponses in cells (such as the stages in the cell cycle) and for\r\ndetecting anomalous behavior that occurs as a result of disease. \r\nClassifying cell behavior is relevant for the evaluation of drugs\r\nwith high-throughput assays, including the development of\r\ncancer-cell growth inhibitors.",
