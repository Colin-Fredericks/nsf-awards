 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI Kodrick Brown\r\nDDIG Proposal number 0808508\r\nTitle: DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Behavioral and ecological factors mediating the co-occurrence of two Gambusia  fish species\r\n\r\nIncreasing habitat alteration has put previously geographically separated species into secondary contact. The mechanisms by which two closely-related species avoid hybridization when they come into contact are of great interest. Hybridization avoidance can be driven by differences in ecology and/or behavior. This is the first study that attempts to consider the relative roles of both mechanisms in hybridization avoidance in a model fish system. To determine how two species of fishes are avoiding complete genetic introgression, this study will measure the degree of hybridization in the wild and in a semi-natural population experiment using standard molecular techniques. The molecular data will be examined in light of other laboratory and field studies for this project. It is expected that both ecology and behavior play an important role in the maintenance of the two species' unique identities. This project will broaden the scope of current molecular investigations by linking both behavior and ecology to overall hybridization dynamics. \r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThis study will provide research experience for underrepresented undergraduates at the University of New Mexico. This research will facilitate collaboration with state and federal agencies and university researchers. Because one of the study species is federally endangered, opportunities exist for participation in public education forums, organized by these state and federal agencies, to inform the public about status and management of native wildlife within the State of New Mexico",
