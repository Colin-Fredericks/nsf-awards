Draughon is professor and co-director of the Food Safety Center of Excellence at the University of Tennessee's Institute of Agriculture. She was nominated for the award for demonstrating a sustained commitment to mentoring young scientists for more than 20 years, and has also mentored and trained women and other minorities to take leadership roles in the fields of science, engineering and mathematics. Draughon's activities include recruiting and hiring undergraduate and graduate women and minority students to work in the laboratory to increase their interest in research and to acquire the skills to conduct their own research projects; and introducing them to key professionals in the field of food microbiology and food safety at professional meetings.\r\n\r\n",
