 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there has been a change in paradigm as to the course of Large Scale Collider Experiments.  Until recently, experiments have been done at US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and Cornell CESR.  These large labs often had in-house theoretical physics groups that could aid in the planning and analysis of the experiments.  However next year, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will start operation, making obsolete all current US Collider laboratories. At this facility two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS will be supported approximately 30% by DOE and NSF and will have large participation by people previously working at the US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and CESR. \r\nIn order for the discovery capabilities of the LHC to be fully utilized many calculations and calculational tools need to be developed so that the theoretical uncertainties related to the standard model of strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions become less than the experimental uncertainties. Event generators used by experimentalists in analyzing data need to be generalized or totally rewritten so that signatures coming from candidate theories for explaining Beyond the Standard Model Physics can be understood and to compared with data. Finally, Non-standard Model ideas that include Supersymmetry, Extra Dimensions, Grand Unified Theories, Brane-world Scenarios, and String inspired Effective theories will need to be systematized and analyzed so that their predictions can be easily compared with the new data from the LHC including experimental cuts, backgrounds etc.  The LHC is an essential discovery tool for finding new phenomena which go beyond the Standard Model and which already have been hinted at by the discovery of dark matter, dark energy and small masses for the neutrinos. The US effort in those areas of physics crucial to interpreting and making best use of the LHC facility needs revitalization.  The US effort will have to be University based and is an excellent arena for training students and the next generation of Phenomenoligists.  The purpose of the LHC initiative is to have a mentoring process for involving US graduate students and Post-Docs to get involved with calculations relevant for the interpretation and analysis of upcoming experiments.   \r\nThe initiative calls for one-year fellowships for graduate students and two-year fellowships for Post-docs to work under the guidance of a mentor on LHC related theory projects.  The students, Post-Docs and Mentors will form a network with communication by teleconferencing. There will be two annual meetings with experimentalists to discuss the ongoing data collection process and its interpretation.  It is hoped that the synergy between the young theorists and the experimental community will present a new paradigm for optimal discovery potential in the field of High Energy Physics. It is also hoped that this initiative will allow the US to again take a leadership role in High Energy Phenomenology. The network formed will provide a backbone for a nationwide collaborative theory network making it possible for physicists from isolated groups and smaller institutions to participate and focus their efforts on projects that are directly relevant to the LHC.",
