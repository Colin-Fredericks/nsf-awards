 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses comprehensive theoretical investigation of a broad range of\r\natomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) processes of current significance in science and\r\ntechnology. The proposed activities will build on both of our past efforts and the new\r\ndevelopment of nonperturbative theoretical formalisms and high-precision\r\ncomputational methods for accurate treatment of both the electronic structure of highly\r\nand multiply excited states as well as the multiphoton dynamics and coherent control of\r\natomic and molecular processes in the presence of intense external fields.\r\nEmphasis in the first part of this proposal concerns the ab initio theoretical exploration of\r\nthe frequency comb structure and coherence within each order of the high-order\r\nharmonic generation (HHG) spectrum in the high-frequency VUV/XUV regime. Two\r\napproaches will be developed for the study of frequency comb projects: (a)\r\ntime-dependent generalized pseudospectral method (TDGPS) for accurate and efficient\r\nsolution of the time-dependent Schrdinger equation (TDSE) in space and time, and (b)\r\nmany-mode Floquet theory (MMFT). The second part of this proposal will deal with the\r\nstudy of the coherent control of population transfer in Rydberg atoms via sequential\r\ntransitions or via multiphoton adiabatic rapid passage. In the last part of the proposal,\r\nseveral longer range projects will be presented, including (a) the development of a new\r\nTDGPS method in hyperspherical coordinates for fully ab initio 6D treatment of doubly\r\nexcited resonance states and double photoionization dynamics of two-electron atoms in\r\nthe presence of external fields, and (b) the further development of the\r\nself-interaction-free time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for the\r\nexploration of many-electron Rydberg atom dynamics.",
