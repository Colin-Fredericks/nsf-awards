GreenLeaf Market is developing application program interfaces to enable the automated transfer of data to enterprise resource planning systems through a representational state transfer interface interchangeable with a webservice. This platform automatically identifies and aggregates agricultural market information while enabling this information to be integrated into the purchaser's business systems. \r\n\r\nIf successfully commercialized, the application stands to significantly reduce post-harvest spoilage costs, now in the tens of billions of dollars for the United States. It will increase productivity for purchasers, assist the producer in identifying emerging markets, reduce the distance agricultural products must travel, boost the local economy, improve the food security of the US, and lower the overall cost of food by reducing the gap between supply and demand.",
