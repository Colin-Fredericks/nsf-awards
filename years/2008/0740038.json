 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a heat exchanger technology utilizing a homogeneous nano-porous surface (NPS) that will significantly increase the efficiency of the boiling process.  The NPS technology offers considerable enhancement in boiling heat transfer capabilities for small- to large-size heat generating facilities, power plants, and electronics cooling hardware. The goals of the proposed Phase I research are: 1) to develop an effective NPS for boiler applications, 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NPS technology against other conventional heat exchanger technologies, and 3) to evaluate the long-term performance of the NPS based heat boiler.  A prototype multi-tube boiler will be constructed and tested for industrial deployment.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed project will be achieved by producing a surface that can generate smaller and controllable bubble sizes during boiling processes.  Unlike traditional flat surfaces and previously investigated micro-porous surface coatings, the NPS technology can offer improved long-term durability, a simple-to-manufacture and low-cost means of achieving higher performance and more energy efficient heat transfer.  Successful implementation of this technology will result in millions of dollars saved nationally and internationally in the energy market.",
