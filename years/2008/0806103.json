 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide array of mathematical methods will be used to increase the understanding of the long and short term behavior of processes occurring in self-similar, fractal and disordered media. The existence and uniqueness of self-similar Dirichlet forms, Laplacians and diffusions will be proved on a wide class of fractals, including infinitely ramified generalized Sierpinski carpets and limit sets of self-similar groups. Gaussian and non-Gaussian heat kernel estimates and Green's function estimates will be studied on self-similar and random fractals. The project will contribute to the ergodic theory of products of not necessarily independent matrices and their relation to local properties of processes on fractals. Asymptotic formulas for Lyapunov exponents of differential and difference equations with small random perturbations, and  estimates of the Lyapunov exponents of stochastic  differential equations will be obtained, and related to the spectral problems for stochastic differential equations. Work will be done to investigate such questions as functional spaces, partial differential equations, and various notions of differential geometry and topology on fractals. The project contributes to better understand the analysis on Julia sets, limit sets of self-similar groups and finite automata, quantum graphs, products of matrices and ergodic theory, non-commutative calculus and geometry.\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to the study of processes in disordered media (fractals), which have many applications in physics, chemistry, biological sciences and engineering. Diffusion processes in percolation clusters, vibrations of fractal objects, signal propagating in channels with random obstacles, electro-magnetic waves in fractal antennae, Rossby waves in oceanography, models of financial markets are just a few of many examples of such processes. The project includes various activities that integrate research and education. The broader impacts of the project include contribution to the development of human resources in science and engineering, expanding participation of underrepresented groups, and enhancing infrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\n",
