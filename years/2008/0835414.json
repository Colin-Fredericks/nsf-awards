The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the operation of electricity generation and water supply infrastructures can be made more resilient and sustainable by integrating assessments of air quality and water availability into electricity generation dispatching decisions. \r\n\r\nThe project proposes to:\r\n1) Create integrated infrastructure/markets/natural cycles models using the state of Texas as a source of data and as a geographic and temporal test-bed.\r\n2) Evaluate the resiliency of the integrated system to a series of challenges or \"shocks\" to test resiliency and sustainability\r\n3) Assess alternative technical, economic and institutional mechanisms for incorporating assessments of air quality and water availability into the operation of electricity generating systems; these alterations will include changes to existing wholesale power markets, air quality regulation, and emissions markets, as well as potential developments in water markets.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research would provide new methods for improving the resilience of electrical and water infrastructures. A major outcome of the work will be the proof of principle for a next-generation framework for managing the impact on emissions and water use of electricity generation by integrating advanced meteorological information with existing and potential market developments in electricity generation, air quality management, and water availability. This framework will also help in understanding a broader set of impacts from perturbations in the integrated system.\r\n\r\nBy demonstrating a next-generation framework for the integrated management of air quality, water use, and electricity generation, the project will provide alternatives for policy-makers in the case study region. In addition, the information generated by this project will be used to develop educational modules that will be used in classes in energy systems, air pollution control and environmental regulation and policy at both UT and MIT. Further, project personnel will participate in scientific and policy meetings/workshops at which project results will be presented, including forums such as MIT's \"Knight Science Journalism Fellows\", in which journalists spend a year at MIT. Finally, the project will be used to continue the University of Texas' outreach to female students, specifically by engaging participants in UT's Women in Engineering Program (WEP) as project interns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was part of the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) program on resilient and sustainable infrastructures (RESIN).  Our project examined the sustainability and resiliency of electricity generation and water infrastructures in Texas.  Sustainability and resiliency were evaluated by examining the response of the systems to a series of challenges or \"shocks\" such as drought, changes in fuel types and emissions pricing.  For example:\n\nWe explored how using a nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission trading market can achieve significant NOx emissions reductions from the current system without the need for new costly capital expenditures, we also explored ancillary benefits of NOx emission trading, such as reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and water consumption. \nWe examined water and air quality impacts of changing fuel supplies in the Texas electrical grid, particularly focusing on the impacts of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing activities.  The results demonstrated that there are substantial air quality benefits in switching from coal to natural gas in electricity generation, in some cases even in the regions in which enhanced natural gas production is occurring.  In a related analysis, we examined the spatial distribution of water use from combined natural gas production (using hydraulic fracturing) and power generation.  We found that while overall water use decreased over the fuel and electricity generation life cycle, some river systems saw increases in water use (see attached Figure).  \nSince we recognized that shifts in electricity generation shift the spatial and temporal patterns of water demand, we examined whether water demand could be lowered in regions with extreme drought by shifting electricity generation out of the regions.  We demonstrated that this was possible for a recent severe drought episode in south Texas.  \n\n\n \n\nThe project developed powerful new modeling tools that allow researchers and decision-makers to better understand how electricity and water infrastructures respond to both natural and human stresses (intellectual merit).  Also, the results of the project were used to develop new educational materials, including elements of a massively on-line and open course titled Energy 101, that had more than 40,000 students enrolled (broader impacts).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David T Allen"
