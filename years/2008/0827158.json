Kolok\r\nProposal # 0827158\r\nTitle: Student travel to the International Congress on the Biology of Fishes. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows support for travel to the VIIIth International Congress on the Biology of Fishes, to be held in Portland, Oregon from July 28-August 1, 2008. The Congress is international in scope and is expected to draw approximately 300 prominent fish physiologists from around the globe. Travel funds will be offered to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on a competitive basis, with special consideration being given to US citizens from underrepresented populations. For the awardees, attendance at the meeting will provide them with an opportunity to present independent research, learn about the latest international scientific developments within the field of fish physiology and network with colleagues and potential mentors. \r\n",
