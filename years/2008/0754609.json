 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0754609: \r\nThis award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Maryland, Center for Environmental Studies (UMCES). Following a  5-day orientation session, students will work mainly at one of the two UMCES marine laboratories, Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) or Horn Point Laboratory (HPL). The program will support fourteen students during a twelve week summer research program that includes independent research projects by the students, preparation of an NSF-style proposal, a mid-summer presentation, field and laboratory studies, and preparation of a final journal-style research paper and a final oral presentation at a symposium. The program introduces REU students to applying the scientific method; learning field and lab methods; developing an understanding of estuarine processes; achieving an in-depth understanding of a research problem; and learning to interpret, organize and present in written and oral form the results of a research project. Students may work individually with their mentors or as part of a large, interdisciplinary research program. Recent student research topics include nutrient biogeochemistry, estuarine modeling, sedimentology, trace element chemistry, land use impacts, fisheries bioenergetics modeling, predator/prey studies, microbial ecology, genetics, environmental contamination and organism toxicity. In addition, student activities include learning about science communication, research ethics, graduate school application process, networking, science policy and alternative careers in marine science. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.\r\n",
