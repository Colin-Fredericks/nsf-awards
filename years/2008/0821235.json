 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to St. Cloud State University (SCSU), St. Cloud, Minnesota, to acquire a flow cytometer that is a versatile and easy-to-use instrument that can perform quick, multicolor flow cytometric analysis in order to detect and quantify different types of cells. Intellectual Merit: The flow cytometer will bring to SCSU a highly sensitive tool crucial for sophisticated cellular and molecular analysis in areas such as immunology, genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, parasitology, physiology, phycology and aquatics. Nine research laboratories in the Biology and Chemistry departments at SCSU all require identification and quantification of different cell molecules.  The acquisition of the proposed instrument will allow the PI to elucidate important biological mechanisms involved in signal transduction of immune responses. In addition, the flow cytometer will be used to research eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, tumor cell sensitivity, hormonal responses, bacterial toxin activity, and environmental aquatic contamination. Thus, the utilization of the flow cytometer will promote diverse research projects by nine laboratories, and undergraduate research training in common cell analysis technique.\r\n        Broader Impacts: Incorporation of proposed instrument into undergraduate curricula will also greatly improve the laboratory practices of several biology and chemistry classes, including Immunology, Hematology, and Cell culture techniques. A robust, versatile, multicolor flow cytometer is a fundamental piece of equipment for a research and teaching institution such as SCSU.  Its acquisition will not only enrich primary research, cross-departmental collaboration and undergraduate teaching, but also promote attractiveness of SCSU to new prospective students and faculty.",
