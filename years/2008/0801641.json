 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems\r\nBehrouz Farhang-Boroujeny, University of Utah\r\nNext Generation Communication Networks Using Multicarrier Filter Bank\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop an effective solution for next-generation wireless communications that comprehensively addresses the important issues of efficient use of the wireless spectrum, user mobility, and multi-access applications.  The approach is to use multicarrier filter banks to minimize the side-lobes of the filters that constitute the subcarrier signals, thereby alleviating the need for subcarrier synchronization among different nodes in a network.  Freedom from the subcarrier synchronization should alleviate problems due to Doppler shift under mobility and, also, enable cognitive radio communication and support communication among ad-hoc nodes without the need for centralized infrastructure nodes.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The intellectual merits of this research include a thorough analysis and development of the class of multicarrier systems that use filter banks for subcarrier channelization with emphasis on networks with high-mobility; development of novel equalization and synchronization algorithms for multicarrier filter bank modems; and the development and analysis of novel medium access control protocols that take advantage of the high spectral containment of subcarrier signals in multicarrier filter bank.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Multicarrier filter banks are an enabling technology for efficient and complete use of the radio spectrum, so the research has potential economic and societal benefits related to wireless communications.  In addition to the technological impact, the multicarrier concepts serve as a catalyst for learning in several active research and project experiences in signals and systems, software radio, and networking courses.\r\n",
