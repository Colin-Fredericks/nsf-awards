 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamic nature of chromatin (i.e., DNA complexed with its protein packaging) is associated with dynamic gene expression across the genome. Chromatin dynamics are environment-sensitive, yet the contribution of chromatin remodelers (proteins that modulate these dynamics) to adaptation to novel environmental conditions is unknown. Preliminary work described several chromatin remodeling genes that bear the signature of local adaptation in the commonly studied fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This project will characterize the roles of the alternative chromatin remodeling gene variants by measuring patterns of gene expression, and to describe natural variation in chromatin state (static or dynamic) in response to environmental variation. These questions will be addressed using technology that enables gene expression and protein-DNA interactions to be studied within entire genomes.\r\n\r\nThis research will shed light on a novel role for chromatin remodeling proteins. It will also describe novel gene variants that may reveal novel gene function. Recent studies demonstrate a link between mutations in chromatin remodeling and aberrant gene expression profiles associated with many human diseases, including cancer. Natural variation associated with environmental variation, specifically environmental stress, documented in Drosophila may shed light on human disease variation associated with chromatin biology.\r\n",
