 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the disruptive technology of protein-based disk recording through recording/storing/retrieving information on the surface of a photosensitive protein using near-field optical transducers (nanolasers) and demonstrate the potential for areal densities beyond 10 Terabit/in2. The approach is to integrate unique and unmatched optical properties of photochromic proteins with the state-of-the-art in the emerging field of heat-assisted magnetic recording. These properties include thermal and structural stability of 2-nm molecules with a photocycle with a characteristic transition time of the order of a few picoseconds.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe emphasis of this multidisciplinary project will be on the device integration rather than the biophysics of proteins. An \"apertureless\" \r\nnear-field optical system will be utilized to focus light into a spot size of less than 30 nm in diameter.  To manufacture unique ultra-high throughput nanolasers, as necessary for adequate signal to noise ratio, focused ion beam will be used to define nanoscale apertures on a metal-coated emitting edge of a semiconducting diode.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nUCR is one of America's most ethnically diverse research institutions. The investigators commit to make every effort to assure diversity among the students involved in this project and especially with the goal to attract more young people in the region of Inland Empire to enroll in Ph.D.\r\nprograms. This effort also calls for outreach to K-12 schools. Finally, it is anticipated that the study of the \"high-risk\" protein-based memory could not only leapfrog the data storage industry but also revive the national initiative in molecular electronics.",
