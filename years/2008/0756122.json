 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the role of cultural and institutional barriers to the advancement of women in the political arena.  The project aims to investigate whether discrimination against women in voters' evaluation of candidates and evaluations of office holders engaged in decision making helps to explain the decrease in the number of female office holders in Russia. To study the impact of cultural attitudes on voters' evaluations, the investigators designed a series of experiments where respondents are exposed to either a candidate's policy positions via speeches or a decision made by a local mayor.  These elements are kept constant, but the sex of the candidate or mayor is varied to see if voters evaluate male and female candidates and office holders differently.  \r\n\r\nThe Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Buryatia, Tatarstan, and Murmanskaya oblast are the sites for this study.  This choice allows the research team to test for regional differences between the circumpolar and southern regions in the evaluation of women as candidates.  In addition, these cases allow for variation in terms of the dominant religion among the local population.\r\n\r\nThis project promises to shed light on the role of cultural attitudes of voters on political participation of female candidates and their chances to win electoral seats. The results will provide new insights into how voter perceptions and attitudes are influenced by region, religious culture, and candidate characteristics.  The Russian regions present a particularly interesting place in which to study these relationships.",
