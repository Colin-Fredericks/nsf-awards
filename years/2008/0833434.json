 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tech to Teaching project is creating an infrastructure on the Georgia Tech campus that encourages and enables undergraduate and graduate students to effectively pursue careers in K-12 or college teaching, and is developing and implementing programming that ensures these students succeed in their initial years in these career paths.  This effort includes steps towards the institutional transformation of a research-extensive technical institute into an organization that effectively promotes and supports entry to teaching careers.  The new infrastructure and programming align and adapt initiatives developed for other Georgia Tech NSF educational programs, such as the Student and Teacher Enhancement Partnership (STEP) GK-12 program, the Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Science (FACES) AGEP program, the numerous IGERT and RET programs on campus, and a Robert Noyce program awarded to Georgia Tech in partnership with Kennesaw State University.  The Tech to Teaching infrastructure also is a collaboration between many units on campus, including advising, academic courses, mentoring, immersion experiences, and transition or induction support.  In addition, the project is increasing ties between Georgia Tech and partner institutions of higher education in Georgia, such as Spelman College and Georgia Perimeter College, through the use of Georgia Tech graduate students as instructors in the partners' classrooms.  Ultimately, Tech to Teaching will encompass the systems and procedures, personnel and resources to ensure that the pathways to teaching careers are clear and well-lit for both the students and their advisors with the necessary courses, mentoring, and immersion experiences in place to facilitate the students' successful transitions through the academic pipeline to these teaching careers.  As Tech to Teaching comes to fruition, Georgia Tech will maintain the teaching infrastructure at the level needed to meet the demands of its student population, hopefully improving the STEM educational experiences of countless future students at colleges and universities across the country as the Georgia Tech students enter the academic world.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Georgia Tech's Tech to Teaching Program\n\n\n Background\n\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology is a research institution, dedicated to creating new knowledge and educating students in technical fields.  Regulations put forth by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia specifically prohibit Georgia Tech from having a College of Education, so there is no academic unit on campus with the mission of training students in pedagogy, or of preparing them for a career in education.  The Tech to Teaching project proposed to build on existing NSF-supported educational initiatives to develop and institutionalize the infrastructure needed to promote teaching careers at both the K-12 and collegiate level.  The outcome has been the creation of a robust Pre-Teaching program that provides information to students about the different pathways into teaching, as well as courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level related to education.  Tech to Teaching also developed various internships and education immersion experiences to help students explore teaching as a career option.  Rather than being a covert pathway within the Institute, the route to teaching careers is now well lit with support from all levels of the Georgia Tech community.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe details of what worked at Georgia Tech, and which students make use of the services, provides evidence about the role that highly technical institutions like Georgia Tech might play in training STEM K-12 teachers and in promoting future faculty who excel at both scholarship and teaching. At the undergraduate level, students participating in Tech to Teaching were disproportionately from the College of Sciences and Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and female students were highly over-represented.  College of Engineering students make up 65% of the undergraduate population, but only approximately 35% of the Tech to Teaching participants. In contrast, at the graduate level, College of Engineering students participated in numbers roughly proportional to their enrollment percentage. Few College of Computing students participated in the program at either the graduate or undergraduate level. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nDuring the life of the grant, from 2009 - 2014, a total of 1,936 students (1,256 graduate students, 675 undergraduate students) participated in Tech to Teaching activities. These experiences were in three realms&mdash;advising, coursework, and mentored and immersion experiences. \n\n Advising:  At an institution like Georgia Tech, where few students enter with a career in education in mind, providing effective career advice is crucial.  Between 2009 and 2014, advisors held a total of 536 pre-teaching advising appointments with undergraduate students and 280 advising sessions with graduate students.  Career advice is now provided at the Pre-Teaching website (preteaching.gatech.edu), and at the CETL website (cetl.gatech.edu/techtoteach).\n\n Coursework:  When Tech to Teaching began there were no courses offered at Georgia Tech for undergraduate students who were interested in learning more about content related to teaching, and/or that would give them foundational knowledge that could prepare them for pedagogical coursework at institutions offering certification in K-12 teaching.  Tech to Teaching aimed to fill that gap by providing coursework in a limited set of areas.  Over the course of the grant, 284 individual undergraduate students enrolled in courses that covered the basics of teaching and learning, educational psychology, the sociology of education, and STEM educational policy.   \n\n Tech to Teaching also pulled together resources from across campus to create a sequence of courses, and a graduate minor in Higher Education, for graduate students interested in learning pedagogy, academic communication and course design.  Between 2009-2014, 581 graduate students enrolled in these courses.  An additional 732 graduate students participated in shorter CETL workshops.\n\n ..."
