 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program at NSF Division of Chemistry will support the international collaborative research project of Prof. Peter Tonge of State University of New York at Stony Brook and Prof. Stephen Meech of the University of East Anglia.  Profs. Tonge and Meech and their students will focus on AppA, a photoreceptor from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides which uses a Blue Light Using Flavin adenine dinucleotide (BLUF) domain to respond to light. Their hypothesis is that the primary event in the photoactivation of AppA is an alteration in the electronic structure of the flavin isoalloxazine ring in the excited state, which causes a rearrangement in hydrogen bonding interactions between protein and chromophore on the picosecond time scale. Ultrafast time resolved fluorescence (UTRF) will be used to reveal excited state dynamics, while femtosecond to millisecond time resolved vibrational spectroscopy (TRIR) will be used to observe the influence of photoexcitation on the host matrix structure. Data interpretation will utilize isotopic substitution and polarization measurements, coupled with the incorporation of unnatural amino acids. The resulting detailed structure- dynamics relationship will yield the first complete insight into the microscopic mechanism of photoreceptor operation. The study could lead to the development of a new generation of protein-based biosensors. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to US and UK students who will gain invaluable international research experience through extended research stays in the collaborators' laboratories. \r\n\r\nThis international collaborative research project is supported jointly by NSF and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the United Kingdom. The study is also supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) at NSF. \r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLight is essential for most life on earth including the ecosystem inhabited by humans.  While the conversion of light into food for plants and animals is fundamental to our survival, light also regulates many biological process, including how organisms move, grow and develop.  Organisms sense and respond to light through the action of photoreceptors &ndash; proteins that take the energy contained in a photon of light and turn it into signals that mammals, plants and bacteria can understand.  Determining in detail how photoreceptors work will give us insight into the fundamental processes that govern the complex interaction of light with life, and ultimately will inform the development of novel light-activated devices that will be of use to humankind.\n\nMammals, plants and bacteria all contain photoreceptors.  In humans the photoreceptors in your eye allow for visualization of the world, while photoreceptors in plants and bacteria participate in processes such as photosynthesis in which food is obtained from light.  Among the numerous photoreceptors used by bacteria are those that use a chromophore called FAD that is derived from vitamin B2.  A chromophore is a molecule that absorbs light, and in the case of FAD the chromophore is yellow.  Our interest is in a particular photoreceptor called AppA from a bacterium called Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  When \u00e6turned on\u00c6 by light, AppA alters which genes are turned on in the bacteria.  In this way, light regulates how the information in the DNA of the bacteria is used.  Our goal is to understand in great detail exactly how the interaction of light with the FAD chromophore in AppA leads to changes in which genes are on and which genes are off.  If we can determine how this process occurs, then we will be one step further towards developing a method to regulate our genetic information using light. \n\nHowever there is a major challenge: the initial interaction of light with the FAD chromophore occurs really fast &ndash; faster than 10-13 s, while the subsequent changes in the AppA protein occur a million times more slowly.  The goal of our project is therefore to understand how the photoreceptor converts the instantaneous light signal into a signal that occurs on a time scale that the organism can understand.  To meet this goal we have been using a method (TRIR) that reports on changes in the vibrations of the chromophore and protein following the initial excitation by light.  All molecules vibrate, like balls on a spring, and these vibrations contain information about the structure and environment of the molecule.  Using TRIR we have been able to look directly at changes in the structure of the chromophore immediately after light has been absorbed (within 10-12 s), and to then determine how the AppA protein subsequently responds to these changes.  As with many scientific discoveries, much of our time has been spent doing experiments to help interpret our data.  We know that the TRIR data contain important information about the mechanism of AppA, but we have to work really hard to understand the data.  This involves changing the protein and chromophore in subtle ways and then looking at the effect on the TRIR data.  Using this approach we now have a much better idea of how the FAD chromophore and the AppA protein communicate with each other. \n\nThis project has involved a collaboration with two scientific groups in the UK.  In the course of our experiments some of the students from the US have visited laboratories in the UK to perform experiments.  This has significantly broadened the training of student participants in the project.  In particular, the students have benefited in two key areas of critical importance.  Scientific research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, and the visits to laboratories in the UK have provided unique cross-disciplinary educational opportunities in which the students have been exposed to new techniques and learnt how to apply them to their own research..."
