 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Latha Venkataraman of Columbia University will seek to reveal and understand properties of single molecules attached to metal electrodes while educating students about the interplay of physics, chemistry and engineering at the nanoscale. The size of components in the integrated circuit industry is fast approaching the nanometer scale, requiring a detailed understanding of the fundamental properties at the single molecule level. Specifically, this work proposes to develop and build a high-resolution single-axis conducting atomic force microscope to simultaneously measure the rate at which electrons are transferred across a single molecule junction, as well as the forces required to break the junction apart. Electronic properties, such as junction resistance and current-voltage characteristics, are related to intrinsic junction properties including molecular length, conformation and the alignment of the molecular orbitals with the metal Fermi level. Measurements of forces reveal bond strengths, binding energies and junction stability, properties which cannot be probed directly by electrical measurements. The research proposed here will explore both of these related but different aspects of single-molecule circuits. \r\n\r\nAn integral part of the proposed activity is to introduce nanoscience to high school, undergraduate and graduate students, aiming to recruit them to pursue careers in science.  In addition, a new Nanotechnology course for senior undergraduate and graduate students will be developed which will integrate a wide range of topics, from the synthesis of nanoscale materials to their charge transport properties and incorporation into electronic devices.\r\n",
