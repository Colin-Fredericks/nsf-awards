 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Making the San Andreas Fault at the Mendocino Triple Junction: Part II\r\n\r\nA dense array of broadband seismographs have been deployed to investigate the structure of the Mendocino Triple Junction, the northernmost terminus of California's famed San Andreas fault system. The study area extends from the California-Oregon coast to 120o W longitude, and from 37 degrees to 43 degrees North latitude. The Mendocino Triple Junction, the site where the North America, Pacific and Gorda plates meet, migrates northward with time relative to a fixed North American reference frame.  A set of interacting processes associated with the migrating Mendocino Triple Junction, extending from the surface to asthenospheric levels (> 100 km depth), act to modify North America lithosphere from a subduction complex at the Gorda subduction zone to the San Andreas transform plate boundary. The mantle imparts a dominant control on the processes occurring near the MTJ through its control on plate strength and kinematics and the flux of heat and mass from the asthenosphere to the North American plate. Gorda crust and overlying sediment subduct and become incorporated with accretionary terranes from the Cascadia subduction zone as this mass flows into the emerging transform margin and becomes structured into the San Andreas strike-slip system. Simultaneously, slab gap opening south of the Gorda slab causes asthenospheric ascent and decompression melting, which magmatically underplates North America near the San Andreas fault. The reprocessed and inflated lithosphere thickens to create a small Cape Mendocino orogenic plateau, while erosion fluxes large fractions of the upper crust back to the subduction zone along tectonically controlled north-trending rivers. To the east, Gorda-Juan de Fuca subduction results in the Cascade volcanoes, which contribute to continental crust growth, segregation and recycling.   \r\n\r\nResults of an extensive active source seismic study in 1993-94 provide excellent crustal control in the MTJ region. The broadband seismograph array now deployed will remain in place through April 2009, to provide a dataset that will enable us to image the structure, fabric, and seismic and aseismic deformation of the mantle and lower crust in the MTJ region and the southernmost Cascades.  Using a variety of analysis techniques we will produce a 3-D seismic velocity model of the crust and upper mantle that will be included in event and strong ground motion characterization for northern California and southern Oregon, a site of potentially devastating great earthquakes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ) is where three tectonic plates meet just offshore northernmost California.  To the east is the continental North American plate.  South of the MTJ, the San Andreas Fault system separates the North American Plate from the Pacific Plate, while to the north of the MTJ North America is separated from the Juan de Fuca Plate by the Cascadia Subduction Zone.  This complicated interplay of tectonic plates is where the San Andreas Fault is borne as the MTJ moves to the north extending the length of the fault.  This results in migration of crustal blocks from the subducting oceanic plate onto the base of the continental plate, and complex flow in the mantle as the subducting oceanic plate that extends to ~600 km depth is dragged northward.\n\n \n\nThe NSF-funded Mendocino experiment was a deployment of 80 seismic instruments in northern California adjacent to the MTJ.  The purpose of this deployment was to record seismic energy radiating from earthquakes around the globe.  While humans cannot feel the amplitude of the seismic energy, the sensitive instrumentation can detect it.  This data can then be used to constrain the subsurface structure to a depth of ~600 km allowing us to understand the complex interplay of the tectonic plates and the mantle flow beneath them.\n\n \n\nThe dataset was used in a variety of studies.  Firstly ambient seismic noise, which is generated by fluid motion in the oceans and then transmitted through the earth\u00c6s crust, was used to image the 3D structure of the crust and lithosphere (to a depth of ~100 km).  By visualizing the relatively high and low seismic velocities it was possible to locate the position of the subducting slab and the formation and accumulation of melt above the subducting slab.  This melt can then be tracked up towards the surface beneath the Cascadia volcanoes.  The volcanic productivity is greater at the southern end of the Cascadia Arc and larger volumes of low velocity material, presumed to be melt, were observed.  The structure of the subducting slab was also observed to be segmented.  This segmentation is in turn aligned with differences in other processes along Cascadia including variations in earthquake activity and also very low amplitude seismic tremor.  The second key study was of the anisotropic seismic velocity structure.  This provides information about the flow of the mantle between ~100 and ~400 km depth.  The orientations of the seismic fast directions indicate a circular flow pattern around the southern edge of the Juan de Fuca slab.  This is consistent with the idea that mantle material sweeps about the slab as it moves to the north.\n\n \n\nThis project has provided education and training for 2 postdocs, 2 graduate students and 5 undergraduates.  It has also benefited the intellectual development of other students and researchers at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory as they have participated in seminars and research group meetings during which this experiment and the results were discussed.  The project has also featured in the annual CalDay exhibits at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory where several hundred visitors come to experience some of the research excitement at Berkeley.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Allen"
