This re-envisioning of the AP CS course is happening in the context of cutting edge changes occurring in computer science undergraduate programs. Building on an existing NSF-funded project ? From Research to Practice: Redesigning AP Science Courses to Advance Science Literacy and Support Learning with Understanding ? the new course design will use best practices in pedagogy and it will aim to engage and excite all students, including those at low income and minority serving schools. This award will bring together experts who will function in an advisory capacity, providing direction to the larger project.",
