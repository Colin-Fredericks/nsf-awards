All countries are interested in being or becoming globally competitive and more and more countries are signing on to participate in the international assessments of mathematics and science such as TIMSS and PISA.  It is vital that the US participates in discussions related to all aspects of research and development in science education for all students.  The US participants will share a new science education framework developed by the Math and Science Partnership (MSP) project, Promoting Rigorous Outcomes in Mathematics and Science (PROM/SE). \r\nThis request is for funds for the PI and 5-6 other US representatives, from K-12 and higher education, to attend the next conference to be held in Paris 2009.  The request is for $14,000 in travel funds. \r\n\r\n",
