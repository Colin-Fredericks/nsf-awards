 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic studies of the New World primates are necessary for reconstructing the evolution of their genomes, phenotypes, and behavior. These primates are also the closest living relatives of the catarrhines, the group that includes Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Thus, New World primate studies represent a necessary comparative perspective for understanding human biologybiology. Despite their important place among primates, the phylogenetic branching order among New World primates has remained controversial despite many molecular and morphological studies, and key questions remain regarding the interrelationships among the individual genera and species. In this study research, platyrrhine phylogeny will be inferred using innovative and efficient genomic and computational techniques. Random genomic libraries, generated from a representative species of each family, will provide up 100 markers of approximately 650 base pairs in length. These unlinked markers, which are estimated to encompass up to 65 kilobases of non-coding, non-genic, non-repetitive nuclear DNA, will be sequenced in at least one representative species of every platyrrhine genus. This large dataset will be combined with and compared to data from traditional molecular markers such as protein coding loci from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Data will be analyzed with a likelihood-based method, taking into account phylogenetic incongruence among markers caused by ancestral polymorphism and rapid divergence in the early stage of diversification of platyrrhine families.\r\n\r\nWithout an accurate New World monkey phylogeny in place, evolutionary reconstructions of anthropoid genomes, phenotypes, and behaviors will be hampered. Key aspects of platyrrhine phylogeny have been difficult to resolve, and studies of DNA substitution rate variation within platyrrhines have been relatively rare compared to catarrhines. Important phenotypic and behavioral features in primates that can be better reconstructed with the proposed phylogeny include twinning, color vision, and encephalization due to an expanded neocortex. This study introduces new approaches to determine the branching order and timing of divergence among all platyrrhine genera. A high-throughput method will be used to generate a large amount of non-coding phylogenetic sequence data for analysis. Moreover, a likelihood-based method that incorporates demographic variables will be used to infer early diversification of New World monkeys. These methods may be further applicable to other phylogenetic groups. Additionally, by uniting molecular and fossil data to estimate times of divergence, variations in the rate of mutation among different platyrrhine groups will be highlighted. \r\n\r\nPrimates are of great public interest, and many of the New World monkeys to be studied are commonly housed at U.S. zoos where they provide educational experiences for the public. Their charismatic behavior and morphology makes them important conservation foci. New World monkeys also are commonly used model organisms for scientific research, and the common marmoset has been targeted for complete genome sequencing. Resolution of the phylogenetic history of these animals will enhance awareness and understanding of these species in the public, conservation, and scientific communities. This project is collaborative, combining the two investigator's complementary strengths in computational genomics and primate evolution and phylogenetics. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained and encouraged to seek after collaborative opportunities offered by the two investigator's laboratories. A website devoted to New World monkey biology and diversity will be created. Elucidating the phylogenetic history of these genera will provide a foundation on which future studies can be based. Finally, sequences from all the markers generated by this study will become available in public databases. The sequences obtained during this project will be an important resource for the primate genomics community. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPrimates, in particular New World monkeys, love in diverse habitats and display a mesmerizing array of adaptive traits.  The main research goals of this project were to use high-throughput, genomic approaches to understand genetic bases of primate diversity, and to resolve the molecular phylogenetic relations between New World monkeys.  Because the early radiation of New World monkeys are thought to have occurred very rapidly, resolving the phylogenetic relationship among the New World monkey species has been notoriously difficult.  We sought to address this problem by employing modern genomic tools combining computational and experimental methods.\n\nOne of the main outcomes of this research is the development of numerous non-coding, non-repetitive markers from primate genomes.  We have used two methods for this purpose.  First, some markers were obtained by sequencing a large number of clones from a shotgun library, generated using a novel method described in the proposed research.  Second, some other markers were developed from computationally aligned primate genomes (human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey).  Using these markers, we resolved phylogenetic relationships between diverse New World monkey genera, discovered novel patterns of evolutionary rate variation, and provided insights into the genomic structures of several New World monkey species.  These data have been deposited to open data sources (GenBank), allowing researchers and public to access and utilize them.  Another outcome of this research is interpreting primate genomic data in relation to speciation and phylogeny.  In one study, we analyzed large numbers of aligned sites between Old World monkeys and humans, and proposed that generation times and body sizes determine variation of evolutionary rates among these species.  In another paper, we have proposed that differences in life history traits, such as mating system and sperm competition, influence our interpretation of speciation and phylogenetic processes.  Furthermore, as a part of this sponsored research, we have investigated the relationship between primate genome evolution and gene functions in detail.  First, we investigated how evolutionary variables affect gene expression in the human genome.  Second, we have analyzed differences and similarities between human and chimpanzee epigenomes, to elucidate genetic and epigenetic basis of human evolution.\n\n            The topics of the proposed research have been integrated with several classes offered at the PI\u00c6s institution, including an undergraduate level course \u00e6Evolution\u00c6 and a graduate level course \u00e6Molecular Evolution\u00c6.  The PI has created several educational modules directly incorporating the research activities of this project.  During the grant period the PI has mentored two postdoctoral researchers, five graduate students, and two undergraduate students in topics related to this project.  These students were trained in molecular anthropology, evolution, and genomics.  In particular two female students from Korea were mentored during this research period, as a part of an international collaboration. \n\nThe PI has also started a collaboration with the Zoo Atlanta to further our understanding of genomic and epigenomic divergence among primate species.  During the sponsored research project, the PI has given several presentations to the public discussing topics related to the research project.  For example, she presented a career seminar for the Women in Science and Health Careers Network (W.I.S.H.) for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields for 8-12 grade female high school students in Atlanta.  In conclusion, the support from the NSF has allowed the PI to generate numerous markers and provide in-depth analyses of primate genomic data, and to perform educational activities for diverse audience. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Soojin Yi"
