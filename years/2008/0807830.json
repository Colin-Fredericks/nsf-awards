Effects that alter the appearance of the ices are of special interest because they are significant for remote sensing of icy satellites, planetary rings and trans-Neptunian objects.  Effects being explored include: a) the stability of molecules trapped in ice subject to ultraviolet solar radiation and magnetospheric ion impact; b) the relative efficiency of photons, electrons, light and heavy ions in affecting crystalline ice; and c) the electrostatic charging of surface ice by energetic particle impact.  The research will use a unique combination of experimental techniques: exposure to ion, electron and laser beams and vacuum ultraviolet light, optical spectroscopy and interferometry, and microgravimetry and mass spectrometry at cryogenic temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include inspiring students and educating them in the characteristics needed for quality research, professional development of early career scientists, and increased participation of under-represented groups.  The work also brings techniques from surface science into laboratory astronomy.",
