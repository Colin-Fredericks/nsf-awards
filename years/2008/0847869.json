 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most critical problems in Internet security is \r\nthe Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which aims to make a \r\nservice unavailable to legitimate clients. In this project, \r\nwe consider a sophisticated attack, called service-level DoS \r\nattack, which is very difficult to identify as malicious \r\nrequests can be made arbitrarily similar to legitimate ones \r\nand can bypass the network-based defense systems. We propose \r\na novel framework to detect the attackers based on the group \r\ntesting (GT) technique which can overcome the limitations of \r\ncurrent detection approaches. More specifically, this project \r\nseeks to investigate the following challenges: 1) Dynamic \r\nthreshold model is studied to handle the legitimate bursts \r\nand variance in the number of clients on each server; 2) \r\nLegitimates and malicious requests are similar, required \r\nnew testing design without examining each request one by \r\none or tightly specifying legitimate behaviors; 3) In \r\naddition, the study of the proposed model evokes a new \r\ntype of GT, called Size Constraint Group Testing (SCGT) \r\nwhich requires an in depth analysis of matrix construction \r\ncomplexity. This mathematically rigorous framework helps \r\nto minimize the false positive and false negative of detection, \r\nwhich is the main problem currently for any existing defense \r\nmechanisms.",
