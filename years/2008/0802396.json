 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing and implementing a Nanotechnology Technician Education degree program by adapting existing curricula and developing new curricula. The program is a third degree track in the college's Advanced Manufacturing Technology degree program (the other two tracks are Manufacturing Engineering Technology and Polymer Manufacturing Technology). \r\n\r\nThe new degree option is strongly supported by regional organizations and industry.  The 42 project partners include 29 industry partners who are supporting curriculum development and/or are providing internship and employment opportunities for students. In addition to developing new curricula for this program, the college is adapting elements of a nanotechnology undergraduate program developed by project partner University of Virginia, which is also providing training equipment and curriculum development support. The primary audience for the new program is graduating high school seniors, as well as local adult workers who are seeking career re-training due to loss of a great number of the region's traditional jobs in textiles manufacturing and tobacco. \r\n\r\nThe Nanotechnology Education degree program is being managed by Danville Community College's Workforce Services and housed in its Regional Center for Advanced Technology and Training, a new 24,000-square-foot high-tech facility designed to support high-level scientific training programs such as nanotechnology education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTechnician-level employees that are well-trained in the\ntopics of nano science and the operation of high-level lab equipment work with researchers\nto discover and develop improved materials, medical procedures,\nmedical cures, new energy sources, and a myriad of other potential\ntechnological discoveries through the application of nano technology (technology\nat less than 100 billionth meter scale).  Discoveries using the\ntechniques and equipment of nanotechnology are likely to be\nrevolutionary.  Nanotechnology has the potential to impact all traditional-scale\ntechnology. \n\nDanville Community College (Virginia) (DCC) received funding\nto develop and implement a technician-level training program in nanotechnology\nfrom NSF\u00c6s Advanced Technology Education (ATE) program.  As a result, an AAS degree in Nanotechnology\nEducation was developed and offered in Fall semester, 2011.  DCC is the only community college in the\nstate of Virginia that offers a degree in nanotechnology. Over forty companies signed\nthe proposal to NSF, indicating a need for technician-level training in nano\nand micro technologies in the Virginia / North Carolina region.  Presently, six students are enrolled, and the\nfirst graduates are expected in Fall, 2014. \nThese students are being trained to assist PhD researchers by performing\nroutine tests, calibrations and troubleshooting of equipment used in the\ncharacterization and measurement of nano phenomena.  Students should be intellectually curious\nabout science and natural occurrences, mechanically and technically proficient\nto work with computer-based instruments and enjoy working cooperatively in a fast-paced\nlaboratory environment.\n\nCentral to this approach of training nano technicians, is\nthe emphasis of hands-on equipment skills. \nThrough this award, DCC planned and purchased equipment for a basic\nnanotechnology laboratory, for student use in the curriculum. Equipment includes\ntwo atomic force microscopes, a RAMAN spectroscope, a four-point probe, Hepa-filter\nfume hoods and associated tables and equipment. Additional equipment was\ndonated by local industry and the Tobacco Revitalization Commission, for a\ntotal value over $200k.\n\nFor training in this new technology to be sustainable, there\nneeds to be a pipeline of high school students with interest and motivation to\npursue such a career.  Through NSF\nfunding, a number of summer workshops for k-12 teachers were developed and offered\nto over 30 teachers in summer of 2012.  Teachers\ndeveloped lesson plans and received kits and materials to take back to their\nclassrooms to make it easy for them to incorporate nanotechnology topics in\ntheir science classes.  DCC offers secondary\neducation materials free to k-12 technology teachers through this link:   http://www.dcc.vccs.edu/workforce/Programs/NanoTech/default.html   (Click on the \"Secondary Education Materials\"\nbutton on the right).\n\nThe AAS degree is designed to be a terminal degree, meaning\nthat graduates should be able to secure jobs with just this degree.  In addition, DCC is working to partner for\nopportunities for further study at four-year degree institutions in the region.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerry H Franklin"
