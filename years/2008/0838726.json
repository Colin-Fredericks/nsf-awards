 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico State University proposes to explore the potential for an intervention that would  increase the numbers of physically disabled persons, specifically those with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who participate in computing-related degree programs and careers. They propose to implement an introductory computer course that is integrated into the context of a rehabilitation (rehab) hospital. By choosing this venue, disabled persons will be introduced to computing rather than leaving the introduction to chance. Further, by focusing on the spinal cord injured population, a large percentage of the target group will be of college and/or working age. The program will be coordinated with hospital staff and integrated into patient education received during rehabilitation. The course will cover the basic computer use and the use of assistive technology, web development and programming using the Alice programming language. This award will pilot the course three times and will develop a plan to seek further funding in order to improve and scale the program to reach a wider community, including military rehabilitation facilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of Project ENABLE was to increase the participation in computing of persons with mobility-related disabilities.  We proposed to do this through short computing workshops that introduced participants to computer science and computing-related degree programs and job opportunities, and to computer science through the Alice programming environment.   We affected a total of 17 participants in three cohorts.  We offered the program in Pennsylvania, the home state of our collaborator, because the population is far larger and more dense than that in New Mexico, the home state of the PI.  To measure success, we measured the change in attitude toward computing in general and toward confidence in obtaining a degree in computer science and later pursuing a career in computing.   Our key findings are summarized below:\n\n \n\nRecruitment strategies: Directly accessing the community of persons with disabilities is extremely difficult because there are so few participating in the general community.  Therefore, access to this group is indirect, through agencies that serve persons with disabilities.  The best way to recruit participants is to arrange events through these agencies at which direct contact with potential participants is possible.  Doing this, we were somewhat successful with recruiting program participants.  \nObstacles to participation: Transportation can be a large obstacle for this demographic group.  Distance technology may help to alleviate this.  Also hindering this groups\u00c6 participation in computing is the lack of access to adequate assistive technology.  Most of the participants either had inappropriate assistive technology for interfacing to the computer or they did not own any assistive technology for operating a computer (even if they owned a computer!).  \nMeasured success: The goal of the program is to change perceptions and attitudes about computing and computing-related education and careers to the point that participants would pursue a four-year degree in a computing-related field. Using an instrument we developed and data gathered from 11 participants, we showed a small positive change in attitude toward the possibility of pursuing a computing-related degree and career.  The data also indicated that the workshop helped promote a feeling of independence with respect to working on a computer.  Many of the participants had not previously had access to appropriate assistive technology which resulted in an inability to easily interface with software packages; we matched them with technology and instructed them on use.   Although all of the data indicated that the workshop had a positive affect on attitude, because the sample size is so small, it is difficult to make any real conclusions.\n\n\n \n\nOur key products generated through this work are the following:\n\nA workshop curriculum based on the Alice programming environment.  A full set of slides, exercises, and projects comprise this curriculum.\nThe infrastructure, hardware and software, to conduct computing workshops as a departmental outreach activity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeanine M Cook"
