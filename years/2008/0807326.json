This project will develop formalisms to exploit to the fullest the upcoming observational data and to bring new understanding to the frontiers where large-scale structure, cosmology, and particle physics, all overlap.  The research will produce elegant and powerful statistics to analyze peculiar velocity samples, virtually the only dynamical probe of cosmology, and will use them to study large scale structure, neutrino mass estimation, and the matter content of the Universe.  Velocity fields sample the mass distribution directly and are less susceptible to problems of bias and conventional priors as compared to other probes such as the cosmic microwave background, redshift surveys, or gravitational lensing.  This work will allow peculiar velocity surveys to re-emerge as a useful and unique tool to investigate the large-scale mass distribution on various cosmological scales.  The statistical, analytical and numerical methods developed in this project will be valuable for probing cosmological data sets to gather information about fundamental processes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, these statistical tools will help to extract relevant information in many areas of research whenever the data are noisy and unwieldy.  The PI is deeply involved in the important work of outreach and the introduction of scientific innovation to the public, travelling widely to lecture to diverse groups, from elementary to high school students, to churches, special interest groups and professional societies.  Other serious efforts to be continued are those involving public science advocacy and state public school science standards.",
