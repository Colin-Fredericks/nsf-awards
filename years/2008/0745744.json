 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) has operated Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) since July 1, 1997. This project continues NSF support of that facility, and is motivated by BBSO having reached the final stage in building its 1.6 meter aperture off-axis New Solar Telescope (NST). The NST will become an essential test-bed for the US solar physics community's planned 4-meter Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST).\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI will complete the integration of the NST's visible and near infrared vector magnetograph systems, as well as the commissioning of the telescope to its full scientific capability. The PI's team will exploit NST observations in the visible and near IR for a variety of solar physics research programs. These NST observations will make possible high-cadence and high-resolution studies of solar flare emissions, sub-arc-second resolution studies of the quiet solar atmosphere (focusing on measurements of the transverse magnetic field component, which is weaker than intra-network fields), investigations of the energy sources of coronal heating, comprehensive studies of vector magnetic fields associated with flares, and investigations of plasma flow fields in flare-productive active regions. \r\n\r\nBBSO's high quality data and analytical tools are routinely utilized by the space weather forecasting community. BBSO is a leader in the US community for developing the next generation of solar instrumentation and training the next generation of solar physicists. About 30% of NJIT students in this field are women. BBSO is a key part of NJIT's integrated approach to space physics research and education, with graduate student research and dissertation opportunities supported throughout this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the past decade, we built in Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) the first new facility-class solar telescope in the US in a generation -- the new solar telescope (NST).  The NST is the highest resolution solar telescope ever built and is a pathfinder for new telescopes to come.\n\nHigh resolution observations with the NST benefit from adaptive optics, which stabiizes images by compensating for atmospheric distortion.  This corrected  light feeds a new generation of the instruments designs to measure the sun's magnetic field and other dynamical  effects on the sun.\n\nOne of the oldest problems is solar physics is understanding how the sun's cool surface can heat the extended atmosphere (the corona) to temperatures that are more than 100 times higher.  This is a problem that involves observations, as wellas magneto-hydrodynamical analyses, but has had no satisfactory solution.  With the NST, we have seen for the first time how a signficant part of that energy reaches from the surface to the corona.  The sun's surface is covered with a granular field of upflowing plasma that cools and flows back down in narrow lanes that separate the granules.  We have discovered ejecta pulsing from the lanes creating magnetic loops that are at least ten times cooler and ten times narrower than any seen before.  These loops reach up to the base of the corona.  Contemporaneous satellite data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) show coronal loops that are lit up by the pulses coming from the lanes.  This is the first time that the heating dynamics has been tracked from the surface to the corona.  This still leaves open the question of what causes the pulses in the lanes and how they deposit their energy.  We plan to address the former question with simulations and observations of vector magnetic fields in the lanes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Goode"
