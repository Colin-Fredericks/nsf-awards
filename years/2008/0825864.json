 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a nonintrusive carbon nanotube integrated sensing system for driver detection.  The main requirements of this sensing system are high sensitivity, fast response, low power consumption, low cost, and high reliability in operation. This project will investigate fundamental scientific problems associated with applying nanomaterials based sensors to human physiological sensing in dynamic human-machine interactions. The case study will be carried out to target one important application: the driver-vehicle systems. In particular, driver?s gripping force and level of alcohol content will be measured non-intrusively and in real-time manner. This project will conduct experiments to validate the proposed technologies in both a virtual environment and a realistic driver-vehicle system, which are available in the PI?s Intelligent Human-Machine Systems Laboratory at Northeastern University. \r\nIn parallel with the proposed research, novel developments and knowledge in sensing technologies for human physiology will be added to the area of human factors curriculum training program on campus. The education plan includes a variety of trainees, graduate, undergraduate, high school students, and the general public, including specially the under-represented groups. \r\n",
