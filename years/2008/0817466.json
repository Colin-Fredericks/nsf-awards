 "awd_abstract_narration": "GEOSCIENCE (42) \r\n\r\nGARNET (Geoscience Affective Research Network) is examining the impact of the affective domain on student learning in introductory physical geology. GARNET institutions represent a cross-section of the higher education spectrum and include the University of Akron, University of Colorado-Boulder, California State University-Chico, North Hennepin Community College, Macalester College, and the University of North Dakota. GARNET's goals are: 1) To use two instruments, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Science Value Inventory (SVI), to investigate how aspects of the affective domain, in particular student motivation and values, vary for students in introductory physical geology; and 2) Identify if and how those aspects vary with instructor and specific aspects of the learning environments. The key hypotheses are that: 1) The affective domain is a major control on student learning; and, 2) How we teach can significantly change students' affective behavior. The outcome of this research will be pedagogical resources and strategies that guide the development of more effective introductory geoscience classes. The GARNET project results on the influence of the affective domain on geoscience learning and the pedagogical best practices identified begin to fill a largely underappreciated, little studied, yet highly significant gap in our understanding of student learning of science. The project focuses on a way to explore student learning in the geosciences that to date, has received almost no consistent attention at the college level, and no broad analysis within a single discipline. GARNET builds on an existing knowledge base in educational psychology that has been applied in a limited way to some college science classes but there is a paucity of information on the affective domain in introductory geoscience courses that hinders the potential of instructors to engage students and enhance science learning processes. The GARNET assessment plan measures outcomes that provide a foundation for subsequent research and the collaborative nature of this project has the potential to result in the creation of small teams of investigators exploring specific aspects of the affective domain. Results of the evaluation program will reveal which pedagogical strategies are most effective in creating learning environments characterized by more motivated students, with good attitudes about learning geoscience, and greater confidence in their ability to learn class material.",
