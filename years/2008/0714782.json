 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological theory is generally built on the assumption that different species occupy different niches in the environment.  This means that for species to live together they must do different things, and what is beneficial to one species is detrimental to another.  However, a tremendous amount of empirical evidence suggests that many closely related species are also nearly identical to one another.  This means that features of the ecological world may not be maintaining species in a system at all.  More importantly, some species may be slowly being driven extinct at imperceptible rates by interactions with other species in the system.  This alternative is known as 'ecological drift', a process whereby species' relative abundances change according to a random walk that is akin to random genetic drift.  This proposal describes research to evaluate these alternatives in damselfly assemblages found in lakes with fish across eastern North America.  \r\n\r\nThis work combines regional investigations of 80 lakes to search for broad-scale patterns with critical field experiments that test the fundamental predictions that can discriminate niche from neutral processes.  Our ability to construct sound biodiversity management and preservation strategies will critically depend on our understanding of the mechanisms promoting high diversity.  The broader impacts of the proposed activity are to engage undergraduates in all components of the scientific research enterprise, and to foster science curriculum for our local K-5 elementary schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost ecologists think of speciation as a process that produces new species that have diverse ecological properties that permit species to coexist with one another.  However, many species come into existence by modes of speciation that generate reproductive isolation among the newly created species but generate little or no ecological differentiation among them.  These ecologically equivalent species should display quite different dynamics in biological communities than ecologically differentiated species.  One of the great debates in recent years among ecologists has been the prevalence of these ecologically equivalent species in real systems.  The purpose of the research supported by this grant was to provide the first field experimental test for the existence of ecologically equivalent species using Enallagma damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae). The primary focus of the intellectual merit of this work was in testing these ideas of ecological equivalence in field experiments.\n\nThe main body of this work were two field experiments done in a New Hampshire lake to test whether the larvae of two Enallagma species were ecologically equivalent to one another.  The two species, Enallagma ebrium and E. vesperum, were chosen because they (1) co-occur in ponds and lakes across eastern North America, and (2) their last common ancestor was 15 million years ago.  Thus, these species have been separated from one another long enough to evolve significant ecological differences if they were going to arise.  The results of the first experiment proved conclusively that these species, which have been separated for millions of years, are still ecologically equivalent under manipulations of total and relative abundances in the presence of fish predation and food limitation, their natural forms of population regulation.  The populations of these two species responded to manipulations of the total number of Enallagma in a cage, but did not respond to manipulations of their own abundances &ndash; the hallmark response of ecological equivalence. \n\nThe second field experiment tested for ecological differences at higher taxonomic levels within the damselfly assemblage of this lake.  In this experiment, we again manipulated total abundance and relative abundances, but of different genera of damselflies: Enallagma, Ischnura and Lestes.  In contrast to the responses when only two species in the same genus were manipulated, species responded strongly to manipulations of their own abundance in this experiment, while showing little or no change when manipulations of the other genera were done.  Taken together, these field experimental results demonstrate that ecologically equivalent species may be prevalent in nature, but their existence does not mean that all species are equivalent.  Food webs show a definite ecological structure with ecologically equivalent species embedded in this structure.\n\nThis grant also supported a new theoretical direction to my work on coexistence, namely the introduction of intraspecific density dependence to higher trophic levels in models of community structure.  In the past, most models of interacting species have assumed that only the basal resources in a system experience some form of intraspecific density dependence.  I introduced this into standard models of interacting consumers and resources, and found that when consumers limit their own abundances many more consumers can coexist with one another.  Moreover, these theoretical results suggested testable predictions that empiricists can use to test for the importance of intraspecific density dependence on community structure. \n\nThe broader impacts of this work came mainly in the form of student training.  This grant supported three graduate students, one postdoctoral associate, and a number of undergraduate and high school students in the course of this project.  This grant also supported a major broad review of the literature on ecological equivalence  and coexistence o..."
