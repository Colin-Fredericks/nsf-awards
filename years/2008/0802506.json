 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThe Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) is conducting a summit meeting on transformative research, engaging leading scientists at predominately liberal arts institutions. The overall structure includes: 1) a two-day summit for 24 members of the STEM faculty to address questions and consider opportunities for the role of undergraduate institutions in transformative research; 2) the development of a monograph on how undergraduate institutions can support potentially transformative research; and 3) a web conference for predominately undergraduate institutions on their role in transformative research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Undergraduate research is a particularly effective way to develop the problem-solving skills and work habits needed by science professionals. Undergraduate research improves retention in higher education, helps to connect students' classroom experiences to the world of work, and motivates students to complete their STEM studies at the baccalaureate level and continue on at the graduate level. Undergraduate research supports the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, oral and written communication, and self-confidence.  Predominately undergraduate institutions have had a significant role in the preparation of science professionals and it is important to understand the ways in which these institutions can support recent efforts to encourage transformative research. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Over 500 institutions belong to the Council on Undergraduate Research.  All are engaged in supporting undergraduate research.  The results of this project will be communicated to CUR institutional members through the CUR Quarterly and the CUR E-News.",
