 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: \r\nThis award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center of Monterey Peninsula Community College (MPCC). Although this program represents a new site for REU, the PI had funding for an internship program (NSF/OCE 0510158).  The requested program will provide twelve internships per year for undergraduates who are interested in careers as marine technicians. The interns will work on U.S. academic research vessels represented by the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and United States Coast Guard vessels. The interns will spend from one to eight weeks (with an average of 4 weeks per internship) working on these vessels. \r\n\r\nThe MATE Center's marine technical internship program helps to prepare undergraduate\r\nstudents for ocean-related occupations. The program targets community college students\r\nenrolled in marine science and technology programs and university students interested in\r\nmarine technical careers. The program makes a substantial effort to recruit students who are\r\ntraditionally unrepresented in science and technical disciplines. MATE interns will work with marine technicians and scientists onboard research vessels, which provides them with the opportunity to develop their technical, scientific, seamanship, and interpersonal skills. To date, more than two-thirds of the student interns have gone on to work in a marine related science or technical field or to continue their education in a marine-related discipline. \r\n\r\nThe site will be supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program. \r\n",
