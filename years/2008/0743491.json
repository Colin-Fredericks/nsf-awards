 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an integrated team effort to comprehensively survey, review, and summarize the biodiversity of terrestrial vertebrates and their parasites in the Philippines. The Philippines has been designated a \"megadiverse country\" and a \"global conservation hotspot\" (distinctions shared only with Madagascar), yet its biodiversity remains largely unknown, underappreciated, and undescribed.  This project will survey vertebrate and parasite diversity at more than 50 sites throughout the country- across elevational, climatological, habitat, and seasonal gradients. The results will be an unprecedented collection of finest-quality museum specimens with complete, digitized and web-served accompanying data for an estimated 2500-3000 species.\r\n\r\nNew biodiversity information products will include digital collection data, faunal summaries, keys and field guides, and descriptions of new host and parasite taxa for use by biodiversity specialists. Second-order results will include conceptual studies, and investigation of emerging infectious diseases presenting immediate threats to amphibian (chytrid fungus), and bird (avian influenza) biodiversity.  By targeting IUCN-categorized \"Data Deficient\" species and \"Key Biodiversity Areas,\" the project will inform policy makers and the conservation community on a scale never before realized.  This research will provide significant educational opportunities for many undergraduate and graduate students, including numerous Filipino-Americans and other underrepresented groups in science.",
