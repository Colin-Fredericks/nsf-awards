 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project completes the design, construction, and testing of the largest readily portable Supersaturated Dissolved Oxygen (SDOXTM) injection system developed in smaller scale in Phase I.  During the first year of the project, the SDOX will be used to study the effect of dissolved oxygen addition on water quality and fish health in the tailrace of a hydroelectric dam.  In the second year of this project, the SDOX will be used in the prevention of spills and remediation of waterbodies impacted by organics and phosphorous.  The effects of the SDOX on removing DO as the limiting component in aquatic ecosystems will be studied during all four seasons of the year. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are the ability use of a portable SDOX 400 on aquatic ecosystem restoration that has previously been impractical or impossible.  This technology benefits an improved environment for aquatic species, minimized environmental impact from hydroelectric dams, and more economic and efficient wastewater treatment.  The technology could positively impact drinking water, recreation, irrigation and other aqueous ecological services important to the public and the environment. \r\n",
