 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nEarly efforts in wireless and mobile network research focused on \r\nMobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), while some recent research has focused on a paradigm named Disruption-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In DTNs, in contrast to\r\nMANETs, links on an end-to-end path may not exist contemporaneously and intermediate nodes may need to store data waiting for opportunities to transfer data towards its destination. \r\n\r\nThe question of whether the network is a MANET or a DTN is critical to answer as it will profoundly influence its operation.  Such a question is hard to formulate and even harder to answer as many networks will not fit neatly within a simple classification scheme. \r\n\r\nThe main premise of our work is that it is best to consider the space of Wireless and Mobile Networks (WAMs) as a continuum.  A network is characterized by its position in this continuum which is a function of its features and which may change over time.  Certain network classes can be defined over this WAM continuum and such network classification can be used to guide WAM design and operation.  Our work will include development of: fundamentals for WAM continuum specification and classification, network classification approaches, and techniques for WAM operation that exploit network classification knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe are also committed to activities that will promote broader impact  of our work including: development of modules based on our research for graduate and undergraduate classes and continued emphasis on inclusion of under-represented groups within our research efforts.\r\n",
