 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks of macromolecular interactions are fundamental to all biological processes.  Until recently, the progress of functional networks studies in Arabidopsis has been propelled primarily by genetic-based approaches. On the other hand, the enormous potential of high-throughput studies of defined macromolecular entities has not been fully realized, largely because reliable affinity tag-enabled fractionation tools remain unavailable to most Arabidopsis researchers. To facilitate these studies, this project will develop and deliver a suite of high throughput cloning-adapted vectors incorporating quantitatively characterized tandem affinity tags, for rapid proteomic and RNomic analyses of Arabidopsis macromolecular complexes. In addition, the project will generate a set of robust purification protocols tailored to the specific affinity tags. These tangible deliverables will be disseminated to the Arabidopsis research community via the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (for binary vectors and plant lines), professional publications, TAIR as well as the project website (the purification protocols). This contribution will enable systems-level studies in a variety of areas of plant biology by many groups presently prevented from doing so by prohibitive cost of conducting the optimization studies in-house.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts. In addition to the tangible deliverables for the Arabidopsis research community in the form of vectors, plant lines and experimental protocols, this project will also make significant contributions to long-standing goals of NSF of integrating research, training and education. First, it will provide an outstanding interdisciplinary training for graduate students and a postdoctoral associate that involves a wide range of approaches, different kinds of expertise, and engages collaborators at two different sites. Second, every semester two undergraduates will be trained and incorporated into the project team at UMKC - an urban institution with >20% students coming from underrepresented minority groups, i.e. considerably higher than national average. Third, the project will establish, in collaboration with the Institute for Urban Education (IUE) at UMKC, a rigorous and innovative \"wet bench/e-bench\" practical course that is custom-tailored to the needs and the mission of IUE to train science teachers specifically with the explicit goal of reducing the achievement gap for urban K-12 students.",
