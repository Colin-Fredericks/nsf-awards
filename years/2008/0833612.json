 "awd_abstract_narration": "The iDREAMS (Integrative Design-based Reform-oriented Educational Approach for Motivating Students) project engages middle school students in computer science curriculum through game design with the ultimate goal of helping them understand and build interest in pursuing IT careers.   The project builds on earlier work with AgentSheets and successes with students at various ages.  The teachers and students are drawn from four Colorado diverse communities: Boulder Valley School District (technology hub), Aurora Public Schools (inner city), South Central Board of Cooperative Educational Services (rural), and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe  (remote/tribal).  The project delivers one week of classroom instruction to 1120 students as part of a required course within the curriculum, a 4-week follow up elective module, and a 1-week transition module to high school computer education.  Training for 28 teachers and 28 community and tribal college students include annual intensive one and two week-long summer workshops, and ongoing remote support throughout the school year.\r\n\r\nThe project results in an IT curriculum that is tested in middle schools, compliant with the National Educational Technology Standards, and scalable.",
