 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrated Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) Program on Scalable Computing and Leading Edge Innovative Technologies (SCALE-IT) for Biology will educate future biologists in a new way of approaching biology?a seamless combination of computing expertise and research using emerging tools that can attack the most challenging problems in biology spanning sub-cellular to organismal scales. These activities will be coordinated by a team of biologists and computational scientists at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The goal is to endow future scientists with the expertise to work at the interface of computational and biological sciences, giving them the foundation to grasp important biological problems, understand the scope of the data needed to address them, shrewdly design comprehensive solutions, and implement them in a reasonable and efficient fashion.  SCALE-IT trainees will conduct research in an environment that includes state-of-the-art instrumentation, high performance computing and worldwide distributed computing via the Tera-grid.  New curricula will provide trainees with the background to work across computational and biological scales, including in-depth problem-based learning with hands-on experiences.  Opportunities will be available for students to intern with major industries, institutes and other academic programs.  Other broader impacts of the program include summer research experiences and curriculum development workshops for faculty and students from partner institutions.  Collaborations with Delaware State University and Tennessee State University will provide pathways for underrepresented minorities to participate in this doctoral program.  Training in effective communication of science will be fostered by establishing a Science Communication Center with colleagues in journalism.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

The academic environment of the University of Tennessee and the \"big science\" strategies at Oak Ridge National Lab have been ideal for this program, combining to offer a special training environment for students, that provides quality research opportunities and examples of varied approaches to the scientific pursuit. Our program design underscores professional development of young scientists through multiple threads, including knowledge of subject areas, accomplishments in research, ability to work in teams, and effectiveness as science communicators. Featured successes include:\n\nWe have designed a customized curriculum that offers an opportunity for students to learn a breadth of biology and computing approaches to address problems within this broad spectrum.   Students interested in computational biology now earn an interdisciplinary graduate minor in computational science in addition to their doctoral degree.  \nSCALE-IT has demonstrated that interdisciplinary training requires more than simple exposure to multiple disciplines and is best achieved through collaborative projects and team-oriented problem solving.  Beginning in the first year, we have convened teams of IGERT students with varied skills to solve research problems using a multi-pronged approach.  This novel training element has been the crux of the program and has led to several highly successful and sustained research efforts. \n&middot;We have proven success when students are engaged as leaders early in their training, with opportunities for organizing research teams, writing grant proposals, giving public presentations, peer mentoring, and outreach throughout the program. A key program element that has fostered this leadership potential is our \"Innovation in Research and Education Grants\" program, through whish senior graduate students develop projects for specific research or education goals.   \nWe also know that broadening the participation of individuals currently underrepresented in scientific research is not only necessary to sustain the scientific enterprise, but brings a diversity of perspectives that will enrich interdisciplinary science. SCALE-IT students have participated in several outreach projects, including serving as instructors in \"Kids U\", for which they have designed hands-on curriculum for a summer high-school program.  One of the students was instrumental founding the \"Systers: Women in Computing\" organization in the College of Engineering and serving as the point person for the nation's first \"Lean In\" circle on a university campus to encourage more women to participate in science and engineering.  Students also have honed communication skills so that they can better inform both professional and lay audiences about their accomplishments and significance of their work.  A workshop on popular science writing has been notably successful, with students publishing articles in several outlets including LiveScience.\n\n\nThrough this program, fifteen men and nine women have been supported on SCALE-IT fellowships and have gained competency as interdisciplinary scientists.  Five have completed their PhD to date, and all have secured highly desirable positions in academia and industry.  Three of the female students have received NSF GRFPs and one male has earned a USDA fellowship.  Another student was awarded a 2013 NSF East Asian and Pacific Science Initiative Research Fellowship Award.  They have published over 18 peer-reviewed articles and have given over 140 conference presentations.  Software packages for a variety of applications have been produced and are openly available.
