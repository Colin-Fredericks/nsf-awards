 "awd_abstract_narration": "In modern computers with multiple CPUs per chip, multiple levels of\r\ncomputer memory are shared among the CPUs. This sharing may cause\r\nvarying response times for computer applications, potentially\r\naffecting their usability. For instance, a video streaming\r\napplication that has unpredictable response times due to interference\r\nfrom other applications may be essentially unusable. Thus, the\r\ncomputer system must attempt to allocate shared memory resources\r\nequitably to increase response consistency. Virtual Private Machines\r\n(VPMs), in which shared computer resources are partitioned to give\r\nthe illusion that a program is running on a single physical CPU\r\nrunning in isolation, are one method to provide response\r\nconsistency. This research involves the development of software\r\nmodeling techniques to predict the memory requirements of applications\r\nrun on modern computers and using those predictions to guide memory\r\nresource allocation to provide consistent, predictable performance.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research consists of the development of\r\nreuse-distance-based memory locality analysis for multi-threaded\r\napplications to predict the resource requirements of those\r\napplications.  This research will apply the new memory locality models\r\nto manage the cache and bandwidth requirements for multi-threaded\r\napplications run on a VPM within a multi-programmed\r\nenvironment. Specifically, this research will examine reuse distance\r\nfor Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) applications written in\r\nUnified Parallel C (UPC). The research will investigate the effects of\r\nthe number of threads used per application on per-thread data size and\r\nthe effect on reuse distance of shared data caused by thread\r\ninteraction. The result will be novel solutions to memory locality\r\nanalysis for multi-threaded applications while allowing the compiler\r\nto predict and specify the resources needed to give multi-threaded\r\napplications targeted performance.",
