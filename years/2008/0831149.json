Privacy and verifiability are key characteristics of voting systems, and their importance cannot be overstated. The research focuses on two types of systems: (1) ones that use randomized partial audits of mixnet-like components and reveal information to computationally bounded adversaries, and (2) ones that do not use cryptography in the construction of ballots.  The research approach builds on an information-theoretic model of voting to measure privacy loss and to study the fundamental limits of privacy and verifiability. The research has practical value for voting system designers and election officials. In addition, this project has a significant outreach component, including the development of course material for high school education in cryptography and voting systems.",
