The study of matrix pseudospectra\r\npowerfully illustrates the general technique:  fundamental\r\nindicators of transient dynamical behavior, pseudospectra have a\r\nrich structure, blending complex and matrix analysis,\r\nsemi-algebraic geometry, and numerical linear algebra, all\r\ningredients in pseudospectral optimization.  Semi-algebraic\r\ngeometry in particular is developing into a fundamental tool not\r\njust in applications such as pseudospectra, but throughout\r\nvariational analysis.  The investigator uses this approach, for\r\nexample, to study novel structural tools such as \"partial\r\nsmoothness\", thereby analyzing convergence rates observed in\r\ncomputational practice.  Fundamental to the investigator's\r\napproach is a complex blend of variational analysis, classical\r\nmathematics, numerical computation, and applied modeling. \r\n\r\n     Often the designer of a complex engineering system varies\r\ncertain features in order to optimize some aspect of system\r\nperformance.  A simple example is a shock-absorber:  by varying\r\nthe grade of lubricant it contains, the manufacturer can modify\r\nhow stiff a suspension system feels.  Finding optimal choices for\r\ndamping vibrations in such a physical, electronic, communications\r\nor information system is \"nonsmooth\": choices are very sensitive\r\nto slight changes in the system, one reason they seem hard to\r\ncompute.  The investigator facilitates this important but\r\nchallenging optimization process by blending mathematical\r\nmodeling and analysis with scientific computation.  He\r\ndisseminates his research energetically through expository and\r\ntechnical publications, high-profile lectures, and online, to\r\ndiverse international scientific and engineering audiences.  As\r\nan integral part of the project, the investigator's PhD students\r\ndevelop crucial skills bridging divisions between sophisticated\r\nmathematical theory and the many practical applications of\r\nnonsmooth optimization. \r\n",
