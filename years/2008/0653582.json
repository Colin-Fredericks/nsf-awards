 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as enhanced LIGO and Advanced LIGO will only reach their fundamental sensitivity limits if significant technical problems can be solved first. Many laser power related problems can be reduced significantly by using adaptive mode matching techniques and employing a new optical configuration known as a stable recycling cavity.  The interaction of these techniques and  configuration changes on other subsystems will be studied in this research effort.  Advanced interferometric detectors also depend on improved sensors and improved modulation techniques.  These technologies will be developed beyond the current state of the art.\r\nDuring the commissioning of the LIGO detectors unexpected problems were discovered and in many cases non-optimal solutions where used to mitigate the problems.  These often improvised solutions are sufficient for LIGO but will not be sufficient in future detectors like Advanced LIGO.  New solutions have been developed for Advanced LIGO but their broad impact on the entire instrument may not be fully understood.  New technologies have to be developed or older technologies have to be improved to ensure the success of future gravitational wave detectors.  These technology developments are also a chance for new students and postdocs to participate in and contribute to this very exciting and still expanding scientific area.",
