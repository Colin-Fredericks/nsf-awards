 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quality Education for Minorities Network?s three-year project to provide technical assistance to HBCU-UP grantees and potential grantees aims to prepare participants to submit competitive proposals to the National Science Foundation, and in particular to the HBCU-UP program.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned are: i) a two day professional development and evaluation workshop and a one year follow-up workshop each year; ii) technical assistance visits to new grantees during the first year of implementation; and iii) a special-focused, two-day workshop each year to strengthen institutional capacity in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe two-day proposal development and evaluation workshop will assemble a team of consultants to meet with teams from eligible institutions and provide presentations on grant preparation, specifically geared toward the HBCU-UP project.  The institution teams will include the chief academic officer, along with a key person from the project.  Consultants will provide feedback to the institutions on their proposal outlines and project activities.\r\n\r\nTechnical assistance to new grantees includes campus visits to observe project activities and make recommendations.  This visit will occur in the first year of the project in an attempt to best advise project and campus leadership on activities and practices that affect their HBCU-UP projects.\r\n\r\nThe special-focused capacity-building workshops will help to inform potential grantees about issues that are of importance to the HBCU-UP program and the NSF Directorate for Education and Human Resources.  In the three years of this project, QEM plans to have three different workshops: one on education research, in particular ways in which HBCUs can inform the field; a second on design of STEM teacher preparation programs; and a third on the integration of mathematics into introductory level STEM courses and on effective STEM instructional strategies.\r\n\r\nQEM Network brings leadership and expertise in working with HBCUs to this project and the potential to impact a large percentage of the Nation?s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\r\n",
