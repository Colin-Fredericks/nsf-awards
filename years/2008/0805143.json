 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - DMS - 0805143\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of problems on which this project is\r\nfocused. The first is about the geometric and analytic\r\nproperties of the Ricci flow equation and their applications to\r\nthe study of geometry and the topology of manifolds. Secondly,\r\nthere are a couple of nonlinear partial differential equations\r\nappeared in the applied science, to which some techniques and\r\nresults obtained by the PI are related and can be applied. The\r\nfirst part of project consists of the classifications of\r\nself-similar solutions, namely gradient solitons, and the\r\nconvexity type estimates for Ricci flow solution in high\r\ndimensions. Such results have far-reaching consequences in the\r\napplications of Ricci flow in the study of\r\ngeometric-topological structure of the manifolds. The second\r\ntheme of the project is about the sharp gradient estimates of\r\nLi-Yau-Hamilton type, related monotonicity formulae and their\r\napplications in geometric nonlinear PDEs. Their relations to\r\nphysics, statistical mechanics in particular, shall be studied\r\ntoo. The aim is to discover a fundamental physical/geometric\r\nprinciple to unify various sharp estimates and monotonicity\r\nformulae. It will also provide the guideline for further\r\ndiscovery of the new monotonicity formulae in other geometric\r\npartial differential equations.\r\n\r\nThe project is on the geometric and analytic properties of\r\nRicci flow, one of the most important geometric partial\r\ndifferential equation in mathematics and physics. The\r\ncompletion of the project will enhance the current\r\nunderstanding of the singularity formation of the Ricci flow\r\nequation and its relation with several branches of applied\r\nscience and theoretic physics. By giving lectures for general\r\naudience including high school students, writing several\r\nmonographs and survey articles, the project contributes to the\r\ndissemination of enhancing the scientific understanding of\r\nmathematical community as well as the general publics.",
