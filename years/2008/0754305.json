The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Quy A. Ngo to work with Dr. Ueli Grossniklaus at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this proposed research is to understand how plant gametes interact at the cellular, molecular, and physiological levels to effect double fertilization. During the course of fertilization, both male gametes (two sperm cells) and female gametes (egg cell and central cell) need to recognize each other as partners at long and short distance. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, the PI will combine cytological, molecular, and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that gamete interactions rely on molecular recognition and signaling events such that a defective gamete alters the reproductive behavior of its wild-type partner. In addition to providing the mechanistic insights into these fundamental plant developmental processes during double fertilization, this study will also serve as springboards for subsequent investigations to advance the field. Since the products of plant reproduction contribute a major part to the production of food and feed, a better understanding of plant reproduction and innovative applications of this knowledge have a significant potential for improving agricultural crops.\r\n",
