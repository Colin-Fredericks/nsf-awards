 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed, realistic program to model three-dimensional, seismo-acoustic wave propagation from an exploding volcano in the near field is achieved by combining theoretical calculations and field observations.  A test of theoretical predictions based on models of wind shear and topographic effects is established by recording explosions on a 15 station 30 element array at Tungurahua Volcano, Ecuador.  Full waveform simulations with realistic representations of three-dimensional distributions of topography are used to model acoustic wave propagation in the atmosphere as well as elastic wave propagation in the earth.  For explosions, source time functions may be derived from acoustic waves to deconvolve source effects from hi-fidelity seismic wave recordings.  Seismic signals are used to extract detailed geologic structure in the volcano edifice and conduit, as well as physical parameters such as melt percentage, viscosity, and partitioning of gas-fluid-solid phases.",
