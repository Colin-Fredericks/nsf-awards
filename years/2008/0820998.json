 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine reserves are recognized as one of the most effective means of coastal resource management, and community participation has been found to be essential in this process.  Recent research has indicated that community participation in the form of co-management?that is the managing entity, usually government, and community members cooperatively managing the resource?is most effective for sustainable coastal resource management. The research will explore stakeholder involvement in selected examples of existing co-management regimes developed to manage marine reserves within the Wider Caribbean.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will identify which resource users and other stakeholders are currently involved in managing the resource, the variables that influenced aspects of their involvement, and the extent and effectiveness of their participation. Understanding the interests of stakeholders can be a way to more effectively address the distributional and social impacts of policies, which can in turn increase compliance with management measures and lead to more sustainable resource management regimes. The researchers will use network analysis to determine patterns of relationships between stakeholders that facilitate effective co-management of marine reserves. Effectiveness is both institutional (the functioning of the management entities) and biological (health of the coral reefs within the reserve as compared to outside the reserve). \r\n",
