 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nThe \"Teaching Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (K-8): Adapting Local Materials for Use in Diverse Institutions and Settings\" builds on extensive foundational work in identifying, characterizing, and measuring the \"mathematical knowledge for teaching\" (MKT) that enables and empowers K-8 school teachers to successfully improve their student's achievements in learning mathematics.  The project develops, field-tests, produces, and disseminates a set of three large learning-units which are collectively a one-term course curriculum for future K-8 teachers.  These materials can also be integrated separately into undergraduate mathematics content or methods courses for future elementary and middle school teachers.  The project promotes faculty learning through the establishment of collaborative structures called \"instructor planning groups\" which support the development of faculty knowledge and skills for successful implementation of the materials.  Additionally, an online community is used to contribute to the professional knowledge-base for mathematics education of teachers.  The dissemination of this project helps build the foundation for launching research on teaching and learning of MKT nationally, thereby setting the stage for major innovations in the mathematical education of teachers and the evaluation of its overall effects.",
