 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program in the Physics Department at the University of Washington.  The program offers a broad selection of student projects from many sub-fields of physics, for ten weeks of summer research. It makes use of the University of Washington's in-house \"table-top\" experimental programs; its machine-shop facilities including a student shop; CENPA, a DOE center-of-excellence in nuclear physics and astrophysics; and theory opportunities ranging from the Institute for Nuclear Theory to a two-teraflop local cluster.   Each student participant will be partnered with a UW faculty advisor. Most Physics faculty members participate as advisors, as do selected faculty from affiliated departments. Student work includes: design, construction, and commissioning of instrumentation; data collection and analysis; numerical modeling; the development of software for such modeling; and theory.   A variety of social activities that allow students to see the Seattle area and to interact with other students are also planned. In the past this has included interactions with other on-campus REU groups, such as those from Mathematics and Chemistry.",
