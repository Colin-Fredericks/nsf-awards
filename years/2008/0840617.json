The purpose of this meeting is to bring together an international group of researchers to discuss emerging topics in electronic packaging.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference,  electronic packaging remains an especially challenging area of research, particularly given its interdisciplinary nature that combines expertise from electrical engineering, thermal engineering, materials science, and others.  A topic of special importance, to be emphasized at this symposium, is three-dimensional packaging, in which a third dimension is added to typical two-dimensional electronic systems.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include partial support for a number of US-based junior researchers and students, with women and minority attendees especially encouraged to attend.    The results will be widely disseminated through a special issue of the ASME Journal of Electronic Packaging.",
