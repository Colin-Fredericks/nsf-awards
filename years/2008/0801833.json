 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nObjective\r\nThe objective of this work is to develop a medical imaging system for skin burns. Preliminary results indicate that a reflective terahertz (THz) imaging system can be used to image burns on porcine skin with high resolution and high tissue-condition contrast. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed system approach is based on conventional radar technology and significantly simplifies the system components and enables near real-time THz imaging.  A pulsed photoconductive switch is used as the broadband, free-space-coupled THz transmitter, and an antenna-coupled, zero-bias Schottky diode rectifier is used in the front-end of a time-gated receiver. Both in-vitro data and in-vivo data taken over the course of the proposed work will establish the capabilities of THz imaging of skin burns, and provide a large set of imagery data for future work and for dissemination to the scientific community. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nIn addition to the direct engineering and medical benefits, the proposed research will also promote student learning and teaching by creating a variety of opportunities, such as intercampus seminars, for meaningful interaction between faculty, clinicians, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students on both campuses.  For example, a new course on THz Science and Technology will be offered on the UCSB campus Fall of 2008 and will bring in students from Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology to a truly interdisciplinary learning environment.\r\n\r\n",
