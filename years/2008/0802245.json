 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Evaluation Resource Center (ERC) focused on evaluating the work of the ATE program through an annual survey since 2000.  The ERC now investigates and responds to the evaluation needs of the ATE projects by assisting current and prospective ATE grantees to develop high-quality evaluations that provide evidence to demonstrate the extent to which the goals of the projects and the ATE program are achieved.  The Center provides ATE grantees and evaluators with support to design, conduct and report credible, useful improvement and accountability-oriented evaluations.  The ERC continues to provide ATE program monitoring activities that are useful at the program and project level.  The ERC assesses the evaluation needs and capacities of ATE grantees, collects and develops evaluation resources keyed to their needs and builds evaluation capacity.  The Center also engages in and supports research on evaluation-related ATE issues and disseminates the findings and resources to the projects.  Information about the Center activities is disseminated to increase capacity for educational evaluation more broadly.  The activities of the Center are also evaluated.",

As such, it is geared toward supporting ATE grantees to use evaluation regularly to improve their work and demonstrate their projects&rsquo; impacts. From 2008-13, EvaluATE offered 25 webinars and 5 workshops, gave 36 conference presentations, and published 20 quarterly newsletters. These activities have directly served more than 1,000 people (not including website visitors). Over the five years of this grant, more than one-quarter of ATE principal investigators and more than one-half of ATE evaluators have actively participated with us by attending a live webinar or workshop. Additionally, EvaluATE has continued the survey of ATE grantees, which has been conducted annually since 2000, with an average response rate exceeding 90 percent. From 2008-13, we produced more than 20 reports and data snapshots based on results from this annual survey. We have produced an array of resources to support evaluation efforts in the ATE context, such as a checklist for evaluation planning for ATE proposals, a logic model template, an ATE evaluation primer, a guide to using Google Analytics for project evaluation, and numerous handouts that provide additional information and resources related to webinar and workshops topics.</p>\n<p>The results of the 2013 survey of EvaluATE&rsquo;s constituency (which includes those targeted by EvaluATE and others who seek out our resources) conducted by EvaluATE&rsquo;s external evaluator provided strong quantitative and qualitative evidence that EvaluATE is fulfilling its mission.

They also said because of EvaluATE they were more effective in using evaluation results to improve projects (56%) and have taken steps to learn more about evaluation on their own (57%).
