These concerns join other fundamental unsolved problems - the nature of dark matter, the origin of the baryon asymmetry, and the fundamental origin of inflation or other physics of the early universe. A central part of the proposal is the development of a suite of tests to (a) establish the theoretical viability of dark energy and modified gravity models and (b) to distinguish such models from one another and from the default case of a cosmological constant. The P.I. will investigate the extent to which there are relationships between modified gravity and dark energy models; the P.I. will map out and explore the territory of possible modifications to gravity with the potential to drive late-time cosmic acceleration; and the P.I. will perform a general study of cosmological perturbation theory in modified source gravity and on a class of models in which the \r\nGravitational action is a general function of curvature invariants. \r\nThe P.I. further proposes to carry out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of coupled \r\ndark energy-matter models, focusing on the stability of these models. The P.I. also proposes a systematic study of the cosmological consequences of models arising \r\nfrom compactified higher dimensional theories of particle physics and gravity; in particular, whether there are specific signatures that might be accessible to future \r\nsupernovae studies, lensing surveys, large-scale structure measurements and collider experiments. \r\nThe dominant broader impact of the proposed research is in public science education; bringing cutting edge science to the public, including populations traditionally underrepresented in physics. \r\nThe P.I. has been a co-P.I. on Cosmic Connections, an NSF-funded project to construct modern cosmology exhibits for display in the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology in Syracuse. The P.I. also organizes a public lecture series - Saturday Morning Physics - to share the ideas and excitement of cutting edge modern physics with people with no previous science education. Further, the P.I. has co-founded and organizes Caf\u00e9 Scientifique Syracuse. Held at a downtown restaurant, Cafe Scientifique is a place where scientists and scientifically interested non-scientists can come together informally to hear about and discuss interesting science.\r\n",
