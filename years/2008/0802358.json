 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Logistics Technicians: Goods to Go project has three goals: 1) to improve the educational experience of pre-technology students by providing a complete fast-track career pathway in supply chain/logistics technology; 2) to recruit regional high school students, at-risk youth and foster care youth to the automated systems and logistics technology program; and 3) to prepare community college faculty to teach the automated systems and logistics technology program by developing their expertise in specialized curricula areas with the support of university faculty. \r\n\r\nThe project partners regional high schools serving diverse low-income communities that have student bodies with low college-going rates with the community college logistics program. The innovative program links a community college, university, high schools, and industry to create a streamlined pathway to a baccalaureate degree in Technology and Operations Management. Both college faculties are committed to a seamless transition from high school to community college to a four-year institution. An experienced evaluator is committed to the project. The institutions include a Minority Serving Institution (MSI with 52% minority enrollment) and a Hispanic Serving Institution (H.S.I. with 32% Hispanic enrollment) with over 30,000 students. The project recruits from regional high schools, at-risk youth programs, foster-care programs, and a Summer Automation Institute for middle and high school students.",
