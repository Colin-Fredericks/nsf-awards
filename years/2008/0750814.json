 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Donald Walter, Ms. Jennifer Cash, and Dr. Daniel Smith at South Carolina State University (SCSU) will partner with Dr. Steven Howell and scientists at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) as well as Dr. Mark Leising and scientists at Clemson University (CU) in a partnership to be known as POCA (A Partnership in Observational and Computational Astronomy).  Through a multi-faceted program they plan to use the partnership as a means to fill the pipeline of African-American students pursuing advanced degrees in science, and particularly, astronomy.\r\n\r\nArchival data will be used to relate the periods of RV Tauri stars to several physical parameters, which help shape these objects into useful distance indicators in the Local Group.  The partnership will also participate in a world-wide network studying gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow and a study of primordial lithium abundances.  Additionally, they will use narrow-band H-alpha photometry to search for short-period, tidally locked binaries in the Galactic Halo. Finally, some of the group will use data from the Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope to investigate the role of magnetic fields in star formation.\r\n       \r\nSCSU is a Historically Black College/University with 96% of the student population being African-American. Undergrads at SCSU and grad students from CU will take part in all of the proposed research.  The opportunities for student research will exist year-round, and graduate students will be encouraged to become mentors to undergraduates.  The program is also intended to boost the research foundation at the university by mentoring not only SCSU students but also faculty members.  The program will also reach non-science majors through inquiry-based astronomy labs, and outreach programs will be used to share the science with the public and K-12 community. \r\n",

That mission has been accomplished over the past 7.5 years and the three institutions continue to collaborate with each other even though the initial award has ended.\n\n \n\nThe Broader Impact of this project was to increase diversity in the field of astronomy by (1) strengthening the educational and research program in physics and astronomy at an HBCU, specifically SCSU; and (2) increasing the number of individuals from underrepresented groups that engage in astronomical activities and earned degrees in astronomy and related fields.  \n\n \n\nItem 1 was achieved by involving the three physics faculty members at SCSU in a variety of activities with scientists at the partner institutions including authorship of peer reviewed publications, training and use of ground-based telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory and successfully competing to obtain observing time on NASA\u00c6s space-based observatory Kepler.  Additionally, the SCSU faculty members and their students in collaboration with scientists at NOAO, CU and other institutions gave presentations at national conferences and created educational products such as laboratory and web-based activities.\n\n \n\nThe success of Item 2 above was through supporting students in programs at SCSU, CU and other institutions.
