 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop brings together topics of robotics and creativity in the context of the premier artificial intelligence conference in the United States. The annual AAAI Conference is a venue that brings together American roboticists and AI experts. For over a decade-and-a-half, the AAAI has held the Robotics Workshop and Exhibition as part of the overall Conference. This established venue provides a unique opportunity for the community to formulate roadmaps that leverage and apply America?s strengths in artificial intelligence to robotics. The 2008 AAAI  Robotics Exhibition and Workshop (Chicago July 13-17, 2008) emphasizes multi-disciplinary research in the area of ?Robotics and Creativity?, which will provide novel opportunities to establish new paradigms merging AI and robotics. The workshop will emphasize research in which robots display creativity as well as cases where creativity is combined with design and engineering to stimulate robotics research at a variety of educational levels. A focus on creativity can lead to new paradigms for robotics research. A tangible output of the workshop is a White Paper describing a research roadmap for the community.",
