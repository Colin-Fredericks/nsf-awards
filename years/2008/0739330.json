The AMBS is a database for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, whose primary focus is compilation of multibeam bathymetry, geophysical, and underway data collected by the US Antarctic Program (USAP) research ships. The data are critical to current research activities and represent an important program legacy. In terms of broader impacts, the AMBS synthesizes data into regional maps to facilitate the dissemination of results. It also supports exploration, visualization, and correlation through simple, web-based interfaces as well as specialized research applications. This award also supports dissemination of results through the Antarctic Master Directory, an archive of metadata records from each research project supported by the USAP.",
