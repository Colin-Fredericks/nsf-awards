 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to use unique advantages provided by cavities with spherical symmetry for developing technology and applications of mesoscale coupled cavity structures. These advantages include the possibility of achieving a supermonodispersive selection of microspheres with an unprecedented level of uniformity (~10 <-5>) for their whispering gallery mode resonances. They also include the possibility of integrating cavities in all three spatial dimensions (3D). The focus of this project is on developing new types of microprobes with subwavelength resolution for laser surgery and biochemical sensing, as well as on developing tunable filters, sensors and compact spectrometers based on 2D and 3D coupled cavity structures. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the project is in developing novel concepts related to light transport in such systems including photonic nanojet-induced modes, percolation of whispering gallery modes and the role of disorder and dimensionality in the optical transport properties. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed program will have a broad impact on education and outreach through inherent multidisciplinary topics such as material science, engineering, and integrated photonics. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary research, preparing them for careers in nanotechnology and optical engineering. The outreach activities incorporated in this project are aimed at developing a series of educational workshops for undergraduate and graduate students where micro-optics will be used as a way of explaining hard-to-visualize aspects of wave physics, quantum mechanics and solid state physics.\r\n",
