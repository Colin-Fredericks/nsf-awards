These systems are highly modular, and can be used in yeast, insect, and mammalian cells to regulate the production of human therapeutic proteins. In addition, this project will generate information about the molecular mechanisms of natural quorum-sensing systems, which are commonly used by infectious bacteria to regulate pathogenesis. Therefore, insights gained during this project will be valuable for the design of effective quorum sensing inhibitors to control a variety of infectious diseases. Quorum sensing has also been used extensively in constructing artificial genetic circuits, and engineered quorum-sensing systems will be valuable tools for the fine-tuning of circuits with applications in gene and bacterial therapies targeting cancers and HIV. \r\n\r\nThe education plan includes the development of bioengineering courses and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students. A course in Molecular and Systems Biotechnology for graduate students and Introduction to Biomolecular Engineering for undergraduate students has been developed by the PI. A bioengineering laboratory course is also being developed.\r\n.",
