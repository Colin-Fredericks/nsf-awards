 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Glendale Community College (GCC) Scholarships and Support Equal Academic Achievement (SSEAA) Project is to promote participation and persistence among students in computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, biological science, physical science, or mathematics degree programs. To achieve this goal, the project is designed to accomplish the following objectives: \r\n(a) Recruit and enroll eligible students based on a recruitment/selection strategy designed to attract students who are most likely to persist through completion of an associate degree or transfer to a four-year degree program.\r\n(b) Provide academic support and monitoring to promote academic achievement. \r\n(c) Provide student support services including general activities and career development. \r\n(d) Provide at least 50% of scholarships to underrepresented minorities. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The SSEAA project uses the structures  developed by a successful NSF funded CSEMS program. The project includes student support systems to monitor, intervene, promote and foster academic achievement and successful completion of a degree and transfer. Individual education plans provide a foundation for continually assessing student progress, which provides a support mechanism to help students persist towards achieving their degree. Assistance in solving problems is being provided by mentors, staff and college services. A referral process is used to connect students with outside agencies that provide no-cost services to low-income individuals and their families. Students interact with peers, faculty members, university faculty and industrial representatives through the STEM Club and Biotech Club created and staffed by students. Activities such as Engineering Day, Science Olympiad, and DNA Day are supported by technology companies such as Honeywell, TGen, and Medtronic. These same companies provide monthly speakers and field trip opportunities. \r\n\r\nBroader Implications: Engineering, high-tech, and science companies in the Phoenix area continue to need highly qualified workers. The project helps fill this hiring gap and provides students with the opportunity to obtain high paying jobs. Combined with the fact that 50% of the students are from underrepresented minorities in the STEM disciplines, this project increases the number of women and minorities working in STEM careers.",
