 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the PI's program of research within the framework of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) including projects in the areas of source modeling and data analysis relevant primarily to binary stellar systems containing neutron stars or black holes (binary compact objects).\r\nThe supported research will contribute towards answering three critical questions at the interface between astrophysics and gravitational waves: (i) What are current predictions for the likelihood of gravitational wave detection? (ii) How can astrophysical studies help to optimize searches for gravitational waves? and (iii) How should gravitational wave observations be interpreted and what can be learned about astrophysics from them? More specifically this research focuses on: (i) the application of constraints from stellar population models based on measured physical properties of binary compact objects instead of just empirical rates; this will allow the best possible predictions for expected LIGO event rates; (ii) the study of physical correlations between compact object masses and spins black hole binaries to inform studies of the detection efficiency of LIGO; (iii) the study of mass ratios in binary black holes with the goal of most efficiently guiding the numerical relativity efforts for the calculation of merger waveforms; (iv) the employment of genetic algorithms for highly multi-dimensional searches; (v) the development of a proper statistical framework for the interpretation of both upper limits and possible detections to specifically address subtleties associated with the dependence of limits on compact object mass, galaxy types and star formation histories as well as the effect of small number detections.\r\nThis research program focuses on a number of questions the answers to which are important for the interpretation of current and future gravitational wave observations with LIGO, on ways of maximizing the gain from future detections, and also on upper limits expected to constrain current theories of compact object formation. Some of the basic underlying physical principles of this research will be used in the development of public outreach activities. The PI will benefit from the long-standing connection between Northwestern University and the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum. Joint activities include the development of computer-based museum exhibits with the goal to disseminate the research results to the public and enhance their interest in compact objects and gravitational wave physics.\r\nThe PI also has an active history and interest in involving undergraduate students (especially those from underrepresented groups) in research projects and promotes a framework of peer learning in tutoring and mentoring.\r\n\r\n",
