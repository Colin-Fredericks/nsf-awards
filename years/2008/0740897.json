 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the design and development of systems for real-time enhancement of the quality of video distributed over IP-based networks, including best-effort links.  The proposed research provides a systematic way of realizing the above goal, building upon recent research on the measurement and optimization of video and network subsystems. A central aspect of the proposal is a zero reference method for predicting video quality anywhere in the network, with high correlation with subjective measurements of quality. The research will include the topologically simple example where video quality at a specific place in the network (such as the receiver at the end of the video communication chain) is enhanced by making use of algorithms that are at the core of the system. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the solutions proposed in this research will help content providers, aggregators, distributors and receiver manufacturers in meeting user expectations in emerging systems for entertainment video. This is by itself a significant market. The proposed research will also contribute directly to the science of high-quality visual communications.\r\n",
