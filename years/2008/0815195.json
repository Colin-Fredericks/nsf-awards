 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: I/UCRC: CELDi at MU\r\nInstitution: \tUniversity of Missouri-Columbia\r\nAbstract Date: 03/30/2008\r\n\r\nThe award establishes University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) as a research site of the Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi).  Other sites of this collaborative research center include the University of Arkansas (lead), Oklahoma State University, Lehigh University, Clemson University, University of Oklahoma, University of Louisville, Texas Tech University and Virginia Tech.  The mission of this center is to provide integrated solutions to logistics problems through modeling, analysis, and intelligent systems technologies.  MU will be a strong partner of CELDi and should be able to immediately contribute to the logistics systems analysis and design, supply chain modeling, and material flow design and improvement.  MU has a team of researchers who are capable of providing immediate assistance in research related to the integration of logistics components in large, complex inter/multi-modal systems.  CELDi will benefit from the expanded research expertise and involvement of top Fortune 500 companies that MU will bring to the table. \r\n\r\nUniversity of Missouri-Columbia will make significant contributions to the mission of CELDi.  The quality and quantity of research conducted will expand the impact of CELDi in technical, educational and outreach activities.  The research team at MU is multidisciplinary with faculty participating from industrial engineering, systems engineering and transportation engineering perspectives as well as management logistics and agricultural economics.  MU has a clear plan to involve students in its research, and the nature of the proposal ensures that the proposed research will have significant impact on industrial practice through close collaboration with industrial partners.  Both the undergraduate and graduate education at MU will be positively impacted by MU?s participation in CELDi.",

The results are typically both a report and software that can be readily used by all CELDi members with little modification.  University of Missouri researchers have participated in two CDP\u00c6s: 1) Logistics Network Design for Less-than-Truckload (LTL) Consolidation and 2) Integrated Freight Consolidation and Shipping Models in International Supply Networks\n\nFundamental Research Projects (FRP)\n NSF provides competitive funding for basic research on ideas that are derived from the research conducted within I/UCRC\u00c6s.
