 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an intensive inventory of amphibians and reptiles of 15 major unstudied areas in Papua New Guinea (PNG), a country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and associated archipelagos to the north. PNG has one of the richest assemblages of reptiles and amphibians in the world, with an estimated 950-1000 total species. This is twice as many species of reptiles and amphibians as North America, which is 40 times larger.  Prior NSF supported work in PNG resulted in discovery of more than 120 new species of reptiles and amphibians; this new project extends surveys to include previously unexplored regions of PNG. The project also provides logistical support for a team of colleagues conducting concordant studies of herpetological parasites, mammals, birds, land snails, and aquatic insects.  \r\n \r\nThe study will lead to the discovery of perhaps 120 additional new species of reptiles and amphibians, bringing our knowledge of PNG's herpetofauna to approximately 90% completion.  It will document patterns of faunal richness and endemism, test biogeographic hypotheses, and identify centers of regional endemism that will advance conservation planning in the country.  Finally, it will train the next generation of herpetologists working in PNG, including the first professional Papua New Guinean herpetologists, and at least two American graduate students.",
