Bhunia\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is the development of a technology for mass production of low-cost nanochannel devices with electrodes. The project includes modeling, fabrication, characterization and testing these devices. The approach is to define nanochannels lithographically with sidewall batch fabrication techniques. Each device consists of a nanometer-sized channel with inlet and outlet openings and two metallic nanoelectrodes embedded across the nanochannel walls. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: Nanochannel devices for single molecule probing and analysis are presently fabricated with direct write techniques which are not viable for low cost fabrication. In this program we will develop methods for mass production of low-cost nanochannel devices with transverse electrodes on silicon substrates. These structures will be tested and characterized in terms of their physical properties and their ability to interrogate macromolecules. Fast and accurate semi-analytical models for estimation of device parameters such as channel conductance in the presence and absence of single biomolecule will be developed. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Single molecule interrogation technology using nanochannel probes provides tremendous opportunities in biological, environmental and clinical applications. The project will provide research and training opportunity to two graduate students; up to four undergraduate students and up to two high school students from Hathaway Brown, a local all girls school with a distinctive student research program. Emphasis will be given on recruiting bright underrepresented students, including minorities and women engineers. The technology developed through this project will be shared with peer research groups from various institutions for additional testing and characterization of the devices.\r\n",
