 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quorum sensing is a regulatory mechanism used by bacteria to control a variety of processes in response to cell densities in bacterial communities. The acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) dependent quorum-sensing system is found in over 90 gram-negative bacterial species, and is responsible for regulating processes, including bioluminescence, antibiotic production, plasmid conjugal transfer, biofilm production, and pathogenesis in plants and animals. This project focuses on understanding how the enzymes known as AHL synthases make the AHLs in the cell. It will provide new insight into the mechanism by which AHL synthases select and act on substrates with different acyl-chain lengths to produce different forms of AHLs. It will also determine the degree to which the acyl-ACP pool modulates the types of AHLs produced, which may be a crucial aspect of controlling the behavior of bacterial communities in response to environmental stimuli. This research will also have a broad impact of a practical nature because AHL mediated quorum sensing contributes to agricultural crop losses, damage to industrial equipment and aquaculture though marine biofouling, and loss of human and animal lives through bacterial infections.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis project will provide training and education to several early-stage scientists, including undergraduate researchers and graduate level trainees from under-represented groups in the Denver area. One undergraduate student comes from the Community College of Aurora through the Stride Toward Encouraging Profession in Science (STEPS) program. This project will provide education and training of students from under-represented populations who have not had any research experience as undergraduates, but who need this experience in order to move into graduate or professional schools. These students will come from institutions where there was little opportunity for research for them in the Denver area and from a collaborator at a primarily undergraduate institution. The project will also provide valuable research experience for both Masters and Ph.D. graduate students. Therefore, through several avenues, this project will introduce new people from diverse backgrounds to research, help the development of new graduate students, and generate additional diversity among the scientific community.",
