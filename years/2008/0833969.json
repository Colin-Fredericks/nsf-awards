 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Signing Math Dictionary for Kids Project builds upon two prior awards (HRD-0095392 and HRD-0533057) to create the Signing Math Dictionary.  The primary institution, TERC Inc, is partnering with Vcom3D Inc to use the SigningAvatar accessibility software to:\r\n1) Research and develop an illustrated interactive 3D dictionary of mathematics terms and definitions for elementary and middle-grade students who are deaf and hard of hearing and whose first language is sign. \r\n2) Evaluate the extent to which use of the dictionary furthers understanding of standards-based mathematics content, command of the language of mathematics, and the ability to study mathematics independently. \r\n3) Create a more robust sign/facial expression/body-space lexicon of signed mathematics terms that other developers can use when generating signed mathematics materials.\r\n\r\nThe Signing Math Dictionary will be developed, evaluated and promoted to serve elementary and middle school students who are deaf or hard of hearing and who first language is sign.  The following schools and programs have already agreed to participate in the project:\r\n- Bruce Street School for the Deaf, Newark, NJ \r\n- Countrywide Program for Students Who Are Deaf/Hard of Hearing, Town & Country, MO \r\n- Eisenhower Elementary School, Davenport, IA \r\n- Hinsdale South High School (grades 6-8), Darien, IL \r\n- Kinzie School, Chicago, IL \r\n- Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, Augusta, ME \r\n- St. Francis de Sales School for the Deaf, Brooklyn, NY \r\n- Texas School for the Deaf, Austin, Texas \r\n- The Learning Center for Deaf Children, Framingham, MA \r\n- Washington School for the Deaf, Vancouver, WA\r\n\r\nThe proposed dictionary will offer students an indispensable learning tool and teachers a library of recognized signs for studying mathematics ideas with their students. It will include at least 1,000 key mathematics terms and will be the first tool of its kind to bring mathematics learning to life using avatar characters that sign.",
