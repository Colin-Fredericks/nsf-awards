 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project academically-talented, financially needy graduate students in the geological and geophysical sciences are pursuing the study of Continental Margins Oceanography (CMO). The project's intellectual merit rests in part on the increasing social and scientific importance of research on continental margin processes given the recognition that both human activities and natural environmental processes are having a profound effect on the continental margins from the coastline to offshore areas. The multi-national exploration for oil and gas reserves makes these regions even more environmentally, socially, and economically important and is increasing the demand for capable scientists with appropriate expertise. Three CMO scholar cohorts are being recruited primarily from Texas universities and colleges where the population of students with financial need is large and there are high populations of students from historically underrepresented groups, particularly in the sciences. Academic and social support networks are available both at the department level and university-wide. In addition, through the institution's Career Center, CMO scholars connect with companies and organizations recruiting masters and doctoral students in each scholar's specialty. The project's broader impacts are being felt through targeted recruiting efforts that are bringing academically-talented, financially needy students into areas of high national need with impact on society and the economy as alluded to above.",
