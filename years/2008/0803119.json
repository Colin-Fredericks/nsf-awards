 "awd_abstract_narration": "College of Menominee Nation, a tribal college located in Keshena, WI, has successfully completed the \r\nobjectives and strategies of its Phase I:  STEM Curriculum Enhancement Project.  The College proposes \r\nto continue the expansion and growth of its STEM programming and curriculum through a Phase II: \r\nEvolutionary STEM Advancement Project. NSF funding will allow College of Menominee Nation to \r\ncontinue contributing to both the significant broader impacts of Tribal College STEM achievements as \r\nwell as to the support and critical promotion of Native Americans in STEM employment fields  \r\n \r\nCMN?s Phase II goal is:  To continue to strengthen and build CMN?s capacity to provide competitive \r\nSTEM programming and services.  Anticipated Phase II impacts include 1.) Increasing the number of \r\nunderrepresented STEM majors; 2.) Increasing STEM student retention; 3.) Increasing the number of \r\nunderrepresented STEM graduates; 4.) Increasing the number of underrepresented students who enroll \r\nin baccalaureate degree granting institutions; and 5.) Increasing the number of underrepresented \r\nminorities entering the STEM workforce.  \r\n \r\nPhase II objectives and strategies build upon the sturdy foundation of Phase I successes and follow a \r\nnatural progression of development.  The objectives and strategies are as follows: \r\n1. Objective One: To advance existing STEM programs revised, expanded or developed in Phase I.  \r\nStrategies include developing and implementing advanced STEM courses in mathematics and \r\nscience, continue developing the Materials Science Program linked to Menominee expertise in \r\nforests, expanding faculty and student STEM resources available at CMN, and further integrating \r\ntechnology into STEM courses. \r\n2. Objective Two: To increase faculty capacity through advanced degree support for two faculty \r\nmembers and general professional development for STEM faculty.  Strategies include supporting \r\none faculty member in earning a Master?s degree, supporting another in earning a doctorate, and \r\nsupporting general professional development of STEM faculty.  \r\n3. Objective Three: To develop and implement additional STEM student research, internships, and \r\nexposure opportunities.  Strategies include developing and implementing student research and \r\ninternship activities, supporting a student exchange program with Belize, and supporting student \r\ntravel to major research labs and key STEM association meetings. \r\n4. Objective Four: To continue to provide and expand demonstrated successful STEM student \r\nsupport activities.  Strategies include supporting a STEM student advisor, supporting STEM \r\ntutors, supporting the STEM scholars program and developing the STEM honors program. \r\n \r\n",
