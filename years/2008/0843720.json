 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing wiki technology has successfully encouraged the collaborative development of content from a distributed and large set of individuals. However, a typical wiki does not encourage the community to actively collaborate or communicate with each other, unless they are required to collaborate. This project identifies a framework for addressing the shortcomings in typical wiki technology that encompasses ideas from social computing to develop a more community focus for the CreativeIT wiki. This project creates a socio-technical environment to support researchers, practitioners, and students to become a vibrant community focused on Creativity and IT, based on the formative evaluation of the existing CreativeIT wiki and related research in the field. A theoretically grounded and empirically evaluated framework is developed for the creation and evolution of a participation culture. Grounding the proposed research in a real problem provides a unique opportunity to assess the strengths and weaknesses on an ongoing basis. This research effort contributes to broaden the theme of Creativity and IT, involves more people to participate, and sustain the effort in the long-term future. The project identifies insights, mechanisms, guidelines, and support environments for participation cultures.",
