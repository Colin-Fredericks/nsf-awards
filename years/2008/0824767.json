 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sustainable  infrastructure  systems  require  a  greater  understanding  of the complexity  of  those  systems,  including  their  dependence  on environmental  systems  and  services;  their  interdependence  on  other infrastructure  systems,  and  on  social,  technical  and  economic  systems;  their dynamic  behavior  over  time  and  space;  and  the  need  for  the  services  they provide.   This  workshop  will  bring  together  a  diverse  blend  of  researchers to  explore  and  form  research  initiatives  within  the  theme  of Delivering Sustainable  Infrastructure  for  the  Built  Environment.   It is scheduled for Dec. 15-17,  2008,  following  the  Third  International  Conference  on  Sustainability Engineering  and  Science  (Dec  9-12).  \r\n\r\nThe  workshop  objectives  are  to:  1)  identify  priorities  and  an  action  plan for research  into  Sustainable  Infrastructure  related  to  the  urban  built environment;  and,  2)  identify  and  prioritize  collaborative  research  projects, including  establishing  research  teams,  identifying  funding  opportunities  and outlining  research  objectives.    \r\n\r\nThe  workshop  outcomes  will  be:  1)  an  agenda  for  establishing  a  funding initiative  and/or  program  to  support  research  into  sustainable  infrastructure that  serves  the  urban  built  environment;  and  2)  development  of  3?]5  clearly outlined  international  collaborative  research  projects,  including  establishing research  teams,  identifying  funding  opportunities  and  outlining  the research objectives.   \r\n\r\nThe  3  US  workshop  organizers  are  committed  to  recruiting  7  additional  US researchers  and  3  doctoral  students  for  a  group  of  13 US  participants  that will  be  diverse  in  terms  of  discipline,  area  of  expertise,  gender,  race,  and career  length.  Also  attending  are  25?]30  additional  international  researchers and  7?]12  international  doctoral  students.   These  individuals  will  come  from four  countries  (UK,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  and  Australia)  and  their participation  will  be  supported  by  their  home  governments.  \r\n\r\nThis  workshop  will  provide  fundamentals  for  the  study  and  application  of the  science  and  engineering  of  sustainability  and  may  affect  the  planning and  management  of  future  urban  infrastructure  that  serves  the  built environment.   The  development  of  priorities  for  research  and  of  specific interdisciplinary  research  projects  will  assist  in  directing  resources  into topics which  are  considered  crucial  in  developing  this  field,  both academically and professionally.    \r\n\r\nThe  results  will  promote  a  better  understanding  of  the  role  of  various disciplines  in  developing  socio?]technical  systems  and  will  enable  a  greater understanding  of  the  risks  inherent  in  the  large,  multiple?]scale,  complex dynamic  systems  which  comprise  socio?]technical  systems.   Specifically,  it should  assist  in  developing  better  responses  to  climate  change,  increased urbanization,  increasing  use  of  resources,  and  implications  of  shortages  of resources  and  management  of  aging  urban  infrastructure.   The  research projects  resulting  from  the  workshop  that  have  a  focus  on  globalization and sustainability  should  attract  (and  train)  a  more  diverse,  globally  integrated, and  competitive  science  and  engineering  workforce.   International research collaboration  will  lead  to  innovation  in  course  and  curriculum development.     \r\n",
