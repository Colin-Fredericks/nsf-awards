 "awd_abstract_narration": "This group proposal is to support three research groups investigating problems in the field of theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics. These three groups work primarily on the physics of ultracold gases, with an eye toward exploiting them as controllable quantum systems, as well as overcoming present bottlenecks and limitations in our understanding. The three principal investigators have acquired complementary areas of expertise over the years, which are strengthened by their close ties, ease of regular communication, and common interests. The resulting synergy of interests and abilities enables these three groups to delve efficiently into a broad range of problems.  Parenthetically, it is mentioned that the results being reported are for a five year period even though the last reviewed funding cycle only covered a 3-year interval that began in the spring of 2003. The additional two years of funding since spring of 2006 were provided as an NSF Creativity Extension.  The intellectual merit of the research proposed here primarily derives from the fact that this proposal tackles numerous problems of contemporary interest in the field of ultracold quantum gases. Dilute quantum gas research has recently observed Cooper-type pairing in a degenerate Fermi gas, and an associated phase transition akin to BCS superconductivity. This and other properties of a degenerate Fermi gas continue to pose new challenges for theory, and remain rich areas for deeper investigations. The behavior of atoms in optical lattices is a field in its infancy, particularly in conjunction with magnetic Feshbach resonances, and it will receive theoretical attention from this project as well. Generalizations of two-body scattering theory to handle collisions between two polar molecules have proven to be tremendously challenging, and they will be the focus of concentrated effort in the coming funding period. Three-body recombination and four-body scattering and rearrangement collisions are also planned for concerted theoretical attack.  The investigators have established expertise in many areas relevant to this proposal, which partially overlap, including quantum optics, many-body theory, two-body scattering physics with and without a dressing laser field present, and few-body interactions and recombination processes.  The broader impacts expected to result from the next funding period are centered squarely on the training of graduate students in theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics. All of the funds requested are aimed at the support of graduate students, approximately three per year divided evenly among the three investigators.",
