 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 12-month standard award to support a doctoral symposium program at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), to be held in Monterey, CA (October 18-22, 2008). This will bring together approximately 8 dissertation-stage doctoral students from diverse areas that include traditional graphical user interfaces, virtual and augmented reality, multimedia, new input and output devices, CSCW, and ubiquitous computing, among others. It includes on day of talks and interaction with 3 distinguished senior faculty mentors, followed by events integrated throughout the conference.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe doctoral symposium is intended to help expand the participation of young researchers currently pursuing a Ph.D. studies in the area, giving their innovative work wider exposure in the community, helping to foster a sense of community among these young researchers, and providing an opportunity to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community in an interactive and supportive environment. This will be accomplished in a number of ways. Visibility will be increased by publication of student position papers in the UIST Conference Companion, and by presentation of posters at a special session the first night of the conference. Community building will include beginning the symposium with an informal social event to establish a friendly and interactive atmosphere before formal presentations are made, and the inclusion of substantial time for discussion among the participants. Finally, guidance and feedback will be provided by senior members of the community with substantial experience working with Ph.D. students in the area, again structured with substantial time planned for interactive discussion.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe UIST doctoral symposium brings together highly talented students and several senior researchers, facilitating the development of a social network that will play a major role in the career success of new researchers. Since both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions (research topics, methodological approaches, national and cultural background), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.",
