 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award funds a workshop to be held in May, 2008 to bring together leading researchers and educators in geotechnical engineering.  The workshop is partly sponsored by the United States Universities Council on Geotechnical Education and Research (USUCGER).  The main objective of the workshop is to foster interaction between participants for exchange of knowledge and ideas and to develop specific plans for research and educational collaborations. The workshop will be held  be held on Sunday May 18, 2008 in Sacramento, California to immediately precede the ASCE Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics IV Conference, also scheduled for Sacramento. This will allow for maximizing the participation as well as the\r\nexposure of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will have the general theme of identifying geotechnical research and education priorities and fostering relations to promote effective collaborations on these topics. Research, education, and mentoring panel sessions that include leading experts from a variety of perspectives will highlight this theme.  For the research panel,   speakers/representatives from NSF/NEES, Industry, Geo-Bio area, transportation area, energy area, and one of the contributors to the NRC report  \"Geological and Geotechnical Engineering I n the New Millennium: Opportunities for Research and Technological Innovation?. For the education panel, general issues that will be addressed include: assessment, Body of Knowledge (BOK), broad dissemination of geotechnical modules to other supporting disciplines, improving recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in geotechnical engineering, and the implications of ASCE Policy 465 on graduate geotechnical education.  A mentoring session will also be held that addresses young faculty members? issues such as tenure; funding; and education, research, and service issues. Sufficient time is permitted in the workshop schedule to allow for open discussion among workshop participants, questions, and exchange of ideas among workshop participants.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together prominent researchers, educators, students, and practitioners from U.S. institutions. Significant advancements can be made in identifying research and education priorities, challenges, and opportunities in geotechnical engineering. Incorporating knowledge from other disciplines (geo-bio, transportation, and energy) on emerging issues will increase the awareness of the attendees in these areas for developing effective research plans. The technical and educational outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated through reports, presentations, and the USUCGER website. Advancements in geotechnical engineering provide improved safety and functionality of infrastructure, better environmental protection, and overall improved the well being of the public at large. Societal outcomes of the workshop also include positively influencing participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering, developing education opportunities for graduate and post-graduate students, and establishing baseline curricula for undergraduate and graduate geotechnical education for 2008.\r\n",
