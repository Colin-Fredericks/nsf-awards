The investigative team brings together expertise from a range of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies.   A theory of embodied mathematical cognition empirically rooted in classroom learning and workplace practices will broaden the range of activities and emerging technologies that count as mathematical, and help educators to envision alternative forms of bodily engagement with mathematical problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project enables the collaboration of research teams at three different universities (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Vanderbilt University, and San Diego State University).  The project seeks to advance new theories for how the body is involved in learning and teaching the mathematics of space and motion.  The work conducted by the three teams of the project has become a point of reference for scholars working on Embodied Mathematical Cognition in the US and abroad.   Through a combination of teaching and design experiments, combining qualitative and quantitative data, the contributions of the project can be grouped in three areas: 1) Gestural Actions, Logical Necessity, and Coordination of Symbolic Resources, 2) Art, Manipulatives, and Large-Scale Structures for the Learning of Mathematics, and 3) Re-Scaling the Body to merge places, memories, symbols across fields of action\n\n1) Gestural Actions, Logical Necessity, and Coordination of Symbolic Resources\n\nMathematical cognition is embodied in two key senses: it is based in perception and action, and it is grounded in the physical environment. We present evidence for each of these claims drawn from the gestures that teachers and learners produce when they explain mathematical concepts and ideas.  On these bases, we argue that (a) Pointing gestures reflect the grounding of cognition in the physical environment; (b) Representational gestures manifest mental simulations of action and perception; and (c) Some metaphoric gestures reflect body-based conceptual metaphors. Thus, gestures reveal that important aspects of mathematical thinking are embodied.  The gestures and other bodily activities, such as gaze and facial expression, of teachers and professionals play crucial roles to produce and maintain cohesion of central concepts across the range of representations, objects, activities, and social structures in classrooms and workplaces.  Bodily activities, whose origins can be traced to social interactions with objects and symbols, are re-enacted by learners and professionals to imagine novel mathematical relationships and to envision the necessity of certain results and implications. \n\n2) Art, Manipulatives, and Large-Scale Structures for the Learning of Mathematics\n\nGiven that gestural and other bodily activities are central to learn and imagine mathematical relationships, this question follows: How to design learning environments that enrich and extend bodily engagements in classrooms, playgrounds, and workplaces?  To address this question we have identified three areas of development.  The first one is to advance the interplay between physical and virtual environments, rather than the exclusive reliance on software-based models; the second one is the incorporation of art projects in the learning of mathematics, and the third one is the design of large-scale mathematical structures for the body to navigate and walk-through.  All these areas of development are important not only to add intellectual depth to mathematical work, but also to broaden the modes of engagement so that learners of all sociocultural backgrounds can find their ways into mathematics.  The project has generated multiple tools, prototypes, and activity records to advance these three areas of development.\n\n3) Re-Scaling the Body to merge places, memories, and symbols across fields of action\n\nSince all mathematical experience involves bodily activities, what can we learn about how the body is deployed, engaged with representational media, and mobile in the material environment, as it works through the mathematics of space and motion? Our studies of professional work groups (archeologists, emergency air transport controllers, and urban planners) engaged in practices of spatial analysis and modeling document recurring processes that scale bodies to both representing (model) and represented (what is modeled) aspects of the lived world.  Building on these descriptive findings, designs that change the scale, m..."
