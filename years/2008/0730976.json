The system will consist of a planar flow cell designed to provide well-controlled flow-induced heterogeneity in flow conditions while allowing direct in situ observation of physical/ chemical conditions by optical sensing techniques and microbial growth by microscopic methods. The system will allow the study of microbal communities of varying degrees of complexity. Current experimental systems for studying biofilms do not allow equal control and observation of all the factors that the proposed device will. Aside from developing a tool for research on biofilms, the project will evaluate the range of flow patterns that can be established and how they affect biofilm growth in the system. Biofilms are virtually ubiquitous in the natural environment and in many built systems, including water distribution systems, treatment plants, ship hulls, and concrete structures for waterways. \r\n\r\n",
