 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California Irvine (UC Irvine) for the summers of 2008-2010. This REU site will be managed by Fillmore Freeman with assistance from Gregory Weiss, both from the Department of Chemistry at UC Irvine. This REU site will bring eight students to campus for a ten-week period each summer to conduct cutting edge research in chemistry. The main focus UCI's Chemistry Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (Chem-SURF) program is to introduce students to faculty-mentored and collaborative research in the chemical sciences. Twenty-two faculty mentors with research projects in the areas of chemical biology, chemical physics, analytical, atmospheric, bioinorganic, bioorganic, computational (theoretical), inorganic, materials, organic, physical, polymer, and surface chemistry will be available to the REU students. In addition to their core research projects, students will be attending several seminar sessions designed to develop their research, communication, and professional interaction skills and several field trips and tours will be arranged to local companies and organizations.",
