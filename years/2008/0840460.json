 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to provide travel funds for both domestic and foreign students to attend the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation Grantees Conference, to be held in June, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The theme of this conference is Research and Education in a Flat World, and the inclusion of students from around the world will complement this theme.  Domestic students will be invited to apply for support through announcements on the NSF web site and through e-mailings sent to all Divisional grantees.  Foreign students will be invited through their respective funding agencies and because of extant international collaborations with Divisional grantees.  Foreign student support will include conference registration fee and hotel accommodations.  Domestic students will also obtain travel support.  Student applications for support will be reviewed by an ad hoc committee and selections made based on factors that include diversity, research topic relevance and poster presentation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact and benefit of this activity will be a broadening the education of domestic students to include a more international view of engineering and the formation of collaborations that, in many instances, will last well into the careers of the students.  Through this exposure, students are likely to improve their research and to make contributions that will provide greater benefit to society in the future.",
