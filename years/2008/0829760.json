 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is said that the next ten years of advances in computer science could be far more significant, and far more interesting, than the past ten. To achieve this significant progress, there needs to be a concerted effort to attract a new generation of students, especially those willing to obtain a Ph.D. The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to attract and encourage women and underrepresented minority (URM) computer science undergraduate students (specifically those in their sophomore and junior years) and graduate students enrolled in M.S. programs to obtain a Ph.D. in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together researchers (including women and URM\r\nleaders) from academia and industry to give talks on the kind of research typically performed after obtaining a Ph.D. The workshop will engage women and URM students specifically interested in systems research in a process of imagining how they might make significant contributions to the world through systems research. Researchers from several areas of systems research will review past research and the current state-of-art, and will present a number of future problems that we should be prepared to tackle in the coming decade.\r\n",
