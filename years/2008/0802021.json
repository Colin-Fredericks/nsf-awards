 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Makenzie Lystrup is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Dr. Lystrup will investigate the connection between the upper atmospheres and magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn with a multi-wavelength and multi-faceted approach. She will use data from ground-based near infrared observations and Cassini ultraviolet spacecraft data to probe the auroral/polar regions of the planets in order to answer outstanding questions regarding the energy balance of the planets and the atmosphere/magnetosphere coupling. This will include the first comprehensive comparative study of the ultraviolet and infrared auroral emissions at Jupiter and Saturn. Dr. Lystrup will augment the observational component of her work with modeling and theoretical work being done at the host institution.\r\n\r\nDr. Lystrup will also implement a program of research and mentoring for undergraduates in astronomy and astrophysics with the aim of retaining talented young women in astronomy. Undergraduates will participate in the data analysis of the project using skills they have learned in data analysis coursework at the host institution. Additionally, Dr. Lystrup will create the Astronomy Beyond (ABB) program to provide mentoring for the next stage of students' careers, to provide a network mentors and role models for undergraduate students, and to create the infrastructure (workshop materials and website) for continuing the ABB program beyond Dr. Lystrup's fellowship tenure.",
