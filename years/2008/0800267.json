 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to design, model, and demonstrate a novel fiber sensor scheme for long-span fully-distributed measurement of pressure and transverse stress. These two important parameters, as of today, still can not be measured in a fully-distributed manner by any means.  This unprecedented capability will fulfill needs in many industrial and research sectors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed scheme is based on optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) technology and specially designed microstructured optical fibers. The OTDR can provide distributed measurement of fiber birefringence while the microstructured fibers present change in birefringence when pressure or transverse stress is applied. The major tasks include novel fiber design and fabrication, sensor performance (sensitivity, spatial resolution, and dynamic range) enhancement, and sensor test and demonstration under harsh environment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The proposed technology will expand the functionalities of the fully-distributed fiber-optic sensing beyond the traditional only temperature and longitudinal strain measurement. The multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research will offer well-balanced training and research opportunities for the participating students and enrich the current curriculum at Virginia Tech.  Graduate students from underrepresented minority groups will be recruited.  Undergraduate research projects will be designed in various areas of the proposed research.  High school students will also be involved into the proposed program through summer internships.\r\n",
