The approach is to implement real-time processing algorithms that can identify and interpret reproducible electronic signals that could lead towards practical sensor applications.  The underlying experimental platform is comprised of a single-walled carbon nanotube circuit, to which a single molecule has been covalently attached.  The experimental approach is to acquire and characterize electronic signals arising from these devices as the attached molecule probes, recognizes, or binds to partners in the surrounding environment.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is its effective use of recent discoveries to push molecular-scale electronics in a direction of immediate practicality.  The merit includes the principle that signals from molecular devices, with appropriate processing, can be used to quantitatively measure and illuminate complex chemical processes.\r\nThe broader impact of this project includes the development of exquisitely sensitive devices for chemical sensing or low cost biosensing, providing new diagnostic and research capabilities.  All of the work will be completed by graduate and undergraduate students in a training environment designed to expose junior researchers to problems and techniques relevant to future careers in science.",
