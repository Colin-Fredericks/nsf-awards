 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive laboratory research indicates that a relatively small number of male and female reproductive proteins play key roles in determining differential success of gametes. These molecules are regulating complex communications in what may be antagonistic interactions between male and female reproductive interests. Little is known about the molecular basis for these interactions and their relative importance in the wild. This study will identify the genetic basis for male-male and male-female interactions, determine how associations between genotype and phenotype vary when the male competitor?s genotype varies, and directly identify which male reproductive genes mediate male x male interactions. This study also will investigate how mating status varies across the day, the season, densities and as a function of the female genotype and allow the most direct tests possible of the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation in nature.\r\n\r\nAmong its broader impacts, this study will inspired a diverse collection of undergraduates through direct participation in research projects by engaging them in honors projects, giving them opportunities to present results at international meetings, and motivating them to pursue careers in scientific research. This study also will produce shared infrastructure, including a large number of Drosophila cultures that are openly available, and a publicly available Bayesian estimator for association testing using brood-structured data. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis completion of this research grant advanced our understanding of how insects successfully reproduce (intellectual merit criteria) and made important societal contributions through training the next generation of scientists and outreach programs (broader impacts).\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nWe have gained a much better understanding about how genes in males and females interact to affect successful reproduction in insects.  We utilized variation that is present in natural populations to show that the success of a given male depends upon the female that he mates with and also the males against whom he is completing.  In addition, we have identified several candidate genes that might be responsible for these interactions.  Olfactory genes appear to be important in influencing female mating rate and genes involved in sperm storage appear to be important for male reproduction.  In addition, we demonstrated there is not a genetic correlation between male body size and mating ability.  This suggests that the environment in which the male was raised also has important implications for his reproductive success.  We also developed a technique to measure production and transfer rates of two important seminal fluid proteins.  Numerous other studies are using this procedure to study insect reproduction.  Overall, seven papers were published and 24 presentations were given as part of this research grant.\n\nUnderstanding why some individual insects are more successful at reproducing than others can provide unique insights into novel mechanisms to control invasive species, agricultural pests and vectors of human disease.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis research grant also provided numerous training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as engaged the general community.  More than 30 undergraduate students participated in my research lab during the time frame of this research grant.  Most of these students felt this was a very positive experience and participated for multiple semesters.  Four undergraduate students were co-authors on publications related to this research grant.  Four graduate students were supported as part of this research, two of which have graduated and have been successful at entering the job force.  We also engaged in numerous outreach activities to share our love of science with K-12 students.  We brought science to the community by setting up hands on science activities (e.g. DNA extraction from strawberries) during \"Binghamton Days at the Mall\" and also through \"Out of the Box Science that Rocks\" at a local science center.  In addition, we developed modules for summer campers to use fruit flies to design and conduct their own science experiments.  We have reached hundreds of budding young scientists through these programs and their reactions have been overwhelmingly positive.\n\n            Encouraging children to form questions, explore and be excited to engage in scientific inquiry is one of the most important things we can do and I am honored to have had the opportunity to interact with so many young scholars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony C Fiumera"
