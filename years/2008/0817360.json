 "awd_abstract_narration": "When faced with more salient and available rewards and temptations, people often abandon their goals and global interests.  These self-control failures, exemplified by problems such as obesity, substance abuse, and unsafe sex, are perplexing and troubling.  Despite widespread agreement of its importance, there is a surprising lack of consensus on what self-control entails, and what factors promote or impair it.  The present research proposes that, like other judgments and decisions, self-control is construal-dependent.  That is, people can construe the same object or event (\"listening to a lecture\") abstractly (or at high-levels; e.g., \"getting an education\") or concretely (or at low-levels; e.g., \"sitting in a lecture hall\").  The level of construal affects self-control in that higher level construals of events lead to judgments and decisions that are more consistent with one's global goals and values.  Dr. Kentaro Fujita of Ohio State University builds on his previous work in this area by examining the specific psychological mechanisms by which subjective construals impact self-control.  One set of studies examines how construal level may moderate the cognitive association between temptation and goal.  Another set of studies examines how construal level may moderate the evaluative association between temptation and negativity.  These changes in cognitive and evaluative associations as a function of high- vs. low-level construals should make it easier to avoid temptations and choose behavioral options that promote self-control.  Self-control failures are believed to be at the heart of a number of costly personal and societal issues.  Understanding better what self-control is, its underlying processes, and the factors that enhance or impair self-control may provide critical insight in how to address such problems.",
