 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be held at Louisiana State University, Feb. 14-17 to help integrate contemporary and future efforts in microbial biology with the vision and implementation of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). NEON represents a transformative approach in ecological studies through its ability to address questions that involve large spatial scales and long time periods. The Observatory Network is especially amenable to understanding the dynamics of ecological phenomena in response to changes in climate and other human-induced environmental changes. To better inform microbial biologists about NEON and to engage them with its research, approximately 65 individuals representing diverse aspects of microbial biology will participate in a workshop with 10-15 representatives of NEON's administration and geographic domains.  Participants will be provided with details about NEON's organization, goals and implementation, and will then be challenged to develop a set of research questions for microbial biology consistent with those goals. Participants will be asked to recommend observations that should be incorporated into the NEON framework, and to identify associated technological and computational needs. The organizing committee will use recommendations and associated discussions to prepare a \"white paper\" on options for better integrating microbial biology with NEON. The white paper will be distributed to participants in NEON and to the community of microbial biologists. Broader This workshop will include a diverse community of microbial biologists. Specific efforts will be made involve a significant fraction of junior scientists and members of underrepresented groups.",
