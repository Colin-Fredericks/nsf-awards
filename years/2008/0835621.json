 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach that integrates new\r\ngeometrical techniques, modeling, and experiments to address fundamental, open\r\nquestions concerning the physical properties of granular media and other jammed\r\nmaterials such as glasses, foams, and colloids. The hallmark of jammed materials is\r\nthat they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids. In addition,\r\nmany jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force\r\nchain networks when external forces are applied. Although the existence of force\r\nchains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in\r\nphysical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been\r\nunable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them. Precise identification and\r\ncharacterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces\r\nwill likely have a transformative impact in many arenas. For example, financial and\r\nenergy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high\r\ninefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone. Also,\r\navalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of\r\ngranular media detrimentally impacts mankind. In this work, we will apply novel\r\nmathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain\r\na quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials.\r\nThe outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to\r\nstudents from underrepresented groups. We will organize education and recruiting trips\r\nto predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black\r\nschools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the\r\nSoutheast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including\r\ndemonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.\r\nDuring informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and\r\ntechnology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups. To stimulate\r\nfurther student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so\r\nthat promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical\r\naspects of our research. To encourage close collaboration among researchers in the\r\nfield of jammed materials, we will organize biannual interdisciplinary workshops. The\r\ninaugural workshop, ``Computational Homology Tools Applied to Jamming and Flow in\r\nGranular Materials'' is scheduled for the winter of 2009.",
