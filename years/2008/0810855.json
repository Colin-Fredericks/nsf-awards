 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this project is to develop, analyze, and test novel,\r\naccurate a posteriori error estimators of the recovery type for various\r\nfinite element discretizations of a variety of elliptic equations and\r\nsystems arising from solid and fluid mechanics, including nonlinear\r\nproblems. The investigator and his colleagues plan to study two types of\r\nrecovery procedures: one is accurate only for the constitutive equation\r\nand the other is accurate for both the constitutive and equilibrium\r\nequations. Based on these recovered fluxes (or the stresses for solid\r\nand fluid mechanics), they will study three kinds of estimators. In\r\nparticular, they will study an exact estimator on any given mesh,\r\nincluding an arbitrary initial mesh, with no regularity assumptions.\r\nExactness on any given mesh implies that the estimator is ideally\r\nperfect for error control (or the so-called solution verification) on\r\ncoarse (pre-asymptotic) meshes. No regularity assumptions in this\r\nproject mean that the only assumptions on the existence of the\r\nunderlying problem are required.\r\nThis is weaker than those required for approximation theory and much\r\nweaker than those required by the current theory of the recovery-based\r\nestimators. Therefore, the estimators can be applied to problems of\r\npractical interests such as interface singularities, discontinuities in\r\nthe form of shock-like fronts and of interior or boundary layers. The\r\nsecond part of the project is to establish convergence of adaptive\r\nfinite element methods based on the recovery-based estimators and the\r\nnewly developed estimators of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nA major problem with computer simulations of physical phenomena is that\r\nall computational results obtained involve numerical error.\r\nDiscretization error can be large, pervasive, unpredictable by classical\r\nheuristic means, and can invalidate numerical predictions.\r\nA posteriori error estimation is a rigorous mathematical theory for\r\nestimating and quantifying discretization error in terms of the error's\r\nmagnitude and distribution based on the current simulation and given\r\ndata of the underlying problem. This information provides bases for\r\nsolution verification and for adaptive control of simulation process:\r\nadaptive mesh refinement, adaptive control of mathematical models and\r\nnumerical algorithms. Success in this project will provide accurate and\r\nreliable a posteriori error estimators for a large class of elliptic\r\nequations/systems arising from engineering, physics, aerodynamics,\r\natmospheric sciences, geology, biomechanics, material sciences,\r\nnano-technology, and industrial applications. The development of the\r\nexact estimator will enable error control on pre-asymptotic meshes and\r\npredictable computation analysis. Error control on pre-asymptotic meshes\r\nis of paramount importance for simulating physical phenomena in\r\nengineering applications and scientific predictions with limited\r\ncomputer resources.\r\n\r\n",
