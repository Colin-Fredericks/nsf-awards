 "awd_abstract_narration": "non-technical abstract\r\n\r\nSuperconductivity is probably the most widely known example of a\r\nquantum mechanical phenomenon manifested at a macroscopic level.\r\nThe physical properties attributed to the superconducting state\r\nare spectacular and include the flow of electrical current without\r\nloss and the expulsion of magnetic flux from the interior of a\r\nsuperconducting sample. These same properties make\r\nsuperconductivity uniquely useful for many applications. Of\r\nimportant scientific and technological importance is to understand\r\nhow superconductivity survives to high magnetic fields. Many years\r\nago, it was predicted that this is possible through a mechanism\r\nproducing a state of matter inhomogeneous on a microscopic level.\r\nIn this project, magnetic resonance techniques will be used to study \r\nsuperconducting systems for which there is evidence for formation \r\nof a new phase at high fields, including an exploration of their \r\nphysical properties, with the aim of identifying the inhomogeneous \r\nphase and characterizing its properties. This work will be complemented\r\nby investigations of new forms of field-induced magnetic states in\r\na class of magnetic insulators. Magnetic resonance is suitable for\r\nthis type of problem because it is sensitive to the environment\r\nlocally proximate to the nuclear spins being probed. Graduate\r\nstudents will engineer and carry out the experimental program\r\nunder a range of extreme conditions, including very low\r\ntemperatures and high magnetic fields. Undergraduate students will\r\nassist in the design and construction of specific components.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical abstract\r\n\r\nThe nature of magnetic field-induced phases in superconductors and\r\nquantum spin systems, stabilized by large magnetic fields, will be\r\nstudied using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In the case\r\nof the superconductors, the materials are organic superconductors\r\nwith highly anisotropic superconducting properties which weakens\r\norbital pair-breaking. Evidence exists for distinct high-field\r\nphases in each case, making them excellent candidates for\r\ninhomogeneous superconductivity in a form predicted forty years\r\nago but not yet confirmed, and for which its properties remain\r\nuntested experimentally. Magnetic resonance accommodates easily\r\nthe necessary extreme conditions, and it is a local probe\r\nsensitive to inhomogeneities. The quantum spin dimer system is an\r\nS=1 system in which the dimers sit on a layered hexagonal lattice,\r\nand for which thermodynamic measurements give evidence for\r\nmultiple phase transitions as the field is varied at temperatures\r\nT<1K. Graduate students will design and carry out the experimental\r\nprogram, and are assisted by undergraduates who will learn how to\r\nengineer specific components. Evidence for inhomogeneous states\r\nwill be looked for, from which new quantum effects are expected to\r\nemerge.",
