 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the conduct of an Early Faculty CAREER proposal writing workshop. The workshop will be held at George Mason University, Arlington, Virginia, March 12-13, 2009. It is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, testimony from previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on their draft proposal summaries. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in the mock panel. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees and ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.\r\n",
