 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract \r\nObjective: \r\nThe goal   of the proposed research is to elucidate the underlying properties of   the phenomenon, and use this knowledge to develop unique and useful   device capabilities for the THz spectral range. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nOver the last decade, interest in the field Plasmonics has increased dramatically, because of the striking new physics that can be explored and the potential for new and unique applications associated   with many of the discovered phenomena. One particular phenomenon that has elicited significant attention is that of enhanced optical transmission through arrays of subwavelength apertures (also known as plasmonic lattices). During the research program period, we will examine the   transmission properties of plasmonic lattices at THz frequencies   using time-domain spectroscopy, which offers several unique advantages over existing studies performed at optical frequencies: (i) Unlike at optical frequencies, where only gold and silver are able   to support relatively low loss propagation of surface plasmon-polaritons, a broad range of metals including aluminum, stainless steel, as well as more exotic metals such as heavily doped conducting polymers and metallic single walled carbon nanotubes, work well at THz   frequencies (ii) the transmission resonances at THz frequencies exhibit a higher quality factor than similar resonances at optical frequencies (iii) THz time-domain spectroscopy allows for a direct   measurement of the THz electric field transmitted through the structures, yielding both amplitude and phase information. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nPotential applications include sensing for biomedical and homeland security applications, short range free-space communications, and imaging. The   strong interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will serve to educate graduate and undergraduate students from multiple departments, who will be involved in all aspects of the research projects.  \r\n\r\n",
