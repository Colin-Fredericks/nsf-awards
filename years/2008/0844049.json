SSRC will organize a meeting to build on earlier international consultations of the SSRC, the International Social Science Council and its Committee on Developing and Transition Economies that have linked social scientists and national funding agencies in advancing the social sciences internationally.  The meeting will advance previous efforts by producing a report that will:\r\no\tIdentify topics for international research\r\no\tClarify approaches to capacity building;\r\no\tMap successful programs; \r\no\tDesign programs and mobilize resources.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nCapacity building for international social science is an important topic that addresses a critical issue in social science research.  Issues related to comparative and integrated modes of international social science research are addressed.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed activity involves collaborations with emerging and transitional economies to develop international research in social science.  Efforts to build capacity globally with regard to international research are especially needed in today's complex society.\r\n\r\n",
