The REU site will provide research opportunities for 6-10 undergraduates in accelerator and nuclear physics. The goal is to expose selected undergraduates to the sense of excitement and accomplishment that accompanies independent research and to provide information and contacts that can improve their chances of remaining in physics.  The students will have ample time to interact with each other, the ODU faculty, graduate students and Jefferson Lab staff scientists, several of whom hold joint appointments at ODU.  Social/Cultural activities will be organized to help forge a strong bond among the students.  In rigorously peer-reviewed projects in Jefferson Lab's state-of-the-art facilities - an environment with a longstanding tradition of mentoring and nurturing students - the REU students will be well guided to make meaningful contributions to advances in superconducting RF structures, novel accelerator design, and particle detectors.",
