 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current networking protocols have been designed with the assumption \r\nthat an end-to-end path between source and destination is almost \r\nalways available. However, this assumption does not hold for an \r\nentire class of wireless networks. In Delay or Disruption Tolerant \r\nNetworks (DTNs), lack of continuous connectivity, network \r\npartitioning, and very long delays are the norm, not the exception. \r\nSuch networks have recently found applications in challenged \r\nenvironments, such as space communications, military operations, \r\nand sensor networks. Routing in DTNs is very challenging as it \r\nmust handle the time-varying and unpredictable availability of \r\nlinks, long delays, and a dynamic topology. \r\n\r\nThis project contributes theoretical models and algorithms for \r\nrouting in DTNs with semi-deterministic mobility. In such networks, \r\nnode trajectory is either tightly controlled, but affected by random \r\ndeviations from the environment, or it is socially driven. In both, \r\nopportunities for communication can be predicted using knowledge on \r\nnode mobility. These networks, underrepresented by current research, \r\nhave immediate applications in mobile sensing (e.g. littoral \r\nunderwater monitoring), disaster management, or in campus environments. \r\nThis research develops prediction models with Markov processes for \r\nnode mobility and methods for contact probability estimation. \r\nPerformance limitations and optimal parameters for the routing \r\nprotocols and algorithms are also investigated.\r\nThe research will produce a set of protocols suitable for operation \r\nin conditions of sporadic connectivity and limited resources, \r\nemphasizing local information exchange and adaptation techniques. \r\nThe protocols will be evaluated with detailed simulations at the \r\nFlorida Atlantic University Wireless and Sensor Network Laboratory.  \r\n",
