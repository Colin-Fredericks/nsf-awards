 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project where the American Mathematical Society (AMS) to create a national program that initiates early career mathematicians into a research community, guiding them as they begin life as research mathematicians and form working relationships with other researchers.  The goal of this project is to create research cohorts of young mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time, fostering joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all research areas of mathematics.  \r\n\r\nThis project is a three-year program, Mathematics Research Communities, that would include a total of eleven conferences, special sessions at three annual AMS/MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, as well as a mentoring program and discussion network.  Conference topics will include both pure and applied mathematics areas of research.  In the first year, 2008, three conferences will be held on the following topics:\r\n-\tTeichmueller Theory and Low-Dimensional Topology\r\n-\tScientific Computing and Advanced Computation\r\n-\tComputational Algebra and Convexity\r\n\r\nEach of these conferences will bring together a diverse group of young mathematicians.  The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences.  The programs of these conferences will bring together groups of young mathematicians who are working on core problems from different perspectives, and will foster exchanges of concepts and insights that can occur more readily with face-to-face communication.  The AMS has a long track record of attracting outstanding organizing committees, a key to any successful conference, and administering them so as to maximize the experience of participants.\r\n\r\nThe conferences and special sessions at the JMM will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many years after the conference itself.  Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist, and it is this aspect of the program that has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research in the U.S.  Finally, the AMS is keenly aware of the need to increase participation of underrepresented groups, and all aspects of the program will reflect that awareness.\r\n\r\nThis project was jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and MPS' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).",
