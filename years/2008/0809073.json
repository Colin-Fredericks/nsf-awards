 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley, is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop the theoretical concepts and computational methodologies that aim to provide a quantitative description of many kinds of dynamical phenomena in molecular systems, focusing on chemical reactions. More accurate versions of the semiclassical initial value representation (SC-IVR) methodology, such as the forward-backward approach (FB-IVR), will be developed into a method that is able to describe many types of quantum phenomena, such as coherence, tunneling, and zero-point energy effects.  The capabilities of the new developments will be tested on a variety of applications, including molecular spectroscopy and dynamics on a femtosecond time scale.\r\n\r\nThis research continues to explore the development of a potentially universal treatment of chemical dynamics, including the quantum mechanical effects that are important for very small particles. This approach may improve the predictive capabilities for chemical processes that occur in solids and solutions, with resulting impacts in chemistry, biology, physics, and nanoscience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantum mechanics (QM) provides a complete description of all molecular phenomena, including all of chemistry (and thus all of biology), as emphasized by Paul Dirac (one of the founders of quantum theory) over 80 years ago.  This makes it possible, in principle, to carry out calculations to predict and interpret essentially all chemical processes, e.g., chemical reactions, molecular energy transfer (when molecules collide), photo-chemistry (how light causes chemical change), and bio-molecular processes.\n\nThe equations of QM, however, are too difficult to solve except for small molecular systems, e.g., those involving no more than ~10 atoms.  The equations of classical mechanics (developed by Newton over 300 years ago!), however, can be solved (with the aid of modern computing technology) for systems of thousands of atoms, and such \u00e6classical molecular dynamics (MD)\u00c6 calculations are now in widespread use for many applications of critical importance for present society, e.g., finding cleaner and more efficient ways to use of fossil fuels, developing better batteries for storage of electrical energy, finding more useful ways to harness solar energy, and for describing many bio-molecular processes.\n\nThough these classical approaches describe many aspects of MD well, they do not include the effects of QM, which are sometimes very important; i.e., one has the situation that QM is always correct, but too difficult, while classical MD is feasible but not (wholly) correct!  The focus of this research program has been to find practical ways for adding quantum effects to classical MD calculations for large, complex molecular systems. \n\nThese so-called semiclassical (SC) approaches include all of classical mechanics correctly and add an approximate treatment of QM effects.  SC approaches in fact include all quantum mechanical effects approximately, and usually to a very good approximation.    Though they are more difficult to apply than purely classical calculations, much progress has been made over this 3-year period in making them feasible for application to complex molecular problems.  With the latest progress, in fact, one can say that SC calculations can now be applied to essentially any molecular system for which classical MD simulations can be carried out.\n\n     Applications have most recently focused on electronically non-adiabatic processes for which quantum effects are central.  This is most relevant to photo-chemistry, an essential feature of all solar energy technology.  Being able to carry out reliable calculations for these processes is crucial for understanding experimental work and suggesting further directions for such studies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William H Miller"
