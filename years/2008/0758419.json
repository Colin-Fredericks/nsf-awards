 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at advancing resonant microelectromechancal (MEMS) mass sensors such as those used for detecting specific chemical or biological agents. Two investigative themes are proposed: (1) mass sensors utilizing array-type detection single-input-single-output device configurations which is simpler than existing array-based approaches and would allow designer to minimize on-chip electronics, and (2) mass detection using parametrically resonance sensors. Methods will be developed for assessing sensor metrics for performance comparison with traditional resonance-based mass sensors. Nano scaled material modeling and assembly for synthesis and performance enhancement will be investigated.  The development and simple single-input-simple-output design would allow minimization of on-chip electronics and enable packaging of the resonators in vacuum and enhancement of overall system performance and sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative multi-disciplinary research between a theorist and experimentalist will  advance the graduate education programs across the departmental and institutional boundaries, and address outreach at the junior high and high school levels through art, the internet, and interactive activities, all of which are enhanced by computational components.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n&shy;&shy;\n\nThe overarching goal of this collaborative project was to develop methods for improving the performance of micro-scale sensors that make use of mechanical vibration.  These micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) sensors have applications in inertial sensing, often used in guidance and navigation, and for the detection of chemical and biological agents.  Such sensors rely on the measurement of highly sensitive changes in the vibration characteristics of the sensor device that occur due to variations in its environment.  Fabrication technologies allow for the design of very small sensor devices of this type, which are appealing for a number of reasons, including, power usage, weight, and ease of integration with electronics.  However, their small size also presents challenges, since the device signals are similarly small and more easily corrupted by noise and other factors.  This project used fundamental physics and modern computational tools to model and design novel devices, and state-of-the-art fabrication and testing methods to build and evaluate micro-sensors designed to overcome many of these challenges, thereby offering improved performance of MEMS sensors.\n\nThe collaborative project supported an ongoing partnership between research groups at Michigan State University (MSU), who specialize in the modeling, design, and analysis of MEMS devices, and the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB), whose expertise is in the design, fabrication, and testing of these systems.
