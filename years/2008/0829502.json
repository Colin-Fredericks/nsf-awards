 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California Davis is awarded a grant to acquire and deploy specialized receiver/antenna units that will enable automated animal telemetry at the Quail Ridge Natural Reserve using the existing wireless communications towers. The project will also enhance the wireless communications at the UC Davis West Campus Reserve (Putah Creek) and establish a compatible telemetry receiver network at that site. The proposed system is compatible with a diverse range of available radio transmitter devices and will allow researchers visiting the sites to pursue continuous, real-time animal movement and physiological studies that would be technically difficult or impossible in settings without an extensive off-grid communications infrastructure. A key objective of the automated telemetry program at Quail Ridge will be the integration of animal movement information from the reserve into the NSF-funded Movebank database.\r\n\r\nAutomated animal telemetry systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to study animal movement, interaction, and physiology. With such systems, signals from tiny transmitters attached to individuals are detected by a network of receivers, which interpret signal strength and direction to determine real-time animal location and activity; the transmitters may also communicate physiological parameters such as body temperature and heart rate. Data collected by the network are then streamed to the web, where researchers, instructors and students have instant access. In spite of the enormous potential of automated telemetry networks, very few operational systems exist. The daunting investment necessary to establish such a system, given the challenges of constructing receiver towers, providing electric power, and building a functional communications network in a remote setting, has greatly limited their implementation.\r\n",
