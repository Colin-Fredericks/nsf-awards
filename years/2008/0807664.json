 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though their field was once thought to be reasonably well-understood, astronomers in the massive-star community are now faced with a number of new and fundamental questions about the non-spherical character of stellar mass loss. The nature and extent of wind clumping remains an unsolved problem; recent studies suggest that due to this clumpiness, O star mass-loss rates should be revised downward by an order of magnitude or more. In addition, a growing body of evidence shows that magnetic fields can influence the geometry of mass loss in hot star winds in unanticipated ways. The effects of stellar rotation on the structure and formation of disks around some main sequence and post-main sequence massive stars are still not fully understood. Meanwhile, detailed observations of supernovae reveal that many more core-collapse objects interact extensively with aspherical circumstellar environments than previously realized, and signatures of this interaction may be mined for clues to the mass-loss histories of massive supernova progenitors.\r\n\r\nThis project is a comprehensive study of clumpy and aspherical structures in the circumstellar media of massive stars and supernovae. Motivated by access to high-resolution spectropolarimetric data and using an established Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, Drs. Ignace and Hoffman, and their team, will construct simulations of variable line and continuum polarization in the stochastically clumped winds of Wolf Rayet, luminous blue variable, and O stars; in the disks and rotating magnetospheres of other active stars; and in core-collapse supernovae interacting with their immediate environments. They will also develop algorithms that will allow the modeling code to simulate line polarization arising from the Zeeman and Hanle effects from the circumstellar fields of magnetized stars. The investigators have broad experience in both radiation transport techniques and interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of hot star winds and interacting supernovae. By confronting detailed 3D models of these systems with multiwavelength and polarimetric data, the goal is a better understanding of how the mass-loss history of main-sequence and evolved massive stars can be extracted from their observation and those of core collapse supernovae.\r\n\r\nThe project includes a unique outreach program, Promoting Careers in Science, through which Drs. Ignace and Hoffman will each implement innovative strategies for improving science education and literacy in their respective communities. Dr. Ignace will reach out to school counselors to enhance science education among Appalachian middle- and high-school students. Dr. Hoffman will partner with the University of Denver's Women's College to create new entry points into the scientific career 'pipeline' for non-traditional female undergraduate students. In addition, Dr. Ignace will continue supervising undergraduate research projects both through East Tennessee State University and through involvement in an REU site program. The bulk of the 5-year funding will go to support the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher at East Tennessee State University and a graduate student at the University of Denver who will be trained in the theoretical modeling of radiation transfer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLight is polarized.  Many people encounter the term \"polarized\"\n\nwhen buying sunglasses.  It turns out that light is comprised of\n\nwaves.  We are all familiar with waves such as water waves at the\n\nocean.  Those waves bounce up and down.  But now think of viewing\n\nthe Earth from space.  Our planet is round.  It is largely covered\n\nin oceans as well.  Which way are the waves bouncing?  Suddenly\n\n\"up\" is no longer simple.  Ocean waves are perpendicular to the\n\nsurface of the Earth.  If the Earth were completely covered in\n\nocean, and the same waves were everywhere around the Earth, then\n\nthere is no direction will more or bigger waves.  Although the\n\nocean-covering Earth picture just described is not quite an accurate\n\nrepresentation, unpolarized light waves can be considered as a\n\nbundle of many waves with equal oscillations in different directions\n\n(but in directions orthogonal to the motion of the light).\n\n \n\nThe Sun and other stars emit largely unpolarized light.  But there\n\nare ways to cause light to be polarized, which is when the light\n\nhas more oscillating waves in some directions than in others.  One\n\nway is through scattering.  Scattering of sunlight by the Earth's\n\natmosphere gives the sky its blue color and also leads to polarization\n\nof the scattered light.  Sunlight that is scattered off oceans and\n\npuddles on the road tend to produce polarized light, with more waves\n\noscillating horizontal to the surface.  Polarized sunglasses allow\n\nfor the transmission of waves that oscillate in one direction, so\n\nthat when worn normally, they cut down the glare from scattered\n\nsunlight.\n\n \n\nResearch supported by the National Science Foundation for this\n\nproject focused in large part on the use of polarization for light\n\nto understand massive stars (the kind that explode as supernovae)\n\nand their environments.  Massive stars are far more luminous than\n\nour Sun and have substantial gaseous stellar wind outflows.  Our\n\nwork dealt mainly with the wind outflows, and was often concerned\n\nwith the magnetic properties of the stars.\n\n \n\nStars tend to be unresolved objects, meaning that although astronomers\n\nobserve their light, stars are so distant that our technology is\n\ngenerally unable to map their surfaces in pictures.  Instead,\n\nastronomers apply a range of \"tricks\" to probe the stars despite\n\nimaging limitations.  Polarization represents one \"bag of tricks\"\n\nused by astronomers.\n\n \n\nFor example, a property called \"circular polarization\" is a direct\n\nindicator (via the Zeeman effect) for the presence of magnetism in\n\na medium and can be used as a tool for measuring stellar magnetism.\n\nIgnace is part of an international team to detect and catalog\n\nmagnetic properties of massive stars.  As an example, Ignace took\n\npart in the discovery of two analogues of a famous magnetic massive\n\nstar called tau Sco; prior to this discovery, tau Sco was unique\n\nin its unusual properties.  Ignace collaborated with a researcher\n\nat the University of Iowa to develop a better understanding of\n\ncircular polarization in features called \"spectral lines\" that form\n\nin the winds of massive stars.  To date, the telltale signs of\n\nmagnetism in wind lines have yet to be measured, but the quality\n\nof observations are becoming better.  Once detected it will be\n\npossible to test our understanding of how magnetism is transported,\n\nvia wind outflows, from their stellar atmospheres (where magnetism\n\nis easier to detect) to the surrounding interstellar environment.\n\n \n\nIgnace also employed different methodologies for use with linear\n\npolarization.  One application involved Faraday rotation for radio\n\nlight polarization.  Ignace investigated polarization mapping across\n\n\"astrospheres\", bubbles formed by stellar winds that blow into their\n\nsurrounding interstellar environment.  The initial work focused on\n\nsimulations of polarization mapping for magnetized winds.  Ignace\n\ndeveloped diagnostics for stellar magnetism in stellar atmospheres\n\nand circumstellar disks using..."
