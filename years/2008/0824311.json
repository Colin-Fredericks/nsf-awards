Novel concepts are to integrate optically promising semiconductor materials, III-nitrides and ZnO. The proposed approaches are: (1) to functionalize the very effective optical properties of nitride/ZnO heterostructure to emit triple colors, including blue, green, and red emissions; (2) to use nanostructured ZnO for enhanced external light extraction; (3) to use highly conductive n-type ZnO substrates for vertical design which allows for the high injection currents for super-brightness emission at larger chip sizes. The proposed research will develop the integrated devices with III-nitrides and ZnO to create new level of high efficiency white LEDs. This research involves the advanced growth technologies, including dynamic control of hetero-interface layer, defects, enhanced hole concentrations of p-type GaN, and the investigation of luminescence efficiency of nanostructured ZnO. The expected thrusts are the novel white emitters which promise very cheap, reliable, and high efficiency LEDs. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The successful devices will produce huge energy-saving sources by replacing current fluorescent-based general lighting sources. This research requires the understanding of intensive characterizations of heterojunction system of ZnO and III-nitrides. Thus, the research program provides an opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students actively to involve material characterization, growth, device simulation, and scientific activities in the engineering communities. Furthermore, the educational strategies for minorities and women will be steadily conducted through undergraduate \"senior research projects\" where a small group composed of diverse senior students, including minorities and female students, will be exposed to interesting research fields. The principal investigator will participate in this project as \"Mentor and Advisor\" and will raise their interest in scientific and engineering topics and let them continue their careers in continued academic fields or in the industrial engineering and scientific fields\r\n",
