HPCA is one of the top conferences in the field of computer architecture, with an acceptance rate of under 20%. The conference addresses a broad spectrum of concerns, including micro-architecture, cache and memory system design, parallel architectures, embedded and reconfigurable architectures, I/O systems, and performance evaluation. The conference includes four workshops and three tutorials.\r\n\r\nFunding in the amount of $10,000 is being provided to support travel for 20-40 students to attend the conference. Priority is given to student authors who are presenting papers, then to non-presenting authors, and then to other students. Students must apply for the travel grant and write a post-conference summary of their experience. Grants will fund or partially fund travel to Salt Lake City and hotel costs during the conference.\r\n\r\n",
