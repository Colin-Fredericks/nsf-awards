One way to approach this question is to study why mating does not occur between closely related species.  This research will use behavioral experiments to look at the effect of social interactions on mating behavior in a pair of species (benthic and limnetic stickleback fish) that can form hybrids but normally do not interbreed.  Previous work found that social experience as juveniles (being raised with the other species) altered which species fish chose to mate with.  The project will look at whether interactions with parents or predators affect mate choice and hybridization.  Being raised by a parent of another species might make sticklebacks more likely to mate with their foster species; this occurs in other fish and bird species.   Experience with predators could also increase hybridization between species, since females become less selective of males of their own species when predators are present.  To test for these effects, two experiments will be performed. In one, sticklebacks will be raised either by a parent of their own or the other species and then tested to determine which species they prefer to mate with.  In another experiment, sticklebacks will see trout predators in an adjacent tank to determine if the perceived risk of predation makes them less particular about who they mate with.  Studying how social interactions alter hybridization will give insight into the role social behavior may have had in the initial evolution of these species.  Additionally, it will identify factors that lead to increased hybridization between these species.  This information could help explain why hybridization occurs in some disturbed lakes and inform conservation efforts.  Broader impacts: These experiments will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the data collected will be used to develop educational materials that employ sticklebacks to illustrate evolutionary principles.",
