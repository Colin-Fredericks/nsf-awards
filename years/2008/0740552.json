 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will combine photonic and materials science using molecularly engineered semiconductor nanocomposites with antibody capture layers to construct high-sensitivity biosensors. The nanocomposite will be used to fabricate high?finesse, planar microring resonators in large arrays to produce high throughput biosensing arrays. The sensors will be developed to detect foodborne pathogens but create a platform that can subsequently be applied to additional health care and homeland security issues. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research will be to provide biosensors that can quickly and cost effectively detect the more than 200 known diseases that are transmitted through food by viruses, bacteria, parasites, toxins, metal, and poisons. This research uses molecular engineering and nanotechnology to provide a bridge between integrated circuit (IC) and biosensing device manufacture in order to bring IC levels of improved performance and lowered cost to revolutionize biosensor availability and answer a market need, that is insuring the quality and safety of the food chain. This innovation research will address this need with a cost efficient, highly integrated optobiologic sensor array.\r\n",
