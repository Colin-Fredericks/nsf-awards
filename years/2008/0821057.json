 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA grant has been awarded to the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga under the direction of Margaret J. Kovach to acquire a microarray scanner and real-time PCR system to enhance undergraduate research and education in molecular biology. The instrumentation will be used by faculty and students in the departments of Biological and Environmental Sciences and Chemistry to elucidate changes in gene expression associated with biological processes. Microarray analysis offers the advantage of profiling expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously, whereas real-time PCR analysis provides precise quantification of expression levels for a small set of genes. In this proposal, these methods will be applied to model systems to measure responses to experimental stimuli to gain a better understanding of the molecular events behind certain biological processes.  Specifically, this proposal is comprised of 13 research and teaching activities by five faculty members that represent a wide range of biological research and organismal systems including: mechanisms of gene regulation associated with genomic instability and tissue differentiation in mammals, physiological stress responses in plants, muscle and bone development in fish, the role of biologically active small molecules on biochemical processes and the activity of soil microbes in bioremediation and biogeochemistry of forests and wetlands. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will enhance faculty development and student growth by enriching course offerings in molecular biology, plant physiology, developmental biology, biochemistry and microbiology through integration of hands-on exposure to advanced genomic and proteomic applications such as microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. Pivotal to the student?s education is increasing the number and variety of experimental procedures available for independent research projects through modern instrumentation. Ultimately, this grant will serve to train young scientists in cutting edge technologies relevant to post-graduate studies and employment in molecular biology and biotechnology.\r\n\r\n",
