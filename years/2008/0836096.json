 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Andrea Munro of the University of Arizona as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Munro will synthesize and study the properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (CdSe) embedded in a polymer matrix.  Dr. Munro will work in collaboration with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  In her plan for broadening participation, Dr. Munro will develop hands-on materials with associated curriculum to be used by teachers of grades K-6 in the Tucson and Sunnyside school districts.  Some of these materials may be modified for use in the University of Arizona Biosphere II for outreach to the general public.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Munro is aimed at developing better materials for photovoltaic devices with improved properties, as well as developing a better understanding of how these materials behave.  The ultimate aim of research like this is to develop better materials for solar energy applications.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Munro are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n",
