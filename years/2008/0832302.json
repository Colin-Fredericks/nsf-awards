 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for THz Application \r\n\r\n0832302 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Xi-Cheng Zhang \r\n0832304 Oklahoma State University; Weili Zhang \r\n     \r\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and Oklahoma State University propose a planning grant for a collaborative center to investigate applications of Terahertz radiation. The proposed center \"Terahertz Technology and Applications Center\" (THz-TAC) will focus on developing new knowledge, tools, hardware, and personnel required for THz wave non-destructive testing and stand-off sensing for industrial and security applications. The center will leverage industry support and enhance the impact of the fundamental research at academic campuses to the application-driven tasks promoted by the industry members.  The research to be pursued at the proposed center  will address frontier areas of the electromagnetic spectrum from 0.3 to 10 THz in a number of challenging topics. The investigator experience and facilities appear to be well aligned with this project. \r\n\r\nTHz-TAC will present an excellent platform for interdisciplinary research with broad applicability. There should be significant benefits through academic program development and technology transfer is highly likely, leading to more rapid utilization of terahertz technologies in industry and improved industrial competitiveness. THz-TAC will have an immediate impact on non-destructive analysis, a short term application (3 to 5 years) for homeland security and a longer term interest (5 to 10 years) in biomedicine.  The THz-TAC's performance plan clearly addresses the interaction with underrepresented students. RPI has excellent track records on the enrollment of female and minority students. Diversity is well addressed in this planning grant proposal. The non-invasive nature of the technology holds potential for many areas of application in numerous fields.",
