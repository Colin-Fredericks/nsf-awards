 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to increase the number of students in the Division of Science and Mathematics who receive baccalaureate degrees by increasing retention. Over 30% of Morehouse students major in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines; however, only 20-25% of the students who begin majors in STEM disciplines graduate with a STEM degree. Retention is being increased by: 1) Identifying at-risk students in their freshman year and then providing these students with skills that are necessary to overcome stumbling blocks in the majors. Skills such as quantitative literacy and critical thinking as well as academic and personal future building skills form the basis of a three-semester Scientific Literacy course designed for STEM majors; 2) Providing a comprehensive support program within the Division of Science and Mathematics that includes student intervention, cohort collaboration, automated systems for intervention, academic support and undergraduate student research opportunities, as well as faculty training; and 3) Establishing an environment in which students discover the value of team learning, thereby creating a culture at Morehouse that supports collaborative learning.  Peer Led Team Learning already has been implemented in introductory gatekeeper courses throughout the Division of Science and Mathematics. To enhance and support a growing culture of team learning, peer leaders for key upper level courses in the Division are being added, and numerous workshops such as the Pedagogy of Team Learning and Study Skills are being offered to students. These provide continuing support for students who have matriculated beyond the first two years in their major and thus further support the goal of creating a culture of team learning.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The process for creating a collaborative/team learning culture among African American male students throughout an entire Division of Science and Mathematics is being investigated. The components that affect behavioral change in student study habits from independent to collaborative learners are being assessed. Components that are being evaluated include the impact of teaching the pedagogy of team learning to students, peer led team learning, team supplemental instruction, automated tracking of at-risk students and intervention programs designed around peer study groups. In addition, continuing studies are being conducted on predicting student success and the behavioral norms of successful and unsuccessful students as indicated by the Birkman Assessment instrument. \r\nBroader Impacts: The activities of this project are broadening the participation of underrepresented African-American males in the STEM workforce by increasing the graduation rates at Morehouse College. The efforts of this project are expected to result in a model for enhancing retention by developing a culture of team learners that can be used to decrease attrition at other Historically Black Colleges and Universities and majority institutions. Morehouse is a founding member of the Atlanta University Center (AUC), a consortium of six independent institutions forming the largest private center of African American higher education in the world. Advancements made in one institution often impact the entire Center.  The development of a Cyber Village is having a broad impact on the College's infrastructure as well as the AUC by facilitating networking among cohorts and departments, encouraging student participation in summer and academic year research, and expanding student participation in scientific meetings. Dissemination is occurring through posters and presentations at local and national meetings, a web site presence, and articles in newsletter and campus publications and in peer reviewed journals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF STEP grant, \"Enhancing Success in STEM by Building Skills and Intervention\", had a goal of increasing retention of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors.  This was accomplished through creating a Scientific Literacy course for STEM freshmen and establishing a Comprehensive Support Program (i.e., team study groups, Cyber Village, and collaborations).\n\nScientific Literacy Curriculum Success: Best practices in a highly successful scientific literacy program, have been developed at Morehouse College to increase retention of STEM majors.  This program consist of a for credit, semester long, Scientific Literacy course (Table 1), that meets two hours per week with 20 academically at-risk freshmen who have a 75% probability of not passing the first course in their STEM major as predicted by regression analysis from SAT and high school GPAs.  Academically weak freshmen enrolled in the Scientific Literacy course had almost twice the retention rate in their respective STEM majors at the end of their sophomore year compared to a similar control group of academically weak freshmen (Table 2). Retention at the institution of the control group has increased by 10%.\n\nCyber Village Website and Team Learning Program: The comprehensive Cyber Village (www.morehouse.edu/cybervillage/) serves as a central location for the dissemination of student information, i.e. research and career opportunities.\n\nTo establish an environment in which students discover through experience the added value of team learning, 15 to 20 students each semester were given small stipends and then trained in the pedagogy of team learning.  These trained team leaders then recruited other students in their STEM classes and formed weekly study teams. Over 450 non-stipend participates were recorded in study teams.  In a random survey of non-leader students (n= 68), students agreed or strongly agreed at an average percentage of 94% to twenty-four statements.  These statements are summarized as follows.  Study groups: increased my understanding of materials; help in solving problems; increased test scores; increased course grade; improved performance; increased interest in related courses; led me to join and participate in other study groups; I would recommend study groups to other students; and finally and most interestingly, 81% agreed with the statement \"the group(s) reinforced my desire to continue in the sciences.\"  Team learning is another cornerstone in the scientific literacy curriculum with the potential of increasing STEM retention among all STEM majors.\n\nThe successful outcomes of implementing this STEP grant (along with other intervention activities) have been documented in Figure 1.  The activities that were introduced and developed in part from this STEP grant have been and will be sustained in part by the Scientific Literacy Center (www.scientificliteracycenter.org).\n\nScientific Literacy Center: The Scientific Literacy Center\u00c6s mission is to promote student knowledge, interest and successful pursuit of STEM majors; enhance student cognitive and non-cognitive skills needed for success in the STEM major; provide a scientific literacy curriculum that is specifically designed to increase STEM retention; promote increased student awareness of career opportunities in STEM; provide a scientific literacy assessment; and study this instrument to continue to research the scientific literacy of pre and early freshman STEM majors. The Scientific Literacy Center website promotes student success in STEM majors by providing: a curriculum with PowerPoint presentations, lectures, student activities, case studies and teaching notes; the scientific literacy scale to identify deficiencies in STEM competencies; a searchable database of 150 plus STEM occupations, as well as professional and trade organizations; and a searchable digital resource library for STEM-related information.\n\nResearch Simulation Case Study\u00c6s Role in Scientific Literacy: A major re..."
