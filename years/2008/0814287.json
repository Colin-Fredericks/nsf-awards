Sea urchins are one of the best model organisms for understanding how genes regulate development, in large part due to the technical ease with which complex molecular biological procedures can be undertaken using their embryos.  Sea urchins are also one of the mainstays of undergraduate teaching labs as they are easy to obtain, culture, view and handle.  This meeting will be the first since the publication in September 2006 of the genome sequence of the purple sea urchin and hence will particularly focus on the use and development of genomics-based tools and resources to enhance research, and also to discuss ways in which undergraduate curricula can include genomics approaches with traditional teaching uses of the sea urchin.  Utilizing curricula that combines experimental and computational experiences and a familiarity of genomics resources is of foremost importance in training undergraduate and graduate students for careers in modern biology.  This meeting brings together the world's leading sea urchin biologists, scientists with experience in building and using genomics tools and faculty with experience in creating and implementing undergraduate research based curricula.  This provides fertile ground for new and exciting ways to invigorate the sea urchin field, genomics research, and undergraduate education.  Approximately 150 attendees are anticipated, which, in the past, has provided an intimate setting for informal discussion and initiation of new ideas and collaborations.  This meeting provides opportunity for students to present their work (often for the first time), fosters new collaborations between scientists and educators, and aids in development of new undergraduate curricula. The program is well-balanced with respect to gender.",
