 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures (QSPINS).  The MRSEC's research is centered on studies of new magnetic materials and structures at the nanometer scale, with the aim of developing fundamental understanding of their properties and related phenomena important for advanced technological applications.  QSPINS is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1 'Nanoscale Magnetism: Structures, Materials and Phenomena' focuses on fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials issues in nanoscale magnets, addressing important quantum, electronic structure, nanofabrication, high-sensitivity measurements, and magnetization-dynamics problems.  Nanostructuring has reached a length scale where quantum approaches are needed, and this IRG brings a unique combination of theory, modeling, and new fabrication and measurement methods to the study of novel materials and phenomena.  The expected outcomes are new insights into phenomena and structures important for the development of novel cluster-assembled materials, higher energy-density permanent magnets, and information-technology materials. IRG2 'Magnetoelectric Interfaces and Spin Transport' employs the electron spin in a synergistic combination with novel nanoscale magnetic and ferroelectric structures to manipulate spin-dependent properties to yield new scientific concepts and achieve enhanced functionalities. Designed magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic heterostructures are to be investigated where the interplay between electricity, elasticity, and magnetism across interfaces manifests interesting unexplored phenomena, such as electrically-controlled exchange bias and magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and ferroelectrically-tailored spin transport. \r\n\r\nQSPINS's education and outreach programs encourage gifted young people to pursue scientific careers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through targeted programs, and improve materials literacy among the general public.  As an integral part of the Center, QSPINS offers interdisciplinary training for the next generation of materials scientists and engineers by providing regional four-year institutions experience and tools to improve their materials science programs and curricula, offering opportunities for middle- and high-school teachers and their students to learn about materials science, and by addressing pre-college segments of the educational pipeline via targeted outreach activities.  QSPINS maintains shared experimental and computational facilities and supports exploratory Seed Projects to provide continual revitalization of the projects and investigators and promote new interdisciplinary collaborations. QSPINS fosters interactions with industrial companies to leverage the expected scientific innovations for potential technological advances.",
