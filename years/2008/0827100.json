One is for approximately 20 graduate students from Chemistry and Chemical engineering Departments at U.S. universities, with emphasis on underrepresented groups and those from minority-serving institutions.  The other is for incoming chairs of such departments for them to develop their own respective leadership styles.  Specifically the award supports the engagement of facilitators and the travel of the graduate students to attend their workshop and the annual meeting.  \r\n\r\nThe theme of the annual meeting is 'Chemical Research at the Crossroad: The Impact of Globalization on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Education'.",
