 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will reduce the cost and risk of manufacturing nanoparticle-containing coatings. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticle-polymer compositions are becoming more important in a number of fields, including pharmaceuticals, materials, sensors and others. Current manufacturing processes to produce these particles involve producing nanopowders ex-situ with subsequent addition and dispersion into the polymer compositions. These processes are characterized by either high cost, high environmental impact, or both. This project will use an in-situ method of forming nanoparticles in polymer materials. The method involves the blending of a proprietary precursor directly into a liquid resin composition, with a resulting formation of nanoparticles either immediately or during the polymer curing process. The proposed process reduces manufacturing steps, reduces cost and avoids creation of hazardous nano powders. The coatings produced will be tested to determine amount and type of nanoparticles, and the enhancement of their performance. The production process will be evaluated to determine cost and environmental impact.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the creation of a roadmap for development of nanoparticle-containing materials by a simpler process. Potential cost savings are anticipated to be 25% or substantially more compared to existing processes. Most importantly, the attendant health risks posed by inhalation of nanoparticulate powders are completely avoided. The largest potential of the proposed work is to enable a number of nanotechnology applications by reducing environmental, health and safety risks.",
