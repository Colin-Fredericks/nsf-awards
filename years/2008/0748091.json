 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Khondaker\r\n\tThe objective of this research is to develop a novel design engineering technique for parallel fabrication of controllable, scalable, and reproducible single electron transistor (SET) devices using carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The approach is to fabricate SET through (i) control positioning of individual CNT between source and drain electrodes via AC dielectrophoresis, (ii) engineering tunnel barrier formation by bending the CNT with a raised local aluminum oxide gate thereby forming a quantum dot, and (iii) controlling the size and operation of the dot by the same local gate.\r\n\tIntellectual Merit: Controlled fabrication and assembly of SET with different sizes from 100 nm to 20 nm will be demonstrated by integrating top down and bottom up techniques. Electronic transport properties will be studied. Room temperature operation and a novel ultra sensitive quantum sensor will be demonstrated. In contrast to the existing SET fabrication techniques, the proposed approach offers parallel fabrication of reproducible SET devices using one dimensional nanostructures.\r\n\tBroader Impact: The proposed research will have significant impact on nanoelectronics, information processing, and ultra sensitive chemical and biological sensing. Continued miniaturization of Si-Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor will soon hit a major bottleneck. SET will become crucial for information and signal processing. For educational development and outreach, the PI proposes (i) development of a new graduate course titled, Nanoscale Physics and Nanoelectronics, (ii) modification of an undergraduate Nanophysics course, (iii) research training of minority and female students, high school students and teachers and (iv) community outreach through lectures, web based dossier and news letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
