 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFour-year scholarships are being awarded to a cohort of academically talented financially needy freshmen majoring in biology or bioinformatics.  Students are being recruited from areas of Virginia where the poverty rate is above twenty percent.  These areas include the rural Appalachian counties of southwestern Virginia and urban Richmond City.  The racial demographics differ; Richmond is more than sixty percent minority, predominantly African American, whereas the rural counties are over 97 % Caucasian.  Approximately fifteen scholarships are being awarded ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 annually with an average scholarship amount of $7100.  Scholarship amounts are determined by the Cost of Attendance and the Expected Family Contribution.\r\n\r\nThe scholars take common classes and participate in a weekly seminar dedicated to the academic and career preparation, research skills, ethics and diversity.  These efforts are preparing the scholars not only to be scientific leaders in biotechnology, but also to increase diversity and collaboration within the discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
