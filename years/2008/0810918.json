 "awd_abstract_narration": "Macaulay2 is a free computer algebra system dedicated to the qualitative \r\ninvestigation of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. It \r\nwas developed by Daniel Grayson and Michael Stillman with NSF funding. \r\nGrayson and Stillman will continue the development of Macaulay2. They \r\nwill upgrade existing algorithms, develop and publish new algorithms, and \r\nimplement new algorithms. In particular, they will develop the interaction \r\nof the symbolic computations that are Macaulay2's strength with the new \r\nfloating point algorithms in algebraic geometry that are now being \r\ndeveloped by Andrew Sommese, Jan Verschelde, Anton Leykin, Frank Schreyer \r\nand others. It is anticipated that these will make a whole new class of \r\nproblems accessible to experimentation and, in many cases, solution. \r\nEisenbud will organize contacts for the extended integration with other \r\nsystems and will engage other mathematicians in the development work that \r\nneeds to be done. Central to the project are the continued expansion of \r\nthe collaborations that have been the hallmark of Macaulay2 development. \r\nFor this purpose two Macaulay2 Workgroup Meetings will be held in the \r\ncourse of the two-year grant. One particular research problem to be \r\nattacked is: the use of computational systems to (probabilistically) \r\ndisprove, or suggest a proof of, the Jacobian Conjecture on polynomial \r\nautomorphisms of affine spaces (this will require the use the new floating \r\npoint algorithms). Other areas where new algorithms can make an impact \r\ninclude the study of numerical systems, fractions with specified types of \r\ndenominators, ideal factorization, systems where the multiplication of the \r\nvariables doesn't satisfy the commutative law, geometric optimization, the \r\nanalysis of observations of gene expression levels over time, and \r\nbioinformatics. \r\n\r\n\r\nMacaulay2 is part of the infrastructure that supports mathematical \r\nresearch involving systems of polynomial equations in many variables. The \r\nstudy of such systems of polynomial equations is central in pure and \r\napplied mathematics and in physics, with recent new impacts in such fields \r\nas cryptography, robotics and string theory. Increasing computer power \r\nand the availability of programs like Macaulay2 are making a new level of \r\nexperimentation possible. The experimental results found with Macaulay2 \r\nare helping in the formulation and development of tractable conjectures in \r\nmathematics as well as in physics. A measure of Macaulay2's impact is that \r\nat least 270 research papers have cited Macaulay2, several mathematicians \r\nhave contributed code, and books and course materials are now using it. \r\nThe PI's will develop the software further and will recruit developers \r\nfrom the research community. They will introduce graduate students and \r\nmathematicians to the use of computers in research mathematics and the \r\nrequisite skills in programming and development of algorithms, through \r\nworkgroups at Berkeley and through the appointments of graduate students \r\nas graduate assistants.",
