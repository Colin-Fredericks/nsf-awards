The effort focuses on properties\r\nrelated to failure initiation.  Failure is often precipitated by\r\nextreme excursions of the local fields at the level of the\r\nmicrogometry.  Three projects are carried out that seek to make\r\nnew connections between the excursions of local deformation,\r\nstrain, and stress fields as functions of applied boundary loads\r\nand initial conditions.  The first project examines load transfer\r\nbetween length scales for hierarchical structures when the\r\nsubstructure is known only in a statistical sense.  The goal is\r\nto provide new variational tools for teasing out relationships\r\nthat connect the local field response to the applied long\r\nwavelength loads.  The objective is to use these relationships to\r\ndiscover explicit criteria on the applied loads that are\r\nnecessary for failure initiation inside composite media.  The\r\nsecond project seeks to understand how field fluctuations inside\r\nheterogeneous media depend on the boundary data in the presence\r\nof residual stress.  The goals of this project are to: i)\r\nquantify the roles of boundary data, microgeometry and residual\r\nstress on the penetration of high stress zones inside\r\nstatistically defined media and ii) understand the effect of\r\nresidual stress on the decay of high frequency boundary data\r\ninside the composite domain.  Understanding these phenomena\r\nfacilitates the design of tough composite structures for use in\r\naviation and infrastructure.  The third project investigates the\r\ndynamics of heterogeneous media using nonlocal models for elastic\r\ninteractions.  The goal is to develop a multi-scale peridynamic\r\nformulation for modeling deformation fields inside fiber\r\nreinforced laminates.  This formulation provides the mathematical\r\nframework and associated numerical methods necessary to capture\r\nthe dynamic interactions between small and large length scales. \r\nIt is anticipated that the basic mathematical work and subsequent\r\nnumerical investigations can resolve new dynamic phenomena that\r\ncontribute to the delamination and failure of fiber reinforced\r\nlaminates. \r\n\r\n     The investigator develops new mathematical and computational\r\ntools for the quantitative description of multi-scale phenomena\r\nseen in composite structures.  Composite materials are rapidly\r\nbecoming the materials of choice for structural applications. \r\nThis is due to their light weight and superior stiffness\r\nproperties.  In order to accelerate their deployment an improved\r\nunderstanding of their strength properties based upon their\r\nmicrostructural geometry is required.  This proposal focuses on\r\nproperties related to failure initiation.  Failure is often\r\nprecipitated by extreme excursions of the local fields at the\r\nlevel of the microgometry.  The proposal consists of three\r\nprojects that make new connections between the excursions of\r\nlocal deformation, strain, and stress fields as functions of\r\napplied boundary loads and initial conditions.  The projects are\r\nchosen to address issues of practical interest that if solved can\r\naccelerate the use of light weight composite materials for\r\napplications in aviation and infrastructure. \r\n",
