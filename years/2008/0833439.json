 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to create a vision for transforming graduate education and undergraduate research-based education at the University of Florida (UF) to develop an integrative and interdisciplinary program that links all NSF funded student-oriented programs to achieve synergies and avoid unnecessary duplication of activities.  The goals of the project are:\r\n1.\tTo integrate best practices of training grants (NSF and other) at the UF to improve the professional preparation of graduate students in the STEM disciplines;\r\n2.\tTo develop integration and synergies where possible in research training and educational programs; \r\n3.\tTo include undergraduate students where possible in these activities and to enhance their preparation for graduate studies;\r\n4.\tTo ensure that students from underrepresented populations are fully involved in activities associated with the newly developed Program Integration Institute; and \r\n5.\tTo improve interactions among existing programs by establishing the Program Integration Institute.\r\n\r\nThe four NSF awards upon which the I3 project will build include:\r\n1.\tIGERT Program in Adaptive Management: Wise Use of Water, Wetlands, and Watersheds (DGE-0504422);\r\n2.\tScience Partners in Inquiry-based Collaborative Education II (SPICE II) (DGE-0538407);\r\n3.\tThe South East Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (HRD-0450279); and\r\n4.\tGraduate Research Fellowship Program (DGE-0802270)\r\n\r\nThe project's objective is to launch a small suite of professional development, educational, and training activities with students in UF?s NSF-funded and other STEM training programs. Based on the success of the components of the Program Integration Institute, the project will expand offerings and also increase the base of students to whom services are offered. It is the intent of the proposal to permanently establish the Program Integration Institute at the UF and have the institute fully funded by the university.",
