Chung at the National University of Singapore.  The proposed research is novel in the sense that it combines a nanofiltration membrane with tailored surface functionalization for forward osmosis (FO) application.  The researchers propose to develop the FO operation by increasing the value of the negative charge of the membrane surface at neutral pH values.  This more negative nanofiltration membrane will have a higher monovalent electrolyte rejection along with lower concentration polarization.  Development of a desalination process technology using the forward osmosis route has the potential to achieve up to a 75 percent decrease in costs and energy consumption in desalination, in comparison to conventional thermal or reverse osmosis processes.  With continued development of more efficient nanofiltration membranes, operating at lower pressures, the forward osmosis process can be beneficial for both seawater desalination and identifying a new resource for fresh water availability.   This would result in satisfying both economical and environmental concerns.   \r\n\r\nThe researchers have complementary scientific expertise in the field.  The project will combine the University of Toledo?s expertise on membrane material synthesis, surface modification and fouling resistance with the University of Singapore?s expertise in forward osmosis and membrane formation.  It is feasible that this project will develop patentable and marketable FO hollow fiber membrane technologies that could have significant long-term impact on the water supply and the membrane industry.  It is anticipated that this project will provide unique training and educational opportunities for two U.S. graduate students to obtain a global research experience.  These early collaborations between the scientists and students from each country will likely lead to long-term collaborations that will benefit both institutions.  \r\n\r\n \r\n",
