 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports data analysis and instrumentation development research as part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)?s main goal is the direct observation of gravitational waves (GWs) in order to open a new window on the universe. Its widely separated interferometers are used in unison to search for GWs emitted by intriguing astrophysical phenomena such coalescing binary neutron stars or supernovae. Many of these astrophysical sources are also expected to be detectable in other forms such as gamma-rays, optical light or neutrinos. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of LIGO?s recently collected data during time periods corresponding to detected gamma-ray burst, neutrino and optical events is the main focus of the data analysis activity of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group (GECo). The detection of GWs coincident with the observation of a gamma-ray burst or an optical supernova is a long awaited goal in the field of gravitational wave astronomy, promising scientific description of the astrophysical source that are inaccessible through other means. Even non-detections of GWs in the time frame of events observed in other windows can place constraints on the underlying phenomenon. GECo shall also contribute to the Advanced LIGO detectors, through the design and development of the timing synchronization and diagnostic systems. Precise detector timing synchronization and diagnostics are crucial to determine potential arrival times of GWs at spatially separated parts of a single LIGO instrument and at the two LIGO sites and to coordinate with events observed in other windows.",
