 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to organize the 2009 CMMI Grantees and Research Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on June 22nd -25th, 2009. The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation grantees to showcase their research outcomes and network with researchers from the Far East and Pacific-Rim regions to foster closer international cooperation in research and education. The conference will consist of keynote presentations, plenary sessions, workshops, poster sessions, breakout sessions, social activities and informal interactions, which will result in seeding new partnerships and generating cross-disciplinary research ideas.\r\n\r\nThe conference theme draws attention to the ever-changing landscape at the frontier of science and technology research across the globe. It will enable researchers and educators from across the Pacific Rim to discuss their activities and form collaborations, and will likely result in an advanced pace of research across the fields supported by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.",
