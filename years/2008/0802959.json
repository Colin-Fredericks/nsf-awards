Participants are recruited from the\r\ninstitutions of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC)\r\nand perform their coursework and research under the mentorship of\r\nfaculty at the University of St. Thomas (UST) in St. Paul, MN and\r\nfaculty at other ACTC institutions.  Participants benefit from a\r\ncourse developed to support the learning and use of\r\ncomputationally intensive methods in mathematics and statistics. \r\nThe cohort participates in a variety of workshops, seminars,\r\nconferences, and field trips.  In small groups, cohort students\r\ncontribute to research projects requiring the computational\r\nskills acquired in the course and share their progress with\r\nfellow students and project faculty.  Students periodically\r\npresent their results in the larger professional community.  The\r\nintellectual merit of the project is the result of the following\r\nachievements.  Students become proficient using computational\r\nmethods and learn to apply this knowledge to perform research on\r\nproblems whose solutions require the use of these methods. \r\nThrough interaction with local academicians and industrialists,\r\nstudents see how their computation research methods are used in\r\nother areas of research and in real-world problems.  The broader\r\nimpact of the project is felt at four levels.  At UST, students\r\nlearn how to perform research using computational methods and\r\nfaculty gain experience teaching a new course that emphasizes\r\ncomputational methods.  On a larger level, these same impacts are\r\nrealized by students and faculty at other ACTC institutions. \r\nLocal industries that utilize computational methods benefit from\r\ngraduates of ACTC schools who enjoy a high level of proficiency\r\nin scientific computation.  Finally, student presentations and\r\nsponsored conferences promote to a national audience the\r\ninnovative curricular elements developed and research\r\nadvancements made by cohort members. \r\n\r\n     Computing power continues to grow at an incredible rate.  As\r\na result, scientists can use the computer to create highly\r\nsophisticated models for use in solving complicated mathematical\r\nproblems.  In addition, computational methods developed decades\r\nago that were once intractable in practice due to the lack of\r\ncomputing facilities can now be employed to model and solve\r\nproblems.  It is imperative that undergraduate mathematics\r\nstudents at universities in the United States receive the\r\ntraining they need in order to make the utmost advantage of the\r\nworld's ever-increasing computing resources and remain\r\ntechnologically competitive with scientists on a global level. \r\nTowards this end, mathematics and engineering faculty from the\r\nUniversity of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN and mathematics faculty\r\nfrom other institutions in the Associated Colleges of the Twin\r\nCities engage undergraduate students in research groups under the\r\nauspices of the National Science Foundation's Computational\r\nScience Training for Undergraduates in the Mathematical Sciences\r\nprogram.  For each of the next five years, a group of 9 to 12\r\nmathematics majors forms a cohort and participates in a year-long\r\nprogram to learn about computational methods used in mathematical\r\nresearch and put the knowledge they have accrued to work as they\r\njoin with faculty mentors to perform research on problems with\r\napplications to areas such as cancer treatment, image compression\r\nand analysis, tornadic storm detection, the behavior of thin\r\nfilms, and directed cell movement.  Students visit local\r\nindustries in the Twin Cities to further learn how scientific\r\ncomputing is used to solve real-world problems and present\r\nresults of their work at national conferences.  Students leave\r\nthe program armed with both the tools required and experience\r\nnecessary to continue work at a high level either in industry or\r\ngraduate school on problems requiring an expertise in scientific\r\ncomputation.  The project is supported by the MPS Division of\r\nMathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary\r\nActivities, and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.",
