This award supports a workshop, attended by representatives from the mathematical and physical sciences community, to advise the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences on construction of a program to enhance proactive recruitment of undergraduate students in science and mathematics. Such a program addresses the NSF strategic goal to \"Cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe concept of an NSF program to support proactive recruitment in the lower division is inspired by the United States (Executive Branch) American Competitiveness Initiative and (Congressional) America Competes Act, both of which include as a goal strengthening the Nation's scientific workforce.  Successes in this area catalyzed by the proposed workshop will strengthen US worldwide economic competitiveness through greater recruitment of US students to science and mathematics.",
