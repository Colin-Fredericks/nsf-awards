 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the subject of algebraic dynamics.  Orbits of\r\npoints under iterates of maps are among the most important objects in\r\ndynamics.  In the study of algebraic dynamics, the map is typically a\r\npolynomial or rational map in one or more variables.  It is natural to\r\nask what kinds of algebraic relations infinite families of elements\r\nwithin an orbit can satisfy.  The PI conjectures that if infinitely\r\nmany elements within an orbit satisfy an algebraic relation, then that\r\nrelation must in some sense be stable under some iterate of the map.\r\nThis conjecture may be thought of as a general dynamical analog of the\r\nwell-known Mordell-Lang conjecture for group varieties.  Thus far,\r\nthis conjecture has been proved in a few special cases using a\r\ncombination of diophantine and p-adic analytic methods.  The main goal\r\nof this project is to prove the conjecture in general. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the interaction between algebraic maps and\r\nalgebraic equations. An algebraic map is a function such as f(x) =\r\n2x+3.  Applying the map repeatedly to a single number gives what is\r\ncalled the orbit of that number under f.  For example, if f(x) = 2x+3\r\nand we start with the number 1, then the orbit is 1, 5, 13, 29, 61,\r\nand so on.  One can also form orbits out of pairs, triplets, and\r\nn-tuples of numbers by allowing f to be an algebraic map in more than\r\none variable.  An algebraic equation is simply a more general version\r\nof the familiar quadratic polynomials one encounters in beginning\r\nalgebra, except that it may have more variables and have higher degree\r\nterms.  One expects that if infinitely many numbers in an orbit\r\nsatisfy some algebraic relation, then that relation has an innate\r\nconnection with the algebraic map.  The PI states a precise conjecture\r\nalong these lines, which he hopes to prove.  The strategy for the\r\nproof involves a wide range of techniques, some number theoretic, some\r\ngeometric, and some analytic.\r\n",
