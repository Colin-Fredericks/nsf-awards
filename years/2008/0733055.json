SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science) is promoting polar science and education among Native American and other underrepresented minority (URM) communities by adding a polar science dimension to its annual conferences.  The 2008-2010 IPY-themed national conferences are using polar scientists as keynote speakers, guides for scientific symposia, and structured mentors for students.  URM participation in the conferences is being encouraged by targeted travel grant programs. Minority students are being: exposed to role models with similar backgrounds who are leaders in polar science and can advise on career options; alerted to internship opportunities; connected to URM student social networks; and advised on effective leadership skills to navigate the scientific enterprise.  A host of supporting activities includes the use of SACNAS' Minority Postdoctoral Community as an online resource for peer-to-peer mentoring.  The project is using ongoing assessment and evaluation to improve its effectiveness in recruiting URM into polar science as well as in creating a bridge between the scientific community and the traditional knowledge and values of Tribal leaders. The broader impact of this project includes increased URM participation in polar science, educating URM on the issues of polar science and climate change on human communities, and improving URM understanding of the role of the Polar Regions in global processes.",
