 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe objective of this effort is to investigate a microplasma MEMS device that is capable of achieving efficient hydrogen production from hydrocarbon fuels.  The project will develop understanding of the microplasma-based reforming processes and will also lead to practical designs of micro-reformers for fuel cell applications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project will involve the design and fabrication of a microstructure that will generate plasmas for hydrogen production.  Major challenges include: the generation of a suitable plasma at atmospheric pressure, and ensuring its stability, durability, and efficiency.  Microplasmas, which differ from conventionally-scaled plasmas in a few important ways, are attractive in this respect.  Both theoretical and experimental studies will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team, which includes three investigators.  The effort will benchmark the microplasma approach to all other methods of hydrogen production.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in this project.  Because of its interdisciplinary and collaborative nature, as well as its societal relevance, this research effort will serve as a appealing vehicle for education.  The project will involve RIT's co-operative education program.",
