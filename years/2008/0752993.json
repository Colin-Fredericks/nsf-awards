 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moduli theory is one of the central parts of algebraic geometry, cantered around the phenomenon that in many cases objects of algebraic geometry (for instance algebraic curves) are parametrized by an object of algebraic geometry (such a sthe moduli space of curves). The past 15 years have witnessed  an explosion of activity in this area. It interacts extensively with other area: besides the rest of algebraic geometry, it has very important intersections with complex analysis, symplectic geometry, string theory, homotopy theory, geometric topology.\r\n\r\nA workshop and conference titled ``Aspects of Moduli Theory'' is organized, to be held June 15-28 at the de Giorgi Center in Pisa, Italy. This activity is meant to offer a wide view of many aspects of the field. It will be split into two parts. The first week will consist of a summer school, in which high level experts will teach five courses on recent and very important advances in the subject. During the first part of each course  he teacher will present the necessary background material, making it accessible to graduate students and beginning researchers. During the second week a regular conference will take place.\r\n\r\nThe program aims to impact a considerable number of advanced graduate students and post-doctoral fellows who will attend this program.",
