 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is attracting students to and retaining students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields via involvement with sustainable technologies in two ways. The project includes a summer Precalculus Preparedness Seminar, a summer Energy Laboratory Academy as a preparation for a later internship, placement in undergraduate research and/or industry internships, and counseling, mentoring and tutoring support through an existing Math, Engineering, Science  Achievement  (MESA) center.   A  capstone  activity  of the Energy Laboratory Academy  is  a  community  service  project  involving  photovoltaics.  Other efforts aimed at increasing retention within STEM majors include provision of instruction to strengthen skill  sets  important  in  gateway  courses  in  math  and  laboratory  science. \r\n\r\nThe  project's intellectual  merit stems from the interplay of the many interventions being employed: project based  learning, service  learning, learning  through  teaching, intensive  cohort  experiences, individualized  learning,  and  longitudinal  support  through  established  learning  communities. It  addresses   the  need  for  improved  performance  in  two  gateway  classes: Precalculus, the  course  necessary  for  almost  all  lower division  college  technical  coursework, and  Circuits, a  prerequisite  for  almost  all  upper  division  college  technical  coursework  in  many  engineering  disciplines.  It builds on past successes of the MESA center and a current STEP project (0336644) involving a consortium of MESA Centers at a number of community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe project's broader  impacts   are  twofold:  results  from  the  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  project are being widely disseminated to encourage others to try similar efforts; and  the  students graduating from the project are helping to meet the workforce  needs  in  the  greater  Silicon  Valley  and  Monterey  Bay  area.\r\n",
