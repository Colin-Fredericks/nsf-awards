 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a localization system capable of localizing an adversary that is actively trying to disguise its location in a wireless network by distorting its signal features. The approach is a proactive, cross-layer localization design that incorporates attack traceback, cross-layer traffic manipulation, and physical layer position estimation. The attack traceback aspect focuses on narrowing down an adversary?s location to the coverage area of a couple of access points. The traffic manipulation aspect will develop trapping techniques to force or lure the adversary to exhibit their true location-related signal features. Leveraging these true location-related signal features, the physical layer position estimation aspect will develop proactive and robust localization techniques to accurately position the adversary.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed project will help to establish accountability in wireless networks and will result in the development of key attack countermeasures.  It is the first to address many technical challenges in localization and traceback.  This project can also enhance the security of systems where location information is used to restrict access to critical resources. Furthermore, the proposed research results can be used to improve the accuracy of localization systems in harsh communication environments that severely distort the characteristics of emitted signals from legitimate users. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research will foster the integration of research and education by fortifying the existing curriculum with the project?s research results. The outreach component of the project will disseminate research results and pedagogical materials via education and industry outreach programs.",
