Over 95% of the universe is in the\r\nunknown form of dark energy and dark matter. The scale of the dark energy is 15 orders of magnitude lower than the energy scale of dark matter, yet they fill the universe in comparable proportions today. The dark hierarchy is repeated, intriguingly, in a particle physics hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. Attempts to address the particle hierarchy have invoked the existence of extra dimensions bringing a seemingly unrelated list of cosmological mysteries: How are the dimensions stabilized? Why are only three dimensions large? What could have driven anisotropic inflation in the early universe?\r\nThe PI proposes that the dark components of the universe are linked to these other\r\nseemingly unrelated cosmological mysteries through one simple facet of the cosmos  its\r\ngeometry. The dark energy, she suggests, is Casimir energy, a necessary consequence of\r\nquantum mechanics on a finite space. Casimir energy can push the volume of space out\r\nor in, depending on the underlying quantum fields. A superposition of fields allows one\r\nto balance the forces and stabilize the extra dimensions. The dark matter, following\r\nexisting suggestions in the literature, could be related to a lightest Kaluza-Klein particle,\r\nanother direct consequence of ordinary quantum mechanics on a finite space. The\r\nhierarchy between scales, stabilization of dimensions, as well as early universe\r\nanisotropic inflation can be understood as consequences of these Casimir energies.\r\nThe broader impacts of this proposal are that  each year one or two undergraduate students from Barnard College, a women's college affiliated with Columbia University, will be involved in this research on dark components and extra dimensions. The students will learn to solve simple systems of differential equations that describe the expansion of a higher-dimensional cosmology. A complementary aspect of her project will involve dissemination of the ideas through public outreach supported by Barnard to girls in NYC high schools. \r\n",
