 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Development (CAREER) Program grant provides funding for the development of an integrated research and education program to investigate the microstructural and mechanical properties of nanoporous thin films. The integrated, multiscale experimental approach  including nanoindentation, laser-induced surface acoustic waves (LiSAW), laser-induced thin film spallation (LiTFS), and ultrasonic holography based digital image correlation (UHDIC)  will be used to determine the microstructure-mechanical property relationship of nanoporous thin films.  In particular, the study will focus on the effect of porosity, pore structure, and crystallinity etc on the bulk, surface and interface properties of nanoporous thin films, and their deformation, delamination, damage and densification mechanisms under various loading conditions. Due to their ordered pore structure, crystalline framework and dominating role in nanoporous materials market, nanoporous zeolite thin films will be the initial focus of this research while the fundamental knowledge and the established techniques will be transferable to many other ordered and non-ordered nanoporous materials. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to: 1) improved science-based understanding of the process-microstructure-mechanical property relationship of nanoporous thin films; 2) a set of innovative experimental tools that can be used to study a wide variety of nanoporous materials; 3) promotion of processing and application of nanoporous thin films in a wide range of fields such as microelectronics, energy materials, and films and coatings; 4) the involvement of more underrepresented undergraduate students, women and minorities in science and engineering; 5) more outreach opportunities to local high school students and teachers, especially to those economically or educationally disadvantaged students; 6) a larger and more diverse science and technology workforce in the under developed regions at the Inland Empire of Southern California served by UC Riverside. \r\n",
