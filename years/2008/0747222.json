 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization between disease-causing organisms is often met with great concern despite a critical lack of knowledge about factors that promote such events or the consequences for parasite ecology and evolution. In this project a common disease of plants, caused by the fungus Microbotryum, is used to test whether hybrids are more frequent between parasites from closely related hosts, due partly to the ease of disease transmission across the host boundaries. The potential for parasite hybrids to compete against non-hybrids will then be tested under experimental conditions. By documenting the evolution of chromosome structures, these studies will determine how the genetic instability that is typical of hybrids may be overcome to produce viable parasite lineages with novel genomic properties.   \r\n\r\nInvestigation of parasites provides opportunities to study very rapid evolutionary dynamics and species interactions, in addition to being of great importance to preventing human misery cause by disease. More generally, the role of hybridization has been revealed in a broad range of plants and animals, and Microbotryum is a uniquely tractable model to study changes in genome structure. This project will contribute directly into curricular development in areas of genomics and infectious disease and to the training of multiple undergraduate students entering careers in evolutionary biology.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe emergence of new forms of disease-causing organisms is a central concern in protecting the health of human and domestic animal and plant populations, while it is also a little-studied process that occurs continually in nature through the genetic exchange between parasite species.  This project investigated the occurrence of fungal parasite hybridization in a naturally occurring plant disease.  The diversification and distribution of host species plays a major part in determining when parasite species will come together to create hybrids.   This project found that when host species, carrying their own specialized parasites, are found together in the field, the parasites inter-mate and form hybrids.  When those host species are closely related, the parasites can move between the host species more readily, increasing the chances of different parasite species meeting and inter-mating.  Even though we see that hybrid parasites form frequently in nature, it is variation in genetic and chromosomal structures of the parasite species that significantly limit the potential for hybrid parasites to become established in the environment.   In the first couple generations, the hybrid parasite suffers from significant infertility and is outcompeted by the non-hybrid parental parasite species.   The hybrids do not show extreme disease-related traits that might enhance their competitive ability, and instead they appear to have traits that are largely intermediate between the parental species from which they were derived.  This study further showed that the fertility of the hybrid parasites is recovered over four or five generations, and the hybrids exhibit a tendency to mate back with non-hybrid parental parasite species.  Thus, the hybridization may contribute as a potential bridge for the exchange of genes between species rather than the emergence of parasites that are new, independent mixtures of the parental species. \n\n \n\nThis project contributed to the education of large numbers of participants, involving a very broad range of research approaches in modern biology.  These included field studies in naturally diseased populations, numerous experiments in the laboratory and greenhouse, and techniques in genetics and genomics.  Residing at an undergraduate institution, the more than two dozen students who participated directly in the scholarly research received training that led several down paths toward science careers.  Students who pursue other careers, principally in health professions, benefit from the broader understanding of disease biology and the scientific process.  More than a hundred additional students engaged in learning activities in genomics that were developed as laboratory teaching exercises directly out of this research project.\n\n \n\nThe influence of this research upon the state of scientific understanding was achieved through publications in scientific and popular-press outlets.  Two dozen peer-reviewed research or synthetic articles were published in science journals during the funding period, while the impact through future publications and research activities will continue.   Most often these publications included student co-authors, adding to the educational experience within the scholarly process.   The work was also disseminated through popular online magazines, regional newspapers, and seminars, including by the principle investigator and students.  The project was also used to illustrate the integration of research and teaching through seminars with science and non-science college faculty and through annual high-school teacher workshops.  Younger generations were engaged with the project through presentation and experimental exercises with the local primary school. \n\n \n\nThis early career award contributed very substantially to the development of a strong research program in the ecology and genomics of parasites, which has advanced our understanding of disease-related biology as a fundamental discipline with imp..."
