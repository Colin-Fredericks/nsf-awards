The distinguishing attributes of cognitive radio networks such as cooperative spectrum sensing, on-demand spectrum contention, incumbent- and self-coexistence mechanisms, and spectrum etiquette mechanisms raise new security implications that have not been studied previously.  The overarching goal of this research is to contribute to the ongoing research and standardization efforts of cognitive radio technology by investigating crucial security issues that hold the key to the success and wide deployment of cognitive radio networks.  We are currently focusing on problems that cannot be addressed using conventional security solutions.  To solve these challenging problems, research is needed in areas that are considered \"non-conventional\" within the context of network security. These areas include RF signal identification, data smoothing, cyclic spectrum analysis, distributed detection and data fusion, etc. This research involves conducting high risk and high impact research in the aforementioned areas.  We are investigating several security issues unique to cognitive radio networks, including incumbent node emulation and security vulnerabilities in network self-coexistence.  The research findings from this research will serve a critical need in the cognitive radio research community by addressing security issues that have not been studied previously. We expect that our research findings will also benefit regulators and manufacturers involved in cognitive radio standardization and development.\r\n\r\n",
