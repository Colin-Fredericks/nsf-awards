 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harris-Stowe State University, a small HBCU in the St. Louis metropolitan area, serves approximately 2,000 students, ninety percent African American.  Harris-Stow also has a legacy of preparing candidates for careers in elementary and secondary science and mathematics education.\r\n\r\nThe HBCU-UP project at Harris-Stowe has two main goals:  to increase the academic achievement level for first year students in mathematics and science courses; and to increase the overall enrollment and graduation rates of students pursuing teacher degrees in mathematics and science.\r\n\r\nThe strategies proposed make up the Retention Enhancement Program (REP) and the Teacher Education Reform Program (TERP), and emerged as a result of a planning process supported by an NSF HBCU-UP planning grant.  Many of the strategies parallel each other for the Retention Enhancement Program and the Teacher Education Reform Program.  These strategies include student support services (e.g. peer tutoring and peer mentoring); curriculum reform in mathematics and science; enhancement and expansion of research opportunities for students, including pre-service teachers, and a residential summer academy for incoming students.  The program will be supported by a Director of Retention for Mathematics and Science who will coordinate the retention and recruiting efforts.\r\n\r\nThrough the HBCU-UP project, Harris-Stowe State University expects an increase in the number of teacher education candidates in mathematics and science, and an increase in the retention of first year students in mathematics and science. \r\n",

Additionally, students who participated in this program had a higher retention rate than those who did not participate.\n\nThe number of students who majored in STEM went from 50 students in 2008 to 198 currently. In terms of degree production, 2 students graduated in 2008 to 19 in 2015.  In 2013, Harris-Stowe graduated five African-American graduates in math (a total of six graduated that year) and as a result, ranked number #1 in the state of Missouri out of 34 public and private institutions in degree production in math.  Additionally, Diverse Issues in Higher Education a national publication ranked Harris-Stowe #47 in the nation in graduating African-Americans in mathematics.\n\nAs part of STEM curriculum reform at Harris-Stowe, new degree progrograms and minors were added:\n\n1.

Students also presented\n\nat the AAAS/NSF undergraduate research conference (one student earned first place in Genomics category and another student earned 2nd place in the math category.  Students participated in the following undergraduate research programs and projects:\n\nAmerican Society of Cell Biology, Botganical Society of America, Argonne Science REsearch Laboratory, National Organization for Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and the Chemical Engineers Regional Conference.\n\nHarris-Stowe has increased partnerships with STEM organizations including a 3+2/3 Math and Engineering partership with St. Louis University Parks College of Engineering.  Students who participate in this program will complete a math degree and an engineering degree within five years from both institutions.  Harris-Stowe signed a MOU with Kansas City University School of Medicine and BioSciences.  Students will earn a Master's dgree in Biosciences from KCUSB and a biology degree from Harris-Stowe.\n\nOverall, the Implementation grant has transformed STEM at Harris-Stowe.  There is an excitement and energy throughout the institution. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dwyane Smith"
