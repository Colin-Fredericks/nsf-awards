 "awd_abstract_narration": "Node compromise occurs when an attacker through some subvert \r\nmeans, gains the control of a node in the network after deployment. \r\nOnce in control of that node, the attacker can alter the node to \r\nlisten to information in the network, input malicious data, cause \r\nblack hole, or any one of a myriad of attacks on the network. \r\nGenerally a node compromise occurs in two ways. The first way is \r\ncalled physical/external attack, when the attacker physically \r\naccesses or captures a node, and then directly connects the node \r\nto his/her computer via a wired connection of some sort. Once \r\nconnected the attacker controls the node by extracting the data \r\nand/or putting new data, etc. Most researchers in this area have \r\nonly considered this kind of node compromise attack and many \r\nmethods have been discovered to detect such attacks. The second \r\nway is called soft/internal attack, when the attacker compromises \r\na node in a network via software/viruses which can spread over \r\nthe physical communication channels or over the air interfaces. \r\nThe soft attack method is hard to be detected and is the main or \r\nthe only reason that leads to the emergence of compromised nodes \r\nin some practical applications. \r\n\r\nThis proposed research aims at developing node compromise \r\ndistribution models and their defending considerations for \r\nMobile Ad-hoc Sensor Networks.  Specifically, the research \r\ninvolves an exploratory investigation of modeling attack \r\ndistribution that can help system to estimate the probability \r\nof a node being compromised and thus defend against it \r\neffectively and efficiently. We develop several models for a \r\nnode compromise based on different application environments. \r\nFurthermore, we develop an analytical framework to theoretically \r\nevaluate our node compromise distribution models. The analytical \r\nresults will be evaluated by extensive simulations and \r\nexperimental measurements.\r\n",
