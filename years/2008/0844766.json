The Innovation through Institutional Integration initiative challenges institutions to think strategically about the creative integration of NSF-funded awards and is itself an integrative, cross-cutting effort within the Directorate for Education and Human Resources. \r\n\r\nQEM will conduct six two-day information and technical assistance workshops for two-person teams form minority-serving institutions.  The workshops will be held in geographically dispersed areas of the country and are designed to accommodate 144 participants during Fall 2008 and Spring 2009.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe technical assistance offered will enable minority-serving institutions to develop an inventory of current NSF ? and other Federal entity funded STEM projects on their campuses and learn about the mission and key concepts of the I-cubed program.  The technical assistance will enable participants to critically examine intra- and inter-institutional opportunities for partnerships, international initiatives, and efforts at critical junctures that have synergistic and integrative potential for advancing STEM research and education.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nOutcomes of the proposed project include increased participation of the minority-serving institution community in the Innovation through Institutional Integration initiative, as well as enhanced minority-serving institution infrastructure for STEM research and education through innovative and institutional integration.  As opportunities provided by the I-cubed program are better understood and minority-serving institutions develop competitive I-cubed proposals, the pool of principal investigators engaged in integrative STEM education and research programs will represent a more diverse source for ideas and talent to improve STEM initiatives.\r\n\r\n",
