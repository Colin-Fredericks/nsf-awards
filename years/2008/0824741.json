 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current top-down approach subtractively creates nano-features but the process is expensive. Bottom-up approach manipulates species at nanoscale but systematic and large scale assembly is non-existent. The objective of this project is to pioneer a novel template-assisted nanoparticle process in order to produce large surface area materials with hierarchical nanopatterns and nanostructures. Specifically, the program aims to obtain hierarchical nanopore patterns by combining focused ion beam pre-texturing and nano-patterning, understand nanoparticle colloid phase stability and separation for large area nanostructure creation, and formulate a quantitative characterization method in three dimensional sintering for large area nanostructure preservation and control. The template will direct the hierarchy and size distribution of the nanopatterns; the colloidal phase separation and quantitative sintering characterization will offer new and efficient approaches for nano-fabrication. The hierarchical nanopatterns are expected to deliver much enhanced properties. \r\n\tThe materials to be used, TiO2 and ZnO, are the most desired candidates for photovoltaic solar cells, optoelectronics, novel chemical and biological sensors, and catalysts. The hierarchical nanostructures have direct and immediate impact on drastically increasing solar cell energy conversion efficiency and photoluminescence efficiency, among others. The research methodology has wide-ranging significance in multi-scale device integration while improving process reliability and producibility. For nano-education, the program is targeted at engineering-wise underrepresented females by actively recruiting and retaining female engineering students. Broader societal impact will also result from journal publications, conferences, and newsletters.\r\n",
