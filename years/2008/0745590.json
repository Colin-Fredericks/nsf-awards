 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program supports work by Professor Glen Jackson at Ohio University to develop a hand-portable mass spectrometer.  The instrument is designed to operate above 1 mbar (0.75 Torr), eliminating the need for expensive, complex pumps.  The design includes a robust and flexible ion source that can analyze gas-phase neutrals (such as volatile organic compounds and chemical warfare agents) or ions formed from nonvolatile materials via atmospheric pressure ionization techniques.  Resolution exceeding that of portable ion mobility spectrometers (the current instruments of choice for screening protocols at most US airports) is expected.\r\n\r\nPotential applications include national security, forensics, health, and environmental monitoring. The instrument will also serve as a focus for educational outreach, including demonstrations and hands-on experience for high school students, undergraduate students, and field-scientists through both formal and informal avenues.  Students will help disseminate knowledge of the new instrument and its capabilities to the broader scientific community by presenting results at national conferences and publishing the results in peer-reviewed journals.",
