 "awd_abstract_narration": "Necrotrophic plant pathogens are diverse bacterial and fungal species that survive by extracting nutrients from killed plant cells. Due to this mode of nutrition they cause host cell death (necrosis) by releasing toxins into host tissues. Failure to limit necrosis by the plant leads to enhanced infections resulting in plant diseases that culminate in death and decay of the entire infected plant or its parts causing significant losses in crop yield. The biological processes underlying host responses to necrotrophic infections and the associated necrosis are not understood. The overall goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to necrotrophic pathogens. Plant proteins that limit necrotrophic infections that have been identified will be used to determine the biological basis of host resistance or susceptibility to pathogen and stress induced necrosis. BOS1 (Botrytis Susceptible 1) is an R2R3MYB transcription factor that limits pathogen and stress induced necrosis. The functions of novel components of BOS1 mediated resistance including the role of BOS1 interacting E3 ligases will be studied and their regulatory role in resistance to necrosis and/or cell death caused by pathogens and pathogen derived toxins determined. The nature of cell death caused by necrotrophic pathogens and mechanisms of plant responses will be established using molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches. Genome scale changes in gene expression associated with pathogen induced necrosis and the role of BOS1 interacting proteins will be deciphered.  This project will generate new knowledge on biochemical, molecular and genetic mechanisms of plant disease resistance and elucidate some of the fundamental differences in host responses to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. In addition, the project will train undergraduate students from diverse institutions to promote student interest in plant biology. The project will promote graduate student training and education and research and mentoring skills for postdoctoral scientists in various aspects of plant biology.",

The goal of such internships was to encourage students, through this research experience, to purse graduate educations in science. Indeed,\nsome of the summer interns went on to join graduate schools at various\ninstitutions.  Further, the research approaches and outcomes are being used in class room teachings and training of students in the lab. The class teachings involving molecular research approaches benefit students through demonstrating research approaches as well as enhancing their knowledge with experimental results.
