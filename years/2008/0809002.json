 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ulrich Hansmann of Michigan Technological University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work to further develop generalized-ensemble algorithms for use in protein folding simulations.  Partial funding for this award has been provided by the Molecular Biophysics program within the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.\r\n\r\nAfter the successful deciphering of whole genomes a new challenge has emerged:  for most of the newly found sequences we do not know the function of the corresponding proteins. Reliable computational tools that allow one to study the emergence of structure and function of proteins from their sequence of amino acids would therefore lead to deeper insight in the molecular foundation of the fundamental processes in cells. Exploring this relationship in computer simulations is extremely difficult for detailed protein models, and the computational effort to calculate accurately physical quantities increases exponentially with the number of residues in simple room-temperature simulations. In order to overcome this difficulty, the PI has pioneered the generalized ensemble approach and demonstrated its feasibility for simulation of peptides and proteins of up to 40-50 amino acids. By further advancing this approach and implementing it in his highly scalable software package SMMP the PI aims at deriving models that will describe folding and interaction of stable domains in proteins (usually consisting of 50-200 amino acids). Connecting optimization of algorithms to fundamental ideas of statistical mechanics the PI is probing folding and assembly of the 75-residue apo calbindin D9K and the 84-residue tetramer BBTA2; and binding of copper ions to the 37-residue truncated form of yeast copper thionein. His goal is to understand these processes solely from the physical interactions between the atoms within a protein, and between the protein and the surrounding environment.  The work is, thus, having a broad impact on the field of biology as well as through the involvement of students, including some American Indian students, in this research.",
