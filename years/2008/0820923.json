 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation in the School\r\nof Mathematical Sciences at the Rochester Institute of Technology will\r\npurchase a computer cluster which will be dedicated to the support of\r\nresearch in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for\r\nseveral research projects including in particular: the development of\r\nnew, highly efficient, extremely high accuracy numerical algorithms to\r\nsolve the non-linear equations of general relativistic\r\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD).  Magnetohydrodynamics represents a\r\ndifficult challenge numerically due to the small-scale features\r\nintroduced by shocks in the fluid material and the magnetic fields.\r\nThe problem can only be tackled efficiently using higher-order finite\r\ndifferencing methods (greater than fourth-order), including those\r\ndesigned to evolve conservative systems, in conjunction with\r\nhighly-scalable adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) algorithms.  The next\r\ngeneration of multi-core processors are expected to have up to 32\r\nindividual cores in the near future, and computational nodes with more\r\nthan 64 cores will soon follow.  The challenge, then, is to\r\nefficiently parallelize the algorithm on these many-core systems. We\r\nwill do this by optimizing inter and intra-node communication via a\r\ncombination of openMP and MPI. The proposed cluster, which will\r\ninitially have 12 nodes (upgraded to 16 in year 2), each containing 8\r\ncores and 16 GB of RAM, interconnected with a high-speed, low-latency\r\nInfiniBand network, will model these future clusters so that we can\r\ndevelop new algorithms. This cluster will act as the central workhorse\r\nfor developing numerical techniques and performing GRMHD simulations\r\nfor the next 3 years.\r\n\r\nPartial support for this award is from PHY, Gravitational Physics program.",
