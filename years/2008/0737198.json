This project is responding to this time-sensitive need by inspiring underrepresented and rural students in the region to pursue careers in this growing STEM field. Through this project, instructional materials are being developed and implemented in three bioprocess engineering courses. The materials are modular in nature, with a total of nine modules that are being developed and distributed in three courses. The modules are being developed based on the Legacy Cycle approach for curriculum design. The curricular materials are being designed as integrated modules that build upon common themes and that reflect current developments in bioprocess engineering. Thematically linking the modules across courses helps the students make connections between seemingly unrelated material and reinforces selected concepts, further enhancing their learning. The materials are being rigorously evaluated and are easily transportable to other institutions interested in delivering bioprocess engineering courses.\r\n",
