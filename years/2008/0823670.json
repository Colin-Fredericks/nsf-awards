Sound Camera, a digital recording device outfitted with GPS mapping software, allows users to collect audio clips of their sonic experiences as they explore their cities, parks and other environments and upload them online onto a digital map through a Web 2.0 application.  They can then compose, annotate, and share soundscapes of the places where the sounds were recorded.  A Web site will be developed to expand the project?s reach to audiences not in the Boulder programs.  Professional development training will be provided for collaborators and through the Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education.  \r\n\r\nThe educational goals are to promote literacy of PSS and engage the public in personally meaningful activities that benefit environmental education (cognitive goal) and expand environmental awareness (affective goal).  The project work and its evaluation processes (by Wells Resources, Inc.) are intended to advance the field of informal science education with respect to PSS and to study how these new technologies might affect shifts in the kinds of experiences various audiences prefer to have.   \r\n\r\n",
