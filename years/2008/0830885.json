The goals for this project are to: (1) Find the issues, roadblocks, and benefits of using large scale virtual machine laboratories in both developing and existing IA programs; (2) Address these issues by extending existing virtual machine laboratory systems and developing new exercises for them; and (3) Disseminate this work to other faculty through hands-on workshops, open source software and exercised disseminated via websites.\r\n\r\nInteresting aspects of this project include the the integration of virtual machine laboratory systems into cyber-defense programs for high school and college students. The high school efforts serve as outreach and recruitment to get high school students involved in IT-related careers -- an area of national need. Additionally, this effort is tied into a capstone course for distance education for M.S. students in information assurance.",
