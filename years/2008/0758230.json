The project represents one\r\ncomponent of a broader effort within the PI's group in which lasers and coherent fields\r\nare used to manipulate quantum dynamics in atomic and molecular systems. This\r\ngeneral theme is shared by many in atomic, molecular and optical physics research,\r\nwith potential applications to coherent control and surveillance of chemical reactions,\r\nquantum information processing, and direct simulation of model condensed matter\r\nsystems. The proposed work will be performed over a 4 year period in two different\r\nlaser facilities at the University of Virginia. The first is the PI's 1,600 square foot\r\nlaboratory in the Physics Department, and the second is a shared 2,500 square foot\r\nmulti-disciplinary laser laboratory in the Chemistry Department. The experiments will\r\nutilize laser, vacuum, atomic beam, atom trap, and detection equipment currently in the\r\nlaboratories.\r\n",
