 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the workshop are to: \r\n\r\n1. Reach a large fraction of the physics and astronomy faculty in tenure-track positions prior to their receiving tenure; \r\n2. Help participants develop knowledge about recent developments in physics and astronomy pedagogy and the assessment of changes in pedagogy; and \r\n3. Work with participants to integrate workshop ideas and materials into their classrooms in a way that has a positive impact on their students' learning, their departments and their own professional development. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Physics and astronomy faculty who enter the professorate directly from graduate school or from a postdoctoral position typically have not had experience with the type of teaching that physics and astronomy education research (PER and AER) has shown to be effective. The New Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops, with a combination of plenary sessions and small breakout groups run by national leaders in physics education, introduce participants to pedagogical methods that research has found to be effective in actively engaging students in learning. Most of these pedagogical methods have been developed with NSF funding, and the workshop provides an important means of disseminating these effective teaching strategies to a large fraction of new tenure-track physics and astronomy faculty. Further, the workshop introduces new physics and astronomy faculty to the scholarship of teaching and to methods of assessing and evaluating student learning within a framework of general professional development.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The five-year project expects to engage approximately 600 new physics and astronomy faculty members, or 40-50% of all new faculty, in about 60% of physics and astronomy departments. External evaluation of the project carried out in 2006-2007 shows that the New Faculty Workshop has had a positive impact on the workshop participants' students, the students' learning, and their departments. A number of the workshop participants from the early years of the project have served as chairs of their departments, and their experience with the New Faculty Workshop has positively influenced the courses taught in their departments and changed departmental views on what constitutes effective teaching. In addition, the New Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops are being used as models for developing similar programs by other scientific societies. All of these activities taken collectively can play a transformative role in enhancing undergraduate STEM education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Physics and Astronomy New Faculty workshops supported by this project provided professional development in research-based teaching methods and the evidence for their effectiveness in enhancing student learning to 770 faculty members during its six-year funding period. Those faculty members constitute about 50% of the new tenure-tracks hires in physics and astronomy across the U.S and came from 400 colleges and universities, about 53% of the 750 institutions that offer bachelor's degrees in physics.  Based on the conservative estimate that each faculty member teaches about 100 students every year, the project has had an impact on more than 80,000 students per year.  The Intellectual Merit of the project lies in its use of use of teaching methods whose effectiveness has been established by decades of physics education research and in its team of presenters who are recognized for their contributions to both physics education and physics research.  The Broader Impacts lie in the widespread enagement of college and university facutly members across the country.\n\nThe results of an external evaluation of the project indicate that the program is extremely effective in building the participants' knowledge of evidence- based teaching methods and having them implement those methods in their classes. \n\nIn addition to the New Faculty Workshops, the project hosted two trial workshops for Experienced Faculty Members.  Those workshops were attractive to department leaders such as department chairs and associate chairs for undergraduate studies as well as senior faculty members who wanted to become familiar with research-based interactive engagement teaching methods.  Both sets of workshops will be continued during the new NSF funding period.\n\nThe project also produced a series of online video recordings of most of the plenary sessions at the November 2013 New Faculty Workshop.  These videos, constituting the Virtual New Faculty Workshop, are intended to be used by faculty members who could not attend the workshop and by those participants who may want to refresh their knowledge of what they learned at the workshop.  The videos are available at https://www.physport.org/nfw/index.cfm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert C Hilborn"
