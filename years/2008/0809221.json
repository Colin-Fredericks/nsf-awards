 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request funds to partially cover participant costs for the 11th Symposium on Study of Earth?s Deep Interior (SEDI). The meeting will be held in Kunming, China from July 27-31, 2008. \r\n\r\n \r\nSEDI is an international scientific organization dedicated to the \r\nStudy of the Earth?s Deep Interior. The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced \r\nunderstanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth?s deep interior and of the effect of that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The ?deep interior? is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in \r\nthe study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth?s deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs, etc. \r\n\r\nThis proposal will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US \r\ngraduate students and young researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program. The structure of SEDI is intrinsically interdisciplinary, providing many opportunities for intra- and international collaborations on a broad range of topics that contribute to our understanding of the deep earth and other planetary interiors.",
