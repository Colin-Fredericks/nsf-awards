 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study aerosol-water interactions under controlled laboratory conditions and investigate the dependence of water uptake on the physicochemical properties of the aerosol particles.  Various aerosol generation and measurement techniques will be used to create realistic aerosols and analyze their interactions with water.  These will include imaging of wet and dry nano aerosols with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), a cloud condensation nucleus counter (CCNC) for measuring cloud droplet activation, a nano tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA) for measuring aerosol population changes after conditioning, an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) for imaging particle morphology and water interactions of organic particles, SEM for imaging inorganics and for determining residual water presence (via a newly developed technique), and a smog chamber for generating and aging complex aerosols in a controlled environment.  Aerosols will be generated with diameters ranging from 3 nm to several microns and widely varying chemical and physical properties, from laboratory organics to ambient biogenic samples.  Aerosols will then be analyzed in real time or collected on substrates for later study.  The TDMA experiments will permit investigation of aerosol population changes under controlled conditions of temperature, time, and relative humidity.  The CCNC experiments involve supersaturation conditions.  The ESEM, SEM, and AFM allow imaging of the particles under wet and dry conditions.  This combination of instruments and techniques has never before been used in a single, comprehensive study and will allow an improved understanding of aerosol-water interactions and application of the results to the analysis of atmospheric aerosols and to aerosol models.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this proposal include research opportunities for undergraduates at Bucknell University, both within courses and in laboratory research experiences, and a service-learning component for community outreach.  Discovery learning laboratories and a new course in particle technology for chemical engineers will also be developed.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research conducted over the past six years and related to this grant (supported by its funding) has been conducted by grant PI, two post-doctoral researchers, a few MS-degree students, and numerous undergraduate student researchers at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, PA.  The overall research goal has been to better understand the interactions of nano- and micron-sized suspended atmospheric particles (aerosols) with water vapor.  This included the study of aerosol particle morphology (shape, size, and surface features) along with experiments that simulated cloud formation and growth of particles in humid environments.  While the role of common inorganic particles (like sea salt spray) is well-understood, there is much greater uncertainty in the roles of organic particles (like natural products from plants).  We have investigated particles produced from plants/trees, rivers/lakes, soil/mud, and even insects.  We also have done some work with particles produced indoors such as from cleaning supplies or air fresheners.  While some work with pure (single-compound) chemicals was done for comparisons, most of our work involved complex (multi-component) sources.  We have also done experiments combing compounds into more realistic mixtures that might be found in the ambient environment. \n\nThe primary outcomes from all of this research are:\n\n1) Particles are easily formed by volatile chemicals (things that you can often smell such as the scent of a pine tree) which readily are oxidized (chemically transformed) in the natural environment to form condensed-phase (solid or liquid) particles which then can grow to sizes greater than 100 nanometers in diameter.  These particles were formed from natural emissions (scents) given off by plants, insects, soil, and household products.  In general, if there was enough of a gas-phase chemical that one could smell it, it was able to be converted into aerosol particles.\n\n2) Most of the particles formed in our experiments were able to interact with water vapor to form cloud droplets under typical atmospheric conditions and thus they could potentially play an important role in regional cloud cover, solar radiation penetration, and ultimately weather and climate.\n\n3) The more chemically different components that existed in a particle, the more readily it could act to form clouds.  This is especially important since real particles in the atmosphere will be composed of many different chemical species. \n\n4) Mophologically, the particles formed from oxidation were often in the liquid or semi-liquid phase and thus had somewhat spherical shapes with relatively smooth surface features (on the nanoscale).  Some particles, however, were definitely solid-phase and ranged from smooth and spherical to oblong and crystalline (faceted) in shape.  Others were amorphous agglomerates with shapes that are varied and difficult to describe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy M Raymond"
