 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cereal Genomics Workshop at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will give plant biologists the skills necessary to navigate the increasingly complex genomics information landscape, and to identify and encourage young researchers who might choose plant genomics as a career by exposing them to the field's practice and practitioners. A major aim will therefore be to enable students and post docs to take advantage of emerging genomics data in the cereals. Specific problems and unique challenges exist in cereal genomics. Many of the genomes (for example, maize, wheat, barley) are large and complex, and it is unlikely that we will have completely mapped and sequenced genomes for these species in the foreseeable future. The cereals also provide the primary source of nourishment to the world's human and domesticated animal populations. This workshop will provide young students and scientists with the tools and skills they need to exploit the emerging genome data in all cereal crops including complete genome sequences (rice, maize, sorghum) and extensive EST and genome survey sequence from wheat and other grasses.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this workshop will be in exposing young students to the excitement of cereal genomics, as well as enabling more senior researchers to develop cutting edge research and curricular activities. It will also foster development of collaborations and cooperation among the participants.\r\n\r\n",
