The school\r\neducates graduate students and junior faculty on the recent\r\ndevelopments in computational methods for partial differential\r\nequations.  This topic is of major importance in applied\r\nmathematics and is key in developing a better understanding of,\r\nand prediction capability for, complex physical systems.  Topics\r\nto be covered at the intensive two-week summer school include:\r\nnumerical methods for time-dependent problems, nodal\r\nDiscontinuous Galerkin Methods (theory and implementation),\r\nhigh-accuracy and spectral element methods on structured and\r\nunstructured meshes, introduction to parallel computing and\r\nhigh-performance computing on present-day architectures, and\r\nvarious applications such as fluid flow and weather prediction. \r\nThe lecturers include Jan Hesthaven (Division of Applied\r\nMathematics at Brown University, and Director of the Center for\r\nComputation and Visualization), Amik St-Cyr (National Center for\r\nAtmospheric Research), Henry Tufo (Colorado University-Boulder\r\nand National Center for Atmospheric Research), and Tim Warburton\r\n(Rice University). \r\n\r\n     The school has an impact on the U.S. maintaining its\r\nleadership role in computational science, by equipping U.S.\r\ngraduate students with an understanding of the latest\r\ncomputational methods, preparing students to be able to perform\r\nparallel computations on developing architectures, and enhancing\r\ntheir understanding of the important role that mathematical\r\nmodeling and simulations plays in science.  The summer school is\r\nheld just prior to the thematic year-long program on\r\nComputational Geosciences at NCAR, and thus prepares graduate\r\nstudents and junior faculty to participate more beneficially in\r\nthis program.  This project also has a large impact on math and\r\nscience education in Wyoming, as some of the speakers and\r\nparticipants are guest lecturers at the local workshop \"Thinking\r\nand Doing Math and Science with Engineering,\" a program that\r\npresents Wyoming K-12 math and science teachers with feasible\r\nways to make mathematics and science more pertinent and exciting\r\nto their students.",
