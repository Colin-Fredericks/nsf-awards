 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective coordination is necessary for social interactions as varied as conversation among friends, driving and walking in high-traffic areas, playing sports and working in teams. This project distinguishes between two types of coordination  -tacit and explicit coordination while distinguishing matching from mismatching problems. In matching, it is mutually beneficial for actors to choose the same action. Conversely, in mismatching, it is mutually beneficial for actors to choose different actions (e.g., divisions of labor in work teams). Matching and mismatching are expected to foster different interpersonal impression and feelings.  These expectations are based on a model that integrates social categorization theory and the concept of focal points from behavioral economics. The proposed work uses a combination of computational modeling and empirical studies. This project will explore 1) how people use social knowledge to coordinate tacitly with others; 2) how successful matching and mismatching emerges over repeated interactions; and 3) how coordination success on matching and mismatching problems affect subsequent interpersonal impressions and team performances.  The planned experiments will examine the conditions under which coordination does and does not foster cohesion. Ultimately, the PIs plan to : a) model the effects of task and social factors and decision rules on the development of coordinated matching and mismatching, b) use the modeling results to design efficiently empirical studies with live participants, and c) refine the computational model based on the empirical findings.  Findings from the proposed research should contribute to both economic and psychological theorists. The use of a psychologically-themed simulation to represent theoretical assumptions and to derive predictions is both novel and exemplary.",

Bob assumes that his wife fed the dog before she left earlier.  Bob\u00c6s wife knew he had to meet a business associate for breakfast and surely she would have anticipated that he would have been too rushed to feed the dog.  As he boards the train, he remembers that he agreed to meet at the coffee shop next to his office building but there are three coffee shops nearby.  His associate is always early and he guesses that she will have already gone to the one directly across the street from the main entrance. \n\nAs the foregoing scenario illustrates, the consequences of one\u00c6s action or decision frequently depend on what others do.  Not feeding the dog if Bob\u00c6s partner had and going to the same coffee shop as the business associate are good outcomes, but failures to coordinate in either case would not be desirable.

Mismatching coordination problems are those that require the agents to choose different actions for successful coordination as in the feeding-the-dog example.\n\nSeveral studies demonstrated that matching and mismatching elicit different patterns of downstream social consequences.

For example, we have shown that people tend to take the perspective of a person who decides first even when that person\u00c6s actual decision is unknown (as in the business meeting example) and the person deciding first assumes that the others will correctly anticipate her decisions.\n\nEven against the backdrop of much information about one\u00c6s partner, coordination tasks still affected perceptions.
