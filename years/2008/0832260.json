The project is designed to strengthen the financial management, assessment, and evaluation of TCUP-funded projects; improve the capabilities of STEM faculty to better integrate culture into the curriculum as well as improve their mentoring/advising skills; and provide professional development opportunities in Washington, DC, for STEM faculty and students at TCUP grantees. To facilitate achieving these goals, QEM will conduct two workshops for STEM faculty, two workshops for TCUP Project staff, offer an annual nine-month fellowship for a STEM faculty who would be based at NSF, and provide ten-week summer internships for five students each year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFrom 2008 to 2013, the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, with support from National Science Foundation (NSF) Award #0832260, provided intensive professional development for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) faculty, staff, and students at the Nation\u00c6s Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs).  QEM\u00c6s project was designed to further the goals of the Foundation\u00c6s Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) in an effort to impact STEM educational experiences for Native American students nationwide.  QEM provided opportunities for professional development through a series of workshops for faculty and staff from TCUs, faculty fellowships at NSF, and summer internships in Washington, DC for undergraduate students from TCUs.\n\nSince the project\u00c6s start in 2008, QEM has conducted six workshops for STEM faculty and staff at TCUP-supported institutions, as well as additional workshops that have allowed faculty from TCUP institutions to participate.  Workshops focused on: professional development of STEM students; integrating Native culture into the curriculum content and instruction for STEM courses; proposal information and development; fundamentals of education research; assessment and evaluation of TCUP projects; and enhancing STEM research at TCUP institutions.\n\nQEM produced two publications through support from this grant.  The first one, Scholarly Guideposts for TCUP Faculty, was published in April 2011 in an effort to provide STEM faculty and staff at TCUs, Alaska Native-serving and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions the opportunity to share their knowledge of STEM teaching and outreach with each other and the broader STEM community.\n\nThe second report, Promising Practices in STEM Education and Research at Institutions Supported through the National Science Foundation\u00c6s Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, was completed in October 2012.  The report described activities or procedures that have produced outstanding results and thus might be adapted to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and/or innovation in similar situations at other institutions.\n\nThrough this project, two faculty members from TCUP institutions participated in six-month science policy-focused Faculty Fellowships at the National Science Foundation headquarters, based in Arlington, Virginia.  The fellows learned firsthand how NSF functions, how to help shape programs and policies, and how to help ensure that STEM faculty at TCUs are included in the pool of potential reviewers and are aware of other STEM funding opportunities at NSF.  Fellows engaged in relevant research, such as conducting a survey of mathematics programs at TCUs to better understand the strengths and needs of programs serving Native American students.\n\nFrom Summer 2009 to Summer 2013, twenty-two (22) students from TCUs or Hawaiian-serving institutions participated in a ten-week Science Education-focused Summer Internship Program in Washington, DC.  Nineteen (19) of those students completed the entire ten-week program.  The interns engaged in research projects pertaining to STEM education among Native Americans; were exposed to information about science and education policies that affect groups underrepresented in STEM fields; and were able to interact with STEM and education professionals from organizations such as the American Society for Engineering Education, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Science Foundation.\n\nThe TCUP Summer Internship Program provided the students with opportunities for professional development through presentations and activities focused on skills development (i.e., writing, presentation, computer, networking, and time management), pathways to STEM careers, professionalism and ethics, research, leadership, and community outreach.  Additionally, interns were able to broaden their experiences through visits to museums and other sites, as well as through externship assignments at various agencies including the U.S. De..."
