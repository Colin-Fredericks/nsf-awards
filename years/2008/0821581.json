 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at Hamilton College will acquire a computer and disk space system with this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. It will serve the computational needs of a consortium of users. The consortium known as the Molecular Education and Research Consortium in Undergraduate computational chemistRY (MERCURY) consists of George Shields (Hamilton College), Maria Gomez (Mount Holyoke College), Carol Parish (University of Richmond), Marc Zimmer (Connecticut College), Maria Nagan (Truman State University), Tricia Shepherd (Westminster College), Gl\u00eanisson de Oliveira (Rhode Island College), Micah Abrams (University of Central Arkansas), Mauricio Cafiero (Rhodes College), Kelling Donald (University of Richmond), Becky Eggimann (Wheaton College), Karl Kirschner (Hamilton College), Daqing Gao (Queensborough Community College of CUNY), and Eric Patterson (Truman State University).  The requested instrumentation will be shared among the MERCURY Consortium to investigate problems using techniques common to the theoretical and computational chemistry community.\r\n\r\nThis computer will provide enabling computational technology to understand the properties of matter.  The research projects undertaken will utilize computational tools to solve significant problems in atmospheric, biological, inorganic, materials, organic, and physical chemistry.  The research will be largely conducted by a diverse body of undergraduates who will receive valuable training using up-to-date computer hardware and computational techniques.\r\n",
