 "awd_abstract_narration": "With widespread attempts to apply data mining methods to real life\r\nproblems, there is an increasing realization that real life data is\r\noften multi-relational, involving observations connecting multiple\r\nentities through a set of relations. A central problem in several\r\napplications involving multi-relational data is to simultaneously find\r\nclusters of objects across related entities, e.g., customer clusters\r\nand related product clusters in e-commerce, movie clusters and related\r\nuser clusters in recommendation systems, communities and shared\r\ncontent in social networks, etc.  The key novel aspect is that the\r\nclustering of objects in an entity, such as the set of movies or\r\nusers, depends on its relationships with objects in other entities,\r\ne.g., users are similar if they like similar movies, and vice versa.\r\nThe primary goal of of this project is to develop a unified\r\nstatistical approach to multi-relational clustering and related\r\nproblems in multi-relational data analysis.  Towards this end, the\r\nproject investigates a family of novel statistical multi-relational\r\nmixture models, with focus on additive and multiplicative models for\r\nmulti-relational clustering. Due to modularity of design, both\r\nadditive and multiplicative models can incorporate domain specific\r\nsemantics as well as automatic model selection using appropriate\r\nBayesian priors.  Further, the project investigates efficient\r\nvariational inference methods appropriate for discovering latent\r\nmulti-relational clusters.\r\n\r\nThe project significantly empowers the knowledge discovery component\r\nof data mining. Crucial clues to understanding observed data in\r\nseveral disciplines, including social, biological, and information\r\nsciences, are often spread across multiple related observations. The\r\nproject enables a statistical approach to detecting latent structure\r\nin such multi-relational data, which is an important step towards\r\nknowledge discovery from multiple related data sources. The project\r\nplays an important role in developing closer collaboration across\r\ndisciplines and broaden participation in computer science.  Building\r\non the increasing awareness regarding the ubiquity of multi-relational\r\ndata, the project contributes to the development of appropriate\r\neducational material for the next generation work-force.
