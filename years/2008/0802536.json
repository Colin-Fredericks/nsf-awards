 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stark State College of Technology leads a regional partnership dedicated to fuel cell technology education.  The mission of the Great Lakes Fuel Cell Education Partnership is to provide leadership in creating innovative fuel cell-related education and training programs through curriculum development and enhancement; professional development; and partnerships with high schools, institutions of higher education, businesses and government entities.  \r\n\r\nThe main objective is to meet the future workforce needs of the fuel cell industry in the region, including (but not limited to) Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and Indiana.  The Partnership's goals are to: 1) aggregate and evaluate innovative solutions for advancing fuel cell education and training in collaboration with high schools and undergraduate education entities, top research universities, business and industry, government agencies and professional societies; 2) research and define essential technical skills to advance workforce development in fuel cell-related technologies and promote the creation of additional jobs; and 3) serve as a clearinghouse to share proven curriculum materials and foster public understanding of fuel cell technologies, the hydrogen-related economy and the importance of developing alternative energy sources.  \r\n\r\nStark State College is joined in this effort by education institutions in Ohio, New York, Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania.  Partners include the Ohio Department of Education, Hocking College, Case Western Reserve University, Kent State University, University of Akron and University of Toledo (Ohio); Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (New York); Lansing Community College and Kettering University (Michigan); Vincennes University (a two-year college) and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (Indiana); and Penn State University (Pennsylvania).  Fuel cell industry, business and government organizations include Plug Power Inc. and ENrG Inc. (New York); and GM-Powertrain, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems (US) and Graftech (Ohio).",
