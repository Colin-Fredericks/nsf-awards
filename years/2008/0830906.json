Major activities include: (1) to review the technical details of individual research efforts in the areas of water reuse and specifically in the treatment of olive oil wastewater for agricultural reuse, (2) to review results of bench-scale studies of olive oil treatment at the Egyptian National Research Center and to study the potential of using the center for long-term research collaboration, and (3) to assess research progress of utilizing free radical chemistry as an advanced oxidation process for wastewater treatment.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop is a continuation of two previous workshops held in Jordan in December 2006 and in Egypt in May 2007. The workshop held in 2007 was funded in part by NSF.  The workshop will be held on Friday afternoon, Dec. 5, 2008 in the Conference Center at University of California, Irvine. The participants will have participated in the 2008 International Water Conference which will be held at UC Irvine, Dec. 1 - 5, 2008 (ending at noon). During the Conference there will be a session(s) that will focus on various aspects of water treatment and water reuse and the participants will be presenting papers in those sessions. The workshop Proper will occur after the Conference and be open to anyone who attended the conference and that is interested in this activity. The focus will be to establish path to future research and collaboration.",
