 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robotics and GPS/GIS in 4-H: Workforce Skills for the 21st Century is a-five year scale-up project to use 4-H clubs to prepare middle school youth for the STEM workplace.  The project builds on and extends an existing research-based ITEST project by developing and testing new national curricula to introduce basic technology skills, foster problem solving and inquiry skills, and encourage teamwork.  A professional development model to support youth learning of concepts focused on information and communications technology is designed and delivered to adult volunteers, after-school educators, and parents.  The participation of girls and underrepresented populations is broadened through opportunities for collaboration and social networking and infusing cultural awareness within the project deliverables.  The impact of these activities on youth STEM literacy, attitudes and workplace skills is documented.  Research is performed to better understand how hands-on, inquiry-based robotics and GPS/GIS activities presented in an informal learning environment can effectively interest and prepare youth for the STEM workforce.  Research questions include measures of how educational robotics interventions impact youth STEM literacy, workforce skills, and attitudes about STEM content.  The research also investigates the use of the 4-H robotics curriculum to positively impact instructional practice of informal educators, their STEM content knowledge and their confidence.",

In addition, the project applied and tested the fundamentals of the scaling framework developed by Corburn (2003) and Dede (2006).  The guiding principle of the scaling framework is that scaling efforts need to avoid replicating an intervention that worked locally without taking into consideration the variations and complexities of new locations.  Addressing the variation and complexities of a new target population or setting, by carefully reflecting on scale, can lead to a better understanding of what is needed to make a difference in teaching and learning for a wider or larger context.   Coburn (2003) provided a basic framework for scale-up and suggested that scale-up is indeed more than increasing the number of participants, educators, and sites.\n\nOverall the scaling framework was successfully applied to the GEAR-Tech-21 project as the project moved from a statewide initiative to a national program.
