The proposed center intends to focus on innovation and mass-production of advanced polymer composite members and subsystems and integrate them into infrastructural systems through advanced construction methods such as rapid-modular deployment.  Development of lighter materials and modular construction and re-construction will enhance disaster response and recovery both domestically and abroad.  CICI will address the challenge of making these materials viable for commercial application through the combined intellects of academia and industry.  CICI will integrate scientific endeavors complementing WVU and RU strengths to advance the composite knowledge base and applications, with education modules development to train both present and future engineers.  \r\n \r\nThe proposed activities of the center will enhance the international competitiveness of the American industry in the area of composites including modular construction.  The nation as a whole would benefit as composite use would, in general, lead to structures of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost, new job opportunities and creation of new industrial sectors.  The proposed projects of CICI will provide the intellectual tools to reshaping the infrastructure as well as train the skilled practitioners for designing the materials and structures required. Through the various mechanisms available at each university, CICI plans to recruit graduate students from under-represented groups, including minorities and women to broaden their participation in engineering.  \r\n\r\n",
