 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to develop highly reproducible, highly selective, and miniaturized sensitive electrical DNA sensing platform, it is important to develop and study sensor-biological interface that is compatible with microfabrication processing and also provide the requisite sensitivity and stability when exposed to biological environments. Recent developments in Carbon-MicroElectroMechanical Systems and Carbon-NanoElectroMechanical Systems have led to simple fabrication techniques that result in novel micro/nano-scale carbon structures with high-aspect-ratio and high surface area. The research objective of this award is to advance fundamental research in the use of pyrolyzed carbon as a bio-sensing electrode material by testing and engineering various types of carbon electrodes with high surface areas and different arrangements, developing methods of increasing the surface immobilization efficiency of bio molecules, engineering techniques for bio molecules immobilization on polymer/carbon interfaces,  and further understanding fundamental chemical and electrochemical phenomena occurring at or near bio/carbon or bio/polymer/carbon interfaces. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity to create next generation highly sensitive and highly selective inexpensive portable biosensors. This research will broaden the participation of women and minority students in science and engineering, and also foster interdisciplinary interactions with students (especially Hispanic minority students). The research results will be broadly disseminated to enhance scientific and technological understanding through presentation at conferences and publication in journals. In this project, we will effect graduate and undergraduate education and try to raise the awareness in state-of-arts MEMS device and biotechnology for elementary and high school students in local area. Newly developed technique will be highlighted in graduate courses. \r\n",
