The project nurtures interest in optics, electronics, computer hardware and software, while building the intellectual, communication and personal skills needed for success in the STEM workforce. NCSU researchers from Physics, Engineering, Distance Learning and Education will partner with The Science House (at NCSU) and industry leaders to develop, implement, and evaluate the activities. Students and teachers will participate in hands-on and virtual learning, career and personal counseling, and field experiences at universities and Research Triangle Park, a Center for technological innovation. The project will engage parents to be effective champions for students by offering information about college-funding resources, college entrance requirements, and connections between coursework and career opportunities. \r\n\r\n",
