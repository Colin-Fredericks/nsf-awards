 "awd_abstract_narration": "More hydrocarbon enters the atmosphere as isoprene emitted from plants than from any other single source. Isoprene emission is affected by weather and its emission can protect leaves from short high temperature episodes. However, isoprene also participates in atmospheric chemistry leading to ozone, and possibly aerosols, particles that adversely affect human health. Isoprene emission varies widely among plants, with some species emitting much larger amounts than other species. This research will use molecular biology tools to determine the methods plant cells use to control the synthesis of isoprene. The research will also address why some plants make isoprene while others do not, how plants gain the ability to make isoprene, and how weather affects the biochemical reactions in plant cells that lead to the synthesis of isoprene. Regulation of enzymes found to be important in isoprene synthesis will be investigated by using bacteria to express those enzymes. The study organism for most of the research will be the model tree species black poplar (Populus trichocarpa) whose genes have been fully sequenced. This research will provide information needed to know how to manipulate isoprene emission from trees, whether we want to make some trees stop making isoprene to protect the atmosphere or if we want to make some crops make it to protect them against high temperature damage.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Isoprene research is important because it contributes to understanding atmospheric reactions including the production of ozone and aerosols, both of which have significant effects on human health. This research will be used to attract undergraduate students to research. High school students will participate through the Summer Science Institute, which is a seven week residential program. About 70% of its participants are students from groups underrepresented in scientific research. Isoprene research is generally interesting to students and they like the connection to real-world problems.\r\n\r\n",
