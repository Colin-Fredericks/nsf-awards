 "awd_abstract_narration": "EMT/QIS: GaAs hole spins as qubits: Eliminating hyperfine interaction-induced\r\ndecoherence\r\nQuantum Computing is an emerging area of science and engineering. Its broad goal\r\nis to harness the superposition of quantum states for computing purposes. The elementary\r\nbuilding block of a quantum computer is the quantum bit (qubit). Quantum bits have been\r\ndemonstrated in a wide variety of systems ranging from trapped ions, to electron spins in\r\nsemiconductors, to superconductors. In order to be useful, a qubit must be properly\r\ninitialized, measured, and coupled to other qubits. The quality of a qubit is characterized\r\nby a lifetime (T1) and a coherence time (T2). These time scales vary by several orders of\r\nmagnitude from one system to another (e.g. trapped ion versus superconducting qubits).\r\nIt is therefore customary to quote a quality factor, Q, which is the ratio of the coherence\r\ntime to the typical gate operation time.\r\nWe will build qubits based on hole spins in GaAs nanometer-size quantum dots.\r\nHole spins are promising candidates since the hole wavefunctions have p-like orbitals. As\r\na result, hyperfine interactions with the host crystal nuclei are expected to be negligible,\r\nleading to spin coherence times approaching the hole spin lifetime of 300 microseconds.\r\nTaking into account the typical gate operation time of ~150 ps, a hole spin qubit, if\r\nrealized, could have a quality factor of nearly 2 million, well beyond the threshold for\r\nfault tolerance. The primary goal of this project is to accurately measure, and determine\r\nwhat limits, the quantum coherence times of hole spins in GaAs quantum dots.",
