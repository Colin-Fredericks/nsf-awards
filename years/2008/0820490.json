 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broad geographic patterns of diversity are well documented for many groups of species, but the mechanisms that create those patterns are not well understood. This project addresses the challenging question of why some regions support unusually high numbers of species by studying a highly diverse group of Andean hummingbirds. Information on geographic range, morphology, ecology, and evolutionary relatedness will be gathered for species that comprise local hummingbird communities. These data will then be analyzed in the context of gradients in habitat and climate, linking traditional approaches to studying spatial variation in diversity with an understanding of the species' evolutionary history. This research will extend existing theory and methods used to evaluate how the composition and genetic relatedness of species change across environmental gradients, enhancing understanding of factors that generate and maintain diversity. \r\nBroader impacts of this project include contributions to training the next generation of scientists, development of tools for studying biological diversity, and enhancing international research collaboration and capabilities. Graduate students and undergraduate interns will be trained in the study of hummingbirds and the use of computer models to study patterns of diversity. New theory and methods will have application to other ecosystems in which mechanisms that contribute to high species diversity are not well understood. Finally, educational activities are aimed at providing researchers in Andean regions with tools to study and manage biodiversity.\r\nThis award is funded in part by the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
