This proposal requests support for travel and meeting costs for an American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on Shallow Mantle Composition and Dynamics to be held September 22 to 26, 2008, at the Mount Shasta Resort, Mount Shasta, California (http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/2008/ccall/). This will be the fifth International Orogenic Lherzolite Conference, with previous conferences held near the peridotite massifs of Lanzo (N Italy, 1990), Ronda (Spain, 1995), Finero (N Italy, 1999), and Horoman (Japan, 2002). The year 2008 marks the 31st anniversary of the 1977 Chapman Conference on Partial Melting in the Earth?s Upper Mantle held in the Josephine peridotite, one of two field trip locales for the current meeting. This venue was selected as a result of unanimous request of the participants at the previous Conference in this series.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The overall objective of these meetings is to assemble specialists in studies of peridotite massifs and upper mantle processes for a field conference, where recent results and key outcrops can be discussed in a group setting. This conference will incorporate a broader range of topics than previously, and includes influential scientists in rock mechanics and low-temperature alteration processes in the organizing committee to ensure that this is a success. Topics to be covered will include melting processes, melt transport, metasomatism, localized and regional deformation, formation and nature of plate boundaries, mechanisms of intermediate depth earthquakes, and both geochemistry and physical processes of low temperature alteration. An attendance of between 80 and 120 international scientists is anticipated, including ~20% graduate students and post doctoral researchers.",
