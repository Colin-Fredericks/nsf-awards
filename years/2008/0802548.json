 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Capitol Region Information Technology Professional Development (PRODEV) project uses an innovative 2000 hour internship program to prepare workers and prospective workers to meet the needs of the region's growing information technology (IT) industry.  Lansing Community College, in partnership with the local information technology industry group (LINC), is providing an information technology apprenticeship initiative that enables information technology students to get the industry-based technical experiences that puts them on a fast-track to become the experienced skilled employees that local employers urgently need. PRODEV is aligned with the recommendation of Capital Area Michigan Works Information Technology Advisory Committee from April 2007. \r\n\r\nRecent reports predict that the IT industry in the Capital Region area needs to add nearly 1,300 jobs (14% growth) in the next 5 years, resulting is a severe shortage of high-skilled IT workers, especially those with at least associate degrees plus practical training. PRODEV meets those needs by proving registered IT students with apprenticeship opportunities that give them a degree and 2000 hours of practical experience.",
