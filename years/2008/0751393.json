 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The past two decades have seen a surging interest in the\r\nexploration and exploitation of stimulus-responsive polymers, i.e. macromolecular\r\nmaterials which, usually reversibly, change at least one of their key properties in response\r\nto an external stimulus such as such as a change in temperature, pH, ionic strength,\r\nsolvent, and irradiation with light or electric fields. The possibility to program them with\r\ndesired functions clearly distinguishes stimulus-responsive polymers from other\r\nadvanced materials with 'traditional' functional characteristics. Demonstrated or targeted\r\nhigh-level functions such as perception, judgment, movement, and recognition, have\r\ntriggered the inaccurate but rather descriptive use of the term 'intelligent materials'. The\r\ncombination of fundamental scientific curiosity on the one hand and the broad\r\ntechnological opportunities that promise to impact virtually all areas of life on the other\r\ndefine the increasing interest in these materials. The goal of this symposium is to bring\r\ntogether established experts, scientists at the beginning of their careers, and students from\r\ndifferent disciplines, to share most up-to-date and important research focused on the\r\ndesign, synthesis, processing and application of stimuli-responsive polymers. Four halfday\r\noral sessions with about 30 talks will concentrate on (1) Mechanoresponsive\r\nMaterials; (2) Responsive Polymers for Bio-Applications; (3) Polymers with Unusual\r\nSensing Capabilities; and (4) Polymers that Respond to Electromagnetic Radiation.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT: All of the funds awarded from NSF will be used to facilitate\r\nsymposium attendance by faculty members that are at the beginning of their careers (and\r\ntheir students) and who might otherwise not be able to attend. Priority will be given to\r\nparticipants who would like to give oral presentations and from groups that are\r\nunderrepresented in STEM disciplines.",
