This conference is the premier venue for disseminating research findings for India's thermal sciences and engineering community.  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers co-sponsors this event to enhance interactions between Indian and US thermal sciences researchers.  The interactive workshops in six topical areas are designed promote discussion about the next-generation of thermal challenges and seed corresponding Indo-US research collaborations in those areas of mutual interest.  \r\n\r\nThe US delegation includes 13 senior scientists, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 9 graduate students.  The workshops, which target fundamental areas in heat and mass transfer, are expected to enhance US-India cooperation on future thermal technologies, share information and build institutional bridges, and promote educational and cross-cultural experiences for all participants.  US delegates include women and members from under-represented groups who are early-career faculty, graduate students, or senior researchers.  The report on the workshops and conference will be disseminated through a website so that heat transfer researchers worldwide will be able to access this information.  In U.S., the results of the India conference and workshops will be reported to a larger audience at the next major Heat Transfer Conference held in the U.S.    \r\nFunding for this workshop is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
