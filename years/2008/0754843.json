 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\n The focus of the Berkeley CS REU site will be computer science projects that show clearly how the research solves important problems for our society. Information technology represents one of the most critical technological developments of our era. In this context, the CSIS REU site will bring students together in computational and systems biology, graphics and multimedia, cyber-security, reliable, adaptive and distributed systems, and information technology for developing nations.REU students will be required to understand and report on specific applications of their research for the betterment of humankind. For example, REU students working in the area of cyber- security will deal with the social, technical, commercial, and policy aspects of preserving privacy and defending critical infrastructure, which are key factors in realizing the full benefits of IT. A second example is the project in Intensive Care, developing an infrastructure and methodology to manage large amounts of clinical data for patients with life-threatening illness or injury.  Student researchers will join the effort to establish a scalable warehouse for critical care data to facilitate multi-institution collaboration in the interest of healing. Another project opportunity involves human-centered designpractices:contextual inquiry into the needs of clients to understand the needs of a user community, with particular interest in assistive technology for the disabled.  This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
