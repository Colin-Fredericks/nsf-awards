 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biology Directorate, Professor Dongping Zhong of Ohio State University and his graduate and undergraduate research students are investigating the dynamical role of the hydration layer of water on a protein's structure, internal motion and function.  They do this by combining femtosecond laser spectroscopic techniques with modern molecular biology techniques.  Specific proteins to be studied include an alpha-helical globular protein and a beta-stranded globular protein.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the work by Professor Zhong and his group is to develop a fundamental chemical understanding of how a protein's motions are intimately influenced by the motions of the surrounding water molecules.  With the kind of atomic and temporal resolution that are available in this study, the Zhong group hopes to obtain a better understanding of a variety of protein behaviors including protein recognition, folding, aggregation and enzyme catalysis.  Along the way, Prof. Zhong hopes to build a strong, interdisciplinary program in physical biology at Ohio State and to train a new generation of researchers who are also strong teachers.\r\n",
