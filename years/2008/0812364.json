 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new approaches for recovering the three-dimensional (3D) shape and pose of the human body in images and video  sequences.  The methods will use a detailed 3D body model learned from  laser range scans of over 2000 people.  The approach will model the  shape variation across people as well as the non-rigid shape variation  due to changes in pose.  The project will develop and test methods for  robustly recovering the body shape in surveillance video sequences, in scenes with strong lighting, from collections of snapshots and in  unconstrained television/film sequences.  The recovered body model  will be used to produce a variety of biometric measurements.\r\n\r\nThe majority of images and video sequences are of humans and  recognizing people and their actions is a core problem in computer  vision.  The problem is challenging however because the human body is  a complex, non-rigid, and articulated structure that can vary  dramatically in  pose, shape and appearance.  Current methods focus on estimating human pose and typically ignore the problem of human shape  estimation.  This project will treat these problems together resulting  in more robust solutions which will have a wide ranging impact in  multiple disciplines.  Human pose estimation is currently used in  areas such as gait analysis, special effects, game development, human  factors, and sports training to name a few.  Robust video-based  systems like the one developed here will extend the range of  applications to home entertainment, elder care, autonomous vehicles  and animal movement analysis.  By extending previous methods to also  estimate the three-dimensional shape of the human body in images and  video sequences this project will enable additional applications in  video forensics, surveillance, preventative medicine and special  effects.  More generally, methods like those developed here, that  robustly recover the shape and pose of people in complex images and  video streams, will be applicable to a wider range of problems in  object recognition and tracking.\r\n\r\nProject website: http://www.cs.brown.edu/~black/SCAPE.html\r\n",

With this we are able to approximately estimate the shape of a person under their clothes (Figure 4).  This will enable applications such as virtual clothing shopping and virtual try-on, in which users have their body \"scanned\" with a few images and then their 3D body model does the shopping for them. \n\nTo create a more accurate body model, we developed a method that uses the Microsoft Kinect game sensor as an input device (Figure 5).  The Kinect produces noisy depth information.  By combining depth measurements from people in multiple poses, we accurately estimate the person\u00c6s body shape.
