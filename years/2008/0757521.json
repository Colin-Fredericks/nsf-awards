 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Game2Learn project is to develop and evaluate innovative computing curricula that enhance creativity and learning, through applying problem-based learning and design studio teaching approaches.  The educational approach will increase students? ability in computing through problem-based learning, cultivate student creativity through design studio teaching methods, and situate student learning in an authentic community of practice, including faculty and peers. A broader impact of this project is an anticipated increase in student recruiting and retention by providing innovative outlets and products that allow students to be creative in their study of computing.  A secondary goal is that the products created by students in Game2Learn will be effective in supporting learning in introductory computing courses.  The intellectual focus of the project is to develop a Game2Learn course that combines creative processes with learning computing and learn from this course how we might inject creativity into other computing courses. The educational games developed will be evaluated based on: effectiveness for learning, creativity in implementation, creativity afforded to players, and impact on the attitudes of players toward computing. The intellectual merit of this project has two parts: the contributions to computing education through the development of teaching innovations that reward creativity, and the creation of new instructional technologies for computing. We also expect that our evaluation of student creativity in producing new educational technologies will also inform efforts to understand the impact of creative processes on learning and motivation.",
