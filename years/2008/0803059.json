 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shah\r\nDMS-0803059\r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues at the Department of\r\nMathematics of the University of Central Florida introduce a\r\nyear-long computational mathematics research and training\r\nprogram.  Using exciting applications of mathematics in images\r\nand videos as motivating examples, this CSUMS program provides\r\nparticipants with a solid background in both mathematical theory\r\nand problem-solving techniques to pursue careers and graduate\r\nstudy in fields that require integrated strengths in computation\r\nand the mathematical sciences.  The program starts in the spring\r\nsemester with classes that prepare students in numerical methods,\r\nmathematical modeling, and computer vision and imaging science. \r\nThen, in an intensive summer component, the students immerse\r\nthemselves in a research project.  In the fall semester they\r\ncontinue to conduct research and take additional classes in\r\nadvanced computer vision and imaging science, and advanced\r\nmathematical modeling.  In the follow-up spring semester, the\r\nstudents submit their research for publication, finish an\r\nundergraduate honors thesis, and get training in graduate career\r\nadvancement issues.  In addition, participants attend\r\nprofessional conferences, which give them a chance to present\r\ntheir research and to meet known researchers in the field, who\r\nmay serve as their role models.  To broaden the students'\r\nperspective, there are field trips to technology companies in\r\ncentral Florida area such as Lockheed-Martin, Harris, and Boeing. \r\nFinally in order to promote interaction amongst the students, a\r\nseminar course is installed throughout the program and several\r\nsocial events are included such as dinners with distinguished\r\nspeakers visiting the campus. \r\n\r\n     A cohort of 10 participants is selected each year among math\r\nmajors and minors at UCF.  The key elements of the program\r\ninclude: to have a full year training in carefully designed\r\ncourse work so that the participants can master the mathematical\r\nand computational fundamentals, to engage each participant in a\r\nmeaningful research project integrated into the year-long\r\nprogram, and to develop the participants' skills in communicating\r\nscientific ideas in writing and oral presentations through\r\nwriting journal papers for publication, giving routine seminar\r\npresentations, and presenting at the professional meetings.  The\r\nprogram represents a team effort of faculty members from\r\nmathematics, computer science, education and industry.  It leads\r\nto the development of a year-long research-oriented curriculum\r\nfor computational mathematics.  In particular, the participants\r\nare trained in and exposed to the latest techniques and critical\r\nissues in computational mathematics through both upgraded and\r\nnewly designed courses and real-life research projects in\r\ncomputer vision and imaging science, which involve video\r\ncompression, image denoising, object detection, tracking,\r\nactivity and event recognition.  This project contributes to\r\npreparing a work force of diverse scientists in order to maintain\r\nAmerica's strategic position of command in science and\r\nengineering.  Participants are trained in computational\r\nmathematics with an emphasis on computer vision and imaging\r\nscience, in particular they learn fundamentals of computation\r\nwith applications of consequence in areas such as national\r\ndefense and intelligence, homeland security, and biomedical and\r\nlife sciences.  The outcome of this CSUMS model, its evaluation,\r\nrelated research, articles, and curriculum materials, is\r\ndisseminated to other colleges and universities via a dedicated\r\nweb site.",
