 "awd_abstract_narration": "The steady state performance measures of production systems, such as the throughput and work-in-process, have been analyzed quantitatively for over 50 years. In contrast, the transient properties, i.e., the process of reaching the steady states, received very little attention. The transients, however, are of practical importance: Some production systems begin their shift operation with all buffers being empty, which leads to throughput losses due to transients. Therefore, analysis and minimization of such losses are of industrial importance. Clearly, the study of transients is of theoretical importance as well.  The goals of this project are the development of a theory for analysis and design of production systems from the point of view of the transients and the application of this theory for productivity improvement in the automotive industry. The theoretical part of this project will be carried out through the study of the Second Largest Eigenvalues (SLEs) and Pre-Exponential Factors (PEFs) of the Markov transition matrices that describe the systems at hand. The application part of this GOALI project will be carried out at GM?s assembly and engine plants.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a new paradigm in production systems research (based SLEs and PEFs) and initiating a new direction in manufacturing engineering ? that of investigating production systems transients using system-theoretic techniques. The broader impact of the project is in offering industrial audiences a set of tools for productivity improvement by managing and optimization of production systems transients and by exposing graduate students to the realities of factory floor operations. These activities will be facilitated by industrial short courses to be offered by the P.I. and by including the results of this research in the second edition of the textbook ?Production Systems Engineering?, recently published by the P.I.  \r\n",

Without such a base, national wealth could hardly be maintained. To reverse this process, the productivity of US manufacturing should be dramatically increased. This could be accomplished by employing science/engineering-based methods for production systems design and management. The current project, as a part of a series of NSF-supported projects, is intended to contribute to the analytical theory of design, analysis, and continuous improvement of production systems. We refer to this theory as Production Systems Engineering (PSE). The main results of PSE have been summarized in a graduate level textbook written under the NSF support and titled \"Production Systems Engineering\" (by J. Li and S.M. Meerkov, Springer 2009; Chinese translation 2012; see www.productionsystemsengineering.com for additional details).  This textbook has been used for courses at a number of US universities (e.g., University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, University of Connecticut) and abroad (e.g., China, Israel, and Sweden). The PSE methods have been applied in dozens of industrial projects and invariably led to substantial productivity improvements.\n\nThe current project contributes to PSE from the points of view of transient behavior of production systems. While the steady states of these systems have been analyzed in details for many years, the transients, i.e., the processes of reaching the steady states, remain relatively unexplored.\n\nResearch on transients is important because many production systems inherently operate in transient regimes. Examples include: (1) manufacturing systems with floats, where the departments with lower throughput operate overtime to build-up work-in-process (i.e., floats) to be utilized by the departments with higher throughput; (2) manufacturing of perishable goods, where the buffers must be purged at the end of the shift to prevent product deterioration. These examples lead to a problem of evaluating the average duration of the transients. In this project, we addressed this problem in the framework of serial production lines encountered in the automotive, computer, and appliance industries.  \n\nAnother origin of transients in production systems is ubiquitous: the transients occur when a machine fails and, thus, triggers a two-stage transient process: (1) when it goes down, and (2) when it goes up. This leads to a non-average problem of transients, i.e., the analysis of transients in response to a specific machine or work-center breakdown. In this project, we addressed this problem in the framework of re-entrant lines prevalent in the semiconductor industry.\n\nSpecific results obtained in each of these directions are as follows: \n\nSerial Lines: We have shown that the average durationof transeints can be quantified by the second largest eigenvalue of transition matrices, which describe production systems at hand, and its pre-exponential factor. The analysis of these quantitative measures, lead to the following qualitative results:\n\nLarger buffers lead to longer transients.\n\n\nHigher efficiency machines lead to slower transients      of  work-in-process.\n\n\nIn contrast, higher efficiency machines lead to faster      transients of throughput.\n\n\nA drift term, generated by the difference in machines      efficiency, speeds up the transients.\n\n\nThese results have been applied at GM\u00c6s Orion Assembly Center and led to a significant productivity improvement.\n\nRe-entrant Lines: Using the methods of non-linear dynamics, we have quantified the effects of various dispatch policies on production systems performance. In this regard, we have shown that the Last Buffer First Served (LBFS) dispatch, which has superior steady state characteristics, is, in fact, one ..."
