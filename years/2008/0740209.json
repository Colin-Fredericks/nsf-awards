 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research proposal addresses a disruptive tool with the inherent ability to measure, manipulate, and modify in three dimensions across multiple dimensional scales. The basic premise is focused upon an energy source capable of delivering, creating, and sustaining a multidimensional virtual tip high aspect ratio probe. The technology and approach enable the tip to be programmed into various geometric shapes while also providing the capability to detect surface interactions in a 3D space. In nano and micro-measurement this virtual tip when equipped on a measuring machine, provides the ability to perform high speed measuring through continuous scanning, is readily scaleable to nanoscale features, and enables reach into deep cavities and holes\r\nfor 3D measurement. The current scientific heritage in standing wave 1D sensors will be extended to investigate this innovative multi-dimensional sensor for high aspect ratio microscale feature measurements. Research areas include exploring linear driven mode with multi-dimensional capability, nonlinear dynamic modeling for setting up multi-harmonic standing wave modes, and investigating scaling issues for sub-micrometer feature measurements.\r\n\r\nVarious recent reports have both identified microscale and nanoscale metrology tools as a bottleneck to innovation across multi-dimensional scales. Technology barriers continue to arise in three broad areas - measurement, modification, and manipulation. There are many industries now fabricating microscale features with inability to offer quality inspection tools. The market for instrumented tools operating at these scales is, and will be, disruptive thereby enabling scientific insight for emerging markets, predictive process capabilities, enhanced functionality, and connectivity across scales. This technology platform springboards into an array of applications ranging from semiconductor to MEMS. \r\n",
