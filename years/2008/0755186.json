This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program in the Division of Chemistry (CHE).  The program will be directed by David Thomas of the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  Seven additional faculty members, who are computational experts in the Institute of Technology and the Medical School, will serve as research advisors.  This REU site will bring eight students to the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute for a ten-week period each summer to conduct-cutting edge research in the use of supercomputing methods in the physical sciences.  Individual student projects have been developed around this theme of scientific visualization and graphics.  Undergraduate students will be recruited nationally particularly from institutions with limited opportunities for undergraduate research.",
