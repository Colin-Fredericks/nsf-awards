 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: This educational development work is based on developing a series of laboratory and modeling experiments for general use that parallel and amplify texts already established for these highly quantitative courses within the School of Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The research and modeling experiments to be developed would illustrate the utility and importance of using hands-on, computer-based calculations, and visualization in learning and applying modern elements of materials science. The program consist of three phases: Phase A, (one year). Based on PI's previous experience, the following would be created:  MatLab_ codes and original experiments that reflect PI's approach to experimental multicomponent or binary diffusion experiments, extracting diffusivities, and dealing with diffusivity data obtained for metallic and silicate systems at different scales. Phase B, (one year) PI's will use XenoView-a Molecular Dynamics (MD) program with a graphical user interface created by co-PI. The students will learn to create initial structures, minimize energy and equilibrate structures, and then perform MD simulations at various ensembles with the goal of extracting properties that are important for real world applications. The calculation of thermal coefficient of expansion, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are some simple examples. Although many studies of freezing processes are published, melting, per se, remains relatively unexplored both theoretically and experimentally. 3D molecular dynamics simulations that visualize the melting and freezing processes in metals will be generated. Melting/freezing phenomena have importance for a variety of processes including casting, welding and soldering, crystal growth, nebular and planetary processes, and related problems concerning polymers. Under Phase C, estimated to take a third year, a tight collaboration with The Children's Museum of Science and Technology (part of Rensselaer Technology Park) will result in: a) an interactive materials exhibit entitled \"Materials World and Nature\" b) bi-weekly workshops/lectures. There will be a display for each major material class: metals, ceramics, polymers, electronic materials, glasses, composites, and biomaterials. Each display will show materials combined with a hands-on activity, and it will walk the visitor to the related microstructure at different length scales. Moreover, connection between the presented microstructure and similar natural patterns will be shown. Bi-weekly workshops or lectures will be organized for parents and children. NON-TECHNICAL: The PIs plan to increase the number of the undergraduate students in Materials Science and Engineering Department by exposing the interested undergraduate students to both research and modeling. The overall impact of the project is directed at sectors of attracting students and developing the curricula within MS&E. This work would 1) Lower the barrier for pedagogical changes associated with new teaching delivery methods; 2) Expose to research and smooth the materials learning transition for middle school, high school, and undergraduate students; 3) Improve and modernize the curricula in Materials Science and Engineering to attract and retain high quality students; 4) Broadens the participation of underrepresented groups.",
