 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop Micro/Nano-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS/NEMS) resonant sensor arrays enabling measurement of mass and size of individual nanoscale aerosol particles. The sensors will be tested in the laboratory with monodisperse aerosol under conditions similar to those what will occur in the instruments for which they are designed. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed silicon-based resonant sensors are extremely mass sensitive due to their small size and high quality factors. The resonance frequencies of the devices change as they are loaded with aerosol particles. On the other hand, the deflection of the elastic structures is used to measure the kinetic energy of particles striking the resonant sensors. Combining the mass and energy measurements for individual particles permits the collision velocity to be determined which leads to the determination of particle size in situations where the velocity is size dependent.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project is expected to lead to an active and comprehensive research program that fuels several under-development undergraduate and graduate level courses on micro/nano-electromechanical systems and combines them with extensive laboratory experiments and demos. It also allows the PIs to actively contribute in high school outreach programs conducted by the University of Denver as well as employ and educate several undergraduate and graduate students (preferably from underrepresented minorities) to participate in the research activities.\r\n\r\n",
