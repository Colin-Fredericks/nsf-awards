This revelation has driven a significant amount of the scientific and engineering research over the past few decades, especially with regards to electronic materials, biological processes, and catalysis. With regards to catalysis, it is recognized that the activity of a catalyst is not a pure function of its surface area. In fact, as the size of the catalyst shrinks, the catalyst behaves less like a bulk metal, and characteristics such as the morphology of the particles and the nature of the support begin to play a significant role.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of a catalyst search is to identify materials with specific chemical activity. However, a secondary goal is for the catalyst to maintain its activity during reacting conditions, which may include high temperatures, high or low pH, interactions with adsorbates, or the presence of an electrical current in electrochemical applications. Harsh reacting conditions may quickly result in a loss of chemical activity, due to catalyst poisoning, sintering, or dissolution of the catalyst or its support material. In order to maintain activity, these detrimental processes must be mitigated, either by tightly controlling the reaction conditions or by altering the intrinsic properties of the catalyst/support material. As such, a computational investigation will be performed to understand how the interactions between metal clusters and carbon support materials might be manipulated in order to preserve or enhance catalyst function.\r\n\r\nThis project is built upon the premise that catalyst sintering is (in part) related to the interaction of the catalyst with its support material. There are two primary mechanisms that are used to describe the sintering process: coalescence and Ostwald ripening. Since both processes involve the diffusion of the catalyst particles on the support (either as single atoms or as clusters), the catalyst stability should be significantly improved by reducing the inherent mobility of the catalysts. In other words, if the particles are somehow pinned or anchored to the support, sintering should decrease. This is the route that will be explored here. Attention will be focused on the interactions of Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Au metal atoms and clusters with (doped) carbon supports. These metal/support combinations can be found in a wide range of catalytic and electrochemical applications in industry, including fuel cell catalysis, decarbonylation reactions, reductive amination, alcohol synthesis, etc. Due to the high price (and limited quantities) of these precious metals, it is particularly important to maintain their original activity under reacting conditions for extended periods of time. This is one of the central challenges of catalysis.\r\n\r\nThe modeling will be primarily performed using electronic structure calculations to predict a variety of physical and chemical properties of the metal/support systems. In particular, characterization of the structure and activity of Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Au catalyst particles on pristine and doped carbon supports will be performed. Various dopant schemes will be investigated, and these will be compared with typical carbon support chemistry (carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, Stone-Wales defects, etc.). Along with this, the propensity of the catalyst particles for sintering, as a function of temperature and as a function of electric field strength (pertinent to electrochemical applications) will be investigated with ab initio MD simulations. Finally, the metal particles will be analyzed with respect to their catalytic activity by calculating the reaction mechanisms of standard probe reactions, such as CO oxidation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n \r\nThe education and outreach plan has been given significant attention, and a high impact strategy has been developed for disseminating the science outcomes. The outreach activities involve K-12 students by partnering with the McWane Science Center in Birmingham, AL to create a new science exhibit. Also, undergraduate students will participate in this project through the UA Computer Based Honors Program. Finally, faculty at HBCU programs will be included in summer workshops, as well as other audiences through the more traditional avenues (graduate courses, conference presentations, and journal publications).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdvances in chemical catalysis have enabled the development of a large number of highly-efficient and environmentally-benign industrial production processes and consumer technologies.  However, as environmental regulations tighten and as economic markets evolve, there is a persistent need to develop new catalyst formulations.  The primary goal of an effective catalyst search is to identify materials with specific chemical activity.  In addition, a secondary goal is for the catalyst to maintain its activity during reacting conditions, which may include high temperatures, wide ranges of pH, or the presence of an electrical current.  These harsh reacting conditions may quickly result in a loss of chemical activity.  In order to maintain activity, these detrimental processes must be mitigated, either by tightly controlling the reaction conditions or by altering the intrinsic properties of the catalyst and/or the catalyst support material.  In this work, we have performed a comprehensive series of simulation studies to examine the role of the catalyst support.  Moreover, we have identified strategies for improving stability in catalyst systems involving transition metal nanoparticles and carbon-based supports by pursing substitutional doping of the support material.\n\nOur simulation studies have been performed at different scales, ranging from atomistic-level calculations to larger molecular-level modeling.  The atomistic-level calculations have provided us with information about the fundamental interactions between carbon supports (with and without dopants) and the transition-metal catalysts.  These interactions were used to parameterize larger-scale simulations, which have subsequently been used by our group (and others) to model the stability of catalyst particles on the doped carbon supports.  We have predicted that substitutional boron dopants can significantly stabilize the metal-support interactions.  In addition, our simulations predict that the boron dopants increase the dispersion of the supported catalyst materials in aqueous environments, and this helps the catalyst maintain a high surface area and high activity.  The beneficial enhancements are predicted to occur for both planar substrates (graphitic carbons) and curved substrates (carbon nanotubes).\n\nMany of the catalyst applications that we targeted were electrochemical systems (fuel cells, sensors, etc.), so we investigated several properties that are relevant to these applications.  For instance, the strong metal-support interaction was predicted to persist, even in the presence of an applied electric field (relevant to a fuel cell environment).  Also, the metal nanopaticles that were supported on the boron-doped carbons were found to behave as excellent sensor materials for a variety of gas molecules.  Finally, we found that ferrocene-like molecules could be effectively stabilized on the boron-doped carbon substrates.  These stabilized ferrocene-like molecules can function as redox sensors and potentially serve as next-generation materials for glucose sensing (relevant to diabetic monitoring devices).\n\nIn order to broaden the impact of our work, we have involved four undergraduate students in these simulation-based research projects, and all of these students have later enrolled in doctoral graduate programs.  Guest lectures were delivered to a regional Material Science Workshop for faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and a sabbatical visitor from this program was subsequently hosted in our lab.  Finally, a central element of our outreach effort was an interaction with the McWane Science Center (Birmingham, AL).  With the help of a local high school student, we developed a hands-on prototype exhibit for the Center.  The exhibit was highly interactive and demonstrated the operation of a fuel cell, with a focus on the role of the catalyst.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christoffer H Turner"
