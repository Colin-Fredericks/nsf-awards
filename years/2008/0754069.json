 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU at Susquehanna University will host 8 students annually during the summers of 2008-2010 for an 8-week intensive course of study and guided research in Quantum Information Theory. After an intensive, self-contained introduction to the subject, students will work with members of the SU mathematics faculty on selected problems of current interest, potentially leading to publishable results. The staff includes members of the current SU mathematics department and visiting faculty from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Bucknell University.\r\n\r\nWe encourage applications from students in mathematics, physics and computer science with an interest; members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Participants should have a good grasp of finite-dimensional linear algebra and elementary probability theory; exposure to abstract algebra would be a plus, but is not strictly necessary. Prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is not assumed.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the departmental REU website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.susqu.edu/mathematics/reu/\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
