Our program will focus on the integration of research and education at all levels. Through our vertically integrated research groups (VRGs) there will be dynamic research environments where faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates can make discoveries and produce publishable results. \r\nIn conjunction with our core mathematics curriculum and VRGs, we will provide additional professional development opportunities for our students and postdocs through our summer training program, industrial internships, MEFT (Mathematicians Educating Future Teachers) training program and professional development workshops.  \r\n\r\nWith solid training and mentorship we will produce high quality graduates and postdocs for the mathematical science and teaching workforce. We will continue to develop the VRG model which has transformed graduate education at UGA and has the promise of being implemented at a other academic institutions. Our graduates with their collaborative VIGRE experience will be able to transfer this knowledge and expertise in their various professional career paths. Within our summer training program, we will hold a yearly Summer School Program. The mini-courses in this program, intended for for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will introduce foundational concepts and recent advances in a particular area. Our Internship and Interdisplinary Outreach Program will foster interdisciplinary research at all levels though by building contacts between our department with academic, industrial, and government agencies. Furthermore, our MEFT Program will have a positive impact at the local area schools as well as on the nationwide level by preparing students and postdocs to effectively teach K-12 teachers.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe VIGRE program (VIGRE II) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Georgia recruited and trained mathematical scientists from the US to meet the demands of the scientific workplace of the 21st century. In the first five years, the VIGRE II grant enabled the department to award 10 graduate fellowships at a level of $25,000 per year, as well as employ four additional postdoctoral fellows.  \n\nThis infusion of funding had a significant impact in reducing the time to degree for our Ph.D students, in addition to creating new initiatives to improve mentoring students and postdoctoral fellows.\n \n\nIntellectual Merit: We were able to integrate research and education at all levels. Through our vertically integrated research groups (VRGs), our faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates created dynamic research environments. The VRG program is now a national model for the training of students and postdocs.  Many of the VRGs generated original research and documented their findings in preprints and published research articles.  The VRGs produced over 20 publications during VIGRE II grant.\n\nOur program provided professional development opportunities for our students and postdocs through our Summer Training Program (STP). Over the summer graduate students enrolled in graduate courses lasting four weeks, participated in teacher training, and prepared for their qualifying exams via prep sessions.  During the first two years, adjustments were made to revamp the STP by introducing a Mock AMS Conference.  From 2009-2013, there were four 2-week Summer School Programs (SSP). The SSPs featured leading experts with  lectures geared toward introducing junior mathematicians to their research area. The 2-week summer schools were a huge success and brought in a total of 195 graduate students and postdocs (103 of them US citizens or permanent residents) from institutions across the country.\n\nDuring the academic year, our VIGRE professional development workshops provided our postdocs and graduate students with the opportunity to increase their marketability through targeted learning with experienced professional mathematicians.\n \nBroader Impacts: There are new arrays of opportunities for mathematicians in the sciences, industry, government and education. In VIGRE II we promoted interdisciplinary research at all levels through the Internship and Interdisciplinary Outreach Program (II0). During the summers our students interned with a number of academic, industrial and government agencies. \n\nVIGRE II also had positive impact at local area schools and on the national level by preparing graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to effectively teach prospective K-12 teachers through our Mathematicians Education Future Teachers Program (MEFT). This broadening of education contributed to helping our graduates to successfully find employment in academia, government and the industrial sectors.  \n\nOur graduates with their collaborative VIGRE experience have been able to transfer their knowledge and expertise within their various professional career paths.\n \nDepartmental Impact: In 2009, with cooperation from our university administration and VIGRE funds, we opened our new undergraduate study area called ``The Matrix\u00c6\u00c6.  The Matrix has hosted a variety of activities to increase recruitment and retention of students pursuing mathematics. The Matrix continues to serve as a meeting place for groups of undergraduate students to work together. \n\nThe members of the department contributed superb buy-in toward the VIGRE initiatives. In each of the years of the grant the percentage of tenured and tenure track faculty participating in VIGRE activities has been around 90%. \nAt the start of VIGRE II, the department averaged 35 BS/BA mathematics degrees awarded per year. With stronger recruitment efforts, there have been significant increases in the number of undergraduate mathematics degrees over the past three years: 52 (2012-13), 70 (2013-14) and..."
