 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Strickland's work will improve our understanding of the 'superwinds' that emerge from star-forming galaxies.  These powerful multiphase outflows are important for understanding the development of star-forming galaxies, and how nascent galaxies heat and enrich the intergalactic medium.   The proposed research will address two competing mechanisms for cloud acceleration: the ram pressure of the outflowing wind, and radiation pressure.  Dr. Strickland will develop numerical tools for determining the observable signatures corresponding to different models of cloud acceleration, and will model large populations of clouds, as opposed to single clouds alone.  The work combines analytical approaches with pre-calculated hydrodynamical simulations.  It will incorporate several physical effects that are often neglected in studies of clouds in galactic winds, including thermal conduction, stripping, and the dynamical effects of the wind on the clouds. \r\n\r\nThe numerical codes and simulation tools will be made available to the community, so that observers can compare their data with predictions of the various wind models.  The research will help to understand galaxy feedback, which is one of the least understood but important processes in the study of galaxy formation and evolution.",
