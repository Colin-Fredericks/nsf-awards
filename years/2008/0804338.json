This system enables very high angular resolution and very high spectral resolution observations of stars in their later stages of evolution, i.e. red giant and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.\n\nThe ISI is a three telescope system, located at Mt.

In addition, and importantly, the variations of a star\u00c6s size and shape are measured over time scales ranging from much less than a stellar luminosity period to many years.
