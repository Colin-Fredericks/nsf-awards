 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site program will allow 8 undergraduate students per year to participate in a college-wide program to conduct research on topics related to biomedical engineering and bioengineering areas, ranging from biomedical cardiovascular engineering to biochemical engineering, biomechanics of cells and hard and soft tissues, cellular and biosurface engineering, and electrical activity of the heart and brain.  Multiple projects in the areas of materials science including the focus on biologically inspired materials and material systems, mechanical, electrical, computer, civil, and environmental engineering will also be offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the research experience, students will participate in research team meetings as well as special REU group meetings and training in communications, professional writing, and career preparation as well as in professional scientific presentation of research. \r\n\r\nThe program will recruit over 75% of its students from underrepresented groups and will include at least 25% disabled students each year.  Often times this REU program is the first and only opportunity these students will have to learn and do research with students with disabilities, and it is a unique and world changing experience for them, as it is for the disabled students.\r\n\r\n",
