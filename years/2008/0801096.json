 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal contains three projects, in number theory and its\r\napplications to combinatorics. The first project concerns the\r\narithmetic of modular forms for noncongruence subgroups. For\r\nnoncongruence subgroups whose associated modular curves have a model\r\nover the rationals, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer suggested very\r\ninteresting congruence relations on the Fourier coefficients of cusp\r\nforms which are meant to replace the Hecke operators. On the other\r\nhand, Scholl has attached Galois representations to the space of\r\nnoncongruence cusp forms. The ASD congruences together with the\r\nmodularity of Scholl representations yield extremely interesting\r\ncongruence relations between the Fourier coefficients of congruence\r\nand noncongruence forms. Some examples were constructed by the PI\r\nand her coauthors. Continuing her joint work with coauthors, the PI\r\nplans to apply the modularity lifting theorems to investigate when\r\nScholl representations arise from Hilbert modular forms, and to use\r\nthe modularity result and ASD congruence relations to establish the\r\nconjecture which says that the Fourier coefficients of genuinely\r\nalgebraic noncongruence forms have unbounded denominators. The\r\nsecond project is to construct zeta functions of complexes arising\r\nfrom finite quotients of the Bruhat-Tits buildings. Such zeta\r\nfunction should be a rational function which encodes topological and\r\nspectral information of the complex, and which satisfies the Riemann\r\nHypothesis if and only if the complex is Ramanujan. When dimension\r\nis one, this is the Ihara zeta function attached to a graph. In a\r\nvery recent work, the PI and a PhD student did the 2-dimensional\r\ncase. The PI proposes to explore the general case. The third project\r\nconcerns low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC codes are\r\nequipped with very efficient decoding algorithms, which make them\r\nhighly desirable in real world applications. The source of decoding\r\nerrors is the pseudo-codewords. One way to understand these\r\npseudo-codewords is to construct a suitable infinite series, called\r\na zeta function, with each term corresponding to a pseudo-codeword.\r\nSuch zeta function should be a rational function with good\r\ncombinatorial property. This was done indirectly in a joint paper of\r\nthe PI. The PI proposes to pursue a more direct approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental\r\nresearch in number theory and to seek applications of number theory\r\nto combinatorics and coding theory, especially to solve real world\r\nproblems. The study of interplay between these areas has turned out\r\nto be quite fruitful. This proposal is a continuation of\r\n the PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. Part of the research\r\n will be carried out by the PI's Ph D\r\nstudents. The results from this proposal will be disseminated\r\nbroadly through the talks given by the PI in seminars, colloquia,\r\nconferences, short courses, and workshops. They will also be\r\nincorporated in the graduate courses taught by the PI. Weekly\r\ninformal seminars will be conducted to integrate research with\r\neducation and teaching. A conference is planned in 2010 to\r\ndisseminate results from this project.",
