 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kankakee Community College is developing a model curriculum for community colleges to \"revamp\" their existing electrical technology Associate of Applied Science degree programs by adding a concentration and certification for renewable energy technicians. Technicians completing the curriculum will be qualified to install, maintain, and repair renewable energy technologies. The new curriculum consists of four renewable energy courses that focus on solar, thermal, and wind energy technologies, and include laboratory activities, field trips, work-based educational experiences, and assessment instruments. The curriculum is based on the premise that renewable energy technicians must know about electricity and electrical technology, and develops in students the knowledge/skills/competencies needed for the renewable energy workplace. \r\n\r\nThe project is also providing (1) professional development for faculty, (2) a plan for fostering community partnerships that help define training needs, (3) job referral and placement services, (4) an articulation agreement with a university, (5) a career ladder for high school students and displaced workers, and (6) a workshop for helping other community colleges modify their electrical technology curricula to include renewable energy.\r\n",
