 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports a pilot study at New York University\r\n(NYU), under which computer science (CS) is being taught to math and music savvy children in\r\ngrades 7-12. They are learning how CS principles apply to music, a technical field with known\r\ncomputational applications including sound manipulation, music information retrieval, and musicrelated\r\nartificial intelligence. The focus is on fundamental scientific concepts like algorithms and\r\ndata structures and how they apply to technical problems. This contrasts with previous approaches\r\nto teaching pre-college CS, e.g., AP computer science classes focus on a currently popular computer\r\nlanguage (JAVA) and other classes focus on currently popular computer applications (word\r\nprocessing, spreadsheets, etc.). Follow up studies are anticipated for teaching other computational\r\ndomains, such as robotics and artificial intelligence approaches to solving games. Again, the focus\r\nwill be on formal computational problem solving, rather than the use of currently popular computer\r\nlanguages and applications.\r\nThis study explores the incorporation of basic CS into the middle/high school curricula, a\r\nsignificant question for the educational and scientific research communities. The ubiquitousness\r\nof computational thinking in current intellectual thought makes this an extremely significant line\r\nof research.\r\nThe teaching materials created in this pilot study will be available on the world wide web and\r\nresults will be submitted for publication. This pilot study is intended as a stepping stone to a real\r\ncomputer science curriculum for pre-college students, which should prove essential to the future\r\neconomic and intellectual development of the United States.\r\n",
