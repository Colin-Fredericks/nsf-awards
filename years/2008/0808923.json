 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. John Conboy of the University of Utah. Prof. Conboy and his students will study the origin of phospholipid asymmetry in simple model membrane systems. Compositional asymmetry in the lipid membrane is thought to play a crucial role in membrane structural stability, intercellular signaling, and the organization of membrane-associated components. Prof. Conboy and his students will use sum frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS) to directly measure the trans bilayer movement of phospholipids and asymmetry in a variety of membrane models to determine the rate of exchange of native phospholipids.  SFVS will also be used to measure membrane asymmetry, kinetics of transmembrane migration, and thermodynamic analysis of the transition state barrier to migration. Success of the proposed studies will have wide-reaching implications in molecular and cellular biology. The study will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in a highly multidisciplinary research area involving the development and application of state of the art no-linear spectroscopic methods in complex biological systems.",
