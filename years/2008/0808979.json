 "awd_abstract_narration": "0808979\r\nFisher \r\nThis award provides support for two US-India workshops on Frontiers in Scalable Nanostructured Interface Materials.  The first will take place at the Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research in November 2008 and will be followed by a second to be held at Purdue in late 2009.  US PI Timothy Fisher, Director of the Birck Nanotechnology Center will convene the workshops with C.N.R. Rao, Honorary President of the Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore. \r\n\r\nThe workshops will bring together leading scientists from both countries to discuss developing applications that build on a large body of solid fundamental work on nanoscale interfaces and that are expected to create opportunities for dramatic improvements in a wide range of technologies from electronics to structural composites. Interfacial transport across and through nanostructures represents the major remaining barrier to broader applications.  The workshops'primary purpose is to identify the most promising applications and the associated remaining obstacles to practical realization.  Enhancing opportunities for collaboration between the U.S. and India is both important and timely considering the scale of national investments and opportunity to leverage unique intellectual and material resources. \r\n\r\nThese workshops will be catalytic in promoting international collaboration as well as developing future research directions in the subject area.  It is expected that collaborative proposals will be developed that are suitable for submission to the Materials World Network, Partnerships for International Research and Education, and Cyber-enabled Discovery and Innovation.  The select group of U.S. participants is well balanced among established technical experts, highly accomplished junior faculty, and exceptional students including underrepresented minorities.  The Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems is co-funding this activity.",
