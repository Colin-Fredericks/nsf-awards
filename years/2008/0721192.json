A fundamental feature of sexual reproduction in both plants and animals is the specification of distinct types of cells that give rise to eggs and sperm. So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate determination during sexual reproduction in plants. In flowering plants, male reproduction occurs in anthers, which contain highly specialized somatic and reproductive cells. Recently the anther has emerged as a prime model system for the study of cell fate determination and receptor-linked signaling, in addition to its central importance to plant breeding and reproduction. Signal transduction mediated by the EMS1 leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) plays a critical role in regulating anther cell differentiation. This project will use molecular genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques to further analyze the biological functions of EMS1. The expected results would include the identification of an EMS1 ligand and other novel signaling components in the EMS1 signal transduction pathway. The proposed project will shed light on the molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination during sexual reproduction in plants and other organisms. The results may lead to potential agricultural and industrial applications. The proposed research programs will provide excellent opportunities to integrate research into education through training a postdoctoral scientist, underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, as well as K-12 students.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
