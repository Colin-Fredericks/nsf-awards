The teachers will be selected from a total of eight middle schools and four high schools. In addition, teachers from one high schools located in the Dominican Republic will participate in the program. The program is designed around the theme: Learning through Ecology and Environmental Field Studies (LEEFS).  The LEEFS project integrates and expands on existing partnerships between units of the Columbia University Earth Institute and New York City Title 1 schools. Graduate Fellows and grade 6-12 teachers will work together for four to eight weeks prior to the school year in a program of field science internships, professional development, and curriculum planning and creation. During the academic year, direct support is supplied to partnering schools in field and laboratory science: weekly on-site presence of Fellows and assistance in field and laboratory locations. Innovative aspects include: the intensity of integration of teachers and their students into field research in an urban setting; the close linkage of LEEFS with the NYC Department of Education initiatives toward inquiry-driven, hands-on, experiential learning of science for the general student population; near real-time access to LEEFS field data collection; and extension of the Program to research and education in the Dominican Republic. The program actualizes recent pedagogical research indicating unique benefits from field based learning; it contributes to several NSF-funded field programs; and it explores innovative ways to augment graduate student education.  LEEFS will also impact the high-needs schools in the New York area and will provide an international connection for participating Fellows and teachers.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLearning through Ecology and Environmental Field Studies (LEEFS)\n\nThe Learning through Ecology and Environmental Field Studies (LEEFS) was a 7-year project at Columbia University that put graduate students in classrooms to co-teach, and that brought science teachers and some of their students to Columbia to work on authentic research projects over the summers.  Between 2008 and 2013, each year 9 graduate students were selected to spend one day each week in a middle or high school during the school year.  These students created new laboratory curricula; mentored integrated projects week (IPW) teams; stayed after school to tutor students and mentor science clubs; lectured at school assemblies; brought classes to Columbia laboratories; led field trips to local waterfronts; and generally infused students with their own enthusiasm for scientific research. \n\nIn the summers, high school science teachers came to Columbia University\u00c6s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory to participate in field and laboratory research projects.  Using additional funding from private foundations and the City of New York, high school students from collaborating schools were offered paid internships to work alongside NYC teachers and Columbia scientists in local wetlands and geochemical laboratories.  Together with graduate students from Columbia\u00c6s Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, LEEFS teachers and students helped create a long-term ecological study of Piermont Marsh.  The Marsh, which is part of the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve, is 10 miles North of Manhattan and located within sight of Lamont-Doherty.  LEEFS participants worked in teams that included high school students, college students, science teachers, graduate students and Lamont scientists to study everything from sediment accumulation to soil and water chemistry to fish and invasive plants in the wetland. \n\nLEEFS participants presented data from the Marsh at professional meetings of the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, the Society of Wetlands Scientists and the Passaic River Symposium.  They supported original research into the depth-dependence of methanogenesis in the Marsh, natural carbon sequestration, the rate of Phragmites australis (Common Reed) invasion, nutrient cycling, and impacts of invasive Phragmites on utilization of the Marsh by fish.  \n\nOne goal of the LEEFS project was to create a sustainable model for engagement between Columbia scientists and secondary school teachers and students.  Through the Secondary School Field Research Program at Lamont Doherty, LEEFS funding has led to institutionalization of project- and place-based education for public school students at Lamont-Doherty, one of the top earth and environmental campuses in the world. \n\nThrough LEEFS and the SSFRP about 200 students from predominantly Title I (free lunch) schools have received training and experiences that have helped them to attend top-tier colleges.  About half of those students are majoring or minoring in science or engineering.  Already several of them are entering graduate programs in the natural sciences. \n\nLEEFS participants have applied the principles developed in the LEEFS program to: develop a shoreline monitoring protocol for built estuarine settings for the EPA; develop a new marine research and restoration based curriculum for public New York City middle schools; train middle school teachers in research-based science education; and to work with other mentoring programs around the New York metropolitan area to bring more authenticity to their projects.  LEEFS teachers and their students have had an active role in each of these follow-on projects. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert Newton"
