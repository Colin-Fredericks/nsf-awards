 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to develop a novel trans-cervical device using biocompatible shape memory polymers to achieve permanent female sterilization as an alternative to fallopian tube ligation.  Such a methodology could potentially benefit all women undergoing permanent sterilization procedures and would be a significant improvement over existing methods which although relatively new, have been adopted by the medical community despite certain issues.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, current procedures for the ligation of the fallopian tubes are hysteroscopic (visually guided) and although significantly better than the surgically invasive techniques of past, still have several draw backs.  One of the most important of these shortcomings is the length of time that is required to get fibrotic-proliferative-based closure of the tube after the insertion of the device.  Currently a woman has to wait between 3 and 6 months to ensure full closure of the tubes.  The proposed system on the other hand, obviates the wait time and can fully close the fallopian tube upon insertion.  As such, this technology is likely to be a very favorable addition to the presently available trans-cervical devices.",
