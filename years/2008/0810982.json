 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this collaborative proposal is to develop\r\ntheoretically based algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers for Hermitian\r\n(and, where possible, non-Hermitian) positive-definite problems.  The\r\nteam aims to improve understanding of the performance of the family of\r\nAMG algorithms and, with this improved knowledge, to develop AMG\r\nmethods that offer provable, computable, a priori information on the\r\nalgorithm's performance.  The project team represents a close\r\ncollaboration of experts in this area, each of whom has made\r\ncontributions in the field.  Over the past several years, the team has\r\nbegun to work collectively on developing new multilevel solvers and\r\nrigorous theoretical results for the convergence and complexity\r\nanalysis thereof.  Together, the team will have the capability to take\r\na step toward answering some of the fundamental research questions\r\nassociated with these two essential aspects of the analysis and design\r\nof efficient algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe expect the work proposed here to: (1) directly impact computational\r\nsimulation codes currently employing multi-level solvers, by providing\r\nfaster and more reliable computational tools for the numerical\r\ncomputations at the core of physical simulations; and (2) allow for\r\nsimulation of phenomena for which suitable solvers are currently\r\nunavailable.  The results from the proposed research will, thus, have\r\na direct impact on scientific and engineering problems, including\r\nthose from energy, through both the simulation of particle physics and\r\nprocessing of data from oil reservoir models, biophysics, in surgical\r\nsimulation, and the environment, in climate prediction and contaminant\r\nremediation models.  The algorithms to be investigated here are\r\nalready in use in many of these fields, but are often considered to be\r\n\"expert-only\" tools.  The goal of this proposal is to develop more\r\nreliable and robust versions of these tools.  The proposed research\r\nwill have a strong educational impact as well, as it provides for a\r\nsolid base for training of graduate students in the modern theoretical\r\nand practical aspects of numerical methods for modeling of\r\napplications arising in science and engineering.",
