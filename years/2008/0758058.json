 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at providing a better understanding of the non-perturbative interaction\r\nof matter with laser pulses or external fields. In each of the three project groups, the\r\nunderstanding of the nonlinear quantum dynamics will be advanced primarily with the\r\naid of computer simulations to allow for spatial and temporal resolution. It is also an aim\r\nof the research to explore new concepts and tools that could stimulate further\r\ntheoretical and experimental interest.\r\nThe first sequence of projects focuses on new phenomena that occur if laser fields are\r\nsufficiently intense either to trigger or affect the creation of electron-positron pairs from\r\nvacuum. The studies will build on a computational technique that has been developed\r\nby the PIs to solve the quantum field theoretical equations in space-time. The second\r\nsequence of projects examines the spatially resolved electron-photon-electron\r\ninteraction and searches for the origin of the Coulomb force. It is based on a non-unitary\r\nquantum mechanical formalism that allows the computation to be carried out. The third\r\nsequence of projects explores theoretically as well as experimentally the propagation of\r\nlaser fields through heterogeneous dielectric random media.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project provided a better understanding of how one can use an external laser field to control, influence and even create matter.  The research team has developed a sophisticated network of computers to simulate the motion of an electron inside an atom with full spatial and temporal resolution.  These computer simulations as a new scientific tool permitted them to find the optimum conditions under which an atom can act as a source of electromagnetic radiation with controllable properties.  The development of new light sources can provide new ways to control atomic, chemical and biological processes on very short time scales. \n\nThe computer simulations also predicted that if the strength of the laser radiation is very high, this radiation can convert itself to matter in form of electrons and antielectrons.  In other words, light can be converted directly into matter.  This process has not been observed in a laboratory yet but the computer simulations provide guidance for the planned experiments.\n\nAn important mission for the program was also to give undergraduate student the opportunity to gain research experience.  This educational experience provided them with important skills including working as a team, gaining the endurance, intellectual flexibility and experience to tackle serious research problems, and communicating results in conferences and publications. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rainer Grobe"
