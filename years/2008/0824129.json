 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives: \r\nThe proposed research will create electronic and optoelectronic systems that can be reversibly stretched or compressed to large strains, while providing strain-independent electrical performance at the level of state-of-the-art devices built on brittle semiconductor wafers.  These systems will exploit inorganic semiconductor nanomaterials configured into structural shapes that can geometrically accommodate large mechanical deformations without imparting significant strains in the materials themselves.  Comprehensive theoretical models will provide a basic understanding of the physics of these systems, and guide design of systems capable of eliminating the influence of mechanical strains on device performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe scientific and engineering thrusts include:\r\n\t1)  Semiconductor nanomaterials to build high quality electronic and optoelectronic devices on substrates other than semiconductor wafers.  These materials will be integrated with ultrathin polymer sheets using transfer printing techniques.\r\n\t2)  Elastomeric transfer elements and substrates to transform these nanomaterials and devices from their initial planar configurations into various buckled, curvilinear and \"wavy\" shapes needed to achieve stretchable/compressible mechanical response.\r\n\t3)  Analytical and computational models to understand the physics associated with strain-induced deformations in these nanomaterials.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nSuccessful development of the proposed approaches will create entirely new classes of electronic and optoelectronic systems, with wide-ranging application possibilities.  The broad appeal of these systems provides excellent educational opportunities not only for graduate and undergraduate students, but also for the wider community interested in new technology.  Interactive displays at science/technology museums will form a focus of outreach activities.",
