The cohorts will form during a series of summer institutes, where the research knowledge of the Fellows will be disseminated to the teachers, training in pedagogy and learning theory will occur for the Fellows, and integrated STEM curriculum modules will be developed.  The focus of the MESBQ project is to enrich the education of STEM doctoral students, to develop a novel curricular approach to mathematics and science instruction, to build integrated math/science communities within and between higher education and K-12 institutions, and to enhance the mathematics and science content knowledge of teacher participants. \r\n\r\nMore broadly, the STEM graduate students will gain an appreciation for the interconnectedness of the STEM disciplines in research. The teachers will develop an enhanced understanding of the relationship of math and science in their teaching. The K-12 students will benefit through the development of new inquiry-based integrated curriculum modules. Fellows from underrepresented groups will be recruited and an emphasis will be placed on working with teachers from schools with underserved populations. Results will be disseminated nationally through a capstone conference and a model developed that can be replicated across the nation.\r\n",

This has been accomplished by the development of &ldquo;Math/Engineering/Science Bridge Quartets (MESBQ&rsquo;s)&rdquo;, where a scientist (engineer) Graduate Fellow and high school science Teacher Fellow pairs with a math Graduate Fellow and a corresponding math Teacher Fellow at the same school (or, later in the program, through distance-based cohorts at various schools in Texas) to develop learning/teaching cohorts. The &ldquo;Building Bridges: Integrating Mathematics, Engineering, and Science on the South Plains&rdquo; program at Texas Tech University has been unique within the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s GK-12 program due to its interdisciplinary nature. Besides integrating math and science/engineering, a secondary goal at Texas Tech has been to prepare graduate-level STEM researchers and in-service secondary mathematics and science teachers to thrive in an interdisciplinary environment. The organization of the program at TTU was designed to 1) facilitate the research activities of the GK-12 Graduate Fellows, 2) develop professional experiences for both Graduate and Teacher Fellows, while creating a sense of community among STEM participants, 3) encourage collaborative design and implementation of an integrated curriculum, and 4) create cyber-capable dissemination platforms for nationwide outreach through a distance-learning classroom environment. The Graduate Fellows improved their abilities in communicating their research interests and skills to a broad audience and learned pedagogical skills from their interactions with the Teachers.&nbsp; This initiative attempted to provide a cognitive bridge between math and science for high school students.
