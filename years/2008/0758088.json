This method combines the all-order approach currently used in precision calculations of properties of monovalent atoms with the configuration interaction (CI) approach that is applicable for many-electron systems. The main goal of this research is to improve the theoretical understanding of parity nonconservation (PNC) in heavy atoms.",
