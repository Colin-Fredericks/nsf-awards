 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: This project provides a new scholarship program, Scientists for Tomorrow, to leverage existing research and student programs towards long-term student success by providing a critical and otherwise unavailable piece -- funding to support entering students. This program fills a critical gap, supporting approximately 43 incoming Astronomy, Computer Sciences, Math and Physics first-year students each year with scholarships ranging between $2,500 and $5,000 annually. Objectives include 1) increasing access to STEM education, 2) improving first-year performance among at-risk groups, 3) involving students in the scientific community, 4) transitioning students to other existing sources of support, and 5) ultimately affecting graduation rates, graduate school matriculation and scientific career choices. Students apply on-line, are filtered by the Office of Student Financial Services based on need, and selected by a departmental committee using academic merit criteria. Scholarship recipients participate in community building activities, are placed in an academic cohort in their discipline, are assigned a faculty mentor, and attend graduate school, undergraduate research and career seminars. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This scholarship program specifically addresses national areas of need and supports low-income college students and groups underrepresented in the sciences. The university already makes a major contribution to minority education in the United States and is listed among the top ten institutions in awards of bachelor's degrees and first in the nation in the number of doctoral degrees awarded to Hispanics. Existing freshman programs at UT-Austin provide support and encouragement to students in traditionally underrepresented sections of our population, and encourage participation in research. The project expects to make a concrete impact on recruitment and retention in the sciences.",
