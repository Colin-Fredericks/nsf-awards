In particular, wireless local area networks (LANs) and mesh networks are increasingly being deployed in the unlicensed bands of the spectrum. While the density of wireless devices is likely to increase, the spectrum available for the devices remains limited. Therefore, techniques to improve performance of wireless networks are of great interest.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project will explore the use of multi-antenna technology in wireless networks. A particular focus will be on the design and evaluation of cross-layer protocols for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel access. This project will address the fundamental challenges of managing interference and intelligent use of MIMO technology in wireless edge networks. The topics to be covered include design of cross-layer protocols for MIMO-based wireless networks, development of accurate simulation models for MIMO channels, and experimental evaluation of a selected subset of protocols. Through these research activities, the project will contribute to enhancing the performance of wireless networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project has the potential for broad and long-range impact to both the basic theory and practical methods and protocols for wireless networks that exploit MIMO technology. The blend of theoretical and experimental investigations in this project provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for training of future networking researchers and engineers. Selected results from this project will also be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses on wireless communications and networking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
