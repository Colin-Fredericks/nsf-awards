 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative project are (1) to provide fundamental theoretical and experimental understanding of the newly proposed deformation machining process, (2) to establish efficient numerical modeling and simulation methodologies, and (3) to integrate the fundamental understanding and modeling with pre-process and in-process strategies for process planning, part repeatability, part accuracy, and design guidelines. The approach for the simulation will be an adaptive finite element method that will significantly reduce computation time, thereby allowing the study of various process combinations and sequences. Particular emphasis will be placed determining residual stresses and fatigue life through experiments and simulation. Numerical and experimental analysis will be used to study material deformation behavior, to predict fatigue life, and to design workable operational sequencing to achieve process repeatability and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits and broader impacts of this research will come from the greater reliability and improved design freedom. This new manufacturing process will permit new structures, geometries, and products that are not feasible using current manufacturing processes. The theoretical understanding, experimental techniques, and new simulation methods will provide new insights.  As a result, enhanced product capability as well as new flexibility and functionality in terms of manufacturability and product features will be possible.  Finally, in the academic and educational environment, the proposal of a new hybrid process opens the door for collaboration between research communities that traditionally do not interact. The education plan will encourage students with diverse backgrounds to collaborate, and it will provide them with new opportunities and mentoring from the team members. The close interaction among students and faculty from each university, government laboratory personnel, and industry personnel, will result in rich, cross-disciplinary educational experience.",
