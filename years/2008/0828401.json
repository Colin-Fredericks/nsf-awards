To date, the most efficient energy conversion devices are made out of single crystal semiconductor films grown on single crystal substrates. Unfortunately, single crystal substrates are too expensive for large scale production of energy conversion devices such as solar cells. Most low-cost commercial solar cell devices are either polycrystalline or amorphous on amorphous substrate with less than ideal efficiency and with long term stability problems. A key challenge is whether it is possible to grow a single crystal film on an inexpensive amorphous substrate such as glass. An amorphous substrate does not have a well ordered lattice to induce an epitaxial growth. However, it is known that under an atomic shadowing configuration during deposition such as in the oblique angle deposition, it is possible to grow \"quasi-single crystal\" films, called biaxially oriented films, with both strong out-of-plane and in-plane orientations. In this work, we will explore the use of recently developed reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) surface pole figure technique to probe the fundamental mechanics of biaxial texture evolution on an amorphous surface and use the technique for optimizing the growth conditions. We will grow a biaxially oriented CaF2 buffer layer on top of an amorphous substrate such as glass, and follow this by the growth of epitaxial CdTe-based solar cell device structures. Energy conversion efficiency and the long-term reliability of the solar cells fabricated using these strong biaxial CdTe-based device structures will be evaluated. We will correlate the result of the quantitative surface pole figure analysis to the ultimate performance of the solar cells made out of these biaxially oriented semiconductor films. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding of the mechanisms of different thin-film texture formations by shadowing will have a broader impact on many areas of research. In addition to the use of high quality biaxial films in solar cells, the efficiency of materials for catalytic reactions such as the electrodes in fuel cells also depends very much on the texture orientation. The knowledge gained from the proposed research can aid researchers to design and \"functionalize\" textures and further improve the physical properties of thin films. The team members in this proposal have strong track records of integrating research, education, and outreach activities. In addition to training graduate students, they have created over 100 undergraduate research projects and have co-authored more than 20 papers with undergraduates in the past 17 years through NSF REU and Rensselaer-sponsored URP programs.",
