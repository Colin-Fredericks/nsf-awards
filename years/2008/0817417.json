 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElaine Seymour\u00c6s research (1997) finds the reason most often cited by students who drop out of college is their experience in their first mathematics course, and she claims this leads to high U.S. drop-out rates of STEM majors.  The Colorado Momentum project addresses student understanding of math concepts, calculus failure rates, and low retention rates in STEM majors through oral reviews.  \n\nOral reviews were developed in the University of Colorado\u00c6s Department of Applied Mathematics (UCB).  Orals were developed specifically to help students identified as being \"at risk\" of failing first-semester calculus.  Having found that oral reviews produce measurably positive results, with NSF funding we introduced orals in multiple settings: to more math classes, to classes taught in different departments, at different universities, in different disciplines, and at different educational levels.  Data show a .6-1 higher course grades for orals participants, significant reduction in failure rates and higher retention in STEM majors, particularly among the at-risk.\n\nProject personnel have published one article and have one in press.  They have presented information about orals at more than 20 conferences, and they have established successful oral review programs at Seattle, Penn State, George Mason, and Shippensberg Universities where data show similar results to those of UCB.  Fledgling programs are also underway at Santa Clara University and Florida International as well as at Front Range Community College and two Colorado high schools.\n\nOral reviews are based on a constructivist theory that purports that students must create their own knowledge.  In our project, oral reviews allowed students to construct their own knowledge through mathematical discourse.  Oral reviews are voluntary and ungraded, and generally last an hour with five students and one facilitator.  Students are asked conceptual questions and are expected to actively discuss ideas and make mathematical connections by negotiating meaning with their peers and the facilitator.  Scripted questions form the basis of the discussions.  Oral reviews help students clear up misconceptions and vague understandings, and help them determine how well they are prepared for the coming written exam.  The reviews also allow the facilitators to better understand student thinking and identify student misconceptions.\n\nIn these oral reviews, mathematical procedures (like taking the derivative of a function) play a minor role.  Instead students are asked to explain the purpose of procedures (e.g., how can integration help you solve a problem), and to draw a representation of the procedures (like linearization), and then explain how the representation is related to the formula or process.  This helps students use the procedures correctly in solving novel problems.  Students leave the reviews with a much better idea of what they understand and don\u00c6t understand, and this helps them use their study time more effectively in preparing for the upcoming written exam.  Besides improving students\u00c6 conceptual understanding, orals boost students\u00c6 confidence.  Analysis shows that students attend more regularly and participate more actively in classes that offer orals. \n\nCUB's Applied Mathematics Department has put in place many supports that are needed for dissemination of the two-semester course and oral reviews to new institutions and more diverse courses.  We have oral review questions for Calculus I, II and III and have the first version of Matrix Methods, PDEs, Fourier Analysis and Cell Biology questions.  In Mechanical Engineering, we have draft questions for three courses, Statics, Dynamics and Component Design, and are currently revising high school algebra questions.  GMU and Seattle have both begun two-semester Calculus I classes.\n\nWe have developed an electronic sign up system, a training tape and supplementary materials, and a web-based fidelity checklist accompanied by a users\u00c6 guide (to chec..."
