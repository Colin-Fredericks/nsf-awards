 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Lai-Sheng Wang of Washington State University, together with his postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, will study the structural evolution and chemical properties of metal clusters.  Topics for investigation include large gold clusters (more than 20 atoms), endohedral gold clusters, tungsten molecules and clusters, as well as gold clusters with chemisorbed CO and oxygen molecules.  These species will be studied through a combination of mass spectrometry, photoelectron spectroscopy combined with theoretical methods.\r\n\r\nGold nanoparticles have a wide range of applications in catalysis, molecular electronics and biology.  Careful studies like those of Prof. Wang and his group build a knowledge base of the electronic and chemical properties of these species which help to inform the various nanotechnology areas where these substances play a role.  The students receiving research training in Prof. Wang's research group will learn to use sophisticated equipment in a unique university/national laboratory environment.  Prof. Wang's gold cluster research has captured the public interest, and Prof. Wang continues to be an excellent ambassador for science.\r\n",
