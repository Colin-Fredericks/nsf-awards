 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Divisions of Biological Infrastructure and Earth Sciences at NSF. Plymouth State University, in cooperation with the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, Hubbard Brook scientists, and the U.S. Forest Service, is offering a unique summer research experience at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  The program emphasizes the societal relevance of ecology and ecosystem science and is designed to appeal to students interested in the interpretation and communication of science to the broader society.  The program is designed for students interested in using science to address environmental issues, as well as those pursuing careers in resource management, teaching, and applied environmental science.  Eight students will be selected for a 10-week study in one of four areas of ecosystem research (animal ecology; biogeochemistry; hydrology and soils; forest vegetation and carbon cycling).  The program focuses on both independent research and the communication of science to lay audiences.  The independent research portion is done by pairing each student with a team of mentors working on a topic within one of the four themes.  The science communication track focuses on a relationship between the student researcher and an outside organization (ex., NGO) which desires an interpretation of ecosystem science information from the students' areas of study.  Participants receive a stipend, a meal allowance, free housing, a small research budget, and assistance with travel.  More information is available at  www.hubbardbrookreu.org , or by contacting Kevin McGuire, (603-535-3250 or kmcguire1@plymouth.edu, or Tim Fahey, (607-255-5470 or tjf5@cornell.edu).",
