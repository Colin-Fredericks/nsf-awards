Visualizations are a common tool for teaching fundamental geoscience concepts and yet what students learn from them or how effective they are at conveying correct information is as yet poorly documented.  Building on similar research within the physics and astronomy communities, this project will conduct studies that compare how well students learn common geoscience concepts when they are taught using 2-D versus 3-D visualizations or when multiple visual representations are used.  The study will also explore how students interpret (or misinterpret) widely used geoscience teaching visuals.  Pre- and post-testing comparisons will be document student comprehension and how it relates to the effectiveness of instructional materials.  Videotaped interviews and analysis will help to clarify student thinking as they interpret visualizations.  Studies will be conducted in both the Florida Institute of Technologys Whole Earth course, taken by a disparate group of students with highly variable background (including many who are pre-service teachers), and the introductory Astronomy course sequence.  The results of this research will lead to improved geoscience education at Florida Tech, particularly for the pre-service teachers participating in the Whole Earth Course. \r\n\r\n",
