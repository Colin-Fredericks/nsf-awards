 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project aims to study the effects of personal and group identity variables on STEM educational outcomes. Longitudinal data will be collected and analyzed on a number of self and other motivational variables to understand how these personal and social factors are likely to determine the educational trajectories and decisions of African-American youth. Little research, though, has addressed developmental changes in stereotype awareness and endorsement, or ramifications of stereotypes and discrimination for identity development and achievement striving in Black adolescents. The proposed study will model the relationship of two salient group memberships, race and gender, with achievement outcomes for Black youth. Prior research has underscored the need to attend to race and gender simultaneously, as well as the importance of evaluating motivational and achievement outcomes within\r\nacademic domains (e.g., English and science).\r\nThe proposed study is an extension and expansion of a previous NSF-funded\r\nlongitudinal study of African American youth. The goal of this follow-up study is to concentrate more explicitly on the simultaneous effects of race-related and gender-related experiences and beliefs and on investigating how these experiences play out across different course content domains (e.g., English, science, and mathematics). Using survey and qualitative methods, the study will describe normative development in self-concept, stereotypes, motivation, and parenting from fifth through twelfth grade. Another important goal of the project is to determine whether the advantages gained by girls in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics(STEM) areas are maintained as they prepare to move through more advanced coursework and college applications, and what personal, family, and school context factors predict STEM interest and success for both genders. The proposed outcomes will aid in the understanding of how self-concept and other self variables impacts motivation as a predictor for success in STEM disciplines which may in turn broaden participation of under represented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objective of this study was to examine the ways that race and gender stereotypes about academic abilities change from fifth to twelfth grade and the implications of those stereotypes on youth motivation.  We began following about 350 African American youth at fifth grade and added a sample of about 600 additional African American and European American youth in tenth grade.\n\nOur first goal was to determine how race and gender stereotypes change as youth move from middle school to high school.  On average, the Black students in our sample endorsed both race and gender academic stereotypes. Whites were viewed as more competent than Blacks across all academic domains.  Interestingly, girls were rated as more competent than boys in math, science, and English. Whereas students' ratings of the academic competence of Whites did not change from Grade 7 to Grade 10, ratings of the academic competence of Blacks dropped across those three years. The magnitude of gender academic stereotypes did not change from Grade 7 to Grade 10 (Skinner et al., 2011).\n\nRace stereotypes had important implications for students\u00c6 academic self-perceptions.  We showed that race-related stereotypes of Black seventh graders related to their perceptions of their own academic abilities.  When youth believed that Blacks tend to do less well in schools than Whites they tended to view their own performance more negatively, even after we accounted for their actual achievement.  We found that this effect was strongest when youth reported that their academic achievement was very important to their sense of self.\n\nWe also found that race and gender stereotypes do not affect all students in the same manner.  In two studies we showed that Black boys\u00c6 self-concepts are related to both race and gender stereotypes.  Black girls\u00c6 stereotypes, though, were more closely related to their gender beliefs, than to those related to race.  We believe that Blacks boys view themselves as embodying race and gender stereotypes, whereas Black girls are more identified with gender stereotypes. \n\nWe also studied parent stereotypes.  On average, the African American mothers in our sample view girls as more competent than boys academically. Moreover, mothers\u00c6 endorsement of this gender stereotype was related both to their perceptions of their own child\u00c6s ability and their expectations for their own children\u00c6s eventual educational attainment with children\u00c6s actual achievement controlled (Wood, Kurtz-Costes, Rowley, &amp; Okeke, 2010). Mothers who viewed boys as less competent than girls academically&mdash;regardless of their children\u00c6s current levels of academic achievement&mdash;had lower educational expectations of their sons, and higher educational expectations of their daughters than did parents with more gender egalitarian beliefs. Our results imply that negative beliefs about the school achievement of African American boys may create a \"negative feedback loop\" that perpetuates the underachievement of Black boys (Wood et al., 2010).\n\nThe project had significant broader implications.  Results have been disseminated in traditional research outlets, such as journals and at national conferences.  In addition, 20 or more doctoral and undergraduate students of color have been trained through their work on the project.  Results were shared with all schools and families that participated.  In addition, the PIs were actively engaged with a number of local, state, and national organizations focused on eliminating race and gender disparities in STEM participation.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie J Rowley"
