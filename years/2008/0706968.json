Two of the central thrusts are topological methods\r\nbased on the ideas of a stratification, and metric measure\r\nspaces, and their analysis, especially their differential\r\ncalculus.  Others are based on cohomology with growth conditions,\r\nor resolution of singularities, intersection homology, sheaf\r\ntheory etc.  Moreover the applications of these studies are\r\ndiverse, from the Novikov conjecture, knot theory, and\r\ntransformation groups to Gromov-Hasudorff convergence techniques\r\nin Riemannian geometry and geometric group theory to problems of\r\ninterest to theoretical computer scientists (embedding finite\r\nmetric spaces in various Banach spaces).  It is anticipated that\r\nas a result of this meeting, progress can be expected in the\r\ndirections of producing analytic geometric structures on singular\r\nspaces, the quasi-isometric theory of groups, and characteristic\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nMany of the basic ideas of analysis and geometry are based on the\r\nidea of linear approximation.  The first example of this is\r\ncalculus itself where linear approximation defines the basic\r\nnotion of the derivative.  A more modern example is the idea of a\r\nmanifold in topology, which is a space that is, in small regions,\r\nwell approximated by Euclidean space.  Countless further\r\ndevelopments have shown the need for more general tools to deal\r\nwith situations where such approximations are not feasible or may\r\nnot exist.  By bringing together workers who have dealt with\r\nthese issues in varied contexts, this conference will spur the\r\ndevelopment of new syntheses and bring to the fore common issues\r\nthat arise in completely different settings. The conference web\r\nsite is http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/Cappelliday.\r\n",
