 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nWith support from the Chemistry Division of the NSF, this research group will develop two distinct but related projects involving fullerenes; one designed to synthesize a family of C60 derivatives containing multiple adducts in a regioselective manner, later to be tested as potential single molecule transistors, and another project that involves the preparation of novel trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes that are potentially useful as MRI and X-Ray contrast agents. The C60 compounds are designed to exhibit unique electronic properties and self-assembling abilities for potential applications in  molecular electronics, specifically as molecular transistors. Specifically, regioselective multiple N-aryl-pyrrolidine adducts of C60 will be synthesized in order to use these groups to selectively connect the compounds to electrode surfaces in order to study their electronic properties. The trimetallic nitride endohedral project involves the preparation of novel compounds containing lanthanide nitrides that have only been recently reported by this group, which possess unique electronic and structural properties of potential value in MRI and X-Ray contrast applications. Of particular interest is the preparation of larger carbon cages than C80, which so far has been the dominant structure with trimetallic nitrides. C88 and C96 cages are targeted for preparation and structural and electronic characterization. The electronic and magnetic properties of the new cages containing the new lanthanide clusters (Nd, Pr, Ce and La nitrides) will be studied and the potential uses of these compounds as MRI and X-Ray contrast agents will be assessed. The overall thrust of the grant is the preparation of new and interesting molecules that will have important real-world applications to benefit society and expand the body of chemical knowledge.  \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nWith support from the Chemistry Division of the NSF, new fullerenes (also known as ?buckyballs?) and their derivatives will be prepared. Fullerenes are closed three dimensional cage compounds, some possessing spherical symmetry, made exclusively of carbon atoms. The new compounds that will be prepared and characterized will be evaluated as potential single molecule electronic devices (transistors and switches) and as potential MRI and X-Ray contrast agents. The group will train and mentor underrepresented minorities, especially Hispanics, at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. The group will also interact and collaborate with groups both within and outside of the USA.  The Project Director has a long and fruitful history in both of these broader impact areas.    \r\n",
