 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northeastern University ADVANCE Institutional Transformation project will systematically integrate concerns about interdisciplinary and international research into the project model for change.  The Advancing Women within Interdisciplinary and International Networks (AWIIN) model for change will transform recruitment practices; strengthen professional networks for women; and develop a forum for comprehensive engagement of leadership to increase accountability and to instill long-lasting changes in institutional policies and practices.\r\n\r\nSpecific interventions target the isolation of women due to their solo status and the challenge to succeed in interdisciplinary and international research environments at Northeastern and beyond. Efforts to improve retention include Interdisciplinary Recruitment Workshops integrated with campus research center conferences and a new Dual Career Network Committee through the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC). Women?s mixed gender networks are strengthened with External Career Mentoring Teams, the improved existing faculty mentoring program, grants to stimulate interdisciplinary and international collaborations, campus-wide networks, and Greater Boston Area Faculty Seminars. The new Leadership Academy is a forum to engage institutional leaders, influential faculty, and rising women leaders in changing institutional policy and organizational practices. The Academy will also be a forum to enhance intercultural gender competence.  A comprehensive research and evaluation program will accompany the interventions to guide design, possible modifications, and to disseminate findings and best practices. The interdisciplinary AWIIN team includes social scientists, faculty, and administrators from science and engineering. All activities are aligned in the current changing environment guided by the new 2007 Academic Plan.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The two original research projects will provide new insights about the skills of individuals, the tools and organizational practices and policies that allow women and men faculty to succeed in and contribute to an increasing interdisciplinary, global enterprise of science and technology. The project on gender and globalization of the academy will identify gender-specific barriers and strategies to international networks and collaboration. The project on gender and social networks will provide insights into gender differences in the involvement of faculty in professional, interdisciplinary, and international networks. These findings will be of interest to individual faculty, researchers, and institutions that are interested in promoting women scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary and international universities.\r\n\r\nAWINN?s broader impacts include the entire institution as interventions will be rolled out to all colleges in the long-term affecting the climate for all students and faculty at Northeastern University. The Leadership Academy will result in a general improvement of management practices and skills across the institution.  Regional workshops will be held to disseminate best practices into colleges and universities in New England. A national conference on gender and internationalization of science in academia will raise national awareness. In addition, Northeastern University will create a Dual Career Network committee as part of the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC) that facilitates dual career needs in the broader Boston academic community. The AWIIN website will provide guides and tools for individuals and other institutions.\r\n",

In year four (2011-12) STRIDE workshops were expanded to all academic disciplines.\n\nTo further support faculty recruitment, the Future Faculty Fellowship (FFF) began in 2012-13. Designed to promote excellence and diversity in the pool of future faculty candidates at Northeastern, the FFF introduces postdoctoral researchers who are considering faculty careers to Northeastern?s academic community.  Two female faculty members were hired through this initiative.  It was expanded to all university disciplines at the end of the grant. \n\nADVANCE experimented with and evaluated several mentoring initiatives, ranging from one-on-one departmental mentors to group mentoring including both internal and external mentors.  These initiatives have raised the visibility and prestige of faculty mentoring and are creating a culture of mentoring. \n\nA highly visible and successful Research Leadership Development Initiative (ReDI) was created to develop a cohort of emerging academic leaders.  A total of 54 mid-career faculty (59% women) have participated with 19 moving into leadership positions and 16 currently participating in the program.\n\nWomen in administrative leadership roles increased from 14 in 2007-08 to 21 in 2014-15.  Female academic deans have increased from 1 in 2007-08 to 4 in 2015-16. \n\nA social network analysis concluded that women faculty members have more than doubled their efforts in both writing proposals and receiving research funding between 2007-08 and 2014-15.  Overall grant activity has increased substantially.\n\nFor funded grants, the rates of increased participation are:\n Individual grants:                     Men up   73%, Women up 152%\n Collaborative grants:               Men up 270%, Women up 367%\n\nCollaboration between women and men on grants has increased significantly over the period of the grant, as has interdisciplinary grant activity.\n\nThe ADVANCE Office of Faculty Development is sustaining the grant activities and reports to the Provost through the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and a Steering Committee composed of faculty, department chairs and deans.
