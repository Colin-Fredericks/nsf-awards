 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear dynamics has historically played a fundamental role in explaining diverse and\r\ncomplex atomic processes, a role which in turn has stimulated numerous theoretical\r\nadvances in classical and quantum chaos. This trend continues as advances in atomic\r\nand optical techniques provide an unprecedented level of control and precision for\r\nexperimental studies of chaos in atomic systems. For example, the time evolution of\r\nhighly localized initial states (e.g. ultrashort optical pulses, Rydberg wavepackets, and\r\nlocalized ensembles of ultracold atoms), can be measured as they evolve and disperse\r\nwithin a chaotic potential, thereby probing the detailed fractal structure in the chaotic\r\nphase space. Such precision tools, however, highlight a fundamental deficiency in\r\ntheoretical nonlinear dynamics; there exists no general framework (in the sense of\r\nsymbolic dynamics) capable of classifying the diversity of chaotic behavior exhibited by\r\ntransport in real physical systems.\r\nThe focus of this proposal is twofold: (i) It will exploit new advances in chaotic dynamics\r\nto motivate, guide, and interpret experiments capable of probing chaotic phase space\r\nwith unprecedented resolution. These include the chaotic transport, ionization, and\r\ncontrol of Rydberg wavepackets as well as the elucidation of novel chaotic pathways for\r\nthe mixing and loss of ultracold atoms in optical traps. (ii) It will develop a nonlinear\r\ndynamics toolbox that can extract an accurate (symbolic dynamics) model for the\r\nstructure of chaotic transport in Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. This\r\nmodel can be made arbitrarily precise, even for systems exhibiting a mixture of chaos\r\nand regularity. The prior success of ?homotopic lobe dynamics? in describing phase\r\nspace transport will serve as a key ingredient of this program. Finally, recognizing the\r\nnatural topological extension of homotopic lobe dynamics to higher dimensional spaces,\r\nthis proposal will address the challenge of chaotic transport in more than two degrees of\r\nfreedom, for which far fewer techniques currently exist.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Classifying chaotic trajectories\n\nRegular, well-behaved mechanical systems are epitomized by the\nperiodic motion of the planets or the regular ticking of a pendulum\nclock.  However, most mechanical systems are not regular, but are\nchaotic, having wild and unpredictable trajectories.  Such chaotic\nsystems exist on the scale of our solar system (asteroid dynamics)\ndown to the scale of atoms (electron dynamics).  Much is still unknown\nabout such systems, including a general technique to classify the\nvaried behaviors chaotic trajectories may exhibit.\n\nOne of the main successes of this project was the development and\nimplementation of a technique for classifying chaotic trajectories in\nsystems with two degrees of freedom; such systems include, for\nexample, the motion of an atomic electron in applied electric and\nmagnetic fields.  These two-degree-of-freedom systems are difficult to\ncharacterize, in part, because their motion can be both chaotic or\nregular, depending on the initial conditions of the system.  We\ndeveloped a theoretical foundation (called homotopic lobe dynamics) to\nclassify such trajectories through symbolic labeling.  We also devised\na way to partition a system's behavior into qualitatively distinct\nstates.  Finally, we developed a computational toolbox (in Matlab)\nthat automates this classification and partitioning scheme on the\ncomputer.  One application that this toolbox can achieve is the\nlabeling and computation of periodic motion of chaotic systems.  Such\nperiodic motion is the starting point for numerous applications in\ndynamical systems theory and in quantum mechanics.\n\nTurnstile ionization: theory and experiments\n\nUnder appropriate conditions, the ionization of an atom occurs via\nchaotic dynamics.  Such conditions occur, for example, when a highly\nexcited atom is subjected to a series of electromagnetic pulses.  We\nproposed, and theoretically demonstrated, that this ionization would\noccur via a chaotic mechanism called a \"phase space turnstile\".  The\nturnstile is, in essence, a kind of \"trap door\" that promotes an\nelectron from a bound to an unbound state.  Collaborating with the\natomic research laboratory of Barry Dunning at Rice University, we\ndemonstrated that this turnstile mechanism can be seen experimentally\nin real potassium atoms.  The turnstile geometry was clearly imprinted\non the time-dependence of the ionization behavior.  Importantly, this\nmeans that by tailoring the turnstile geometry, one can exert control\nover the ionization process.\n\nEscape of Bose-Einstein condensates from a chaotic trap\n\nIn collaboration with Boaz Ilan, we numerically studied the escape of\na small cloud of ultra-cold (technically, Bose-condensed) atoms from a\nchaotic trap.  The atomic cloud sloshed around in the trap, exhibiting\nthe expected chaotic behavior.  Since the trap had a \"hole\" in it,\nsome atoms would leak out, creating a very complex time-dependence to\nthe leakage.  We saw fractal structure in this time-dependence, as\nwell as quantum interference effects.  (Fractals are geometric\npatterns with detailed, fine-scale structure visible at all levels of\nresolution as one zooms in on the pattern.)  Importantly, we found\nthat attractive interactions between the atoms not only suppressed the\nquantum interference but also enhanced the fractal resolution.\n\nReaction fronts in fluid flows\n\nThe chaotic dynamics seen in atomic systems is a general phenomenon\nseen in many other systems, including the motion of fluids like water;\nthis is an indication of the interconnected nature of nonlinear\ndynamics.  In this spirit, our study of chaos in atomic systems led to\na study of chaos in the dynamics of reaction fronts growing outward\nwithin a flowing fluid.  This work was inspired by a collaboration\nwith Tom Solomon, an experimental physicist at Bucknell University.\nOur main achievement in this work was the identification of new\ngeometric structures, called burning invariant manifolds, that form\none-way barriers to reaction front p..."
