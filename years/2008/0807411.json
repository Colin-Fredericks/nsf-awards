The kissing problem\r\nin x dimensions is the question of how many unit spheres can\r\ntouch (kiss) a unit sphere in x dimensions.  The new ideas\r\ndeveloped in these works pave the way for further advances in the\r\nproblems of bounding the size of codes and in a number of other\r\nproblems in distance geometry. \r\n\r\n     The main problems to be addressed in the project are related\r\nto bounding the size of optimal sets of points on a sphere when\r\nthe sets have a certain property, and the links between the\r\nbounding problem and multivariate positive definite polynomials. \r\nInteresting properties of the point set include having a minimum\r\nangular separation that exceeds a given value between any two\r\npoints in the set (this is relevant for signal processing\r\nproblems), and supporting an exact cubature formula for spherical\r\nharmonic functions of a given degree.  Applications of the point\r\nsets studied include communication theory, numerical analysis,\r\nthe meshing problem, data representation, and localization in\r\nsensor networks.",
