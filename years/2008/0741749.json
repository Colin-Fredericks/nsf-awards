 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Television will produce six new episodes for the Dragonfly TV GPS (Going Places in Science) series in order to inform a mass audience of children, adults and educators about the revolutionary advances taking place in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The new programs will shine the DragonflyTV GPS spotlight on the network of science museums in the NISE Network, showcasing the new nanoscience programs and exhibits that are currently being developed.  DragonflyTV, a weekly science television series targeted at children ages 8-12, presents children engaged in inquiry-based investigations, on-location in science centers across America.   Each investigation will demonstrate the direct connection between learning experiences in science centers and the application of those lessons in everyday life.  Each Nanoworld episode will apply the Dragonfly \"Real Kids . . . Real Science\" model, communicating both the scientific process and basic concepts in nanoscience.  The DragonflyTV GPS will involve collaboration with the NISE Network, led by the Museum of Science in Boston, the Exploratorium, and the Science Museum of Minnesota. The episodes will be distributed by PBS Plus.  Ancillary products will include an Educator's Guide, a Nanoworld poster, and a website featured on pbskids.org/go.  Multimedia Research and will conduct formative and summative evaluations of the television production.  Inverness Research will evaluate the collaborative process between TPT and the museum partners, and identify specific lessons learned by each group.",
