It will comprehensively synthesize peer-reviewed research but will also examine additional types of knowledge that influence the field. The project methods adapt those of Knowledge Management and Dissemination project, funded by NSF MSP and seeks to further advance the scope and rigor of knowledge synthesis. The reasons identified for this interest are: (a) PLCs ameliorate undesirable working conditions leading to dissatisfaction that drive teachers from the classroom; (b) PLCs are grounded in theory developed in the literature on how people learn; and (c) PLCs are supported by initial research on the effectiveness of modes of professional development that involves sustained collaborative effort over time, with an emphasis on tasks that are authentic to the participants? work. Researchers systematically find relevant knowledge and evaluate the methodological integrity and evidentiary utility of each research study or knowledge claim. Four kinds of knowledge on this topic are being analyzed and synthesized: (1) empirical and descriptive studies published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) research published in venues other than peer-reviewed journals (including online); (3) published expert knowledge and advice located in periodicals or on websites, and (4) current practice-based knowledge acquired through an online Expert Practitioner Panel.\r\n\r\n",
