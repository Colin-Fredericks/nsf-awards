As new numerical methods being developed, new geometric\r\nconstraint formulations that are key in the accuracy and convergence\r\nanalysis of these methods emerge. In this two-year project, practical\r\nand theoretically sound algorithmic solutions for a number of\r\ntriangulation problems will be studied. More importantly, new software\r\nbased on these solutions will be developed and made available to the\r\npublic. In particular, first ever software for computing acute and\r\nnon-obtuse triangulation problems will be deployed. Such software are\r\nsought for in scientific computing as a geometric tool to be coupled\r\nwith the widely used finite volume methods as well as in graphics\r\napplications. Practical algorithmic solutions for other triangulation\r\nproblems such as minimum weight Steiner triangulations which is\r\nexpected to find use in networking applications, will also be studied.\r\nIn addition, parallelization of the aformentioned algorithmic\r\nsolutions will be studied within this project. The project will ensure\r\nits broader impact through distribution and integration of new robust\r\nsoftware. Project personnel consists of one graduate student that will\r\nbe selected among underrepresented groups in engineering.\r\n____________________________________________\r\n",
