This project is designed to study the ways in which these materials enable students to develop a deeper understanding of statistical concepts.  These comprehensive modules are web-based, utilize the low-cost yet computationally powerful statistical software StatCrunch, contain interactive multimedia presentations for students, and include extensive instructor materials.  While the materials can serve as a stand-alone course, they are also modular so that parts can also be integrated into a course which is taught using a typical introductory statistics textbook.  The INCIST resources are useful for statistics instructors at a large number of institutions including those teaching at community colleges and smaller liberal arts colleges.  This project also holds workshops to train instructors on using the modules in their courses.",
