 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tuskegee University's Center for Advanced Materials (T-CAM), is requesting HBCU-RISE support to further strengthened the Ph.D. Program by providing additional depth and breadth to the curriculum; incorporating new areas of research; supporting start-up funds for junior faculty; and providing professional development activities for doctoral students that includes skills development in several areas as well as internships in external laboratories. Intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the fact that the involvement of students in the cutting-edge research in advanced materials, particularly, nano-bio materials, and the offering of a vide range of new courses, will lead to the production of graduates who can successfully handle materials development challenges posed by the future technological advancements.  T-CAM contributes significantly to the basic and applied research in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). The T-CAM faculty members, who support research and education of a large number of minority undergraduate and graduate students, have developed state-of-the-art facilities to conduct research in many aspects of advanced materials and acquired expertise in chemical synthesis and analysis, processing/manufacturing, performance evaluation, and modeling of advanced materials and structures.  Therefore the broader impacts of this project include production of a large number of African American graduates at the Ph.D. level, in emerging areas of materials science and engineering with excellent communication and interpersonal skills developed through industrial experience and international exposure which will result in a profound impact on the economic development of the state and the region.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
