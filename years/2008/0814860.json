 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical Biology and Biomathematics will be held June 22 - 27 at Il Ciocco, Lucca (Barga) Italy.  The goal of this conference is to bring together established and young investigators from the field of quantitative biology to share new approaches and discuss advances in this exciting and rapidly growing field of biology.  Nine sessions are planned on the topics: Signaling and Bacterial Chemotaxis, Cancer, Cell Division, Collective Animal Motion, Mechanics and Neurophysiology of Locomotion, Protein Receptor Signaling and Transport, Oscillations in Biology, Stochastic Modeling in Biology, and Complex Fluids in Biology.  The breadth of topics covers many spatial and temporal scales of biological phenomena.  Each session will begin with an introduction to the field by the session chair followed by two or three invited talks. In addition to the formal sessions, there will be two afternoon poster sessions. The session chairs and invited speakers are either established leaders or energetic new researchers who are at the forefront of quantitative biology.  Invited speakers have been selected based on their expertise and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender, minority representation, and seniority.\r\n\r\nThe conference's multidisciplinary nature fosters new collaborations between biologists and researchers from the mathematical sciences. It provides an ideal setting for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with leaders in the field of theoretical biology.\r\nThe novel, European, setting for this year's conference provides a unique opportunity to broaden contacts between scientists and students from North America and those from Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The breadth of topics represented at the meeting exposes researchers to new mathematical and computational tools that are being developed in fields different from their own.  The conference provides a collegial and inclusive environment that encourages the participation of women and other groups that are underrepresented in science.",
