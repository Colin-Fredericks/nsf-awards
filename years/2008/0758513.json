The aim of this symposium is to provide an update on some of the crustacean genomics projects that were underway, but not yet completed, two years ago during a similar symposium that was held at SICB. In addition, the 2008 symposium will include several speakers and crustacean genomics projects that were not represented at the past SICB meeting. By featuring researchers who are studying a variety of taxa, this symposium will showcase the diversity of crustacean models used in genomics-based research in order to foster collaborative efforts. The line-up of speakers includes junior and senior scientists and members from groups underrepresented in science. Outcomes from the genomics projects presented in this symposium will be published independently, as well as summarized in a single manuscript to be submitted to one of the SICB sponsored journals.",
