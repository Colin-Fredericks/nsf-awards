 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the proposal is to collect and quantify black carbon colloids\r\n(BC) in water samples from Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake in the wake of the Lake\r\nTahoe basin Angora fire. The sampling program will collect near-shore, mid-lake and\r\noutlet river samples from Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe. In addition to sampling\r\nconducted by the project, we will leverage pre-existing sampling programs such as the\r\nUC-Davis Mid-Lake Tahoe Profile (MLTP), which collects depth profiles from the lake\r\nevery 30 days. A proposal will be submitted in December to the NSF Hydrologic\r\nSciences to interpret the data resulting from the SGER.\r\nScientific merit\r\nLittle is known regarding black carbon colloids, produced by incomplete\r\ncombustion, in aquatic systems. However these nano-particles are now believed to be\r\nan important component of the global carbon cycle, the hydrologic cycle, global\r\nwarming, accelerated snow pack and glacier melt, fresh water and marine chemistry and\r\nsediment geochemistry. Recent studies of BC in seawater and marine sediments\r\nsuggest that BC may have a very long residence time in the ocean and fresh water\r\nbodies. These particles may also determine the partitioning of many toxic organic\r\ncompounds in aquatic ecosystems. To our knowledge there have been no studies of BC\r\ncolloids in a lake system following a major fire in its basin.\r\nObjectives\r\n. Collect and analyze BC in water samples from Lake Tahoe and Fallen Leaf Lake\r\nover a two year period after the Angora Fire.\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThe project represents a rare opportunity to study the impact of a fire on BC\r\ncolloids and determine how these colloids impact the aquatic environment. The results of\r\nthe project may have wide ranging impacts on the global Earth Science Community as\r\nwell as the Lake Tahoe community. For example, if the study can establish the\r\nresidence time of BC in the lake, we will be able to determine the impact of BC on the\r\nlakes optical properties and chemistry over time. The results from the study may then be\r\napplied to other lakes and rivers. The data will be used by Federal and State\r\npolicymakers and local planners to evaluate and implement environmental policy in the\r\nLake Tahoe area. The project will communicate the results to the Lake Tahoe\r\nstakeholders and scientific community through journal publications and public meetings.\r\n",
