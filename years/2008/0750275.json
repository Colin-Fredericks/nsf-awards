 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Uwe Bunz has proposed a new type of cross-shaped chromophore (XF, cruciform, 1,4-bis(aryl-ethynyl)-2,5-distyrylbenzenes) in which the frontier molecular orbitals are localized on the two different axes.  The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is localized on the distyrylbenzene axis, while the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is localized on the bis(arylethynyl) transverse. This orbital arrangement translates electronic properties into spatial patterns; the XFs will contain metal coordinating electron-donating substituents on the distyrylbenzene axis and metal coordinating acceptors on the bis(arylethynyl) transverse achieving two-stage sensing of different metal cations.  The addition of two analytes with the resulting fluorescence changes will be used to construct a Logic Table. The analytes are the input and the fluorescence change the output.   They plan to deposit the XFs with and without metal salts onto solid supports to obtain sensor arrays for volatile organic compounds.  The combination of different fluorophores and the use of the same fluorophore complexed with different metals will lead to changes in emissive properties when exposed to analytes such as volatile amines due to reversible decomplexation/protonation or deprotonation. \r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThis chemistry will potentially allow detecting toxic metal ions in water and toxic volatile amines in the atmosphere using simple test strips impregnated with different XF-type fluorophores.  The research will develop a molecular logic based upon recognition of different analytes with XFs for molecular computing.  Educational Impact: The PI has an active outreach program with an inner city high school (Tri-Cities High). He has had and will have high school students in his laboratory working on the sensing of model analytes using either solutions of XFs and/or XFs immobilized on solid supports such as highly silanized silica gel to attract bright students into chemistry.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
