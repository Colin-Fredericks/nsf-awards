The goal is to explore how current in a transistor channel is influenced by nano-sized adsorbates, ranging from random impurities to precision-engineered quantum dots. The study will enable the design of novel devices such as memories and sensors, operating on the controlled insertion and manipulation of molecular 'traps'. The approach is to couple the channel and dot electrons -- at the formal level by solving their respective dynamical equations to match their response functions, and at the computational level by employing embedding techniques to match their interfacial band-structures. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nUnderstanding the dynamics at the nano-micro interface will prove crucial to the design of emerging devices that will involve a mixture of length, time and energy scales. The study will enhance fundamental understanding of many-body effects in quantum transport. It will bridge disciplines, materials, and ultimately, the boundary between fundamental science and technological applications. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nThe research will allow the engineering of hybrid devices operating on fundamentally new principles, while still interfacing with present-day silicon technology. Nano-science will be made accessible to Albemarle middle schools through 'hands-on', experiential learning, and to K-12  students and teachers in partnership with the Science Museum of Virginia. Web-based education tools will be deployed on the UVa Virtual Lab, the NSF-sponsored Computational NanoHUB and a nanoscience curriculum under development. Minority students will be engaged through activities involving the university's Center for Diversity in Engineering. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
