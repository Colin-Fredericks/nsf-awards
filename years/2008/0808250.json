 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Chicago under the direction of Dr. Peter J. Makovicky to study the evolution and systematics of the Pelecaniformes (pelicans, cormorants, and other large water birds).  The project will improve the doctoral dissertation research of Nathan D. Smith.  This group of birds is an ideal model for the study of living and fossil species.  This group of birds exhibits an exceptional fossil record and remarkably disparate morphologies, but their evolutionary relationships are poorly known.  This project will unite data from molecules, morphology, and paleontology to examine evolutionary patterns within Pelecaniformes. Morphology and DNA data will be used to resolve phylogenetic relationships, and a synthesis of the fossil record will elucidate relationships of key fossil taxa. These data will be used to investigate the sensitivity of molecular dating methods, compare relationships supported by molecular genetic data with those of the fossil record, and explore rates of evolution and potential cases of morphological convergence.\r\n\r\nThis research has broader implications for issues of dataset combination and divergence time estimation in systematic biology. This study will also educate the public about paleontology, evolution, and biodiversity. Results will be used to update exhibits of fossil birds in the Field Museum of Natural History. Smith will collaborate with the FMNH to enhance explanatory material accompanying the Harris Educational Loan Program, and to create programming for the Illinois High School Transformation Project that focuses on paleontology and evolution.\r\n",
