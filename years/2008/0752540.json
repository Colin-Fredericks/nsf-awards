 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a series of workshops to be organized and held by the American Physical Society aimed at improving the communication and negotiation skills of female physicists.  These workshops, modeled on ones initiated by the Committee on the Advancement of Women in Chemistry (COACh), are a continuation of a previous series of workshops which have sought to address the under representation of women in physics at all levels from undergraduate students to full professors and on into prominent leadership roles in the field.  This award will allow the continuation of the initial workshops and also offers two new aspects: 1) to include female postdoctoral fellows for the professional skills development workshops and 2) to specifically target women of color to be included in all workshops.  The object of the program is to continue to give tools to women physicists that will best allow them to succeed and advance in the current environment.  Building role models at the senior levels is especially important in order to inspire the next generation.  This activity is funded through both the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
