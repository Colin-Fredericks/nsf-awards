The project?s broad goal is to identify promising tools and strategies that policymakers, school officials, administrators, and educators could use to improve the retention of mathematics and science teachers to enhance the quality, quantity and diversity of the teacher workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses two specifically related research questions: (1) what impact have accountability policies and practices had on the retention of mathematics and science teachers?  (2) What impact have teacher preparation, education and training trends, and levels had on the retention of mathematics and science teachers? \r\n\r\nTo address these questions the project analyzes data on mathematics and science teachers from multiple cycles of the National Center for Education Statistics? (NCES) nationally representative Schools and Staffing Survey (SSS) and its supplement the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS).  \r\n\r\n",
