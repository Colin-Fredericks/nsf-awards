 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2008 the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) will end nearly three decades of providing electron-positron collisions for the CLEO experiment. At that time it will be possible to reconfigure CESR as a test accelerator, CesrTA, for important accelerator R&D work directed to high intensity beam development and the International Linear Collider (ILC) project. CESR offers a unique opportunity with which to investigate beam physics and instrumentation critical to the design and operation of the ILC component known as \"damping rings\" that are perhaps the most challenging accelerator system in the ILC and other possible projects.. The changes required to make CESR available as a test accelerator are modest so that research results will be available in a timely fashion. \r\n\r\nThe scientific broader impacts of this work are significant. The use of real time measurements for the optimization of beam performance via interactive algorithms has applications in several other areas of research of high complexity. The fast x-ray profile monitors being developed here and the other instrumentation developed for CesrTA will be very useful for synchrotron radiation research and other accelerator applications. Of primary importance for the broader impact of this work is the hands-on training of accelerator and x-ray beam line scientists that serve around the world as principals and staff of laboratories for nuclear and particle physics and x-ray science. \r\n\r\nFurther, faculty, staff and students participate in a broad gauged program of outreach and education involving graduate and undergraduate students and the general public with special emphasis on K-12. The laboratory's intellectual and physical resources are used to promote the adventure of science directly to young people as well as to provide workshops and direct \r\nsupport for teachers of science in their own classrooms and in group settings on campus. In addition, the Lab has been collaborating with underrepresented populations in both urban settings of New York City and rural areas here on the edge of Appalachia. Creation of materials for the classroom is also an important part of this work in helping teachers in New York State deal with changing science curricula.",
