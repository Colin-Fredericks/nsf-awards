Trinkle; Materials Science and Engineering; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign \r\nLouis G. Hector, Jr.; General Motors Technical Center; Warren, Michigan \r\n\r\nThe University of Illinois and General Motors will collaborate on a computer modeling study of how different chemical additions?like aluminum and zinc as well as more exotic elements?change the strength of the metal magnesium to design new magnesium alloys for widespread use.  The computer model starts with an understanding of how atoms bind to each other to model changes in chemical bonds as the metal is bent and shaped.  Different chemical additions further change the bonding, which makes the alloy stronger/weaker, or ductile/brittle.  Modeling changes in strength and ductility allows researchers to design and optimize new magnesium alloys in a computer, rather than through expensive trial-and-error approaches.  In addition, the quantitative understanding of chemical bonding from atoms is built into computer models for the shaping and behavior of real automobile parts.\r\n\r\nMagnesium alloys have two-thirds the density of aluminum; replacing many of the steel and aluminum body pieces in an automobile with magnesium can significantly reduce the weight of a vehicle, which reduces fuel consumption by nearly 30% and a substantial reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases.  The computer modeling will allow the design of new alloys much more rapidly, and allow magnesium alloys to enter widespread use for transportation.  Students at Illinois will learn first-hand the connection of academic research to industrial development, and materials science that benefits society.  Moreover, Prof. Trinkle and Dr. Hector will work with high school science teachers in Illinois and Detroit doing in-class presentations and demonstrations about the use of materials science to combat global warming.\r\n",
