 "awd_abstract_narration": "The integrity of commodity operating system kernels is threatened by rootkits\r\nthat modify key kernel data structures to achieve a variety of malicious goals.\r\nWhile rootkits have historically been known to affect control data in the\r\nkernel, recent work demonstrates rootkits that affect system security by\r\nmodifying non-control data, such as linked lists used to manage bookkeeping\r\ninformation and metadata used for memory management. Existing techniques fail\r\nto detect such rootkits effectively.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing techniques to provide real-time protection against\r\nrootkits by detecting anomalies in both control and non-control kernel data\r\nbehavior using automatically-generated integrity specifications. This goal is\r\nbeing achieved in two steps.  First, a technique to mine specifications of\r\nkernel data structure integrity is being developed. These specifications are be\r\nmined automatically as data structure invariants.  Second, these techniques are\r\nbeing extended using operating system support to provide real-time detection.\r\n\r\nImpacts and Results: The techniques developed in this project will defend\r\nagainst the next generation of rootkits, and will enable real-time detection of\r\nsuch rootkits.  In addition, techniques to infer kernel invariants \r\nmay also find applications in operating system reliability, fault tolerance and\r\nsoftware engineering. The PIs will disseminate the results by releasing the \r\ntools developed.  The results of this project will equip the workforce with an\r\ninter-disciplinary toolkit, that combines operating systems, computer security,\r\nand software engineering, to address the challenges posed by the next\r\ngeneration of stealth malware.  \r\n",
