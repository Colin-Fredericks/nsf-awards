 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project summary\r\n\r\nThe workshop proposed here is intended to bring together the relevant NSF research communities to discuss NetSE activities undertaken by the computing research community and the recently announced NetSE program, and to facilitate future collaboration by providing a workshop environment for researchers from different communities to meet. \r\n\r\nThe Community Computing Council (CCC) created the NetSE Council. In addition to this workshop, the NetSE Council will hold five topical, invitational workshops on aspects of NetSE. One of the goals of this workshop is to allow the open community of potential proposers to hear about the research agenda and results of these different workshops. This meeting will tie together the external planning process of the NetSE Council with the internal planning process within NSF in a timely manner consistent with the schedule imposed by the NetSE solicitation deadlines.\r\n\r\nThe NetSE solicitation describes a new structure for research related to the future of networking, and calls for new concepts, new approaches, and new ways of doing research. Because of the novelty of this solicitation, it is important that potential proposers have the opportunity to hear about the program from the relevant NSF program officers, learn about the preliminary work that has been done to frame and define this initiative, to talk to potential collaborators, and to ask questions that will help them better position their own research interests.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\n\r\nWhile the main objective of the workshop is informational, we anticipate that the integrated presentations concerning the various NetSE Council workshops and the following breakout sessions can lead to fresh insights and research ideas. It is the goal of this workshop to excite the relevant research communities about the new approaches to research that are embodied in NetSE.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this workshop is broad impact?outreach across a broad set of research communities, broader than would normally respond to a solicitation concerning network design. The goal of NetSE is to engage research across multiple disciplines within CISE, and to reach out even beyond CISE to the social sciences, law and humanities to get their points of view about the future of our global networks. This workshop, with broad outreach, is a central component of that objective.\r\n",
