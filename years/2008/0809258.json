 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Kit H. Bowen of the Johns Hopkins University, together with his undergraduate, graduate and high school student researchers, will investigate a broad range of chemical topics using gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopy.  Some of the systems and topics to be studied include biomolecule anions and clusters, electron-induced proton transfer, diffuse (Rydberg) electron systems, and circular dichroism effects in chiral anions.  These are wide-ranging experiments that probe fundamental questions in chemistry.  Data from these studies will be of interest to theorists as well as other experimentalists.\r\n\r\nStudies conducted in the Bowen laboratory are aimed primarily at understanding the ways in which electrons interact with molecules.  By studying these interactions in well-controlled gas-phase systems, experimentalists like Bowen provide useful data to understand the chemistry and physics of more complex systems.  The acid-base studies that are one of the key components of the present work will shed new light on this simple and ubiquitous form of chemical reaction.  In addition to the broad scientific impact of the work in the Bowen laboratory, this project will enable a broad range of young scientists -- from high-school to graduate student researchers -- to pursue cutting-edge physical chemistry research.  In addition, Prof. Bowen has a long record of outreach to underrepresented groups and this work will continue.\r\n",

Here, we summarize selected accomplishments. There exists a close relationship between proton transfer and hydrogen bonding, both being ubiquitous in chemistry and especially in chemical biology. Many processes depend on interactions with their molecular environments in order to proceed. In some cases, even what appear to be elementary acid-base reactions actually do not proceed, I.e., proton transfer does not occur, unless they are \"helped\" by some outside interaction. In particular, we found that reactions between single molecules of ammonia and hydrogen halides, which do not proceed on their own, are induced to occur by the addition of an excess electron. This opened the door to the study of electron-driven proton transfer processes both in acid-base chemistry and in electron-induced radiation biology. Hydrogen bonding is often the outside interaction that \"helps\" some chemical processes occur. Some enzymologists have proposed that low barrier hydrogen bonds are responsible for the extraordinary rate enhancements seen in enzyme catalysis, this being a collection of poorly understood catalytic processes on which life itself depends. For their mechanism to be plausible, however, the strengths of such hydrogen bonds would have to be unexpectedly high. We have provided spectroscopic data that sets an upper limit on what is energetically possible and in the process shown that their proposed mechanism is tenable. In another category of studies that we have done, we have studied electron interactions with bio-molecules. This is important because ionizing radiation produces low energy electrons which are known to do biological damage. We asked, how does the attachment of excess electrons to bio-moleucles modify their properties?&nbsp; We examined electron interactions with a variety of systems, including nucleic acid base pairs, base pairs with weak acids, hydrated nucleosides (to mimic aqueous environments), chemotherapeutic agents (molecules), bioinorganic complexes, and peptides. All of these relate to elementary processes occurring in radiation biology. In another category of studies, we explored the properties of dipole bound negative ions and their realtionship to normal (valence) negative ions. In dipole bound negative ions, the excess eelctron if bound by the diploar electric field of a highly polar molecule, whereas in valence negative ions, the excess electron is described as residing in a defined molecular orbital.&nbsp; We have conducted experiments where we saw the transition occur between these two types of negative ions in the same chemical system. Dipole binding states have been proposed as \"stepping stone\" or \"doorway\" states by which electrons get a \"toe-hold\" onto highly polar molecules, this being the initial step in many other phenomena. In addition, we have also studied other topics, such as the solvent stabilization of otherwise unstable negative ions, the energetics of super-alkali molecules, and the electronic structure of the simplest metal clusters. All of these experiments were conducted via negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy. In this technique, a beam of mass-selected negative ions is crossed with a fixed-frequency light beam and the resulting photodetached electrons (photoelectrons) are then energy analyzed. Since one knows the frequency of the light and measures the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, the difference provides the electron binding energies of the various spectroscopic transitions in the recorded spectra.
