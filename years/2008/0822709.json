 "awd_abstract_narration": "Olfactory cues play important roles in the lives of insects, providing information about biologically relevant resources such as food, mates, and oviposition sites. Moths are among the most economically significant agricultural pests, but an understanding of the sensory cues controlling oviposition choice in adult moths is lacking.  This study utilizes an experimentally favorable moth (the giant moth Manduca sexta) to advance the understanding of the behavioral control of oviposition and the olfactory cues that may lead to progress in pest control. This project will investigate the neural mechanisms that allow this specialist insect to evaluate appropriate plants for oviposition. Using a mutualistic system between the hostplant, Datura wrightii, and its primary pollinator and larval host, Manduca sexta, will allow inference about adaptive behavior and function of olfactory systems in general. This project encompasses three levels of analysis: behavioral, neurophysiological, and chemical. First, the host plant odors mediating attraction and repellence for oviposition will be analyzed. Second, neural responses of olfactory neurons in the brain of moths to stimulation with the hostplant odors and the chemical constituents within the odors will be studied. This will reveal specific odor compounds that activate neural pathways controlling oviposition behavior. As a final step, these bio-active volatile compounds will be tested in behavioral oviposition experiments. To strengthen the societal relevance of our research and broaden its impact, we will: (1) involve undergraduate students in multidisciplinary basic research; (2) increase participation of minority students and women in biological science and enrollment in baccalaureate degree programs; (3) foster faculty and student interaction between a Community College and a Ph.D.-granting university; (4) provide educational outreach in science for students at several levels of K-16 education; (5) commit to translational research in a broader sense, owing to the impacts of insects on human health and welfare.",
