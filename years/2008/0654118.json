 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the National Science Foundation to Florida State University supports the renewed operation of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) for a five year period, 2008-2013. The Laboratory supports 7 High Magnetic Field User Programs across the three campuses of the NHMFL at Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Each user program is built around unique magnetic-field facilities and world-leading scientific expertise. These user programs are the Steady-State (DC) Resistive Electromagnets, Pulsed Electromagnets, Ultra-Low Temperature, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Electron Magnetic Resonance, Ion Cyclotron Resonance, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) User Programs. Access to the User Programs will be provided on a competitive basis to the most meritorious proposals submitted from an international and interdisciplinary scientific community spanning materials science, condensed matter physics, magnet technology, chemistry, and biology. The NHMFL's nationally recognized education and public outreach programs will utilize the laboratory's scientists, infrastructure, and Web site to target K-12 students, and undergraduates and teachers via the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET) programs, to expand research and mentorship programs for female or minority graduate students and early career scientists that are tailored to advance each individual's career goals. The laboratory will implement a diversity plan which is designed to put it in a leadership position in this regards.",
