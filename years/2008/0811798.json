 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this proposal is to evaluate the use of instantaneous, chip-wide global information for increasing performance and reducing power and cost in large-scale, chip multi-processors (CMPs).  Using global information contradicts conventional thinking because it has been assumed that traversing the entire chip requires many clock periods.  Recently developed circuits, however, enable single-cycle, chip-wide signaling, suggesting new possibilities of combining global and local information simultaneously.  Further, similar ideas have not been previously implemented in large, traditional multi-chip systems because design flexibility, interconnect configurability, and transistor performance improvements exist only on chip.\r\n\r\nPreliminary exploration has identified both the required interconnect circuits and opportunities for hardware and software to take advantage of up-to-date global information. The research plans to exploit new circuit techniques that will enable the proposed network-on-chip (NOC)with hybrid interconnect (NOCHI) architecture, which has both a data plane using conventional interconnect techniques and an ultra low-latency control plane with a global interconnect. Because NOCHI ignores established design patterns, understanding the circuit properties is essential for the architectural studies, which include: new algorithms that can better control and regulate power consumption within the network and across cores; improved interaction of the cores with the off-chip memory system to reduce demands on on-chip network resources; the ramifications of global information on cache coherence and management; and software controlled, ultra low-latency efficient synchronization for multicores.\r\n",
