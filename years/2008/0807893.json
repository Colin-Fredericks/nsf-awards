It is also\r\nclosely related to other mathematical problems such as\r\noptimization problems and complementarity problems.  The\r\ninvestigator and her colleagues study the mathematical structure\r\nof certain finite-dimensional variational conditions, develop\r\nsolution algorithms, and apply these to handle model input\r\nuncertainty in practice.  Specifically, they investigate the\r\ninfluence of the major constraint qualifications on the structure\r\nof the variational condition, to identify conditions that\r\nindicate nice solution behavior and are more general than the\r\ncurrent nondegeneracy condition.  Based on these conditions, they\r\nanalyze the sensitivity and stability of a variational condition\r\nwith respect to perturbations in both the function and the set in\r\nits formulation, provide criteria to identify classes of\r\npractical problems that satisfy these conditions, and design and\r\njustify algorithms for solving these problems.  They also apply\r\nknowledge gained in this work to other areas dealing with model\r\ninput uncertainty, such as robust programming and stochastic\r\noptimization. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies a mathematical model called\r\nvariational condition.  This is a general model that\r\ncharacterizes an equilibrium status.  For example, it can model\r\nan economic equilibrium that predicts commodity prices, sector\r\nactivities, and consumer consumptions, or a force equilibrium\r\nthat describes the geometry and dynamics of a mechanical\r\nstructure, or a traffic flow equilibrium in a transportation or\r\ncomputer network.  Thus, this model provides a unified framework\r\nfor a very large number of equilibrium problems from areas\r\nincluding economic policy studies, structural engineering,\r\ntransportation, computer networks, materials science, and other\r\nareas.  It is also closely related to some other important\r\nmathematical problems, such as optimization problems; it can be\r\nregarded as a generalization of optimization problems.  In this\r\nproject, the investigator and her colleagues seek to develop\r\nbetter insight into the mathematical structure of this problem,\r\nand to exploit this insight to produce better computational\r\nalgorithms and the means for justifying them.  They investigate\r\nwhat the solutions of this problem look like, how they change\r\ncorresponding to changes in the model input, how to find a\r\nsolution quickly and robustly, and how to identify practical\r\nproblems that are easy to solve and have robust behavior. \r\nSuccess in the work helps to better understand, analyze and solve\r\nthe broad class of equilibrium problems.",
