 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate the establishment of a new REU Site at the Physics Department of the University of Memphis from 2008-2010. Each year, nine undergraduates will be engaged in research for 10 weeks during the summer.  These REU students will be selected from a nation-wide applicant pool with particular focus on underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged students from primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges in the Mid-South region of our nation. Nine faculty members from the departments of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering will mentor the REU students in experimental and theoretical studies on nano/bio materials related research projects.  This program also offers professional development and career guidance activities such as training in technical presentation and report writing, graduate admission procedures, seminars on nano/bio materials research, and organized visits to local biomedical industries and research hospitals. The participants will be encouraged to continue contacts with each other and with their mentors beyond the summer program. This program is funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.",
