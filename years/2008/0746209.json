However, in many cases, it remains unclear how these interfaces form, making it extremely difficult to recreate appropriate interactions between disparate tissues after injury. An anticipated outcome of this project is that a controlled, three-dimensional coculture system as a model for interface development in orthopaedic tissues will be developed. This project is significant because the model system will provide key information about the role of cell-matrix interactions in promoting a gradient of phenotypic expression by mesenchymel stem cells (MSCs) under tensile loading, such as that experienced at the bone-ligament interface in vivo. \r\n\r\nThe education project includes the creation of new and innovative teaching materials at the high school, college, and graduate levels that will advance understanding and appreciation of the complex processes required to assure safety of modern biomaterials, and highlight limitations of current biomaterials.\r\n",
