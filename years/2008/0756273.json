 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is in understanding of fundamental principles of assembly of highly branched macromolecules with emphasis on conjugated branched backbones.  The PI will explore how branched molecules with different architectures, electronic structures, and bearing multiple functionalities can be utilized for tailoring interactions among inorganic nanoparticles for their guided assembly into organized assemblies.  As a first step, the PI will explore novel conjugated rods (phenyloxybenzoates) either decorated with branched end/side flexible segments or branching out from a single core.  On the other hand, highly branched flexible molecules will be represented by multiarmed star block-copolymers with a central core modified with hydrophilic-hydrophobic blocks.  In the framework of the following studies, the PI will attempt to assemble branched molecules with proper symmetry and terminal functionalities onto highly-curved surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., silver nanowires and gold nanorods) to create hybrid nanostructures with tailored branched shells which can be utilized to design of electro/optical-based sensing nanomaterials.  Several important questions will be addressed in the course of the project: How does the chemical composition of shape-persistent rod-like and branched conjugated cores and flexible dendronized branches affect their ability to assemble into organized structures?  How does the branching of conjugated molecules affect electronic and optical properties of their surface assemblies?\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThis project will introduce new nanomaterials assemblies with unique optical, electronic, and mechanical properties and foster a partnership between the PI's group at Georgia Tech and researchers from the U.S., Greece, Korea, and Ukraine: Georgia Tech, Patras U (Greece), Yonsei U (Korea), and the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry (Ukraine).  This collaboration with international and domestic research groups brings invaluable experience for graduate students.  Through this external collaboration, the proposed project will enable Ph.D. students to become mature, internationally aware researchers familiar with cutting-edge basic and applied research.  Moreover, the PI will further focus his efforts to increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering by working on recruiting women and minority students, an area in which he has been active. \r\n",
