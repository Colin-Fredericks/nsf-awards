 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Minimum Sobolev Norm Methods\r\n\r\nThe aim of this research project is to design fast and accurate\r\nnumerical algorithms for the solution of large classes of mathematical\r\nequations that arise in engineering and science. In particular, the\r\nmain concerns are the solution of integro-differential equations on\r\ncomplex domains and of signal and image processing problems. The\r\napproach is based on formulating the estimate of the solution of the\r\nequation at a point as the value of the smoothest solution (on\r\naverage) at that point based on the given data. The resulting discrete\r\nequations can be shown to have specially structured matrices, which\r\ncan be exploited to create fast solvers for these equations. The\r\nresulting methods have two main computational advantages. First, they\r\ncan be designed to avoid gridding or triangulation of the complex\r\ndomain. Second, these methods exhibit local convergence; that is, the\r\nrate at which the approximant converges to the solution at a point\r\ndepends only on the local smoothness of the solution. These advantages\r\nenable the method to tackle equations with complicated singularity\r\nstructures with relative ease.\r\n\r\nLet Hs denote a Sobolev Hilbert space whose elements have s > 1\r\nfractional derivatives. Suppose an unknown function f in Hs satisfies\r\nthe equation L(F) = g, where L is a linear operator and g is a known\r\nfunction. Let Ln denote n linear functionals on Hr. Let q denote a\r\nlinear functional on Hs. Then the best minmax estimate for q(f) can be\r\ncomputed from the minimum Sobolev norm function p in Hs that satisfies\r\nthe constraints Ln(L(p)) = Ln(g). This p can be computed very rapidly\r\nsince the optimal p is given by a nice set of equations that has Fast\r\nMultipole Method (FMM) structure when written in the proper\r\nrepresentation. Also, it is possible to work with Lp Sobolev spaces\r\nwith p = 1. In these cases the optimization problem is more\r\ncomplicated and can be reduced to linear programming problems, for\r\nwhich fast solvers are being developed that exploit the underlying FMM\r\nstructure of the constraint matrix. The theoretical work consists of\r\nstudying the convergence of the solution as n gets bigger, and also in\r\nproving the FMM structure of the resulting discrete equations. The\r\nalgorithmic work consists of designing fast algorithms for\r\nconstructing the FMM representation and then designing fast algorithms\r\nfor the direct (non-iterative) solution of these equations. The\r\napplication work consists of applying these ideas to image\r\nsegmentation and multi-rate signal processing. Also, mesh free,\r\nlocally convergent schemes are being developed for the solution of\r\nintegral equations and elliptic partial differential equations on\r\ncomplex domains in two dimensions.",
