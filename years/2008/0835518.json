 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the second in a planned series of regional student conferences in applied mathematics.  The conference, held at the University of Florida on 5-7 March 2009, immediately precedes the \"100th Anniversary Ulam Conference\" beginning on 7 March 2009 at the same location.  This conference encourages and financially supports participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.  Members of groups underrepresented in mathematics are especially encouraged to apply for support.\r\n\r\nThe meeting includes many student research talks and poster presentations, as well as plenary lectures, on topics of current research interest, including computational methods and optimization, modeling in biomathematics, and medical imaging.  The conference brings together workers in a variety of different research areas, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new researchers to present their work and to develop research contacts and collaborative networks.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.math.ufl.edu/siam/ \r\n",
