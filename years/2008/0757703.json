 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop methods to calculate the properties of\r\nnuclei and nuclear matter by solving the Schroedinger equation for\r\nnucleons interacting via realistic two- and three-body potentials.\r\nQuantum Monte Carlo techniques are used.  The nucleon positions are\r\nsampled using diffusion Monte Carlo while the spin and isospin degrees\r\nof freedom are sampled by the addition of auxiliary fields. Successful\r\ncompletion of this work will allow us to verify the accuracy of the\r\nnuclear Hamiltonian by reproducing and comparing to experimental results,\r\nand then to predict the properties of nuclei that are currently difficult\r\nor impossible to produce and measure in the laboratory. These data are\r\nneeded to understand, for example, astrophysically important systems\r\nand processes such as neutron rich matter and r-process nucleosynthesis.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this work include development of quantum many-particle\r\nmethods that can be applied to problems in a variety of other fields\r\nsuch as electronic structure and cold atomic gases.  The project will\r\ntrain both undergraduate and graduate students, give them exposure at\r\nnational and international conferences,  and provide for dissemination\r\nof the results.\r\n",
