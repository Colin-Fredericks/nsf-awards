 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology is advancing rapidly in such areas as genomics, bioinformatics, and imaging, but not all species of plants and animals that are currently being studied for important biological questions can be used with the latest technology. This workshop will explore the need and importance of developing tools for new or emerging model systems that will enable scientists to address specific questions appropriate for understanding the complexity of life. This workshop will facilitate the achievement of this goal by identifying the \"toolmakers\" in the scientific community and the resources needed to develop important tools for a broad range of species that are best-suited for studying biological systems in a modern, integrative manner. At a broader level, this workshop will bring together researchers from many different disciplines to discuss what kinds of new tools and resources are needed. These discussions will result in the formulation of a broad and coherent set of goals to advance many different fields of biology. This workshop will include a great diversity of scientists in terms of their rank, areas of expertise, and institutional types and locations. In addition, scientists from groups underrepresented in Biology will be represented at the workshop.",
