Huang, PA ST U University Park \r\n\r\nObjective: The proposal focuses on developing a new class of ultra-small, all-optical plasmonic switches using photoactive rotaxanes as active components. The proposed photoactive rotaxane-based all-optical plasmonic switches could achieve unprecedented performance (size: molecular level; energy consumption: 1-2 eV; excellent reversibility and flexibility) and be integral components for the future ultra-small, ultra-fast plasmonic circuits and very large scale electronics and photonics integration (VLSEPI). \r\n\r\nIntellectual merits: This project introduces light-driven molecular machines into optical device settings. Molecular machines driven by light have several advantages: they can be switched much faster; they do not produce any waste; light can be used for dual purposes\u00a1Vinducing (writing) as well as detecting (reading) molecular motions. Experimental and numerical investigations will shed some light on the fundamental understanding of controlling plasmonics at molecular level. More importantly, with molecular machines\u00a1\u00a6 advantages in their size, energy consumption, speed, and controllability at molecular level, we expect that once established, the proposed rotaxane-based plasmonic switches will be welcomed in many applications such as optical communication.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact: The PI will partner with the Penn State Center for Nanoscale Science and develop outreach activities around the theme of \u00a1\u00a5from molecular shuttles to nanomechanics, nanoelectronics, and nanophotonics\u00a1\u00a6.  A suite of demonstrations will imitate molecular machines\u00a1\u00a6 mechanical motions, broadly constructed and idealized in their operation by macroscopic models.  The results developed in the past as well as from this proposal will be used to illustrate what molecular machines can achieve, and they will be delivered to museums, high-schools, and summer programs.",
