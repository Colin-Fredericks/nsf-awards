 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a merger of two NSF National Centers of Excellence: \r\n(a) The National Center for Manufacturing Education (NCME) which operates the Manufacturing Education Resource Center (MERC Online), an online clearinghouse of manufacturing and related educational resources (administered by Sinclair Community College of Dayton, Ohio); and \r\n(b) The New Jersey Center for Advanced Technological Education (NJCATE) which operates the National Engineering Technology Education Clearinghouse (NETEC) an online clearinghouse of engineering technology and related educational resources (administered by Middlesex County College of Edison, New Jersey). \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The goal of the project is to increase the national impact of engineering and manufacturing technology reform through the dissemination of model programs, materials, and instructional curricula via a web-based clearinghouse (www.merconline.net), faculty professional development, and related outreach services. The primary areas of emphasis are (1) proactively expanding the educational resources available in the digital clearinghouse and (2) aggressively expanding the user base of pre-college and postsecondary faculty across the country. The instructional resources disseminated nationally by the digital clearinghouse represent cutting edge technology content and project-based pedagogy. An experienced external evaluator is assuring effective formative and summative assessment of the project outcomes. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Merging the two centers leverages the best practices developed by both while providing operational efficiencies and cost reductions. The resource center is the dissemination site for numerous professional societies (Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Manufacturing Education and Research, SME Education Foundation, and the ASEE Manufacturing Division) and NSF-funded centers such as the Consortium for Alabama Regional Center for Automotive Manufacturing (CARCAM) and the National Center for Welding Education and Training at Lorain County Community College. Online services are being expanded to include professional development, mentoring, and technical assistance.",
