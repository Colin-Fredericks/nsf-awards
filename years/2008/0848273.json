 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in wireless and micro-electronics technologies \r\nhave made these technologies functionally accessible and available \r\nto a wide range of different applications. One of the fast growing \r\nfield?s is wireless sensor networks technologies, whose applications \r\nfrom military,  such as monitoring enemy and military consignments, \r\nto traffic surveillance, environment and building structures monitoring. \r\nAn important characteristic of sensor networks is the limited power \r\nsupply of the sensor nodes. These nodes are usually powered by batteries, \r\nand therefore it may not be possible to recharge or replace the batteries \r\nafter their deployment.\r\n\r\nThis proposed research aims at addressing the maximal lifetime scheduling \r\nproblem for sensor surveillance networks in a dynamic environment in which \r\nthe positions of the targets are dynamic and each sensor has different \r\nsurveillance range. Specifically, the research involves an exploratory \r\ninvestigation of finding a novel family of efficient scheduling algorithms \r\n(that offer a wide range of tradeoffs among cost, scalability and energy \r\nconsumption) for a sensor surveillance network. Its purpose is to monitor \r\na set of moving targets, such that all the targets are being monitored by \r\nthe sensors in the network at any point in time and at the same time the \r\nlifetime of the sensor surveillance network is maximized. In this scheduling \r\nalgorithm, a sensor can switch off to save energy when it is not its turn to \r\nmonitor a target. The proposed project also develops distributed monitoring \r\nmechanisms and scanning methods to obtain a sensor?s locations information. \r\nAn analytical framework to theoretically evaluate the scheduling solution \r\nfrom the point of view of tradeoffs between cost, scalability and energy \r\nconsumption is also proposed. The analytical results will be evaluated by \r\nextensive simulations and experimental measurements.\r\n\r\n",
