The specific areas of\r\nresearch in the proposal are as follows: Development of\r\ncomputational algorithms for differential invariant algebras,\r\nwith particular emphasis on methods for determining minimal\r\ngenerating sets; exploitation of the invariant variational\r\ncalculus based on moving frames to analyze minimizers of\r\ninvariant variational problems and the behavior of invariant\r\nsubmanifold flows, focusing on the evolution of differential\r\ninvariants and their signatures; algorithms for analyzing the\r\nstructure of symmetry pseudo-groups, their use in classifying and\r\nfinding explicit solutions to nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations, with applications in fluid mechanics, gauge theories,\r\nintegrable systems, and meteorological models; further\r\ndevelopment of practical tools for object recognition and\r\nsymmetry detection in digital images based on differential\r\ninvariant and joint invariant signature methods; and exploration\r\nand application of new invariant numerical algorithms for\r\nintegrating nonlinear differential equations and approximating\r\ndifferential invariants such as curvatures, torsion, etc. \r\n\r\n     Exploitation of symmetry, equivalence and invariance\r\nproperties remains one of the most important mathematical methods\r\nfor tackling the complex nonlinear systems that arise in a wide\r\nvariety of applications.  The investigator's reformulation of the\r\ngeometrically-based method of moving frames has led to a wide\r\nrange of new and, as yet, underexploited computational tools, as\r\nwell as new and unexpected areas of application, including\r\ncomputer vision, recognition and surveillance, materials science\r\nand physical gauge theories, fluid mechanics, interface flows,\r\nDNA mechanics, relativity, and elsewhere.  The project continues\r\nto develop this powerful new approach to analyzing very general\r\ngroup actions and their invariants, directly driven by current\r\nneeds in these areas of application. \r\n",
