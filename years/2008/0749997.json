 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Brian R. Crane at Cornell University  to study long-range electron transfer between cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and cytochrome c (Cc) to ascertain how molecular associations, conformational dynamics, and hole hopping control long-range electron transfer rates. Substitution of heme cofactors by Zn-porphyrins will enable photo-activation of redox chemistry.  Spectroscopic rate measurements are to be carried out in a set of crystalline complexes between CcP and Cc that display a range of association states and reactivities, set redox center environment and fix molecular orientation. X-ray diffraction studies will directly correlate structure with reactivity. Through mutagenesis, small-molecule complementation, cross-linking, temperature variation, and solvent substitution studies, parameters affecting hopping reactions and protein/solvent dynamics will be systematically probed, all in the context of single crystals. Experiments will be guided and reconciled by computational studies that assess electronic coupling between donor and acceptor sites as a function of conformational state and solvent structure. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will reveal how specific parameters, such as bridge structure, conformation, redox potentials and hopping site environment affect long-range ET in heterogeneous systems similar to those synthetically accessible for device development. Dissemination of findings will be facilitated by submission of data to public databases and the development of new web-based tools that readily allow the visualization of structure/function relationships for electron donor/acceptor interactions. The proposed research will train undergraduate and graduate students in bio-, physical- and inorganic chemistry and interface well with the investigators formal teaching efforts in these areas.\r\n",

Computational studies on the CcP:Cc system also indicated that ET operates in the Marcus inverted region. We verified this assertion by testing the driving force dependence of photoinduced ET. Variants of Cc that perturbed the heme redox potential indeed showed that ET slows with increasing driving force. These studies provide one of the few experimental measures of reorganization energy for interprotein ET and demonstrate that optimization of driving force will not necessarily optimize rates of reactivity.  Furthermore, changes to solvation (through altered molecular associations) can tune ET reactivity by modulating reorganization energies. These results also have implications for design of soft material electronics and the electronic behavior of interfacial systems.\nOur work on NOS demonstrates how localized charge movement controls enzymatic catalysis, both in the confines of the active center and in the delivery of charges to the active center.  We confirm the role of the cofactor hopping site in facilitating the second step of the reaction by what amounts to electrocatalysis. One-electron redox chemistry of the cofactor within the protein is decidedly different than the two-electron reactivity seen in solution. We have also established that the two stages of NOS catalysis involve different reactive heme-oxygen species, whose formation and stability is controlled by substrate. Importantly, a hydroperxo, rather than a peroxo intermediates is the key reactant in the second stage.  This distinguishes the mechanism from a nucleophilic heme-oxygen reactions as seen in P-450 aromatase. These results have implications for understanding oxidation activation by metalloenzymes and the design of catalysts for oxidation reactions of organic substrates. Finally, to produce our metalloproteins of study we developed a ferrochelatase co-expression method that considerably produces yields of recombinant protein. We have shared this method with over 20 academic laboratories and two companies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian R Crane"
