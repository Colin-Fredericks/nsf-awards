In collaboration with three NASA organizations, seven professional societies, a national consortium of research institutions, one formal and two informal education institutions; MS PHD'S participants engage in research exposure, professional development, mentoring and community building activities undertaken at MS PHD'S organizational partner meetings, NASA facilities, science museums, and the National Academies, in Washington, D.C.  \r\n\r\nThe MS PHD'S Professional Development Program facilitates three phases of activities that provide information regarding future funding, education and career opportunities; and on-going communication and mentoring support via membership within a virtual community comprised of peers, researchers, and educators. Phase I includes student participant and mentor orientations, initial mentor-mentee partners' interactions, networking, professional development, broad Earth system science and engineering exposure, a tour of NASA Ames Research Center facilities tour and MS PHD'S community building activities that occur in San Francisco, CA in conjunction with the American Geophysical Union fall meeting. Phase II enables student participants to receive additional Earth system science and engineering exposure, mentor-mentee interaction and networking at one of seven MS PHD'S professional society partners' meetings. During Phase III participants engage in brownbag discussions, government agency visits, and dialogues with professional society and foundation representatives. In addition to these Phase III activities, while in Washington, D.C. students receive $1,000.00 scholarships, tour of NASA Ames Goddard Space Flight Center facilities and participate in an Ecological Society of America-organized urban watershed field trip of the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nResearch exposure, mentoring, technology and capacity building activities are key aspects of the MS PHD'S Professional Development Program. Ongoing assessments result in additional professional society presentations, journal articles and the database for two doctoral dissertations.\r\n",
