 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant is to enable U.S. scholars to travel to, and attend, the 5th International Symposium on Nanomanufacturing (ISNM) that will take place in Singapore from Jan. 23 - Jan. 25. The ISNM serves as the world's leading forum in which scholars, engineers and members of the business community discuss research, education and applications in Nanomanufacturing.  Travel support will be provided mainly to African American and women scholars, particularly those who are establishing their careers in nanomanufacturing.  It will also enable U.S. students to participate in a nano-design contest, in which students will compete to design a nano-positioning stage.\r\n\r\nMaintaining US leadership in nanomanufacturing is important to the national interest.  The broader impacts of this grant will occur via the education and experiences that attendees gain at the symposium.  More specifically, early career scholars will enrich their knowledge of the state-of-the-art in their area of technical expertise and complimentary fields, observe how established researchers communicate ideas, network and form seeds for research/education collaboration, take part in discussions about improving nanomanufacturing education and thereby diversify the perspectives that are heard, gain experience in technical communication via posters and oral presentation of their research, and participate in an engineering design competition with students from other countries.  Other tangible benefits include the rapid dissemination of nanomanufacturing science into the U.S. academic/engineering community, continued recognition of U.S. leadership in the field, and continued increase in the participation of scholars from underrepresented groups.",
