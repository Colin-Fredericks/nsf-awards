 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Career development plan includes significant research, educational, and outreach components. The\r\nresearch component is focused on developing novel and systematic methodologies for the analysis, design,\r\nand implementation of cooperative dynamic networks. A dynamic network consists of spatially distributed\r\ndynamic nodes (e.g., autonomous vehicles, mobile sensors) which are coordinated by common set of goals and\r\npossible dynamic interaction between the nodes. There are many applications where a dynamic network may\r\nbe more suitable than a single vehicle, especially where a distributed system of sensors is advantageous. Yet\r\nwithout coordinating the movement of the nodes or without managing the information the nodes retrieve,\r\nany advantage of dynamic network deployment may be lost and damaging collisions or interference may\r\noccur.\r\nThis research will be integrated into curriculum development designed to provide research opportunities\r\nfor undergraduate students with emphasis on attracting and retaining underrepresented minorities. The\r\noutreach component will support on-going educational programs designed to target K-12 institutions, and\r\nthe Native American populations of Oklahoma.\r\nIntellectual Merit New Developments in complex networks of interacting systems like teams of au-\r\ntonomous vehicles/robots for homeland security, search and rescue operations, disaster relief operations,\r\nmulti-targeting/multi-platform battlefield groups, unmanned air vehicle systems, intelligent highway/vehicle\r\nsystems, wireless surveillance networks, and elsewhere place severe demands on the design of cooperative\r\ncontrol schemes and communication strategies in the presence of changing environment. The large-scale in-\r\nterconnected nature of such systems requires logic-based supervisors with increased capabilities for dynamic\r\nplanning, optimality and that guarantees performance subject to constraints, con ict resolution, failure\r\nhandling, and other decisions. To facilitate the design of this class of systems the following key research\r\nchallenges will be addressed:\r\n Development of computationally efficient algorithms for distributed model predictive control.\r\n Derivation of novel algorithms for cooperative optimization based control.\r\n Development new methodologies that enable goal directed sensing by fusing the information from\r\nheterogeneous sensors over the dynamic network, and providing the required information for each node\r\nto plan and control its mobility.\r\n Designing adaptive robust controllers that take into account the uncertainties on the dynamics of the\r\nrobotic network.\r\n Experimental verification and validation of the proposed methodologies.\r\nBroader Impact Ensuring that the above Career research thrusts have the broadest impact on society,\r\nthey should be integrated with a coherent educational and outreach plan. It is well-known that robotics pro-\r\nvides an excellent platform for getting students interested in science and engineering. This proposal includes\r\neducational components targeted at high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The proposed work\r\nincludes:\r\n Mentoring activities that include under-represented students in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and\r\nTechnology (SMET) with the objective of retaining them in electrical and computer engineering.\r\n A robotic extension program will be designed to stimulate the interest of Native American children to\r\nincrease their appreciation and understanding of science, technology, and engineering, in an informal\r\nlearning environment.\r\n Seek industrial/governmental partnerships to transfer technology. Besides publications in refereed\r\nconference and journals, new courses such as Computer Embedded Systems, Robotics and Perception,\r\nand Control Hybrid Systems will be introduced into the curriculum.\r\n Software tools, algorithms, demos and results will be available on the web.\r\nThe educational and research components of this Career proposal build upon previous and on-going work\r\nand existing equipment supported by Oklahoma State University.",
