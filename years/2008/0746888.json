This presents serious threats to privacy:\r\neven if individual pieces of data are cryptographically protected,\r\nsensitive information may still leak out due to mismatches between\r\nprivacy policies of different components.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop tools and techniques for protecting privacy\r\nof sensitive data, focusing on three main research thrusts.  The first\r\nthrust is protection of public databases containing individual information\r\nsuch as medical records, transactions, and preferences.  This includes\r\ndesign of provably secure methods for enforcing access policies directly\r\nin published data, development of analysis tools for finding privacy\r\nvulnerabilities, and evaluation on real-world data.  The second thrust\r\nis design and implementation of formal methods for checking privacy\r\npolicy compliance in order to ensure that data processing applications\r\ndo not violate the stated privacy policies of the enteprise.  The third\r\nthrust is development of new methods for analyzing privacy-preserving\r\ncommunication networks.\r\n\r\nProtecting data privacy is important not only for individuals, but\r\nalso for businesses and organizations that deal with individual data.\r\nNew technologies developed as part of this project will help detect\r\npotential privacy violations and enforce privacy policies.  They will\r\nenable applications dealing with sensitive personal and organizational\r\ndata to be executed in open computing environments and support many\r\nsocially important tasks such as multi-institution medical trials that\r\ndo not violate patients' privacy and collaborative analysis of Internet\r\nsecurity threats.\r\n\r\n",
