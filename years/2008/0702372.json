 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to study the dynamics of various steps relevant to the occurrence of the photorefractive effect in hybrid polymeric nanocomposites containing quantum dots. The  investigations will target the mechanisms of photogeneration and transport of charge carriers and the development of the refractive index grating in materials containing quantum dots acting as photosensitizers. The focus is on the process of photosensitization in the infrared to extend the photorefractive sensitivity to telecommunication wavelengths as well as on the process of multiexciton generation induced carrier multiplication to dramatically improve the photorefractive performance at shorter wavelengths. The nanocomposites will involve engineered semiconductor nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) such as nanopods, through attachment of the QDs to carbon nanotubes and through the use of mobility boosting components such as pentacene.  The project will place emphasis on training of minority students and researchers, which is a priority at our university. They will be involved in highly multidisciplinary research involving nanotechnology, photonics and spectroscopy.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThis project will impact broadly optoelectronics and photovoltaics, leading to better ultraviolet (UV) detectors using carrier multiplication, as well as broad band, highly efficient photovoltaic and solar cells capable of harvesting photons from UV to infrared (IR). The optoelectronic devices using carrier multiplication will be especially useful for space applications by efficiently using readily available deep UV photons. The project will place emphasis on training of minority students and researchers, which is a priority at our university.\r\n\r\n",
