 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oral and poster presentations by undergraduates have become an integral part of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) summer MathFest and winter Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM). Participation in national meetings offers students a chance to become a part of the mathematical community at a national level and interact with peers from other institutions. Learning new mathematics and sharing experiences with others can provide strong motivation for continued study of mathematics. Despite the positive effects and the upsurge in participation by undergraduates at national meetings, funding for travel remains a significant obstacle to participation for many undergraduate students. This five-year grant is for travel support for students who are presenting their research talk or poster at either the summer MathFest or winter JMM. The grant will support approximately 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 students in the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.\r\n",
