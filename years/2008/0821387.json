 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the Department of Biological Sciences at The University of Toledo to support the acquisition of: 1) the Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging system; 2) the ImageQuant RT ECL Imaging system; and 3) a SpectraMax M5 Multi-detection plate reader.  This instrumentation will support the research programs of the PI and Co-PIs and other members of the Department of Biological Sciences focused on cell signaling and regulation of gene expression in human cells and in model systems (nematodes and plants).  In addition, these instruments will also be available to the broader research community in other departments at The University of Toledo.  These instruments will provide investigators with more advanced and sensitive tools for conducting assays that they currently do not have the capabilities of performing.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of these instruments will have a significant broader impact on the educational mission of the Department of Biological Sciences and The University of Toledo.  The PI/Co-PIs as well as the department as a whole are strongly committed to the integration of research and education.  The use of these instruments will be available to undergraduate students working on research projects under the direction of a faculty mentor.  In addition, the use of these instruments will be incorporated into several upper division undergraduate laboratory courses, in particular the core Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology (taught by the PI) labs.  Underrepresented groups, through the department?s commitment to the STARS and Glenn-Stokes programs will also benefit from the acquisition of these instruments.\r\n",
