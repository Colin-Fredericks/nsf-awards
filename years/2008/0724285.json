 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the scale up and validation of a tool which enables small and medium-sized banks to optimize their \"sweep\" programs for managing their deposit balances.  To date, most optimizations are based on heuristics and are out reach for small to medium sized institutions.  The approach of the proposed effort, which will be embodied in a cost-effective software application, deploys a proprietary algorithm based on analytics and stochastic optimization.  It should provide a 15-25% improvement over the current heuristics effort and be affordable for small to medium sized banks.\r\n\r\nIf successfully commercialized, the proposed solution will enable more efficient deposit optimization in small to medium-sized banks; addressing an approximately $150M market opportunity.  The solution also has the chance to enhance cash management at branches, vault cash/ATM networks and other cash logistics operations.  Further, improved modeling of customer behavior has potential applications for customer relationship management in all financial services including credit cards, insurance, brokerage services and e-commerce in general.  \r\n",
