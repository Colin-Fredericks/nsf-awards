Todd \r\nINSTITUTION: University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa\r\nTITLE: GK-12 Sustainable Energy Systems\r\n\r\nThe two major goals of this multi-disciplinary project in engineering and mathematics are to 1)increase the professional caliber of our STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduate students and equip them with the skills and experiences to become future leaders in academia and industry; and 2)provide resources and support for the newly formed State of Alabama high school Engineering Academies and create materials that integrate engineering applications into existing high school and middle school science and math courses.  The multi-disciplinary theme of the project, Sustainability in Energy Systems, includes transformative research on alternative and traditional energy systems, including renewable resources in consideration of their environmental impact.   This project strongly emphasizes the integration of graduate research with K-12 education to collaboratively design and deliver K-12 STEM instruction. \r\n\r\nGraduate fellows will work on-site in the Sumter County schools.  Sumter County ranks among the poorest counties in the state and nation by every measure of poverty, including school performance.  The faculty and student body at all Sumter Co. public schools are over 95% African American.  Fellows, working with K-12 teachers, will be challenged to connect with students from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds in an appropriate way to enhance knowledge and engage, motivate and build confidence in the students regarding STEM careers.  In addition, materials developed for Sumter County schools will be offered to other state schools using real-time and archived cyber infrastructure resources.",
