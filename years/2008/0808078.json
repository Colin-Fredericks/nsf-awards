This is critical as it is allowing people to attend ICER who are doing computing education research but do not have funding for that research or for travel. In addition to the conference's role in helping to support the growth of the computer science education research community, the conference is providing a dissemination medium for recent awardees from the new NSF CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education (CPATH) program to present the results of their projects.",
