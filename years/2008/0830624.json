Each scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program.  Scholarship students engage in rigorous academic programs that emphasize both theory and practice of IA and that incorporate research and experiential learning.  Upon graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in an IA position.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship program helps to address the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.  One of the collaborating institutions is an HBCU that has a well-established mechanism to attract talented minority students into its IA program and to help them succeed as IA professionals.",
