 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award helps support a workshop to discuss the potential contributions of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment (AR5). A possible outcome of this workshop is the identification of key climate targets for model simulations and data synthesis that can help reduce uncertainties in future climate projections. The planned workshop discussions will focus on the evolution of Earth System modeling, climate variability and abrupt changes, and how to develop appropriate methodologies to reduce uncertainties in climate projection.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the researcher requests funds from the NSF to help provide partial participant support for approximately sixty scientists to attend a workshop in Estes Park, Colorado from September 14-19, 2008.  Participants at the workshop will have expertise in paleoclimatology and related aspects of climate research and will discuss the pros and cons of specific simulations of key past time periods that could be proposed to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) for inclusion in a proposed suite of simulations to be done by international modeling groups for the IPCC AR5. \r\n\r\nThe participants will include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  In this manner, an open and lively exchange of views on the science and the concept of a paleoclimate modeling will be enabled.\r\n",
