 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis award supports integrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics. The goal of this research program is to develop new theoretical models and investigate ultrafast generation of coherent phonons in semiconductors. A key question being addressed is whether such phonon dynamics can be manipulated to influence magnetic and electric polarization to the extent that it has device potential.\r\n\r\nThese research investigations are looking into three new areas to theoretically describe the interactions of the photogenerated coherent phonons with carriers and spins that are already present in the nanostructures under conditions of high electric and magnetic fields and in novel materials such as carbon nanotubes.  Researchers will investigate the use femtosecond pulse shaping to manipulate the electric and magnetic fields as well as the carrier, phonon and spin dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe coherent control of magnetic and electric fields and carrier or spin dynamics on an optical time scale will have a broad impact on future device design.  Through control of these features with coherent phonons, a variety of novel and interesting possibilities for future device applications in emerging fields such as spintronics or quantum information theory will be garnered. \r\n\r\nGraduate students will participate in this research effort and benefit by learning theoretical techniques and understanding the materials and technology associated with nanoscience. This work will be the basis for dissertation research leading to the PhD.  The principle investigator has record of acting as a mentor of young students and participating in outreach efforts of the department of physics, activities which will continue during this research project.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nIntegrated research, education and outreach activities in theoretical condensed matter physics combine as the core activities under this award. The primary motivation of the project stems from the phenomena of atomic vibrations, like sound, generated by lasers in semiconductor materials.  The pure frequencies of ultra short laser pulses produce similarly pure and large \"sound\" waves. These are sufficiently large that the \"sound\" alters the electric and magnetic properties of the material A goal of this research program is to develop new theoretical models to understand this effect and control it. The characteristic that this occurs extremely fast and in a small area leads to the potential for optical control of the smallest possible electronic devices that are being developed in the field of nanotechnology.  \r\n\r\nGraduate students will participate in this research effort and benefit by learning theoretical techniques and understanding the materials and technology associated with nanoscience. This work will be the basis for dissertation research leading to the PhD.  The principle investigator has record of acting as a mentor of young students and participating in outreach efforts of the department of physics, activities which will continue during this research project.\r\n",

Dr. Xingyuan Pan, now a postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&amp;M University, received his Ph.D. with support from this grant.  Students received theoretical training in solid-state physics, quantum and nonlinear optics, computer programming, numerical methods, and data analysis. This enhances our future workforce in a high technology field.   Students also closely interacted with experimental groups, helping them  appreciate their calculations and foster future working relationships.\n\n  \n\n     \n\n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                         \nResults:\n1.      Coherent phonon spectroscopy in Carbon Nanotubes \n\nResonant Coherent Phoonon Spectroscopy. To model the experiments of the Kono group at Rice, we developed a microscopic theory for coherent phonon spectroscopy in carbon nanotubes. In Fig. 1 we plot theoretical and experimental coherent phonon (CP) intensity at the radial breathing mode (RBM) coherent phonon frequency as a function of pump/probe energy.   \nAligned Nanotube Films. We modeled CP spectroscopy of RBM CPs as a function of polarization angle and found that CP signal decreases as the angle goes from 0o to 90o (perpendicular to the tube).  Results for a mod 2 semiconducting (38,0) nanotube are shown in Fig 2 where we plot the experimental (red) and theoretical (black) integrated CP power. \n2.  Optically Pumped NMR (OPNMR) in Semiconductors.  \nMagnetic fields play an important role in determining the band structure of materials. We collaborated with the experimental group of Sophia Hayes at Washington University to study Optically Pumped NMR (OPNMR) spectra in bulk semi-insulating GaAs generated by a narrowband  laser. \nIn OPNMR, circularly polarized light is used to spin polarize conduction band electrons.   The excess conduction band electron spin polarization then interacts with nuclear  spins through the hyperfine interaction and is detected by conventional NMR.  By comparing our calculations with the Hayes group experiments, we found  that the OPNMR oscillations  are due to formation of Landau levels modified by excitons.  The  dominant structure in the OPNMR spectrum comes from weaker transitions between light-hole and conduction band Landau levels and is shown in figure 3. \n3.      Optical..."
