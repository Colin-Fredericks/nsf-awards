These systems are\r\nfrequently metastable.  Two broad areas for investigation have\r\nbeen identified directly from potential application: texture\r\ndevelopment dependent on interfacial properties of polycrystals\r\nand diffusion mediated transport with application to ensembles of\r\nmolecular motors.  A central materials science problem is to\r\nengineer a microstructure to attain a desired set of\r\ncharacteristics.  The group of the investigator has discovered a\r\nnew characterization of material texture, the description of a\r\npolycrystal in terms of its geometry and crystallography, called\r\nthe grain boundary character distribution, which is found to be\r\ncorrelated to interfacial energy.  A main objective of this\r\nproject is to explain this characterization employing large scale\r\nsimulation and analysis and stochastic analysis.  Geometric\r\ncoarsening is also studied.  The goal of the second part of the\r\nproject is to develop appropriate modeling and analytical methods\r\nto understand how molecular motors function in various\r\ncircumstances, and in particular, to examine various\r\ntransformation pathways and transduction scenarios.  This\r\ninvolves mass transport theory among other new directions in\r\nnonlinear analysis.  Understanding the predictive character of\r\nlarge scale simulations of metastable systems used to interrogate\r\nand model physical and biological systems is an emerging\r\nfundamental challenge for mathematical/computational science.  It\r\nis a coarse graining or upscaling question at the informational\r\nlevel.  The goal of this project is to address this challenge.\r\n\r\n     This project has two related parts.  Most engineered\r\nmaterials arise as polycrystalline microstructures, composed of a\r\nmyriad of small crystallites, called grains, separated by\r\ninterfaces, called grain boundaries.  The energetics and\r\nconnectivity of this network of boundaries are implicated in many\r\nproperties across all scales of use, from nanoscale medicine and\r\nelectronics to aircraft structures.  A new characterization of\r\nmaterial texture is now available, the grain boundary character\r\ndistribution, discovered very recently in the group of the\r\ninvestigator.  It is as if each material leaves a unique\r\nfootprint in the microscope.  A project objective is to explain\r\nthis distribution by simulation and innovative mathematical\r\nanalysis in order to provide materials engineers with a\r\npredictive tool.  Eukaryotic intracellular traffic owes to a\r\nnetwork of molecular motors moving on cytoskeletal or actin\r\nfilaments.  This is the second part.  The ability to successfully\r\ntransduce chemical energy to motion owes to functional elements\r\nand relations in the system.  These are modeled and analyzed. \r\nThe opportunity to discover the interplay between chemistry and\r\nmechanics and to elaborate the implications of metastability\r\ncould not offer a more exciting venue.",
