 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial and temporal data are critical components in many applications. \r\nThis is especially true in analytical applications ranging from scientific \r\ndiscovery to national security and criminal investigation. This exploratory \r\nresearch develops of new methods for modeling and querying spatial, temporal \r\nand thematic (STT) data. The methods differ significantly from traditional\r\napproaches for STT data management; they follow a paradigm that goes beyond \r\nquerying for resources to querying about the relationships between resources.\r\nThree STT data management advances this will lead to are: \r\n(1) new query operators that exploit the graph-centric nature \r\nof Semantic Web data models, (2) new indexing and query processing \r\ntechniques for STT data that are specialized for Semantic Web data models \r\nand (3) an extension of the SPARQL RDF query language to support STT queries.\r\n\r\nA second aspect of this project is to compare the STT-RDF \r\napproach described above with an alternative approach based on OWL-DL \r\nand qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. This exploratory \r\nstudy evaluates whether the STT-RDF analytics approach provides a \r\nmore efficient and expressive query language than the \r\nOWL-DL approach with space-time ontology. Specifically, \r\n(1) for the queries that can be encoded in both the formalisms, \r\nis the former implementation more efficient? and (2) are there \r\nqueries that can be formulated in the STT-RDF analytics formalism\r\nthat cannot be expressed as OWL-DL queries? \r\n\r\nThroughout this project, special attention is given to\r\nrepeatability of experimental results. All code will be open source, \r\nand all benchmarks, datasets and ontologies will be available \r\nthrough the project web site at\r\nhttp://knoesis.wright.edu/research/semweb/projects/stt/\r\n\r\n\r\n",
