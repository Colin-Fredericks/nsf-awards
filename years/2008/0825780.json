 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching research objective of this award is to reveal the basic evolution of fatigue life with tool wear progression in hard turning for creating a six-sigma based robust process design. To realize the research objective, a synergistic experimental and theoretical study will be conducted. The research approaches are to: (i) Comprehensively characterize surface integrity evolution versus cutting time and tool wear; (ii) Map the distribution and variance of rolling contact fatigue life onto cutting time and the corresponding tool wear progression; and (iii) Create a six-sigma based robust process design tool for hard turning industry for fatigue life management while maximizing tool life.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the six-sigma based design tool will allow the machining industry to manufacture reliable components while maximizing tool life in production. The new knowledge created will significantly advance the basic understanding of the linkage between process parameters, surface integrity, and product performance. The developed methodology of robust process design will also be useable in broad manufacturing processes when fatigue performance is of concern. This research will benefit machining economics by replacing expensive grinding by cheap and environmentally friendlier turning and reducing the associated tool costs. The synergetic university-industry partnership will afford a unique opportunity for faculty and students through the conduct of research and practical experience in industrial settings. The strong industrial participation will build a long-term research infrastructure through collaboration, co-advising students, industrial seminars, and rapid technology transfer.",
