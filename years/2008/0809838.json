Prof. Borguet and his students will investigate the chemical reactivity of molecules at solid-liquid interfaces in order to gain molecular level understanding of the rules that govern charge transfer and transport at charged interfaces. This will enable transformative advances in electrochemical and nanoscale science that will be important in a variety of areas including molecular electronics, electrochemistry, catalysis, information storage, solar energy conversion and sensors. The study will provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees in a highly multidisciplinary research area involving the development and application of state of the art electrochemical imaging methods to analyze complex interfaces of increasing technological importance.",

With colleagues at Duke University, we demonstrated that at least two classes of molecular wires,1, 2 display linear length dependence of conductivity.
