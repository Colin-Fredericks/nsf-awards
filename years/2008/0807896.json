When the linear redundant representation is\r\nassociated to a group representation (such as the Weyl-Heisenberg\r\ngrgoup), the relevant Hilbert-Schmidt operators inherit this\r\ninvariance property.  Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction\r\nalgorithm seems possible.  A wireless communication channel is\r\nmodeled as a linear operator that describes how transmitted\r\nsignals propagate to a receiver.  For ultrawide band (UWB)\r\nsignals, the Doppler effect no longer can be modeled as a\r\nfrequency shift.  Instead it is captured as a time dilation\r\noperator.  A continuous superposition of time-scale shifts is\r\nused to model a UWB communication channel, and consequences to\r\npseudo-differential operator theory are analyzed. \r\n\r\n     The investigator takes up two problems related to signal\r\nprocessing.  In the first he considers how to represent signals\r\nin ways that allow more effective reconstructon of them from\r\nlimited information.  In the second he analyzes properties of\r\nwireless communication channels, aiming at improvements in\r\ntransmission.  The solutions to these problems have a strong\r\nimpact in the strategic area of information technology. \r\nImportant applications such as signal processing, X-ray\r\ncrystallography, and quantum computing are affected by solutions\r\nto the first problem.  High-impact applications related to the\r\nsecond problem include ultrawide-band through-wall imaging\r\nsystems, higher-throughput 802.15 Wireless Personal Area\r\nNetworks, and wireless sensor networks. \r\n",
