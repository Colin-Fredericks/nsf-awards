 "awd_abstract_narration": "In traditional social choice, it is assumed that each agent explicitly ranks all of the alternatives. In Artificial Intelligence applications this is generally impractical: for example, there are exponentially many joint plans\r\nor allocations of tasks/resources. Nevertheless, even the computational social choice community has so\r\nfar focused primarily on the explicit-ranking model. While this was a necessary phase to establish a solid\r\nfoundation for this line of research, it is now time to move on and consider the combinatorial domains with\r\nexponentially many alternatives that motivated computational social choice in the first place. This is what\r\nthe proposed research will do.\r\nThe PI proposes the following 5-part research plan. First, he plans to study how agents? votes should\r\nbe represented, that is, what language the agents should use to express their preferences in a combinatorial\r\ndomain. Once the language has been determined, he plans to study what rule should be used to make a\r\ndecision based on the votes. Such a rule would be useless without a good algorithm for executing it, that\r\nis, for solving the winner determination problem. Even with a good language, it may be overwhelming\r\nfor an agent to report its complete preferences, so the PI plans to study how to elicit the (relevant parts of)\r\nagents? preferences by asking the agents simple queries. Finally, he plans to address the problem of agents\r\nvoting insincerely to manipulate the decision, in part by investigating whether such manipulation can be\r\nmade computationally infeasible.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed research will allow agents to coordinate when solving a complex problem, even if they have\r\nbeen created by different designers with different objectives. For example, robots in search-and-rescue or\r\nother exploration settings can vote over how they will divide the exploration. This allows a much greater\r\ndiversity of agents to participate in such a task, undoubtedly leading to better results. Also, some of the\r\nresearch is likely to be applicable to human decision making.\r\nEurope is starting to take the lead in computational social choice; if funded, this proposal will ensure that\r\nthe U.S. retains expertise in and continues to shape this burgeoning research area. Of course, research is not\r\na zero-sum game, and the PI plans to collaborate closely with the other researchers in the area. In fact, this\r\nproposal corresponds to the PI?s part of a 12-investigator proposal that was just recommended for funding\r\nby the European Science Foundation (ESF). This (NSF) proposal would also support the PI?s collaboration\r\nwith Jeff Rosenschein (Hebrew University); for this collaboration, Jeff and the PI already received a small\r\nUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation grant that serves to support the Israeli side as well as travel.\r\nThe proposal also includes plans to develop a new graduate course on computational social choice,\r\nmentor graduate and undergraduate students, build connections to economics and political science, and\r\nattract more women to computer science (as well as participate in other outreach activities).",

How should an alternative be chosen based on these preferences, and how computationally hard is it to do so?  Can we elicit the preferences incrementally, rather than force the agents to report them all at once?  Generally, an agent may have an incentive to misreport her preferences or engage in other types of manipulation; can we prevent this, possibly by making it computationally hard?
