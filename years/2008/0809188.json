 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic  Chemistry program supports research by Professor Michael Maroney at the University of Massachusetts to understand the role of the protein in creating the active site in recombinant Streptomyces coelicolor nickel superoxide dismutase (NiSOD). Point mutations will be employed to address the following questions: 1. Do residues in the second coordination sphere of Ni play a critical role in optimizing the redox potential of the active site? 2. Is the quaternary structure required for catalysis? 3. What are the roles of conserved tyrosine residues near the active site? 4. How does the protein structure moderate the interaction of the active site with hydrogen peroxide, a molecule that is a reaction product, an active site reductant, and readily oxidizes thiolates, such as the cysteine ligands found in the active site? Mutant enzymes will be characterized using a strategy that employs a variety of complementary biophysical techniques including EPR and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The effect of mutations on catalysis will be addressed by measuring the catalytic rate constant and examining the reaction mechanism using pulse radiolytic generation of superoxide and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and by assessing the redox potential of the enzyme using redox titrations. Mutations that result in a perturbed mechanism will be further examined using crystallography. Catalytic intermediates that have been detected in a number of existing mutant NiSODs will be freeze-trapped and examined spectroscopically \r\n\r\nThe study of NiSOD will contribute to the understanding of redox catalysis by biological nickel sites. The research will provide multidisciplinary training at the interface of chemistry and biology for students at all levels (undergraduate through post-doctoral).\r\n",

These reactive oxygen species damage biological molecules and have been linked to aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Superoxide dismutases are a diverse group of metalloenzymes that catalyze the conversion of superoxide ion to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide at rates approaching the diffusion limit.  As such, they constitute a cell's first line of defense against oxidative damage.  Prior to 1999, three variations of superoxide dismutase had been extensively characterized.  These enzymes contained copper (CuZnSOD), Manganese (MnSOD) or iron (FeSOD) as metals whose redox properties could be used in the reaction that is catalyzed.  All of these metals will, in fact, catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide in water without the protein. In 1999, a nickel-dependent version of the enzyme was discovered in bacteria.  This enzyme is unique in that nickel does not have the appropriate redox characteristics and does not catalyze the reaction in water without the protein.

The first, Y9F, revealed the anion (superoxide) binding site as a complex with bromide, and shows it to be removed from the nickel center (picture).  The second, D3A, revealed a possible mechanism for redox cooperation between nickel centers in hexameric enzyme.  Investigation of this mechanism is also a topic of current investigation.\n \nThe last ligand to the nickel center is the backbone amidate from Cys2.  Thi..."
