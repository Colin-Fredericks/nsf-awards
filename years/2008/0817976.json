 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robust homeostastic mechanisms are key to cellular survival. Cells must maintain stable and optimal intracellular conditions for proficient enzymatic and metabolic processes. However, a highly dynamic and often stressful environment inevitably leads to cellular disturbances. Increases in cytosolic free calcium and reactive oxygen species are examples of intracellular changes that result from many environmental stresses. Cells have evolved mechanisms to use these changes as second messengers. Calcium and redox sensor proteins perceive these signs of stress and convey information that activates not only cellular and physiological adaptive responses but also counterbalancing mechanisms to regain cellular homeostasis. The Arabidopsis CML24 protein may be not only a calmodulin-related calcium sensor but also a redox sensor. CML24 undergoes calcium-dependent conformational changes and also has the potential to form a disulfide bond in response to oxidation. Plants with mutant CML24 have altered nitric oxide accumulation and autophagy regulation. Thus, nitric oxide and autophagy regulation may be functionally linked in plants and such links may be critical for cellular homeostasis. The roles of calcium and redox in CML24 conformation, stability, protein interaction, and physiological function will be determined through biochemical, biophysical, and molecular genetic approaches.  CML24's role in nitric oxide accumulation will be investigated through determining, in part, whether CML24 functions in an NOA1-, nitrate reductase-, and/or mitochondria-dependent nitric oxide synthesis pathway. Autophagy will be monitored to reveal whether CML24, and its calcium-binding ability and disulfide bond formation, are critical for regulation. Nitric oxide accumulation and autophagy mutants, in addition to cml24 mutants, will be characterized to determine potential linkages among nitric oxide, redox, and autophagy regulation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research will address fundamental and important questions about cellular stress perception and response and may bring transformative insight into the roles of calcium, redox, nitric oxide, and autophagy in cellular homeostasis. Such processes are critical for plant survival and productivity. Knowledge derived from these studies should aid practices aimed at improving agricultural efficiency and preserving natural environments under stress. Through the involvement of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, this research will enhance the infrastructure of research and training. Students supported by this grant will be encouraged to participate in conferences and teaching opportunities. Training of women and students of underrepresented groups will be a high priority. Outreach activities, such as lab tours, science fair judging, and NSF Advance activities, will continue. Research results will be disseminated widely through publication, conference presentations, and websites. Mutants and transgenic lines will be freely accessible to the community. This work also involves collaboration at Rice University, across the US, and internationally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of the research funded by this grant is strong and diverse.  First, we discovered that the plant circadian clock, which enables plants to monitor time of day, has a significant impact on how resistant plants are to insect herbivores.  Plants whose clocks are set to the wrong time of day or whose clocks are nonfunctional have a much higher susceptibility to herbivory.  We found that the levels of major plant defense hormones cycle with circadian periodicity, along with at least some major defense phytochemicals.  These findings indicate that plants may use their circadian clock to anticipate insect attack on a daily basis and this enables plants to increase their defenses at the times when insects are likely to feed.  Furthermore, this work has implications for the human health value of fruits and vegetables and potential for improving postharvest storage conditions to reduce crop loss.  We found that fruits and vegetables maintain circadian clock function postharvest and this function can affect health-relevant phytochemicals, pest resistance, and shelf life of various crops.\n\nWe also uncovered the genetic basis for how plants alter their growth and morphology when subjected to mechanical stress, such as wind or touch.  These findings led to the practical implication that repeated mechanical perturbation of plants increases in defense hormone levels and overall plant resistance to insects and fungi.\n\nOur work also led to new insights into how plants deal with environmental stress. We identified potential new mechanisms by which plant cells remove nonfunctional and/or superfluous components, which then may promote stress resistance and delay senescence.  Additional genetic analyses led us to uncover evidence for the role of a particular plant signaling protein in enabling plant roots to change their growth pattern when they encounter mechanical barriers. Finally, we provided evidence to help understand how plant cells can generate the essential, but potentially lethal, precursors for the major plant pigment, chlorophyll through balanced regulation of two distinct biochemical pathways, which together protect against accumulation of toxic precursors.\n\nThe research also has had broad impact.  The fundamental research findings help to illuminate longstanding questions in plant biology.  For example, our data demonstrate that the plant circadian clock provides strong advantage to plants, in particular, with respect to insect defense and tissue longevity, along with providing insight into daily pest resistance occurs, that is through the circadian regulation of defense hormones.  Furthermore, our work revealed the critical role of the jasmonate defense hormone in regulating plant growth in response to mechanical perturbation and thus also impacting plant pest resistance.  In addition, these fundamental insights have practical applications.  We now know that at least some health-relevant phytochemicals in the plant foods that we eat may be at different levels at different times of day and that storing fruits and vegetables under light/dark cycles, as is natural in our environment, may improve the value of these crops for human health.  In addition, this grant has enabled us to provide scientific training and experience to many students, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.
