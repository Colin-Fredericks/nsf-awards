 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Have You Spotted Me? Learning Lessons by Looking for Ladybugs\" is an innovative citizen science project that targets children from Native American, rural, farming, and disadvantaged communities. While most citizen science efforts target teens and adults, this project enables youth ages 5-11 to contribute to the development of a major ladybug database. Adult mentors in youth programs introduce children to topics such as ladybugs, invasive species, biodiversity, and conservation. Youth not affiliated with a program may participate independently. Project deliverables include a self-contained education program, an Internet portal and project website, a dedicated corps of volunteers, and the largest, accessible biological database ever developed. The database is made more reliable by utilizing records accompanied by an identifiable data image as a certified data point. Partners include the NY State 4-H, South Dakota State 4-H, Migrant Worker Children's Education Program, Cayuga Nature Center, Seneca Nation Department of Education Summer Programs, Seneca Nation Early Childhood Learner Centers After School Program, and the Onondaga Nation After School Program. Strategic impact will be realized through the creation of a citizen science project that provides hands-on interactions, field experiences, and accessible data that creates unique learning opportunities for youth. It is estimated that nearly 10,000 youth will be impacted by this work.",

Participation by communities under-represented in science included Tribal Nations, low-income rural, and migrant farm worker communities in New York, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and other states.\n\nThe major intended educational impacts of the ladybug project are: 1.  For children, their families and community to feel more comfortable and familiar with doing science.  By creating concrete connections between the children's cultural community and science, children will also realize they already do science. 2.  For children to directly experience authentic science, with opportunities for meaningful achievement and mastery, through active participation in a national survey of ladybugs. 3.  For children to increase their understanding of the importance of preservation through biodiversity and conservation through these activities.\n\nLost Ladybug project participants from all 50 states including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 6 Canadian provinces, and 3 Mexican estados made a significant scientific contribution.
