Shapiro\tIOS-0744974\tGenetic basis of morphological diversity and parallel evolution in ninespine sticklebacks\r\n\r\nA major goal of this project is to identify the genetic factors underlying skeletal changes in natural populations of ninespine stickleback fish (Pungitius pungitius). Throughout their Northern Hemisphere-wide range, several exceptional populations of these fish fail to develop the pelvic fin and its supporting bones, a part of the skeleton that is the developmental equivalent of the hindlimbs of humans and other land vertebrates. A principal aim and expected outcome of this work is to identify the genetic basis of pelvic loss in ninespine sticklebacks. Preliminary genetic studies suggest that a single chromosome region has a major influence on pelvic loss in an Alaskan population of these fish; this approach will be extended to identify the gene(s) involved. Another major aim of this project is to examine whether the same or different genes control pelvic reduction in another, geographically distant population of ninespine sticklebacks. This aim will show whether the same or different mechanisms control similar skeletal changes in independent populations. This comparative genetic approach provides a unique opportunity to test whether there are general rules for the types of genetic changes that govern morphology in different groups of organisms.\r\n\r\nThis work will have a broader impact on the scientific community by developing new molecular genetic tools and reagents that can be used by other researchers. Furthermore, the investigator has a strong record of promoting the participation of women in scientific research at the undergraduate, graduate student, and postdoctoral levels. This project will foster the intellectual and career development of a gender group that is traditionally underrepresented in scientific research.",
