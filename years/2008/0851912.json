 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduate Site at the University of Toledo \r\nprovides a unique opportunity for 10 undergraduate students to perform \r\nsupervised research and obtain rich experiences in a diverse and \r\nmulticultural environment. In this program, each student carries out an \r\nindependent research project under the close guidance of a faculty mentor \r\nduring 10 weeks of summer. \r\n\r\nThe research projects cover a wide range of research topics in the field \r\nof Information technology such as computational algorithms, software \r\nengineering, architecture, graphics, optimization, information security, \r\nimage processing and multimedia. Supervised research experience has been \r\nshown to motivate students and encourage higher levels of academic \r\nachievement leading to increased retention and graduation for \r\nundergraduate students, especially for underrepresented minorities. The \r\nparticipants are also strongly encouraged to present their research at \r\nregional and national scientific meetings. In addition to gaining \r\nresearch experience, students will participate in other activities \r\ndesigned to promote other skills such as communication skills, technical \r\nwriting skills, as well as presentation skills. This program will also \r\nexpose participants to the possibility of graduate study and encourage \r\nthem to choose this step in their career paths, which will increase their \r\nemployment prospective. The end result will be a strong set of graduates \r\nwho can satisfy at least some of the needs for Engineering and IT \r\nprofessionals in research and industry. The undergraduate participants \r\nin this program will be recruited nationwide, particularly from \r\nminority-serving and other small colleges. Also, underrepresented groups, \r\nincluding minorities and students from small colleges and universities \r\nwith little research opportunities are strongly encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\n",
