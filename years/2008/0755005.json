 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Chemistry Department of Clemson University during the summers of 2008-2010. Twelve NSF funded students will form the core of a larger program of 25-30 students, which includes 3-5 students recruited from collaborating institutions abroad. Participants engage in ten weeks of independent research in a project of their choice, under the guidance of one of 23 faculty advisors with a variety of interests in 3 focus areas with high current impact: chemistry of advanced materials, chemistry of biological systems, and chemistry education. Weekly instrumentation workshops and professional development tutorials are also provided. Participants give one short oral proposal presentation, write an abstract, prepare a poster, submit their research report in journal format, and participate in a peer reviewing process of these reports. In addition, there is a final college-wide symposium at which students present the results of their work in a poster format. Application to this program is open to all  junior and senior chemistry majors, but special efforts are placed on recruiting minority students as well as applicants from non-PhD granting institutions. This REU site is jointly supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program and by the NSF Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research.",
