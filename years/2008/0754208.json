 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cutkosky will investigate four projects: toroidalization, local monomialization and ramification\r\n of surfaces in positive characteristic, asymptotic properties of powers of ideals and semigroups\r\n of valuations on local rings.  In toroidalization, the  main conjecture is to show that any dominant morphism\r\nof varieties can be made into a toroidal mapping, or a local monomial mapping, by blowing up nonsingular\r\n subvarieties in the domain and range. Cutkosky will extend his recent work proving the conjecture for 3-folds,\r\ntowards a general proof of the conjecture. On the problem of ramification in positive characteristic,\r\nthe proposer has found with Oliver Piltant stable forms of mappings between germs of characteristic p surfaces.\r\nCutkosky proposes to refine the formulation of  these forms, and apply them to a study of ramification of maps\r\n of surfaces in characteristic p. Cutkosky will continue his work on computing asymptotic properties of Hilbert \r\ntype functions on functors of powers of ideals. Cutkosky also seeks to understand the semigroups which can\r\noccur as the value semigroup of a (possible noetherian) valuation dominating a noetherian local domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgebra is of increasing importance in modern science and technology. Cutkosky will  investigate\r\nseveral problems of theoretical importance in the general area of Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.\r\nThe main objective is to understand the structure of polynomial mappings, and  systems of \r\npolynomial equations. Cutkosky  will   train undergraduate and graduate students, and  mentor young\r\n researchers through this project.",
