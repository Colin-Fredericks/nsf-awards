Rothwell\r\n\tMichigan State University\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research objective of this award is to develop a new methodology for the design of metamaterials, and the design of systems that use metamaterials. The proposed methodology is intended to enable designers to rigorously and methodically explore novel, complex metamaterial designs, address complex, multifunctional performance specifications and to integrate results in design of RF (radiofrequency) systems.  Optimization algorithms based on topology optimization methods and inverse homogenization problems in material design will be used to support the methodologies developed in this research.  Design of electrically small RF systems will be used as a model for design using metamaterials.  A fabrication/testing/validation program will be used to validate the methodology and to adjust the computational procedures to account for factors such as size and edge effects.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide a rigorous and practical foundation for the design of devices that are likely to generate new growth in a number of high-technology industries: personal communications, medical diagnostics, sensors.  When applied to the design of electrically small antennas, this research will help meet increasing demands for miniaturization in personal communication devices and wireless sensors.  While demonstrating the process of integration of metamaterials in RF systems, the research will also facilitate understanding of how to insert metamaterials in components and devices used in other areas of technological importance. The experimental program will provide guidance to the community on how to evaluate the performance of metamaterials.  More broadly, the integration of this research in education and outreach activities will enhance programs for undergraduate students through the introduction of multi-disciplinary design-build-test projects in electrical and mechanical engineering and through the development of web-based tools that expose discoveries to a broad audience in a format suitable for exploration and learning.  \r\n",
