 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington (UW) seeks an extension for the Alliance for Access to Computing Careers (AccessComputing). AccessComputing aims to increase the number of students with disabilities who successfully complete post secondary degrees in computing and enter the computing workforce. It is lead by a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center at UW and it includes Gallaudet University, the Rochester Institute of Technology/National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and Landmark College as partners. The AccessComputing alliance engages individuals with disabilities as well as those who support, serve, guide, educate, and employ them. Specifically, this extension will  (1) increase the capacity of postsecondary institutions, precollege educators, veterans associations, other projects that broaden participation in computing, and industry to fully include individuals with disabilities in computing fields; (2) create synergistic and lasting relationships among stakeholders to foster systemic changes toward inclusiveness in computing education and careers; (3) implement evidence-based practices (e.g., mentoring, internships) to increase the number of individuals with disabilities moving through critical junctures to computing careers; and (4)  expand an online resource center to share research and promising practices worldwide. Applying methods grounded in multidisciplinary knowledge management, collaboration, and social network theory and practice, the AccessComputing Extension will formalize earlier and new relationships into a multi-tier organizational structure of partners, collaborators, and affiliates. Outcomes for individuals with disabilities will be documented by tracking the progress of student participants as well as institutional enrollment and graduation data; results will be compared to local, regional, and national data with respect to the academic and career success of people with disabilities.",
