 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Proteomics and Functional Genomics (PFG) Scholarship program is supporting academically talented but financially needy students, and reaching out to underrepresented groups. Students are receiving interdisciplinary training integrating biology, chemistry and computer science. These students will eventually attend graduate school or obtain jobs in proteomics and functional genomics or related fields. Students are recruited from high school through advertising and contacts with high school science teachers. The project is aided by the Office of Admissions, UW System Women and Science Program, and UW Oshkosh Science Outreach. The project is supporting 8-10 students during the first year and 5-6 students in each of the three subsequent years. A strong sense of community is being established among students by enrolling all students in single introductory science course sections, housing students on the same dormitory floor, providing staff-hosted social events, and working with peer mentors. Students are provided with research/internship opportunities, faculty mentors, and full use of the Career Services Center. The project extends a successful REU Site in proteomics and functional genomics at UW Oshkosh.",
