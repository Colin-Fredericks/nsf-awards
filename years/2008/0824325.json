 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School for Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for anthropology and allied disciplines located in Santa Fe, NM, will undertake a program of Research Team Seminars. They will bring together scientists who are independently working on a particular anthropological topic and need the time, space, and seclusion that SAR provides in order to discuss, synthesize, and analyze the results of their collaborative research and develop future plans for successful completion of their projects. Eligible research teams will be those in which the primary focus is on a question of anthropological importance, but the teams may be interdisciplinary and international in scope. This award provides three years of funding to support at least two Research Team Seminars each year. \r\n\r\nThis award supports a recent trend in the scientific community towards increased collaborative, interdisciplinary, and international research, which has been found to produce products of increased quality and importance. Studies on the practice of collaborative science demonstrate that, while digital communication is an important component of team research, sustained face-to-face interaction is also needed to successfully advance the research.",
