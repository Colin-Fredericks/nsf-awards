 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a novel high-speed Atomic Layer Deposition technology comprising an ALD reactor and associated thin film processes for GaN thin films required for fabrication of high-brightness Light Emitting Diode (HBLED).  The proposed effort is based on successful demonstration of operation of the ALD reactor in phase-I SBIR project at 5x speed of commercially available ALD reactors.  The unique ALD reactor concept can process atomically thin films and also micron thick films in one chamber.  Furthermore, point-of-use, safer and low-cost generation of chemical precursors combined with low temperature processing promises low defect density thin films of a variety of compound semiconductors including GaN.  \r\n\r\nLow defect density, low cost GaN thin and thick films are building blocks of an HBLED. An HBLED bulb that consumes 15 Watts, lasts 10+ years and costs a few dollars can effectively replace a fluorescent tube consuming 30 Watts and an incandescent bulb consuming 100 Watts.  The proposed ALD technology promises to reduce process cost, and improve the HBLED quality critical to realize ultra-large scale production of affordable HBLEDs for worldwide lighting applications leading to 50% potential electricity savings and tremendous associated environmental benefits.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
