 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of Project Delta is two-fold. One, the PI proposes to extend an existing library of seventeen interacting CDROM digital learning environments on numbers and operations by adding an algebra strand. Two, the PI proposes to evaluate the impact of the new algebra materials on teacher development. Each of the digital environments features classroom sessions that allow for exploration of a mathematics topic, children learning over time, and teachers? instructional techniques. The project's research effort addresses the following questions: What is the impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? content knowledge, general pedagogy, and pedagogical content knowledge? What is the impact of Project Delta experiences on elementary teachers? practices, including the use of their knowledge in planning for and enacting algebra lessons? Three groups of 60 teachers participate in the study.",
