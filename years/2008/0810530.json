 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will investigate the feasibility of a potentially disruptive, new Laser Ranging and Detection (LADAR) sensor system with programmable, multi-waveform capability using an emerging technology of Time-lens Pulse Generator (TLPG)?based Photonics Arbitrary Waveform Generator (P-AWG) or TLPG?based P-AWG for short. In complete contrast to traditional P-AWG, the proposed TLPG?based P-AWG does not consider the functions of Optical Pulse Generator (OPG) and Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) blocks as separate per se. In fact, it generates the arbitrary optical waveforms during the pulse generation itself (or in OPG) by using the time-lens concept. This new TLPG?based PAWG architecture is a cost-effective and robust since it uses Continuous Wave (CW) laser instead of expensive mode-locked lasers (MLL) and/or supercontinuum (SC) sources. This translates to (i) simple set-up, (ii) low optical insertion loss, (iv) compact size, and (v) most importantly overall low-cost. The proposed innovation is a significant yet simple modification of existing PAWG that has far-reaching significance. Phase 1 will be limited to (i) developing model & inverse algorithm for calculating the required RF data signal to generate 4 waveform shapes namely; square, triangle, and impulse waveform, in TLPG?based PAWG, (ii) performing proof-of-concept experiment for TLPG?based PAWG, and (iii) developing preliminary engineering design of the highly resonant optical/microwave ring resonator unit. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf successful the result of this project will have broad commercial, scientific, homeland security, military impact. This new high performance P-AWG-based LADAR addresses the needs for new capabilities above and beyond what conventional LADAR solutions can offer. The commercial applications include high resolution (1) remote aerial mapping, ground surveying, and 3D-modeling for urban planning, (2) autonomous vehicle navigation, machinery guidance and collision avoidance for transportation safety and preventive systems, (3) automated process control, quality control, monitoring and ranging for mobile robot in manufacturing and industrial sites. In the scientific and homeland security arena, this superior P-AWG-based LADAR can be used for global climatology monitoring, environmental sensing, geographic surveying, chemical and biological weapon detection to detect additional target characteristics as well as operate effectively under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, its increased resolution from tailored waveforms will aid in the identification of unknown materials or structures. In addition this new smart LADAR is a key subsystem in military applications such as: laser munitions seekers, airborne reconnaissance, active/passive surveillance, anti-ship missile tracking, targeting systems, and imaging sensors for manned/unmanned autonomous robotic ground/air vehicles to name a few. \r\n",
