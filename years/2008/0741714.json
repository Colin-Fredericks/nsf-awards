An array of exciting activities will (1) engage middle school students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies through mechatronics-enabled science labs and robotics competitions; (2) entice students to pursue STEM education and careers; and (3) provide technology literacy and professional development to teachers. \r\n\t\r\nAMPS will enrich graduate education of 9 Fellows, annually, by enabling them to seamlessly integrate their mechatronics and robotics focused education and research into middle school curriculum. Fellows will use mechatronics-enabled science labs and robotics-based lesson plans to engage middle school students in hands-on scientific explorations. This will allow Fellows to develop a deeper understanding of STEM concepts and their research and an ability to recognize connections between their research and societal needs. Moreover, the project will impart pedagogical, communication, leadership, and team-building skills to Fellows. Finally, AMPS will encourage cross-pollination of education research and technical concepts among the university and school faculty.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of AMPS include: (1) reinforcing STEM education of a diverse and underserved inner-city student body and preparing them for higher education and productive careers; (2) addressing the educational needs of the emerging innovation economy by developing technology-enhanced STEM instruction and lab infrastructure; and (3) broadening Polytechnic?s ties with local school districts to sustain and grow its outreach activities.",
