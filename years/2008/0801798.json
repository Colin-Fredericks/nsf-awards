 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective \r\nThe objective of this effort is to demonstrate the utilization of common-paper substrates for inkjet-printed increased-functionality cognitive and autonomous inexpensive radio frequency tags and wireless nodes.  The approach will use a characterization of paper-based materials and different inkjet-metallization schemes to help integrate components (antennas, transmission lines, matching networks, batteries and energy scavengers), with for compatibility of IC-interconnects with paper. \r\n           \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of the first paper-based inkjet-printed technology platform to integrate RF, antenna, material and battery technologies and develop the first-generation of enhanced-range communication/sensor nodes able to operate in various environments.  The scavenging-antenna approach will facilitate the research in autonomous rugged wireless modules and will allow for the first true mapping of potentially harvested energy in commercial bands. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n           The broader impact of this effort would lead to the reconfigurable autonomous sensor networks of the future, addressing various societal challenges (chemical/explosive-detection, crack/stress detection, secure emergency communications, smart logistics, surveillance sensors, biomonitoring).  In addition, this effort could revolutionize high-frequency electronics? education offering the opportunity to students to inkjet-print electronic prototypes in minutes with near-to-zero cost without the need of expensive and time-consuming masks introducing them for the first time to the principles of environmentally-friendly electronics.  A new senior-level course is planned, along with a dissemination effort in major conferences and through a new textbook in the proposed area.  The project is expected to involve a number of minority students.",
