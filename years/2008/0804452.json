 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMultiferroics are compounds which can be simultaneously magnetized (are\r\nferromagnetic) and electrically charged (are ferroelectric). Such\r\ncompounds hold promise for applications in devices and lead to\r\nunprecedented data-storage capacity. However, the underlying mechanism\r\nwhich leads to such unique properties is poorly understood and needs to be\r\nresolved before practical devices can be fabricated. This individual\r\ninvestigator award supports the study of a family of multiferroic\r\nmanganese oxide compounds known as manganites. The properties of\r\nmanganites are intimately linked to their crystal structure. The theme of\r\nthis project is to quantify the role played by crystal structure in\r\nmultiferroic manganites and suggest methods to design materials better\r\nsuited for device applications. High quality manganite thin films will be\r\ngrown using laser ablation. These thin films' response to strain (change\r\nin the crystal structure) will be studied by measuring the change in their\r\nelectrical resistance and magnetism. The microscopic effect of strain will\r\nbe studied using techniques such as a microscope capable of mapping the\r\nlocal magnetism of the material. Since the research and training program\r\nincludes both sample preparation and measurement, this award will help\r\ntrain undergraduate and graduate students in various aspects of condensed\r\nmatter physics research and give them a broad based experience, which will\r\nenhance their future career options in the industry or academe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPerovskite manganese oxides (manganites) display unique properties such as\r\nmicrometer scale phase separation and multiferroism, which are intimately\r\nlinked to their crystal structure. Hence, the electrical and magnetic\r\nproperties of manganites are sensitive to strain. This individual\r\ninvestigator award supports an experimental program to directly measure\r\nthe effect of strain on the properties of manganites and by comparing the\r\nresults to the predictions of theoretical models, determine the origin of\r\nphase separation and multiferroism in manganites. The experimental results\r\nare also expected to reveal methods of enhancing the magnetoelectric\r\ncoupling in multiferroic manganites and controlling the nanoscale\r\nproperties of phase separated manganites. High quality manganite thin\r\nfilms will be grown using pulsed laser deposition. The thin films will\r\nthen be subjected to direct external stress using a three point\r\nbeam-bending apparatus to induce uniaxial strain in the material. Using a\r\ncomplementary suite of local and bulk measurement techniques such as\r\nmagnetotransport, magnetization, scanning probe microscopy, and neutron\r\nreflectometry, the phase diagram of the thin films will be mapped as a\r\nfunction of strain, magnetic field, electric field, and temperature. Since\r\nthe research and training program includes both sample preparation and\r\nmeasurement, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to learn\r\nabout a wide variety of materials and experimental techniques, which will\r\nprepare them for academic and industrial careers.",
