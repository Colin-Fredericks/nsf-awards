Our long-term goals, therefore, are to: 1) institutionalize, improve and sustain a formal STEM enterprise; and 2) increase the number of STEM faculty engaged in producing more Native Hawaiian and other STEM degree completers. This I3 project will integrate faculty innovation within a formal, sustained, always improving STEM Program tied closely to the strategic and long range directions of the College.",
