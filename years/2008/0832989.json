 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award helps support a workshop from June 9-11, 2008 in Trieste, Italy to explore ways to improve the quality and value of climate reconstructions through a coordinated assessment of uncertainties in paleoclimate proxies. One goal of the workshop is to explore a possible coordinated strategy for the future collection and integration of proxy data from key geographic regions. \r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, the researcher, and his colleagues, have organized an international workshop to focus on three primary elements that include: 1) climate proxies with decadal, or better, temporal resolution; 2) how the uncertainties related to climate reconstruction using these proxies can be quantified; and 3) how these same uncertainties can be reduced.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the award will provide participant support for approximately twenty individuals at U.S. institutions with expertise in paleoclimatology and related aspects of climate research to participate in presentations and discussions that examine the scientific strengths and weaknesses of various climate proxies. The participants will include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  In this manner, an open and lively exchange of views will be enabled.\r\n\r\n",
