 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthesis of scientific research is critical for advancing our understanding of fundamental ecological principles and for charting future research directions. The PI will spend two years synthesizing a 21-year series of investigations on the evolutionary and behavioral ecology of an isolated population of Savannah Sparrows breeding at the Bowdoin Scientific Station on Kent Island, New Brunswick. The project will have three main outcomes: (1) a comprehensive, widely accessible scholarly monograph; (2) popular articles on how to enrich undergraduate scientific education and on the importance of synthesis in ecology; and (3) extensive long-term data sets made available on the web for researchers, educators and students. \r\n\r\nThe main focus will be exploring how different biological traits are inherited in natural populations. Making these extensive data sets available to researchers and students will allow them to explore a wealth of scientific questions. A major impact of this work will be the continued inspiration, training and mentoring of students. So far, thirty-three undergraduates have co-authored publications based on the research that will be synthesized here, highlighting the value of integrating research with education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
