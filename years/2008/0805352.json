The cut-and-paste theory of\r\ncontact structures in dimension three, developed by numerous\r\nauthors including the PI, can now be imported into Heegaard Floer\r\nhomology, a (3+1)-dimensional TQFT.  The PI, together with his\r\ncollaborators, seeks to better understand the relations among\r\ncontact geometry, Floer homology theories, TQFTs and string\r\ntheory, and hyperbolic geometry. More specifically, the PI\r\nproposes the following: (1) Analyze the TQFT properties of\r\nHeegaard/sutured Floer homology.  (2) Understand a certain\r\ncategory obtained via contact geometry, which satisfies many of\r\nthe properties of a triangulated category.  (3) Study contact\r\nhomology invariants of exact Lagrangian cobordisms between\r\nLegendrian links in the symplectization of a contact manifold.\r\n(4) Calculate the contact homology of tight contact structures on\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes a study of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces using a\r\nprobe called a contact structure. The 3-dimensional spaces we\r\nstudy will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)\r\n3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very complicated\r\nglobally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just\r\nas an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a\r\nvery large sphere.  A contact structure is a field in\r\n3-dimensional space, analogous to an electric field in physics.\r\nJust as the nature of the electric field, such as the strength\r\nand the direction at any point, gives some information about the\r\ndistribution of the electric charge, i.e., the source of the\r\nelectric field, a contact structure gives information about the\r\nshape of the ambient 3-dimensional space.  A more thorough\r\nmathematical understanding of contact structures in dimension\r\nthree may contribute significantly towards our understanding of\r\nthe shape of the universe.\r\n",
