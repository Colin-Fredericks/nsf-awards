The conference aims to develop a\r\ncomprehensive overview of the present status and future\r\ndirections of geometric analysis and its connections to many\r\nareas including algebraic geometry, analysis, topology,\r\nmathematical physics, and string theory.\r\n\r\nThe occasion for this large conference on geometric analysis and\r\nrelated geometric subjects is the sixtieth birthday of Shing-Tung\r\nYau, one of the leaders in the area.  Geometric analysis is a\r\nmarriage of geometric problems and ideas, which often concern\r\nproperties of geometric spaces on large scales, with analytic\r\ntechniques that begin with small-scale features of geometry and\r\nsometimes allow us to extrapolate those to large-scale\r\nstatements.  Two of the great successes of geometric analysis are\r\nthe Calabi Conjecture, settled by Yau in the 1970s and later\r\nfound to be a key to the development of string theory, and the\r\nPoincare Conjecture, a celebrated problem that was open for more\r\nthan one hundred years before its resolution just a few years ago\r\nby G. Perelman, who brought to maturity a program launched in the\r\n1980s by R. Hamilton.  Many of the results and techniques\r\ndeveloped over the last thirty years in geometric analysis and\r\ndifferential geometry were essential to the proof of the Poincare\r\nConjecture, and the ideas contributed to the problem by Perelman\r\nhave set off worldwide activity on new questions in geometric\r\nanalysis.
