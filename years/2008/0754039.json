 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this research is to improve understanding of the processes that lead to structure and intensity changes of tropical cyclones (TC). The working hypotheses are (1) any environmental flow introduces quasi-stationary asymmetric forcing which reduce the capability of axisymmetrization potential of the symmetric circulation, and thus limiting the maximum potential intensity that the TC otherwise can achieve given favorable tropical oceanic conditions, and (2) external forcing affects tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes either directly or indirectly through the mesoscale processes occurring in the inner core region (within about 200 km from the cyclone center), including interactions among inner, outer spiral rainbands and eyewall convection; concentric eyewall cycle; and eyewall breakdown and the associated mixing process. The following scientific questions will be addressed: \r\n\r\na. How do the inner and outer spiral rainbands form, propagate, and interact with each other and with eyewall convection, affecting tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes? \r\n\r\nb. How important is the environmental asymmetric forcing to the formation of tropical cyclone concentric eyewall and the subsequent eyewall replacement? What determines the timing and lifetime of the concentric eyewall cycle and the associated tropical cyclone intensity change? \r\n\r\nc. How does the inner core of a tropical cyclone respond to vertical shear of the environmental flow and what are the subsequent changes in storm structure and intensity? How sensitive are the structure and intensity changes to both the magnitude and vertical profile of the shear? \r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, the Principal Investigator (PI) will use the quadruply nested, movable mesh, fully compressible, nonhydrostatic tropical cyclone model (TCM4) developed by the PI to conduct a series of well-designed idealized numerical experiments. The PI will analyze satellite and radar data for tropical cyclones over both the western North Pacific and Atlantic and the global reanalysis products to help design the idealized model initial conditions. Comprehensive diagnostics and budget analyses of the numerical results will be performed to elucidate the physical mechanisms. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project: This research will further understanding of the roles of inner core dynamics and their interaction with the large-scale environment in leading to the structure and intensity changes of tropical cyclones, in particular, their contributions to the formation of concentric eyewall structure and the size changes of the eye, eyewall, and the storm scale circulation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project: Research on tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes is of high priority within the U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP), an interagency activity designed to perform research necessary to improve understanding and prediction of tropical cyclone motion, structure, and intensity. This research potentially will contribute to improved understanding of the physical processes that cause the tropical cyclone structure and intensity changes, leading to improved prediction of tropical cyclone structure and intensity by numerical models. In the process of carrying out this research, the PI will train a graduate student in the science of tropical cyclones, especially in the area of tropical cyclone modeling and numerical prediction.\r\n",

These include (1) what controls the inner-core size of TCs; (2) how important the initial structure of the TC vortex is to the numerical prediction models for TC forecast; (3) how important the unbalanced dynamics is to the initial development of asymmetric structure and the intensity change for a mature TC embedded in environmental vertical wind shear; (4) how the outer spiral rainbands form and how they may affect the TC structure and intensity; and (5) how different the dynamical and thermodynamic characteristics are in the inner and outer spiral rainbands.\n\nIn addition to the basic understanding, during the course of this project, we have also developed two dynamical initialization schemes for TC vortex: one is used to improve the numerical simulations of real TC cases for process studies, and one is designed to improve the initial structure and intensity of TCs and the warm spin-up of model physics for real-time TC forecast models. In particular, both schemes were developed based on the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is a community mesoscale model and can be used use-friendly by other community users.\n\nA real-time forecasting system for western North Pacific (WNP)TCs has been developed at the University of Hawaii, which includes the WRF model, an automatic scheduling of real-time forecast, a dynamical initialization scheme with warm model physics spin-up that was developed by the PI's group. The model forecasts are available online and can potentially be used as guidance to operational forecasts of WNP TCs. This system was also attempted to help identify the weakness and challenging aspects of TC forecast and thus help identify future research directions.\n\nWe have studied how the ENSO and East Indian Ocean (EIO) sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly affect the interannual variability of TC activity over the WNP. We found that ENSO remarkably affects the east-west shift of the mean genesis location and accordingly contributes to the intense TC activity. The EIO SSTA affects the TC genesis in the entire western North Pacific and largely determines the total number of tropical cyclone counts. Furthermore, a significant finding has been the SST gradient between the southwest Pacific and the western Pacific warm pool in boreal spring, which has been identified as a new factor that controls the interannual variability of TC genesis frequency over the WNP. Based on these findings, a new statistical prediction scheme for seasonal WNP TC activity has been developed in collaboration with researchers in Shanghai Typhoon Institute, China. Results show promising skill of the scheme in the last several years.\n\nWe have also assessed the potential impact of global warming on TC maximum potential intensity (MPI) based on ensemble simulations from 15 CGCMs participated into Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment (AR4). Different from other studies, we considered the dynamical control of the MPI in our assessment. In particular, with the dynamical control considered, the results show that although the MPI is expected to increase insignificantly over most of the North Atlantic, it increases significantly (by 5-8%) in some US coastal regions. Therefore, potential increase in tropical cyclone intensity might be a special concern for future economic development of the eastern coastal regions of US.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/17/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yuqing Wang"
