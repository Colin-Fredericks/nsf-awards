 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next generation wireless networks will focus on the open \r\nwireless architecture platform. In such a network, heterogeneous \r\nwireless systems will be integrated to provide reliable, \r\nhigh-bandwidth, on-demand services with performance guarantees \r\nto a variety of users with di\u00aeerent tra\u00b1c characteristics, \r\nsecurity requirement, and hardware capabilities. This SGER \r\nproject is exploring three key issues in the resource management \r\nof such systems. First, utility-based model is investigated to\r\ndeal with access selection and vertical handover decisions in \r\nwhich policies governing the network operations are embodied \r\nin the design of marginal utility functions. Second, a \r\nutility-based QoS enabling scheduling model is developed in \r\nwhich the utility at a given moment can re\u00b0ect the received \r\nproductivity of the system in the long term run and scheduling \r\ndecisions to deal with multiple QoS parameters are made using \r\nreinforcement learning. Third, an integrated model that measures\r\nsecurity overheads experienced by security-critical tasks and is \r\napplicable to the security-aware admission control is developed. \r\nThe proposed research is focused on the development of solutions \r\nthat are critical for next generation wireless and mobile \r\ncommunication networking systems. Written reports of research \r\nfindings will be disseminated through academic publications.\r\n",
