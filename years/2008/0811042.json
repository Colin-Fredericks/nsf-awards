The purpose of the symposium is to create an international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners from all over the world to:  review, disseminate and discuss the state-of-the-art research developments on the mechanobiology of genes, proteins, cells, tissues, and organs, and identify the important academic problems that research can be aimed in relevant directions in the future.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will cover research areas of vital interest to our well-being. The focus is on the most recent advances in the mechanics of biomolecules (including proteins, genes, cytoskeletons, etc.), cells (and their interactions with extracellular matrix), tissues and organs, the development of relevant advanced mathematical methods, and the discovery of biological secrets. The workshop will also provide a linkage between the conventional mechanics and the emerging bio- and nano-mechanics. The deliverable will be a report summarizing the result of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will promote and strengthen collaboration among scholars and researchers on one of the fastest growing field mechanobiology/chemistry. One emphasis of the workshop is to encourage the participation of woman, minority and young researchers in the expected excellent professional gathering. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will also be encouraged to attend. This will expose them to the diversity of perceptions and interests in the global research community. This will allow them to establish personal contact with people sharing their research interests all over the world.",
