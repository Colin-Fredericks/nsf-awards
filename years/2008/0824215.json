 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the magnetoresistance of the nanocontacts made of the novel phase-separated ferromagnetic metal-metal oxide/hydroxide nanomaterials. The approach is to build, test and study prototype nanocontact devices having different and well characterized material structures. These devices will be built using bottom-up fabrication scheme with nanocontact structures varying from single crystal nickel or iron to the nanocontact having ferromagnetic matrix with certain fraction of metal-oxide/hydroxide phase. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit The proposed research addresses the feasibility of ferromagnetic metal-metal oxide/hydroxide nanomaterials synthesized in the nanoelectrode geometry configuration as novel approach for fabrication of magnetic field sensors. This project will establish the fundamental relationship between the size and material structure of ferromagnetic nanocontacts and their magnetoresistance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact The proposed research program represents a multidisciplinary effort which has a large transformative potential for development of future magnetic field sensors for magnetic recording, magnetic imaging, spintronics and magnetic biosensor technologies. The new knowledge created in this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate curriculum of nanotechnology and nanofabrication courses at the University of Houston and it will become a part of the broad educational outreach through the Electrochemical Society's short course instructed by PI. This work will provide the training for three doctoral students and for several high school teachers and undergraduate students involved in the summer research programs sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The students involved in this project will have a chance to get the training and to work in industrial research environment through the internships provided by the Seagate Technology.",

The conducted research has led to complete phenomenological description of the hydroxide/oxide incorporation mechanism into ferromagnetic deposit during electrodeposition process. The effect of experimental/electrodeposition conditions such as pH of the solution, thickness of the diffusion boundary layer, concentration of the metal ions, current density and current efficiency are examined and now well understood. \n\nStructure and Properties of the Ferromagnetic Metal-Metal Oxide/Hydroxide Nanocontact Material. The analytical HRTEEM and STEM with nano-EDS and nano-EELS capability has revealed in detail the metallurgical structure of the electrodeposited Metal-Metal Oxide/Hydroxide Material. The dominant phase of the electrodeposited material is ferromagnetic FeCo or NiFe matrix which contains intragranular FeO nanophase dispersed randomly throughout the grains. The dominant oxide phase in electrodeposited material is Fe2O3 mainly segregated at the grain boundaries of the ferromagnetic metal phase (Figure 1). \n\nStress Control in Electrodeposited Films and Nanostructures. The experimental work has led to quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the saccharine effect on stress in electrodeposited CoFe and NiFe thin films and nanostructures. Within the time of the project, a unique apparatus has been built to study insitu stress evolution in thin films during electrodeposition as a function of the film thickness and additive concentration in the solution, Figure 2. The analytical model describing phenomenological relation between the saccharine concentration in the solution and resulting stress in electrodeposited films is developed emphasizing the importance of additive/saccharine adsorption phenomenon during the deposit growth.\n\nStress Evolution in Electrodeposited Films and Nanostructures During Annealing The new, \u00e6one of a kind\u00c6 set up for insitu stress measurements during annealing of magnetic films have been developed and the effect of temperature on stress in CoFe and NiFe films and nanostructures has been investigated insitu.  The heating and termally induced stress change are identified as the main causes of fatigue and change of the device performance. \n\nCorrosion Properties of Electrodeposited Films The research revealed that saccharine incorporation phenomenon is the main origin of the increased corrosion susceptibility of electrodeposited CoFe nanocontacts and thin films. The direct correlation between the cathodic shift in corrosion potential and incorporation rate of saccharine in CoFe films was found. This study revealed the fact that optimum additive formulation for electrodeposition of nanocontact material has to consider both, benefits and drawbacks of saccharine incorporation into the deposit.\n\n Nanofabrication Scheme for Nanocontact Based Magnetic Field Sensor Device. The vertically integrated bottom-up fabrication scheme for nanocontact magnetic field sensor device fabrication was developed yielding a large number of fabricated devices and test structures, Figure 3. \n\nNanocontact Based Magnetic Field Sensors. Novel magnetic sensor device based on ferromagnetic metal-metal oxide/hydroxide material in nanocontact configuration demonstrated large values of magnetoresistance (50% up to &gt;1000%), Figure 4 and Figure 5.  The low temperature resistivity measurements revealed that dominant mechanism controlling the resistivity of CoFe-oxide/hydroxide nanocontact is spin polarized transport through the semiconducting grain boundaries made out of  of Fe2O3 or FeOxFe2O3 disordered/amorphous oxide phase. The scaling of magneto-resistance with the minimum contact resistance  indicate that  electron scattering from magnetic domain walls confined wit..."
