MIMSUP, operated at Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) since 1990, will provide marine education to eight under-represented minority students annually who are recruited from around the nation. Students will spend two quarters in residence taking a total of 31 quarter-credits that may be transferred back to their home institutions. During the first quarter, students take a laboratory/field course in Oceanography, a Current Trends in Marine Science course that introduces them to modern investigative techniques and the potential professional opportunities that will be available to them, and a research course in which they plan and execute an independent project under the supervision of a faculty member. They all participate in a program that involves training in and application of outreach education in marine science to K-12 school children. During the second quarter, students will take a Scientific Communication course and two additional courses covering various marine science topics. Students receive full tuition, housing, travel costs, and a stipend, as well as support to participate in regional and national meetings. The stipend also supports the students' participation in K-12 outreach activities of about 10 hours per week in local schools. Of the prior 135 participants, 112 have finished their undergraduate degrees, and of those, 55% have pursued either a Master's, Doctoral, or professional degree. Prior participants have included 50% Latino/Hispanic, 26% African American, 11% Pacific Islander, and 13% Native American/Native Alaskan students. \r\n",

During the MIMSUP program, all participants completed 31 credits of intensive, upper-level university coursework; gained hands-on experience in state-of-the-art research methodology and equipment; engaged in independent research, supervised and mentored by active marine scientists at the marine center; presented their own research in multiple venues, including formal science conferences; and developed and taught marine science outreach lessons in local K-12 classrooms. The goals of MIMSUP are 1) to introduce students from groups underrepresented in the sciences to career options in the marine science, 2) to encourage them to consider marine science as a career option, and 3) to prepare participants to succeed, and excel, in marine science or other STEM disciplines. Outcomes of the program, which continue to develop as students move along their career paths, indicate that MIMSUP is achieving these goals. Of 40 MIMSUP participants, 5, upon completion of their undergraduate degrees, have subsequently entered PhD programs; an additional 7 have pursued MS degrees. Thus, at least 30 percent have gone on to advanced degrees in the field, and many others continue to move in that direction. Program alumni, with strong support from MIMSUP staff, have been remarkably successful in finding the post-MIMSUP opportunities that are helping them along their career track. To date, the 40 program participants have been awarded at least 52 internships (including 17 NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates positions and 5 other NSF-funded internships), 11 fellowships (including 2 NSF Graduate Research Fellowships), 9 scholarships, 6 research grants, and 3 other academic awards/recognitions.
