 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new REU site award would provide research opportunities for 8 undergraduates (including 5 from underrepresented minority groups) and 2 Jackson area high school teachers for 10 weeks during summer.  The research projects are in cutting edge nanoscale materials chemistry with potential biological and environmental applications and carried out under close guidance from faculty mentors.  The participants will integrate in a research group that consists of other undergraduate, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and visiting faculty.  They will also receive an introduction to and overview of state-of-the-art scanning probe and electron microscopes, lasers, spectroscopic laboratories on campus, and access to high performance computing facilities in and around Jackson, Mississippi.  In addition to the research, REU students will attend seminars and short courses on Nanomaterials Science and Engineering, acquire technical presentation skills, and receive career guidance that will continue beyond the summer program. The high school teachers will develop instructional materials that are based on their research experience, thus bridging K-12 education with nanoscience and technology research and career pathways.  The instructional materials, after classrooms tests, will be available for broad dissemination to other K-12 teachers.\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n",
