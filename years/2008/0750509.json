 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social science research on cyberinfrastructure has relied upon\u00a0piecemeal, project-specific approaches to studying how social,\u00a0technical, organizational and cultural features intertwine. The\u00a0proposed project will move CI studies to the next level toward\u00a0large-scale, integrative approaches that will create comparable,\u00a0reusable datasets across a range of research areas, collaboration methods, project scales, and project goals. The outcomes of the\u00a0proposed work are (1) to produce fundamental social science about infrastructure development for virtual organizations and for data; (2) to create a functioning virtual organization with a specific\u00a0set of goals to study data practice and data policy; and (3) to identify methods for formative evaluation of CI efforts on data, data analysis, and visualization that will be enriched by continual comparisons between projects. The long-term goal is to establish a\u00a0CI Virtual Observatory for the study of data, data analysis, and\u00a0visualization. Toward that goal, the proposed one-year project will\u00a0undertake the necessary background research to develop such a\u00a0virtual organization, to identify the most effective models for a\u00a0virtual organization, and to identify the research questions about\u00a0data, data analysis, and visualization that must be addressed to construct a viable cyberinfrastructure. As a test bed, the project\u00a0will focus on bringing together principal players of CI projects in the environmental and atmospheric sciences.\r\n",
