 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to develop a road map for planning a comprehensive bilateral US-Taiwan team- and center-based research and implementation plan for realizing significant advances in civil and mechanical infrastructure based on ?smart structures and systems through the adaptation of bio-inspired sensing and actuation technologies?. Taiwan is situated in a highly seismically active region of the world with devastating earthquakes occurring almost every decade and along the primary path of Northwestern Pacific tropical cyclones occurring almost yearly. Because of the extensive investment by the National Taiwan Council (NSC), Taiwan today is a recognized leader in the hazard mitigation field.  In this workshop we proposed that significant improvements in multiple nature hazard mitigation approaches are still possible and can be achieved through the adoption of transformative technologies such as bio-inspired sensing and actuation concepts. Bilateral groups of scientists from academia, government, and industry will be invited to contribute and to develop a framework for an integrated research frontier that is envisioned to revitalize US-Taiwan collaboration on emerging research serving pressing societal needs.",
