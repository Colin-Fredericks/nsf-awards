 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists are just beginning to understand the genetic basis of variable aspects of or-ganisms such as size, shape and color, to name a few. However, most traits are com-plex, their development directed by many genes whose effects are influenced by environmental conditions. These combined effects on trait variation must be mediated through the identity and behavior of cells such that, for example, some cells proliferate more to make larger cartilages, or excrete additional matrix to make stronger bones. However, little is presently known about the precise mechanisms of cellular integration, and filling this gap in knowledge is a fundamental problem in biology and is the primary focus of this project. Natural variation in threespine stickleback fish provides an excel-lent opportunity to address this question. The goal of this research is to understand how cells integrate genetic and environmental information and lead to variation in complex head and jaw traits among populations of stickleback. These structures vary tremen-dously among individuals, populations and species. Despite this diversity, all vertebrates share conserved genetic interactions for the development of head and jaw struc-tures. Thus, research on these traits is useful for understanding the situation in stickle-backs, and is also highly informative about the proper development of similar structures in other vertebrates such as humans. These conditions are the product of many genes and their interactions with the envi-ronment, and lead to variations in cellular identities or behaviors (i.e. uncontrolled cell growth in cancer). This research will provide a much better understanding of the genetic and cellular basis of complex traits, be they characters important for stickleback, or the most common types of human diseases.  In addition, Alaskan stickleback populations are studied in collaboration with laboratories at the University of Alaska Anchorage, which has a large Alaska Native student population, and the unique opportunity exists to include individuals in this underrepresented group into research and educational activi-ties.  Furthermore, an educational website is maintained that uses stickleback to provide educators and researchers around the world with knowledge and skills necessary to learn about and perform research with stickleback.",
