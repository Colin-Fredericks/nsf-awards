 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of the award is to investigate processing concepts to fabricate engineering materials with nanometer-sized grains that are characterized by a combination of very high strength in conjunction with ductility. The development of processing concepts will address the critical issue of low ductility in nanostructured materials by elucidating the underlying basic principles governing plastic deformation and high ductility in nanograined materials. Physical models with predictive capabilities for a wide range of material systems based on the inter-relationships between the processing scheme and mechanical properties will be developed.\r\n \r\n\tSuccessful completion of this research will provide mechanical processing of advanced high strength iron-based alloys with superior formability. The high strength-ductility combination of nanograined materials will allow for thinner sections or components which may lead to fuel economy in the transportation sector. Often scarce and expensive alloying elements are added to achieve the desired effects of high strength and ductility. In this regard, the outcome of the research may reduce the dependence on these alloying elements through thermo-mechanical processing approaches to obtain nanograined structures. Additionally, nanograined/ultrafine-grained structures are believed to be favorable for cell adhesion and metabolic activity on the surface of orthopedic implants. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit through involvement in research and integration of research with existing curriculum.",
