The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Nicole C. Lautze to work with Dr. Jacopo Taddeucci at the Instituto Nazionale de Geofisica e Volcanologia in Rome, Italy for fifteen months, and with Dr. Bruce Houghton at the University of Hawaii for eight months.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide understanding of the origin, fragmentation, and ejection of  basaltic volcanic ash.  Fallout of volcanic ash is arguably the most widespread of all natural hazards, having the potential to affect climate, crops, water supply and air travel on international scales. This project incorporates analysis of ash samples from single, observed explosions at Stromboli volcano (Italy), and performance of analogue experiments in Rome?s Experimental Geophysics and Volcanology Laboratory. Textural and chemical data will be gained on ~80 unique ash samples each from an individual explosion collected during fieldwork in 2002, and individual explosion samples collected using a motorized glider in subsequent years.  These are among the most ?precise? ash samples ever collected.  Comparison of ash in these samples with particles created in controlled-fragmentation experiments provides insight into the origin of ash particles.  This project addresses questions such as, a) which are the main processes that generate ash particles during basaltic explosions, and b) to what extent can features of ash particles be used as a proxy for explosion dynamics?  Insight into such questions will enable a broader understanding of past and future ash-generating eruptions worldwide. \r\n",

Fallout of volcanic ash is arguably the most widespread of all natural hazards, having the potential to affect climate, crops, water supply and air travel on international scales.  Greater understanding of the processes of ash production and distribution therefore has potential to benefit society at large.  However, largely because of the difficulty in analyzing ash particles due to their small size, there exists a relative paucity of studies on the physical properties of volcanic ash.  This project employed a relatively new, partly-automated technique to obtain quantitative data on the surface chemistry and morphoscopy of individual ash particles.  The study demonstrated the utility of this relatively simple and rapid technique, and the data obtained provided useful insights into the process of volcanic ash production and subsequent chemical alteration at Stromboli and Etna volcanoes.  A minimum of two peer-reviewed publications and seven professional presentations will result from this project.  The project also established a firm partnership between volcanologists in the US and Italy. \n\nIntellectual Merit. The eruption of basaltic ash is a common occurrence and forms a widespread hazard.  However, research regarding the process of fragmentation of ash-sized particles through volcanic processes is virtually non-existent.  This project therefore addressed a current deficiency in the field.  Additionally, it enabled the development of a robust international collaboration among Principal Investigator Lautze, and Professors Taddeucci and Houghton, and built on their foundation of tephra analyses at Stromboli and Etna volcanoes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicole C Lautze"
