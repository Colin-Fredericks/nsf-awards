The conference will serve\r\nas the 2008 annual meeting of the Vector Bundles on Algebraic Curves\r\n(VBAC) group, an international network of mathematicians working on\r\nresearch questions related to vector bundles and their moduli\r\nspaces. The meeting will also honor the 70th birthday of Professor\r\nS. Ramanan, a pioneer in the subject, and will form part of a\r\nSemester on Moduli Spaces organized by a consortium of Spanish\r\nmathematics research centers.\r\n\r\nVector bundles and their associated moduli spaces stands at the\r\ncrossroads of several areas of mathematics, involving ideas from\r\nalgebraic geometry, topology, differential geometry and gauge\r\ntheory. They have strong connections with theoretical physics, where\r\nthe interaction between geometry and string theory has sparked major\r\nadvances in both disciplines.   After algebraic varieties\r\nthemselves, vector bundles are probably the next most studied\r\nobjects in algebraic geometry. The speakers and participants invited\r\nto the conference described in this proposal include many of the\r\npre-eminent experts in the field.",
