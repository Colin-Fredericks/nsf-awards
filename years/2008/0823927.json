 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop the critical analytical framework for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication in complex channels.  Existing MIMO capacity calculation software will be enhanced by including complex channel models for vehicles, lossy biological channels, and highly noisy channels.  We will also integrate detector models with the electromagnetic and communication MIMO models, and verify the models via measurement. \r\n\r\n  \r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nToday's MIMO models do not include an accurate representation of non-Gaussian, ultra-reflective, depolarizing, and highly lossy channels seen in many personal communication channels, body-worn or implanted medical communication channels, highly reflective and lossy ('Hyper-Raleigh') channels typical of intra-vehicular communication for sensor networks inside aircraft, cars, buses, trains, ships, etc., most wireless ad-hoc network environments, or the human body scattering channel for medical imaging.  This research program will provide more advanced channel models for MIMO.  This will enable specialized MIMO design for each application, providing a far greater probability of initial success for the deployed systems. \r\n\r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis research addresses unmet communication demand for future wireless devices.    In addition to the significant societal, medical, and financial aspects of that potential advancement, the research will be directly integrated into coursework at the University of Utah.",

The inside of metallic vehicles (aircraft, helicopters, cars, buses, trains, etc.) have channels with a lot of echo and multipath reflection.  New sensors that are being developed for safety and diagnosis of vehicle health (fire, vibration, heat, engine health, electrical fault location, etc.) often require communication within this very difficult channel.
