 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract-DMS-0806070\r\n\r\nThe overall description of the proposal is to study manifolds with positive or more generally nonnegative sectional curvature under the assumption of a large isometry group. In past proposals  the principal investigator has used this approach to produce many new examples of nonnegative  curvature, including some on exotic spheres. The present proposal studies a specific class of manifolds that admit an isometric group action with one dimensional quotient and which he considers to be excellent candidates for new examples with positive curvature. These candidates were obtained in a previous proposal as part of a classification theorem. The principal investigator plans to study a concrete class of metrics on these manifolds and has obtained considerable expertise in their curvature properties already. This project is extremely difficult and is expected to require a long term time investment.\r\nThere are many questions of a more general nature within this subject of ``\\nnc\\ with large isometry groups\" that the principal investigator plans to study, and which promise a much quicker return. Finally, as was done in past proposals with success, studying topological properties of new and known examples can be very difficult but also very rewarding.\r\n\r\n\r\nManifolds with positive sectional curvaturecan be defined by the property that the sum of the 3 angles in any triangle is larger than 180 degrees, i.e.\r\ntheir geometry is similar to that of the round sphere. Global Riemannian geometry can be described as relating local invariants like curvature to global topological invariants. Since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry, manifolds with positive or more generally non-negative curvature have been an important part of this subject. A basic unsolved question is whether exotic spheres, i.e. manifolds that look like spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different, can carry positively curved metrics. \r\nSymmetries are an important aspect of many geometric questions and the principal investigator plans to study manifolds with positive or more generally non-negative curvature under the presence of a large symmetry group. One of the goals of this investigation is the search for new examples.\r\n\r\n",
