 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research has the potential to transform the nature of computer aided design (CAD) systems, specifically by building a system that allows sketching and 3D modeling to co-exist in a CAD system that abandons the assumption that a system must maintain a valid 3D model at all times. In exploring the middle ground between sketch and object, the proposed work addresses one of the holy grail problems in interactive graphics: how to move seamlessly between 2D and 3D. This understanding includes not only a computer graphics perspective (algorithms and representations) but also an architectural design perspective, where practitioners have a deep working knowledge of form creation but may lack a computational or mathematical background. To support sketching on 3D models, useful operations for creating design elements, incorporating source material and organizing them in 3D space need to be invented and specified by designers and those that are computationally feasible in a free flowing interactive environment are defined and implemented. The research method of iterative design and development allows this project to focus on the needs of creative designers in the context of computer scientists and their understanding of computational feasibility. Broader Impact: The project has a broader impact on the creative design process by offering a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form, and also impacts the communication of ideas where 2D representation has dominated.",
