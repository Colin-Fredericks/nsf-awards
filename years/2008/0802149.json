 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electro Mechanical program prepares students for real world experiences and addresses future labor shortages in several fields. Graduates are employed as maintenance or operations technicians in regional manufacturing companies. The college's Technology Department enhances and strengthens the Electro Mechanical program by means of several activities. New courses are added and some revised to provide real world experiences with industrial machines. Several courses are improved by incorporating hands-on teaching equipment into these courses. Examples of equipment are a portable pneumatics trouble shooting trainer and a portable PLC. Scholarships are provided to underrepresented students, women and students with disabilities. In addition, the project is recruiting students from middle schools and high schools throughout the region. The Electro Mechanical degree and certificate programs serve students and company employees throughout the Southeastern Tennessee region of the Tennessee Valley Authority. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
