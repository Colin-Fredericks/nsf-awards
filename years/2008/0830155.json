Each scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program.  Students receive valuable education and training -- including hands-on laboratory experience -- in state-of-the-art FPGA based security, intrusion detection, digital forensics, security visualization, and ad hoc network security.  Upon graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in an IA position.  The scholarship program helps to address the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.  The project has a proactive approach to recruitment of minorities and females into the scholarship program.\r\n",
