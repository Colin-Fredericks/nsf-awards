 "awd_abstract_narration": "The four phase project builds on the successful outcomes of previous Gordon Conferences on Visualization in Science and Education. It brings together roughly 130 leading international researchers and science educators for: two workshops on assessment and design; a Gordon Conference on Visualization in Science and Education; five collaborative Visionary Mini-Grants for exploratory research across interdisciplinary communities; and a post-conference interim workshop for evaluation and planning. The conference has been re-organized in the current proposal to bridge science practice with science education. The sessions are organized around conceptual themes rather than scientific disciplines in order to explore the connections between visualization and understanding. Many of the invited speakers and all of the proposed activities surrounding the conference will be heavily focused on the learning and cognitive aspects of revealing nature and of generating insight.",
