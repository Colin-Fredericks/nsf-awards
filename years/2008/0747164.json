Separation of DNA and mutation detection will be based on pulling DNA strands off a solid surface upon stretching them under the influence of an electric field.  The research will investigate the entropic elasticity of DNA molecules upon electrokinetic streching using a dual polarization interferometry technique.  Focus will be placed on the elastic properties of DNA in low force (less than 0.1 pN) regimes, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) secondary structures formed by folding upon itself, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with base-pair mismatches. The force-extension relationship of DNA molecules obtained from these investigations will be employed to design and develop innovative DNA separation and mutation screening processes based on their viscoelastic properties. Processes that evolve from this development will be applied to break through the current limitations of DNA separation technologies in several applications including (i) separation of chromosome-sized DNA molecules, (ii) screening of gene mutations in large DNA fragments, and (iii) separation of DNA sequencing fragments with long read lengths. The research will demonstrate a novel paradigm of separating biopolymers based on their viscoelastic properties, which may also be applied to RNA and proteins. \r\n\r\nThe outcome of the project may have practical significance in enabling genetic analysis to become part of a standard physical examination and to realize the promise of personalized medical care tailored to an individual's unique genetic identity. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, the education component of this proposal consists of three parts: (i) development of a course on biopolymer physics in separation processes for chemical engineering graduate and senior undergraduate students, (ii) development of an international field study module for undergraduate education focusing on international views of ethical and social issues of genetic research through collaboration with Tsinghua University, China, and (iii) outreach to high school and exposure of underrepresented minority pre-college students to science and innovations through development of high-school course unit and workshop by collaboration with Baldwin High School and Westinghouse High School in Pittsburgh with a nearly 100% African-American student population. \r\n\r\n",
