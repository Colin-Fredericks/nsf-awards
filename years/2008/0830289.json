 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves one of the key challenges in wireless networks: how \r\nto take advantage of new advances at the physical layer to push for new \r\ndesign at the upper layers. The approach used is hitchhiking-based cooperative \r\ncommunication (CC) that takes advantage of the physical layer design that \r\nfacilitates the combining of partial information. A node can receive several \r\npartial signals and combine these signals to retrieve the complete signal. \r\nThrough effective use of partial signals, a packet can be delivered with fewer \r\nnodes and/or less transmission power at each node. The investigator proposes \r\na new weighted graph model that can capture the nature of CC. One key concept \r\nproposed is the new notion of  ?link? and ?path? on which other graph \r\nterminologies can be defined.\r\n\r\nBased on this new graph model, the research focuses on two types of \r\npower-efficient design under CC: (1) Power saving protocols that put wireless \r\nnodes into periodical sleep states while maintaining global ?domination? of \r\nactive nodes. (2) Power control for transmission energy consumption by \r\nadjusting transmission ranges while maintaining global ?connectivity?. \r\nWith these, this research presents a promising and unique way of applying this \r\ngraph model to energy-efficient design in wireless networks. This research also \r\ninvolves the design of a general methodology of localized solutions and applies \r\nit to address various energy-related optimization problems under CC. The central \r\ntheme of this research fits well with the objective of the SING program on \r\nfundamental theoretical and algorithmic studies involving coordination and \r\ncommunication. The insights and results of this research are expected to \r\nprovide guidelines for energy-efficiency for a wide range of wireless network \r\napplications.\r\n\r\n",
