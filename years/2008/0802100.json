 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a reliable nanofabrication method and to study the related interfacial science and fluid behavior that can reliably prevent a common, but seldom addressed, problem at the microscale ? fouling. The research approach is to (1) synthesize and characterize an active nanostructuring polymeric film, (2) understand its nanostructuring mechanism and reversibility, (3) evaluate the anti-fouling performance, and (4) apply it onto a micro device for fluid manipulation. \r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis polymeric surface, possessing unique features such as the ease of processing, low actuation voltage and reversible nanostructuring, can be applied towards minimizing fouling and fluid manipulation at the microscale. The research outcomes can be applied to actively control surface morphology, flow condition, and limit fouling. \r\nBroader Impacts\r\nNational Science Foundation?s support for this research on smart nanostructured surfaces will have significant impact on promoting national nanotechnology education. Through this collaborative work at Rochester Institute of Technology and San Francisco State University, nanotechnology demonstrations and hands-on experiences developed from the research activities will introduce K-12 students to the science and fabrication of micro/nanotechnology for practical applications in upstate New York and the San Francisco Area. To promote further opportunities, underrepresented students from Women in Engineering and North Star Program at R.I.T. as well as MESA Engineering Program at SFSU will be incorporated in the outreach activities. Additionally, the anti-fouling applications in IC cooling and biomedical microdevice aspects are far-reaching within social, scientific and industrial aspects and will reinforce our existing research and teaching strengths. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
