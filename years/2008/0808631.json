In his solution to Calabi's conjecture, Yau proved the\r\nexistence of a Kahler-Einstein metric on compact Kahler manifolds\r\nwith vanishing or negative first Chern class. An alternative\r\nproof of Calabi's conjecture is given by Cao using the\r\nKahler-Ricci flow. However, most projective algebraic varieties\r\ndo not have definite or trivial first Chern classes.  Recently\r\nPerelman has made major breakthrough in Hamilton's program as an\r\napproach to the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization\r\nconjecture. The principal investigator proposes to study the\r\ncanonical metrics on the canonical models of projective varieties\r\nof positive Kodaira dimension by applying the Kahler-Ricci\r\nflow. Such canonical metrics are constructed by the deformation\r\nof the Kaher-Ricci flow on minimal projective surfaces of\r\npositive Kodaira dimension. These generalized Kahler-Einstein\r\nmetrics can be considered as an analytic version of the abundance\r\nconjecture in algebraic geometry and will also lead to new\r\nadvances in the understanding and application of the Ricci\r\nflow. In Donaldson's far reaching program, the geometry of the\r\ninfinite dimensional symmetric space of Kahler metrics in a fixed\r\nclass is related to the existence and uniqueness of constant\r\nscalar curvature Kahler metrics. The principal investigator also\r\nintends to study the uniform approximation problem of the\r\nMonge-Ampere geodesics in infinite dimensional symmetric space by\r\nthose in the finite dimensional Bergman spaces on toric\r\nvarieties. The precise understanding of this problem will give\r\nnew insight into the conjecture proposed by Yau between the\r\nrelation of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics and certain\r\nstability in the sense of geometric invariant theory. The\r\nprincipal investigator will also apply the moment map point of\r\nview and study various geometric flows arising from Kahler\r\ngeometry as well as symplectic geometry proposed by\r\nDonaldson. The first is the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of\r\nfunctional related to the Mabuchi energy. The second is a moment\r\nmap flow in a hyperkahler four manifold. The principal\r\ninvestigator intends to study the question of convergence and\r\nsingularities os such parabolic flows.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of the general relativity, geometric analysis\r\nhas become crucial to both mathematicians and physicists.\r\nProblems in this proposal arise naturally from our attempts to\r\nunderstand nonlinear differential equations from geometry and\r\nphysics. The solutions to these problems will contribute to\r\nvarious fields of sciences such as physics and cosmology in the\r\ndeep understanding of our universe. The method of analyzing the\r\nsingularities of nonlinear equations will have wide applications\r\nin engineering and economics.\r\n",
