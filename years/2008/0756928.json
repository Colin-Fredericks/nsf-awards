 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the goal of attracting and retaining freshmen and sophomores in the STEM majors, the departments of Computer Science, Mathematical Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics and Astronomy at Appalachian State University (ASU) established the Appalachian Undergraduate Academy of Science (Academy). This project recognizes the importance of mentoring, mathematics readiness, early involvement in multidisciplinary research, and problem solving skills and involves implementing strategies proven successful at ASU and other institutions. The Academy is coordinating activities for ASU students, faculty, and staff that include: running a summer bridge program to instruct entering students under-prepared in mathematics; establishing science and math clusters that engage undergraduates in research and collaborative learning; establishing a residential learning community; providing special advising, tutoring, and a supervised study hall for Academy scholars; creating a dedicated mentoring program for community college transfer students; defining a common general education curriculum for Academy scholars in order to provide additional peer-support; and including upper-division students by involving them as peer-mentors.  ASU plans to institutionalize the effective Academy components.",
