 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this exploratory research is to develop a cyber-enabled autonomic threat-management system aimed at transforming today's vulnerable bio-implants into resilient bio-implantable systems-on-chip.  The goal is to realize next-generation bio-implantable systems that are capable of dynamic reconfiguration to react to unexpected threats in the complex and unpredictable human body.  The research explores how to model unexpected threats and how a bio-implant knows that there is a threat.  To this end, the research focuses on threat modeling and injection schemes using statistical and probabilistic approaches and self-adaptive threat detection schemes using biologically-inspired artificial neural network techniques.\r\n\r\nWith respect to intellectual merit, this research aims to reproduce the inherent threat resilience of the central nervous system, which handles unpredictable threats via self-adapting mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed artificial neural network technique is intended to mimic its biological counterpart in the human brain by capturing the brain's highly parallel and self-organizing nature and the brain's ability to recognize complex non-linear relationships among different manifestations of unexpected threats in a dynamical human-implant system.\r\n\r\nWith respect to broader impacts, this research has the potential to facilitate future research and development of reliable bio-implantable technologies for the understanding of biological systems, the diagnosis and treatment of disease, and human augmentation.  Integration of research and education is achieved through training of Ph.D. students, development of new educational material, and online tool dissemination.  This project will use existing university outreach programs to attempt to broaden the participation of females and other students from underrepresented groups and to expose K-12 students to engineering.",
