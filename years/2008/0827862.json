To succeed in this project, the Principal Investigators (PIs) have designed a stepwise research plan focused on fabrication, theoretical and experimental characterization, and demonstration of a proof of concept device. The proposal is focused in four distinct areas; a parametric study of microbubble fabrication and fluidic performance; cancer cell culture and cell density pharmacokinetic response; demonstration of a nitric oxide biosensor integrated in PDMS; and outreach and course development in microfluidics and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\n\r\nA primary outcome of this work will be to provide education and mentoring to graduate, undergraduate and high school students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment spanning aspects of material science, surface chemistry, nanophotonics, microfluidics, and biomedical engineering. The mathematical models developed to simulate fluid flows and gas diffusion through PDMS will lead to new design principles. The concepts of optical sensors, nanotechnology and microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices will be integrated into a new 2 credit bioengineering elective course. Algorithms will be made available on personal websites. Lecture materials will be made available on a Blackboard Learning System. Subject matter resulting from this research will be disseminated to underrepresented students and teachers within the PIs' urban community at the junior and high school levels through lectures and development of educational materials in collaboration with faculty and staff in the University of Rochester Center for Science Education and Outreach and the Life Sciences Learning Center.",
