Over the several\r\nyears that they have been in existence, they have been used for making RF \r\ncomponents in Norway, copier gears in India, and for education in the inner \r\ncity of Boston.  A FabLab network has permitted the individual facilities to\r\nshare ideas and solutions.\r\n\r\nA Fab Lab has been established in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, both as a base \r\nfor research and an experiment in itself in the impact of providing \r\nmodern means for invention rather than remotely-developed solutions to \r\nlocal problems. The initial focus on applications in healthcare is targeting\r\nsome of the most immediate needs, which are currently constrained by the need\r\nfor long supply chains or large local inventories. As solutions are developed\r\nand tested in the Jalalabad fab lab, they will be shared throughout the global\r\nfab lab network. The connection with this network, along with access to \r\nrapid-prototyping capabilities, is also expected to contribute to the regional\r\ndevelopment of educational and economic activity.",
