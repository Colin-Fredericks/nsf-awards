 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThis project investigates the phosphate signal transduction (PHO) pathway in the Ascomycota fungal lineage. Ascomycetes diverged from a common fungal ancestor hundreds of millions of years ago and many aspects of the PHO pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are conserved in the lineage, providing a rare opportunity to perform detailed comparative genomic analyses. The two aims of this project are (1) to define the phosphate starvation response and PHO pathway in Candida glabrata and (2) to define the PHO pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  C. glabrata is a model species closely related to S. cerevisiae and Sz. pombe is a distantly related model organism.   Comparing the S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata PHO pathways allows for an analysis of how a signal transduction pathway alters transcriptional output in closely related species and how these alterations impact niche specificity.  The upstream signaling components and downstream transcriptional output of the PHO pathway will be characterized.  Because Sz. pombe does not share orthologous components with the PHO signaling pathway of S. cerevisiae, but generates a similar output (transcriptional up-regulation of phosphate starvation genes), this research will provide the context for how a divergent organism in a similar niche has evolved a phosphate-starvation response, and adopted a similar gene expression program with a different signaling pathway. Eight mutants aberrant in their expression of the phosphate-regulated gene PHO1 will be characterized and the genes required for the phosphate starvation response will be cloned.  The transcriptional response of these mutants (and wild-type) will be measured with DNA microarrays and rt-qPCR.  These studies are accessible to relatively new scientists such as undergraduate students and Master's level students. These systematic comparative genomic analyses will help to explain the evolutionary steps required to tailor a pathway for growth in different niches.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n       Most of the techniques utilized in this project are accessible to beginning scientists.  Many experiments utilize basic genetic and molecular biology techniques and are self-contained projects designed for undergraduate and Master's level students.  The self-contained projects are ideal for students in that they encourage student ownership of an aspect of the total project. This work will create the resources for numerous undergraduates and Master's students at Villanova University to gain practical experience with the scientific method for a future in biomedical or scientific research. Students will also be strongly encouraged to attend scientific meetings to interact with other scientists. Finally, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minority groups will be actively recruited and encouraged to stay in scientific fields through a positive undergraduate/Masters experience.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nHow do species arise? This is an important question in evolutionary biology. There are millions of species on Earth and they represent only about 1% of the total species that have ever existed.  To survive, a species needs to utilize environmental resources and to produce viable progeny.  The PI studied the mechanism by which a group of fungi called Ascomycetes (which includes the common baker\u00c6s yeast) acquire and assimilate phosphate (called the PHO pathway).  Phosphate is a key nutrient in the environment and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA and phospholipids.  The first question addressed was: how similar is the PHO pathway in two distinct species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata. Using comparative genomics and molecular genetics, the PI demonstrated that the PHO pathway (the pathway that regulates Pho4) is highly conserved, but upon closer inspection the PI observed Pho2 is not required for gene induction.  C. glabrata Pho4 compensates for the loss of PHO2.  The work identified changes in the function of core transcription factors, and indicated that in the ancestor of Ascomycetes the transcription factor Pho2 likely did not play a role in the PHO pathway.\n\nThe second question addressed is: what aspects of natural selection influence the phosphate signal transduction pathway?  Evolution through natural selection suggests that unnecessary genes are lost. The yeast C. glabrata lost the gene encoding a phosphate-starvation inducible acid phosphatase (PHO5) present in many yeast including the brewer\u00c6s yeast, S. cerevisiae. However, C. glabrata still had phosphate starvation inducible phosphatase activity encoded by a cryptic gene.  CgPMU2, which functionally replaces PHO5 in this pathogenic yeast, was identified and characterized.  CgPmu2, unlike ScPho5, is not able to hydrolyze phytic acid.  Phytic acid is present in fruits and seeds where S. cerevisiae grows, but is not abundant in mammalian tissues where C. glabrata grows.  C. glabrata is limited from an environment where phytic acid is the only source of phosphate. The PI hypothesizes that over millions of years, the selection for the ancestral PHO5 was lost, and C. glabrata neo-functionalized a weak phosphatase to replace PHO5.  Convergent evolution of a phosphate-starvation inducible acid phosphatase in C. glabrata relative to most yeast provides an example of how small changes in signal transduction pathways can mediate genetic isolation and uncovers a potential speciation gene.\n\nThe third major question addressed was how conserved is the PHO pathway between organisms that last shared a common ancestor over 300 million years ago.  The PI\u00c6s laboratory screened a fission yeast collection where individual genes were inactivated for phenotypes related to phosphate starvation. Genes were identified that are common to fission yeast and S. cerevisiae and genes that are not common to the two.  This work demonstrated that there is genetic flexibility in the phosphate signal transduction pathway and supports the hypothesis that there is a lot of flexibility in the individual components but that the response can still be the same. Additionally, this work identified a new transcription factor that regulates phosphate starvation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nUnderstanding broadly how a transcriptional program changes in different fungi, will be useful for understanding speciation and understanding how potentially pathogenic fungi alter pathogenicity. This work demonstrates dramatic differences even in closely related fungi, suggesting that there are a myriad of mechanisms to obtain a similar response &ndash; i.e. the transcriptional induction of phosphate starvation genes.  Because C. glabrata is a commensal/pathogen, this work may help to uncover possible anti-fungal targets as the PHO pathway is unique to fungi.  This work is also helping to understand the evolutionary steps required for different species to exploit s..."
