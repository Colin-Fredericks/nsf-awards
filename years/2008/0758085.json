VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, located in Southern Arizona at the Whipple Observatory Base camp, is an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (100 GeV ? 50 TeV) that shower in the earth?s atmosphere. Active galaxies (AGN) harbor a super-massive black hole at their core surrounded by an accretion disk. Little is known about the interaction between the accretion disk and the black hole, an interaction that produces powerful beamed jets of highly-energetic particles and radiation. The spectrum of this radiation is a strong indicator of the acceleration mechanisms involved. Combined VHE, X-ray, and UV spectra can test and help to tune current models of the acceleration processes of active galaxies. The goals of this award are to improve the VERITAS gamma ray detection algorithms and to use the improved algorithms to study the acceleration mechanisms in AGN and pulsars. \r\n\r\nUnder Broader Impacts, undergraduate students will be given broad exposure to the science while working on a focused and tractable research project suitable for a senior thesis. This grant will bring the expertise of two senior personnel to all 165 physics majors and support two student research projects each year. The PI will connect with middle school teachers through the Center for Excellence In Science and Mathematics Education (CESaME) to develop supplements that can be used in 6 and 8th grade curricula where Science and Astronomy are taught.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe VERITAS collaboration has discovered more than 20 new very-high energy (VHE) gamma ray sources from observations with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array, located at the Whipple Observatory in Southern Arizona.  Highlights include the discovery of a connection between star formation and cosmic rays in M82 published in Nature (2010) and the discovery of pulsed VHE emissions from the Crab Nebula published in Science (2011).  This RUI project was one of many projects that contributed to these discoveries. \n\nThe primary goals of this project were to improve VERITAS gamma-ray detection software algorithms and to use improved algorithms to study the acceleration mechanisms of AGN and pulsars while bringing astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly undergraduates.  A variety of activities were undertaken to achieve our goals.  First, two undergraduates and the PI searched for dark matter in the three globular clusters, M5, M13, and M15.  New M15 results were presented at the 32nd International Cosmic Ray Conference (2011) and can be found in the proceedings.  Second, six students spent several weeks of their summer at the VERITAS telescope working on a variety of upgrades and one student developed a new calibration for the telescope spot size.  Shorter observing trips and working meetings with collaborators at UC Santa Cruz were also part of the program.  Cal Poly is an undergraduate institution.  The experience of working side by side in the field with professional physicists is an important part of our student\u00c6s career development.  It is usually the first time these students see physics being done outside the classroom or undergraduate laboratory where their efforts extend knowledge beyond what is already known.  At least three of these students came back from trips with plans to attend graduate school in physics.   Third, the PI developed a fitting algorithm for telescope images that improves the sensitivity of VERITAS.  One of our undergraduates assisted in optimizing the routine.  It was presented at the 5th International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (2012) and can be found in the proceedings.  Fourth, the PI served on the VERITAS Science Board as the representative for the VERITAS Associates.  These activities have been productive scientifically and technically while including a significant level of education and outreach.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jodi L Christiansen"
