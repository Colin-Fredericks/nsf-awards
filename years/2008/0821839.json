Dominguez Hills\r\n\t\tCarson, CA 90747-0001\r\nTitle:  \tMRI/Acq.: Acq. of a High Performance Cluster Grid for Research and Education on Computational Science\r\nProject Proposed:\r\nThis project, acquiring cluster-grid instrumentation to fulfill the need for high-performance, contributes to computer science, biology, chemistry, bioinformatics, homeland security, sociology, psychology, and environmental sciences research and education. The high-performance cluster grid is expected to enable a quantum-leap in the computing capabilities accessible to the investigators. Diverse project directions include: \r\n-\tExtending statistical techniques to situations with interval uncertainties\r\n-\tDiscovering gene interactions and gene-disease associations in online medical literature                               (using clustering, classification, and association mining technology), \r\n-\tAutomating computer network intrusion detection and prevention (integrating firewall and applying data mining technologies in computer network traffic data collected by SNORT), \r\n-\tDeveloping an efficient and interactive online examination and assessment system(using knowledge-based expert system technology), and\r\n-\tDesigning and implementing healthcare and patient information management system.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n This project forms a foundation for new research capabilities at this minority-serving institution, impacting researchers and educators throughout the campus and beyond. It promotes the formation of research teams that may overcome traditional cultural and communication barriers enabling interdisciplinary approaches to technological and scientific challenges. The instrumentation provides students with the skills to cope with a rapidly changing workplace. Students will learn to communicate and interact with researchers of different disciplines, a valuable skill at this time.",
