 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical approaches to quantum computing frequently model the state of a\r\nquantum system as something that changes discretely in time.  However, an\r\nunmeasured quantum system fundamentally evolves continuously in time as\r\ndescribed by Schroedinger's equation.  Even the quantum measurement process\r\ncan be described by a continuous-time stochastic differential equation.\r\nThis research explores quantum computation in its complete continuous-time\r\nformulation, with the goal of uncovering new paradigms for processing\r\nquantum information.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on three key areas: continuous-time quantum computing\r\narchitectures, continuous-time quantum error correction, and continuous-time\r\nquantum algorithms.  These areas were selected because examples highlighting\r\nthe differences between continuous-time and discrete-time quantum computing\r\nformulations are already known in each of them.  For example,\r\ncontinuous-time quantum walk architectures require no external dynamical\r\ncontrols, continuous-time quantum feedback can mediate quantum error\r\ncorrection, and continuous-time quantum scattering can calculate Boolean\r\nformulas with fewer queries than any classical algorithm can.  A major\r\nobjective of this research is to expand upon these directions and develop\r\nnew ones.  The strategy will be to focus on problems that are sufficiently\r\nwell-defined and tractable that progress can be made.\r\n\r\nThis project not only supports graduate student training in quantum\r\ninformation science but also supports education and outreach activities\r\nthrough the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network.\r\nThe PI will seek out exceptional students outside his home institution,\r\nespecially encouraging those in underrepresented groups, and sponsor their\r\nattendance at SQuInT meetings to further enrich this growing field.\r\n",
