 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global climate changes are affecting subarctic and arctic ecosystems and peoples more \r\nsignificantly than anywhere else on the globe. Rural Alaska Natives who subsist in these \r\necosystems naturally have close ties to the land and are deeply involved in science-based \r\nresearch and land management through tribal organizations, governmental, and research- \r\noriented institutions. To date, rural Alaska Natives have had limited access to quality STEM \r\neducation addressing their unique cultural and geographic needs and have, therefore, not been \r\nengaged in helping to find solutions to these complex ecological issues.  We sorely need their \r\ninput in this day of rapid change. The underlying philosophy behind the Interior-Aleutians (IAC) \r\nand Chukchi Campus (CC) Gaalee?ya project is that integrating culture and place into all \r\naspects of their academic STEM experience will support the engagement, capacity, and \r\ncontinuity (Jolly et al. 2004) of rural Alaska Native STEM students.  \r\nThe Gaalee?ya STEM project will build a rigorous and culturally relevant STEM program \r\nthrough the Associate?s level for students in the IAC and CC regions. Gaalee?ya STEM will \r\nincorporate cultural values and perspectives and local interests in ecosystem changes with \r\nscientific coursework, research, and analysis from a Western academic perspective while \r\nallowing students to take courses by distance so that they may remain in their home \r\ncommunities.  Mathematics and science courses, which are delivered primarily via audio- \r\nconference to rural students, will be enhanced through this project with culturally responsive \r\npedagogies, face-to-face learning intensives, academic tutoring, and increased contact with \r\nSTEM faculty. Students will also gain research experience through projects designed around \r\nthe theme of ?ecology of place? to engage, educate, and retain rural Alaska Native students in \r\nSTEM degrees. Elders and STEM faculty will work together to support the students using an \r\nintegrative approach. Program objectives are built around gains in student participation, \r\npersistence, grade point averages and graduations of rural Alaska Native students with a \r\nreplicable model for reaching underserved populations as a primary goal of evaluation.  \r\n",
