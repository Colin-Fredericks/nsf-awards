 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probability models from statistical mechanics are a framework for studying how small-scale randomness produces global-scale phenomena, such as phase transitions, which are essentially nonrandom. Alexander proposes to investigate the following aspects of the subject. (1) Pinning and depinning of lattice polymers and interfaces due to potentials existing in lower-dimensional subspaces of the lattice. Particular emphasis will be placed on the disordered case, in which the potential varies randomly with location. Competition between a potential in a subspace and random potentials in the bulk will also be considered. (2) Layering transitions in the three-dimensional Ising model without an external field, caused solely by the attraction of an interface to a wall in competition with entropic repulsion. (3) Convergence to equilibrium, in systems modeling the phase separation that occurs in the freezing of solutions. (4) Moving interfaces, e.g. between phases of the Ising model, which may \"hang up\" at locations where a weakened interaction reduces the energetic cost of the interface, resulting in an energy barier which must be crossed.(5) Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the two-dimensional Potts model and their relation to decay rates of certain probabilities in the FK model. (6) Potts models in which the external field(s) and the boundary condition are opposed to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research can help provide a theoretical underpinning for applied work in areas such as polymers, adhesion, and superconductivity. The work may lead to predictions which can be tested by experimentalists, leading to new practical discoveries.  Introducing a mathematician's perspective to theoretical problems that have previously been considered principally by physicists may in general alter the physicists' perspective,leading to further advances. US-French scienti\u00dec partnership is enhanced by Alexander's collaboration with Francois Dunlop and Salvador Miracle-Sole.  This work is part of an ongoing effort by mathematicians and physicists to understand various systems in the natural world in which nonrandom global-scale phenomena re\u00feect aspects of small-scale randomness. Examples include (i) magnetic properties of materials; (ii) waves traveling through irregular materials, such as seismic waves through the earth's crust; (iii) impurities in semiconductors;(iv) denaturation of DNA; and (v) percolation of liquid through a porous material, such as water or oil through underground rock. It has long been understood that many qualitative aspects of the relation between small-scall randomness and macroscopic properties,including critical phenomena, do not depend too closely on the particular system being studied. One can therefore gain insight into real-world phenomena by studying abstract systems not intended to model specifically magnets, or porous rock, or any other particular part of the physical world. The systems need only exhibit parallel features, such as clustering and critical phenomena. Some of the systems which Alexander will investigate-percolation, Ising and Potts models, and other spin systems-are examples of such abstract systems. Other systems which Alexander will investigate are somewhat more closely based on specific physical systems, such as polymers, DNA molecules, and solutions.",

The systems need only exhibit parallel features, particularly certain critical phenomena. Some of the systems which have been investigated in the project, such as directed polymers, are examples of such abstract systems. \n\nFor the directed polymer, a potential which attracts the polymer to a special site will pin the polymer to that site if the potential is above a certain critical value.  At this critical value, there is a depinning transition as the polymer lets go of the special site.  One can compare a homogeneous polymer in this context to one which incorporates quenched randomness, in the sense that different monomers are attracted or repelled from the site with different strengths.  In some cases, the quenched randomness alters the nature of the phase transition and the value of the critical point, relative to the homogeneous system; in other cases it does not.  In the project, it was proved that in the two-dimensional case, in contrast to what is otherwise typical, the value of the critical point is unchanged by quenched randomness no matter how large its magnitude.  Additionally, a bound was established for the amount of contact between the polymer and the special site when it is not pinned.  For a related model in which potentials exist at all sites, the size of random fluctuations in the free energy resulting from the quenched randomness was analyzed.  \n\nPhysicists study wetting phenomena, in which a film of a substance forms along a wall, separating another substance from that wall.  A mathematical parallel exists in the Ising model, in which a value of +1 or -1 is associated to each site in the integer lattice (a grid), and in the closely related SOS model.  For the SOS model, in the project it was proved that this wetting can occur one layer at a time, in the sense that there are equilibria in which the interface between the film and the bulk substance (or actually, the mathematical analogs of these) is at an arbitrary fixed height.  Analogous results, only partially rigorous, were established for the Ising model.\n\nFor standard symmetric simple random walk, steps of +1 and -1 are equally likely at any time.  For Bessel-like random walks, there is instead always a slight drift away from 0, decreasing with distance from 0.  (Sometimes the drift is toward 0, depending on a parameter.)  These walks give a more varied group in which to study properties of the corresponding directed polymers, among other things.  As part of the project, theorems were proved describing the distribution of the times between visits to 0 for Bessel-like random walks.\n\nRegarding broader impacts, in the context of training and human resources for science and mathematics, one Ph.D. student wrote his dissertation in connection with the project.
