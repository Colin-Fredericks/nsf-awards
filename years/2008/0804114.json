Concepts such as\r\nstochasticity arise out of the evolution of the combined system, as demonstrated by measured results of control and by experimental observation of decoherence and its reduction by active optical control. The research is at the frontier of applied quantum physics. It involves collaborators in the physics of semiconductor nanostructures, in high-precision coherent optical control and spectroscopy of quantum dots, and in many-body theory and light-matter interaction.\r\n",
