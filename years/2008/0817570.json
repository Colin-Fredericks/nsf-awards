 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nThrough this project, students are developing short video demonstrations of principles and topics in geotechnical engineering. The modules are being developed for individuals with different learning styles and are taking into account issues in universal access for students with disabilities. The video clips are available through student-friendly technologies such as podcasts or video MP3 players. The students are adopting their traditional learning styles to unconventional learning modes with extensive and expert use of electronic technologies, design and development of experiments, and awareness of universal design. Through their work in developing the videos clips, students are deepening their understanding of technical concepts, improving their ability to communicate and work on teams, and broadening their understanding of issues surrounding universal access for individuals with disabilities. The flexible design employed in this project facilitates adaptation to other subjects, other universities, and other student populations. Best practices guidelines for using this teaching methodology are being developed and widely disseminated.",
