 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an innovative device fabrication process and bulk hetero-junction structure to fabricate CdTe solar cells with unprecedented performance. Today's crystalline silicon based solar cell technologies are not cost effective as a viable alternative to existing energy sources. CdTe based solar cells have shown very promising as a low cost alternative to current crystalline silicon solar cells. However, the energy conversion efficiency of commercial CdTe solar cells is only ~ 10%. With this innovative approach it is intended to improve energy conversion efficiency up to the limit efficiency of ~29% for CdTe based solar cells, representing a real breakthrough in thin film solar cells and leading to tremendously wide applications.\r\n\r\nWorld solar photovoltaic (PV) market installations reached a record high of 1,744 megawatts (MW) in 2006, representing growth of 19% over the previous year. World solar cell production reached a consolidated figure of 2,204 MW in 2006, up from 1,656 MW a year earlier. Global industry revenues were $10.6bn in 2006. According to a new report from Solarbuzz, LLC, annual worldwide industry revenues will reach between $18.6bn and $31.5bn by 2011. Currently, the solar cell market is dominated by crystalline silicon solar cells with a market share of ~93%. If successful the proposed approach can improve the energy efficiency of CdTe based solar cells to the next level, which enables them to compete with (even outperform) current crystalline silicon solar cells. With improved efficiency and low cost, CdTe solar cells will get a significant share of the solar market. There is an extensive range of applications where solar cells are already viewed as the best option for electricity supply such as ocean navigation aids, telecommunication systems, remote monitoring and control, rural electrification, space power and domestic power supply. The proposed green technology harvests solar energy, reducing the emission of CO2 and global warming. This program also provides a route to enhance scientific and technological understanding of crystal growth process at the nano-scale.",
