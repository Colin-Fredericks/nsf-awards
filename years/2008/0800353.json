 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the current micro-manufacturing platform for microforming processes by the ultrasonic-assisted microforming at unprecedented operation speed. To overcome the limitations of existing technology, actuators based on magnetostrictive Terfenol-D, capable of ultrasonic vibration as well as high-speed macro deformations will be used.  The objectives of the project are to (1) design and construct a novel Terfenol-D actuator to achieve the required performance of microforming applications; (2) develop a suite of advanced model-based feedforward-feedback control techniques to overcome the nonlinear hysteresis and dynamics effects of Terfenol-D on high-speed, precision motion control; and (3) investigate the fundamental aspects of microforming by studying how the tool life and part quality are improved by the introduction of ultrasonic vibration and high speed operation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research represents one of the first attempts in utilizing Terfenol-D actuators in the next-generation micro-machine tool system (mMTS).  This will lead to increased tool life, improved part quality, and reduced footprint addressing several critical challenges in micro-manufacturing including maintenance cost, energy consumption, and throughput limitations.  The novel application of the dual stage magnetostrictive actuator along with the advanced control techniques will enable the systematic study of the fundamental effects of high frequency vibration on microforming processes making significant contributions to moving microforming techniques towards industry applications.  Educational activities will include course module development for graduate and undergraduate classes, summer internship opportunities for undergraduates and high school teachers, open lab tours with hands on activities, and middle school inquire module.  The goal of these activities is to expose undergraduate, graduate, and high school students and teachers to cutting edge research in the areas of micro-manufacturing, active materials, and advanced controls.",
