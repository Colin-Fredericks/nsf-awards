Designed as a retrospective cohort study, we use 12,000 college calculus students' histories to predict performance while controlling for demographic differences. This study has the capability to both reveal the most promising educational practices in mathematics, including technological innovations, and to assess the degree of match between high school math and college calculus courses, both traditional and reform based.",
