The approach is: (1) further demonstrate state-of-the-art photonic crystal cavities with ultrahigh-Q/V ratios, (2) examine nonlinear nanophotonics based on these strongly localized optical cavities with long photon lifetimes, and (3) examine the coherent atom-field interactions available with our nanocavity-quantum dot system. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent successes in device nanofabrication enable the control of light-matter interactions from first principles. The PI will examine the localization of light in wavelength-scale optical nanocavities with long photon lifetimes, limited only by intrinsic material absorption. Coupled cavities will be examined, enabled by a proposed digital tuning approach for matching chip-scale resonance and transitions with nanoscale emitters. Second, the PI will examine ultralow threshold nonlinearities in these nanocavities for frequency conversion and optical logic elements. Third, the PI examines an approach towards quantum dot ? nanocavity interactions in the silicon CMOS infrastructure and in the near-infrared, with coupled coherent interactions.\r\nBroader Impact: These studies on nonlinear and nonclassical optics afforded by the ultrahigh-Q/V optical cavities present an approach to examine and fundamentally control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, as well as a confluence of solid-state physics and optical nanosciences. The interdisciplinary science and engineering training and education will also involve working with minority, women and high-school students in under-represented communities. The PI participates in a technology outreach program, and will further improve the graduate and undergraduate curriculum. \r\n",
