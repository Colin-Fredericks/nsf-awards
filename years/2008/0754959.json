 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a new Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on sensor networks and data security at the University of Missouri - Rolla. The research is in areas of national need and importance and of interest to undergraduates.  The project plans to recruit students from under-represented groups through partnership with a diverse set of academic institutions. Undergraduate students participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution.  The project includes mentorship by faculty and graduate students, collaborative and individual research experiences, seminar and guest speakers, training in ethics, and other professional development opportunities for the participating students.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the project team. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications that could result in advances to the current research in these important areas.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups. The relationships developed during the project could lead to future collaborations among the institutions of the participating students that may enable the students to continue their research and professional growth after the summer experience.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.",
