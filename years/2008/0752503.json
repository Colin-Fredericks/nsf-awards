 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to perform Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling of solar wind turbulence on scales of the ion Larmor radius, where a fluid description is less applicable and plasma kinetic effects are important. This modeling is necessary for investigating how energy in turbulent fluctuations is converted into heat. These kinetic simulations of MHD turbulence will provide quantitative predictions of how turbulence induces fluctuations in a variety of heliophysical quantities, including the magnetic field, the electric field, the plasma density, and the particle distribution function. The PI intends to compare his simulation output with in situ measurements in the solar wind. He will also study the heating of solar wind plasma through small-scale fluctuations in an MHD turbulent cascade, and will quantify the extent to which his modeled plasma heating is consistent with observations of the solar wind. This project will significantly advance the understanding of the complex connection between the turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind and the heating and acceleration of solar wind plasma by such turbulence.\r\n\r\nGraduate student and postdoctoral training will be an important part of this project. The PI will also provide public talks on a regular basis that will incorporate the results of this research and convey the scientific process to a broader audience.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTurbulence involving magnetic fields and gas is a key process\nencountered in a wide variety of space and astrophysical plasmas.  In\nthe solar corona and solar wind, motions near the surface of the sun\nare believed to excite a wide variety of waves that can transport\nenergy over significant distances.  Turbulence is one of the most\npromising mechanisms for converting the energy initially stored in\nsuch waves into thermal energy of the plasma, heating and accelerating\nthe solar wind.  Fundamentally, then, this turbulent heating is\nresponsible for producing the solar wind in the first place.\n\nIn the course of our work, we developed a detailed understanding of\nturbulence in magnetized plasmas, focusing on the small scales where\nthe turbulent energy is converted into heat.  We carried out the most\ncomprehensive calculations to date predicting turbulent fluctuations\nconsistent with direct measurements on small scales in the solar wind.\nThe image \"Predicted Fluctuations in the Solar Wind\" associated with\nthis report shows these predicted electric (green) and magnetic\n(black, red) turbulent fluctuations.\n\nA long-standing problem in understanding observations of the solar\nwind and solar corona has been reconciling the properties of the\nturbulence with the measured temperatures of protons, electrons, and\nother ions like Oxygen.  The temperature measurements seem to require\nturbulence with properties very different than that observed. We\nsharpened this tension using state-of-the-art turbulence calculations\nand then provided one of the most promising resolutions of this\ndiscrepancy by developing new models for how the turbulent energy is\nconverted into heat.  We incorporated these heating models into\ncalculations of the full structure of the solar wind, from the sun to\nbeyond the Earth, that are in good agreement with measurements.  This\nprovides a \"first principles\" model that directly connects the\nsmall-scale physics of heating with the large-scale properties\n(velocity, density) of the solar wind.\n\nFinally, we studied how additional measurements in the solar wind --\ne.g., of the density fluctuations and the handedness of the turbulence\n-- can be used to constrain the key processes producing the heating\nand acceleration of the solar wind.\n\nBroader Impact:\n\nIn the course of our work, we pioneered the application of techniques\ndeveloped in the fusion community to the study of solar system and\nastrophysical plasmas.  The NSF funding was primarily used to support\nyoung researchers early in their career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eliot Quataert"
