 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site in Cell Biology and Neuroscience at Montana State University (MSU) is a 10-week summer research program for students with an interest in biological science but little or no research experience. Students will learn the joys and challenges of scientific research by working on projects in cell development, cell biology or neurobiology. The program consists of an initial 2 week hands-on lab session that will teach participants important biological research techniques. For the remaining 8 weeks, students will use these newly learned skills by working in the lab of a faculty member on a research project. Students will also participate in workshops on scientific ethics and careers, and will have the opportunity to make a poster presentation of their work and present their research at campus summer student symposium at the end of the program. Minority, first-generation college students and students who attended high schools in rural areas are especially encouraged to apply. MSU is located in Bozeman, MT, about 80 miles north of Yellowstone National Park. Over 200 students participate in various undergraduate research programs on the MSU campus each summer, making MSU an invigorating environment for both recreation and intellectual growth. More information is available at http://www.montana.edu/cbn/REU.html or by contacting Dr. Anneke Metz, (406) 994-7519 or at anneke@montana.edu.",
