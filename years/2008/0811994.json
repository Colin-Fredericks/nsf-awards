 "awd_abstract_narration": "Link analysis algorithms leverage hyperlinks created by authors as  \r\nsemantic endorsements between pages, while social bookmarks provide a  \r\nway to leverage annotations by information consumers as a source of  \r\ninformation about pages. This project explores a novel approach that  \r\nis a synergy of the two: soliciting annotations from users about the  \r\ncontent of pages, in a way that implicitly forms networks of  \r\nrelationships between and among resources and tags. These socially  \r\ngenerated relationships are then aggregated to build bottom-up,  \r\nglobal semantic similarity networks. Algorithms are developed to  \r\nconstruct, analyze, and mine these networks in support of search and  \r\nrecommendation applications, exploratory navigation interfaces,  \r\nresource management utilities, tag spam detection, and incentive  \r\ngames to accelerate the achievement of critical mass.\r\n\r\nTo extrapolate both annotations about content (tags) and semantic  \r\nrelationships (similarity) from single users to the ``wisdom of the  \r\ncrowd,'' the project investigates an information-theoretic model that  \r\nextracts semantic assessments from information structures that many  \r\nusers are already maintaining, namely the bookmarks and tags they  \r\nmanage on their browsers or online. This entails the design and  \r\nevaluation of several network-based measures and algorithms, such as  \r\nsimilarity, novelty, centrality, and focus. Among the aims of this  \r\nmodel are the exploration of the duality between resources (URLs) and  \r\nconcepts (tags or categories) and the integration of social  \r\nannotation and collaborative filtering. One way to provide users with  \r\nimmediate value is to integrate client-based taxonomies and server- \r\nbased folksonomies for social bookmark management. Both traditional  \r\nusers of browser bookmarks and social users of online bookmarks can  \r\ntake advantage of the same semantic maps while retaining the  \r\nconvenience of intuitive browser interfaces and centralized storage.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the project can  \r\nbe found at http://GiveALink.org.\r\n",
