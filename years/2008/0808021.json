 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pathways to Earth Science Education (PESE) program is a partnership between York College (part of the CUNY system) and the Bronx Community College that seeks to enrich and support Earth and environmental science education and provide college and high school students with educational pathways to STEM degree programs. The main goals and objectives of this program are to: a) increase the number of students - most of whom are underrepresented minorities - studying Earth science at the high school and the college levels; b) create educational pathways for high school and community college students to Earth and environmental science baccalaureate programs; and c) support, improve and enrich college and high school Earth science instruction in the partnering institutions and the communities they serve.  PESE program activities include: a) summer institutes for college and high school faculty and students; b) Earth and environmental science program articulation agreements between the Bronx Community College and York College; c) design and development of two new courses in geospatial methods and hydrology; c) review and identification of the learning objectives for the first and second year Earth and environmental science course; d) recruitment and mentoring of student research assistants; e) student and faculty outreach; f) professional development activities for existing and new faculty; and g) faculty and student enrichment workshops and seminars.  The PESE project is expected to lead to increased enrollment and improved retention rates for minority students in Earth science and related science courses and programs, as well as enhanced awareness of the important contributions of this scientific field to society.  The program also addresses the growing need for well-prepared Earth science teachers in the New York metropolitan area high schools, a need which is especially acute for inner city high schools.",
