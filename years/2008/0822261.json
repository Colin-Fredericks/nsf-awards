 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of engineering can advance the problem solving and critical thinking ability of all students and prepare them for the technological workplace.  Early exposure to engineering principles may increase all students' interest in STEM fields, while embedding problems in social issues may aid in the recruiting of underrepresented groups to the STEM enterprise.  The INSPIRES program implements these ideas and tests their impact on learning and teaching.  The face-to-face workshops used in the INSPIRES program at Purdue are extended through cyber-infrastructure with the use of video-based mentoring in real time and an asynchronous learning experience.   A video and audio network links elementary school teachers with researchers and educators at Purdue to form a community of practice dedicated to implementing engineering education at the elementary grades.  A learning progression, based on the Engineering is Elementary and model-eliciting mathematics materials, is developed for elementary school teachers to increase their ability to adapt and refine engineering learning materials in their classrooms.  Existing assessment instruments will be revised and new ones developed, as necessary, to measure the impact of the professional development that includes engineering on teacher, student, administrator and parent knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about engineering and engineering education.  The research plan identifies the changes in teacher and student knowledge, the abilities and behaviors resulting from the introduction of engineering, and the attributes of face-to-face and cyber-enabled teacher professional development and community building that can transform teachers into master users and designers of engineering education for elementary learners.  The study involves about 120 teachers in three cohort groups.",

Early findings of doing so show engineering could advance all students\u00c6 critical thinking and problem-solving abilities and prepare them for an increasingly technical workplace. The early exposure to engineering principles may interest students in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, while a vision of engineering as being socially relevant may aid in recruiting underrepresented groups to STEM fields. However, a lack of teacher training with elementary engineering content and elementary students\u00c6 ability to learn engineering are seen as hurdles to implementation. Through this five-year research project, the research team sought to investigate the impact of teacher training with elementary engineering on teacher practice, student learning, and the greater school community, including administration and parents.  \nWorking with a very large school district in south central United States, the research team provided professional development for teachers in grades two to four through a summer academy and ongoing support. During the academic year, with research team support, teachers introduced their students to the definitions of engineering and technology, the work of engineers, and the engineering design process. Then teachers engaged their students in an Engineering is Elementary (http://www.eie.org) design activity linked to science content already being taught. Teachers returned the following summer for an additional three days of professional development with engineering and then went back to their classrooms to teach engineering for a second year.  Four cohorts of teachers (more than 160 total) participated anywhere from one to five years. Their students (over 3000), many from underserved populations, were impacted during their involvement, which ranged from one to three years.\nResearch findings related to students show that even with limited engineering instruction per year (less than 13 hours) there can be positive changes in students\u00c6 understanding of the work of an engineer and engineering design, technology, and science concepts as well as the notion that engineers create and design technologies. They can identify steps in the engineering design process.  These changes can affect boys and girls in equal measure, and exposure to engineering in second grade can prepare students for greater learning of engineering in future years.\nResearch findings related to teachers suggest that teachers\u00c6 impact on student learning of engineering improves with experience and continued professional development with engineering.  Teachers in their first year of teaching with engineering focus on the logistics of bringing engineering lessons and new teaching strategies into their classrooms.  In the second year, they focus more on integrating engineering with other subject matter (e.g. reading, math, science), enabling a richer educational experience for their students.  Teachers saw improved student performance, such as learning to participate in a team, solving problems with more than one answer, and recovering from failed design attempts.  Teachers also report that students are enthusiastic about the hands-on engineering lessons. Research findings also suggest administrative support is necessary for successful and continued use of new teaching strategies.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Heidi A Diefes-Dux"
