 "awd_abstract_narration": "[HRD 0811561]  Lawson State Community College?s HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project supports the addition of advanced robotics technology to the College?s programs in electrical/electronics engineering and industrial electronics/systems. The Advanced Robotics Center (ARC) creates a new concentration for these programs of study. It also provides real-time learning for a broad spectrum of underrepresented students interested in technology and engineering careers. \r\n\r\nAlabama manufacturers are seeking a diverse workforce with the skills required to configure, upgrade, utilize, and maintain the hundreds of robotic arms on their production lines. These jobs require technicians and engineers who have hands-on experience with industry standard robots. Lawson State Community College is uniquely qualified to recruit and educate a diverse workforce due to its historical mission and because it is located in the Birmingham metropolitan area. Students in the program can easily move to the workforce with an associate degree, or continue at a four-year institution to earn a baccalaureate degree. The College is purchasing two robots with training systems, and five specialized robotic simulation software cells to initiate establishing the Advanced Robotics Center.\r\n",
