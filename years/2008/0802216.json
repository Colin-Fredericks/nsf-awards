 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of this research is to extend a recently developed Quasiparticle self-consistent GW\r\nmethod (QSGW) to study quantum transport in molecular and nanoscale devices. Because QSGW\r\nis very accurate, it is uniquely situated as a framework around which a reliable ab initio theory\r\ncan be constructed. The full QSGW theory, however, is too expensive to be a practical engine\r\nfor device design?at least as originally implemented. The major focus of this work will threefold\r\nfirst, to redesign a real-space version of QSGW theory, that should execute far more efficiently\r\nthan the standard implementation with essentially the same reliability; second to design physically\r\nsound approximations to QSGW that are suitable for larger-scale applications, such as transport\r\ngraphene, and new metal/insulator/metal spintronic designs.\r\nIntellectual Merit: It is a significant accomplishment to develop an accurate, universal method\r\nwhich can predict many properties for a wide variety of systems in a unified way. This proposal\r\nextends QSGW in two directions: to calculate quantities of importance to quantum transport,\r\ne.g. phonons, the electron-phonon interaction, Auger recombination, and to find simplifications to\r\nenable practical study of many interesting materials problems.\r\nBroader Impact: This work can significantly extend both the type of materials properties, the\r\nprecision to which they can be calculated, and the complexity of the materials systems accessible. It\r\nlays the groundwork to enable realistic prediction of the performance of several future generations\r\nof electron devices.\r\n1",
