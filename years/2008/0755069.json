The program will support eight students during a ten week summer research program for three years. The program will include independent research projects by the students, participation in a semi-weekly summer lecture series on topics including scientific writing, science careers, ethics and data visualization. It will conclude with a written report and student poster presentations. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.",
