The end-product components consist of an ultra-low-power security chip protected against attacks, by means of a unique compilation-driven instruction set obfuscation technology, built-in cryptographic acceleration support, and secure storage, a mobile security firmware supporting the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) specification of the Trusted Computing Group industry consortium and a unique mobile application protection technology with secure software plug-ins, and associated development tools to facilitate the use of our technology, including a security-focused compiler. By focusing on ultra-low-power approaches, this solution can be used by battery-powered applications and will not greatly reduce the time between recharges.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this activity is that it addresses key technical obstacles that are a barrier to expanding the use of mobile phones in financial transactions and enterprise applications. Currently, mobile phones do not have the amount of built-in security that would lead to the widespread use on them of electronic wallets, for example, or to allowing users to securely execute mobile enterprise applications. \r\n",
