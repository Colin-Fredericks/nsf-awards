 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned research is concerned with deciding how to infer what new physics exists at the TeV scale from various planned experiments at LHC and B-Factories.  The PI believes that  to decide between different New Physics scenarios we have to study their impact on the weak transitions of heavy flavour states (B, K, D hadrons and top quarks). His program involves three components: (i) To determine ever more accurately the values of the basic input parameters that control the Standard Model predictions, like the CKM parameters; (ii) to refine the algorithm used for calculating transition amplitudes; (iii) to study the high p! - low p! connection and prepare the ground for 'reverse theoretical engineering'; i.e., to infer the nature of the New Physics fields that generate forces affecting heavy flavour decays.  The PI intends to also analyze possible manifestations of CP violation in leptodynamics, mainly in ! decays and electric dipole moments of electrons and undertake to classifiy New Physics scenarios that can generate observable effects there. This is driven by a dual motivation, namely to search for unorthodox variants of New Physics and to try to understand baryogenesis as being due to a primary leptogenesis. This analysis will be aided by new experiments at flavor factories and in 'tabletop' experiments searching for T odd effects in atoms, molecules and nuclei. The PI also intends to study the impact of the existence of extra dimensions on heavy flavour decays. Broader Impact: As in the past the PI's research will provide guidance to many experimental studies and support the feedback from experiment to theory. It and its presentation in lectures at schools etc. will provide training to a sizable number of graduatestudents. The book he is revising on 'CP Violation' and his review articles should educate non-specialists about some of the fascinating developments in HEP.",
