This program includes an ethics component which is funded through the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES).  The program will be directed and managed by Ryan Casey of the Department of Chemistry at Towson University.  This site will provide seven undergraduate students with research experience for 10-weeks in the cross-disciplinary area of urban environmental biogeochemistry. All seven students will be supported with NSF funds.  Targeted students will be raising juniors and seniors who are majoring in Chemistry, Biology, Geology, Environmental Science or other related areas.  The primary focus of the program will be the development of the participants' research skills.  Students will also be required to participate in activities designed to build the skill sets needed to discuss, present, and write up the results of their projects.",
