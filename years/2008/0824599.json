 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why tropical mountains harbor so many more species than other mountainous areas of the world has puzzled biologists for more than two centuries. A long-held, but poorly studied idea is that greater elevational climatic stratification in the tropics leads to natural selection for organisms with narrower climatic tolerances in tropical than temperate mountains.  As a result, it is hypothesized that organisms might encounter more climatic barriers to dispersal along tropical elevational gradients.  Dispersal limitation and isolation of populations are key steps in the process by which a single species splits into two species.  Consequently, more opportunities for new species to originate might exist in tropical mountains, thereby promoting their high species richness.  The work proposed here will compare the population genetic structure and physiology of tropical and temperate salamanders and will test two key questions regarding the evolution of high biodiversity in tropical mountains: (i) Does lower dispersal occur between elevationally separated populations in the tropics compared to the temperate zone? and (ii) Is there a relationship between the degree of physiological specialization for different climatic conditions and the rate at which dispersal occurs between populations?\r\n\r\n\tUnderstanding why species diversity is distributed unevenly across the earth is critical for preserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change.  The proposed research will be valuable for understanding how organisms and evolutionary processes in some of the world?s most species-rich ecosystems might be impacted by global climate change.  The principal investigator will also work with the University of Minnesota?s Bell Museum of Natural History to educate non-specialists on the biological impacts of climate change on delicate montane faunas.\r\n",
