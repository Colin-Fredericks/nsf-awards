Wessels, Northwestern University\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Photonic crystals (PC) have been proposed for a number of optical devices for high bit rate fiber-optic communication and information processing systems. These include tunable optical switches and ultra-wide bandwidth modulators. Non-linear photonic crystal waveguide structures are proposed for improving the bandwidth of these devices. Ferroelectric oxides will be used due to their large optical non-linearities and photo and thermal stability. With the recent development of low-loss, epitaxial ferroelectric thin film waveguides and low V electro-optic modulators, a number of high bandwidth devices suitable for optical signal processing are possible. This work builds on our recent demonstration of thin film ferroelectric BaTiO3 with electro-optic coefficients of 360-440 pm/V. Non-linear photonic crystal waveguide devices will be fabricated for ultra-wideband frequency operation (>100 GHz). Devices will be fabricated from the non-linear oxide waveguides including 1-D and 2-D photonic crystal eo modulators and optical switches. Devices will be fabricated using vapor phase epitaxial deposition, and both conventional photolithography and nanolithography. Factors limiting bandwidth will be determined through modeling and testing. Their transmission, operating parameters and bandwidth will be measured. Chip-scale integration of several devices with a single platform will be pursued using thin film ferroelectric technology.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: By using non-linear photonic crystals with large optical non-linearities, significant improvements in bandwidth, operating voltage, and size are expected compared to conventional devices. The program will involve training of undergraduates, and graduate students as well as mentoring K-12 students. Industrial outreach through related STTR programs and industrial and government lab internships will be pursued.",
