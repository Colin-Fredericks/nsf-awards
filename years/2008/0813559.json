 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hybrid Particle Methods (HPM) are developed for the simulation of high velocity dynamic events that include fracture and fragmentation. The intellectual merit of the work includes: (a) meshelss formulation with particle distributions where individual particles have variable neighbors, (b) convenient addition and rearrangement of particles facilitating adaptivity to allow modeling severe deformations, (c) increased accuracy of the MLS interpolations that form the bases of meshless methods, (d) propagation of cracks using geometry-based criteria, and (e) parallel implementation to allow the simulation of realistic problems.\r\n\r\nThe developments extend readily to other disciplines beyond solid mechanics and provide a renewed impetus to the development of meshless methods. The project involves undergraduate students in cutting-edge research, has collaborations with Naval Surface Warfare Center, and provides opportunities for the integration of research and education. The research has extensive applications ranging from military to manufacturing to civilian.\r\n",
