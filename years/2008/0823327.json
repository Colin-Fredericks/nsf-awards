 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Multiresolution Mechanics of Solids and Structures\r\n\t\r\nIn the not too distant future, an integrated multiscale analysis system is desirable for the design of a reliable engineering structure to sustain harsh environmental conditions within a predetermined lifetime. A multiresolution mechanics theory that may overcome the limitations of conventional approaches will be developed for design of higher strength, toughness, extended fatigue life and lower weight materials. The key features of the proposed framework are two-fold: macroscale properties and performance could be predicted directly in terms of the key microstructure design parameters; and a mathematical link between microstructure materials design and product design and manufacture will be provided. \r\n\t\r\nSocietal Benefits: In materials engineering, rather than randomly discovering materials and exploiting their properties, a comprehensive understanding of microstructure-property relationship is desirable. The proposed multiresolution theory could advance a range of advanced composite materials, including multilayer materials and nanofiber-matrix composites. By designing material microstructure intelligently, new materials such as super-lightweight, ultra-strength, low-wear materials for energy related, industrial, and medical applications alike could be designed and optimized. Wonderful opportunities of educating graduate and undergraduate students and the public about materials design and manufacturing could be created.  It is hoped that the undergraduate students would be interested in research and they are encouraged to continue for postgraduate studies. In addition, it is expected that this emerging methodology will be effectively transfer to industry and government laboratories. \r\n",
