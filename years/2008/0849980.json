 "awd_abstract_narration": "Live Updates of Scientifc Workflows\r\n \r\nABSTRACT\r\nComputer systems are being applied to increasingly demanding cross disciplinary applications. The environments in which they function and the resources they manage \r\nare gradually more diverse, distributed and dynamic. This is particularly observed for \r\nbiomedical applications where the need for flexible, dynamic, data intensive computing\r\nfunctionalities are substancially critical. This revolution of modern medicine requires \r\nnovel and efficient approaches to support resource integration and scientific workflows\r\n(SWF) that capture, analyze, retrieve, integrate, and produce molecular  information \r\nincluding biological specimens derived from tissue, cells, or blood combined with\r\nmedical records or clinical trial data. Such workflows are increasingly used in e-science\r\ndiscovery and are characterized by frequent changes that are part of the scientific \r\ndiscovery process. The research develops a uniform approach to support live updates of \r\nscientific workflows accessing distributed resources. The goal of live updates is to allow \r\ncontinuous execution in the presence of changes. The research supports updates of \r\nboth the structure and nature of SWFs processes and the data they access and create\r\n(produce and consume). The research divides the live update problem for SWFs into four\r\nmain technical aims: software update, persistent storage update, workflow update, and \r\nevaluation and testing. It develops the mechanisms for updates as well as automatic \r\nchecks for the safety of a planned update. The research impacts information-based\r\ndrug discovery and development, and healthcare decision support systems.\r\n\r\n",

Unlike the software update that many are familiar with and typically requires restarting the software application or even the device for the update to take effect, dynamic software update updates a software application while it is running. Our study was not confined to traditional software application, but also looked at updates of scientific workflows. A scientific workflow typically consists of many software components that can be developed by different developers and that are put together in a workflow to achieve a scientific analysis. The execution of scientific workflows is time consuming and there is a need to support experimentation with scientific workflows in which modified versions of the same workflow are executed in order to find the best way to analyze scientific data.\n\nAn important goal of the work was to expose students in computer science to work with scientists from the general biotechnology field through internships at the Translational Genomics Institute.\n\nOutcomes\n\nWe have been successful in achieving many of the project goals.\n\nPublications. Ten publications in conferences and workshops resulted from this project with some additional publications in preparation.\n\nDevelopment of a general mechanism for dynamic software update. We have developed a general approach and software tool for updating programs while they are executing. We call the tool UpStare. It is a general dynamic software update tool and it is available together with a user manual for upload and use by other researchers.\nIdentification of the inherent overhead introduced by dynamic software update. We have shown that any general dynamic software update tool that does not place limitation on when an update can occur must introduce overhead to the execution of a program even when the program is not being updated. We have proposed, but not implemented, a mechanism whose overhead would be the lowest possible.\nImprovement of the Structural Prediction for pRotein fOlding UTility System (SPROUTS). SPROUTS was supported by a previous NSF grant and is available to scientists to compare and integrate various analyses for protein folding. SPROUTS was made much more useable and significant improvements were made to the ability to compare multiple analyses as part of effort under this project. As the results of the improvements, SPROUTS' collection grew to 900 entries for various proteins.\nInvolvement of undergraduate students in research. Five undergrdauate students worked on research related to the project. The work lead to one student being a co-author on a workshop paper.

One computer science student spent part of a summer in France working with French scientists.\nIdentification of conditions under which a dynamic software update can be applied safely.  Typical updates that are made to computer software are made with the assumption that the update will not be applied dynamically and such updates might not work as expected if they are applied dynamically. We have identified conditions under which an update can be safely applied dynamically. \nDevelopment of an approach for efficient execution of multiple versions of a scientific workflow. We have formally defined the data reuse problem in which data produced by one version of a workflow can be reused to s..."
