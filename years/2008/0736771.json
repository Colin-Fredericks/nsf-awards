 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This collaborative project supports the pedagogical needs of students and instructors in programming and software engineering courses by providing access to a comprehensive and up-to-date Web-based Repository of Software Testing Tools (WReSTT). The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) increase the number of users at participating academic institutions that currently have access to vetted software testing tools in a single repository; (2) provide a forum where computer science and information technology instructors can improve their knowledge of software testing and software testing tools to support pedagogy; and (3) improve student knowledge of testing tools. Students required to use the tools provided by WReSTT for class assignments are able to (a) improve their conceptual understanding of the approaches used to test software, and (b) improve their practical software testing skills with respect to the testing tools in WReSTT. Instructors incorporate these testing tools into the curriculum of the CS1, CS2 and CS3 courses.",
