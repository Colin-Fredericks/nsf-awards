 "awd_abstract_narration": "The READ: Recognizing Excellence And Diversity in Engineering Scholarships program builds upon the previous CSEMS programs at UC Berkeley.  READ follows a cohort of freshman and continuing students for four years, awards thirty-five renewable scholarships, and targets underrepresented engineering students. Scholars are recruited from the academic programs offered by the UC Berkeley Coalition for Excellence and Diversity in Mathematics, Science and Engineering. READ incorporates demonstrated successful practices with ongoing measures of academic achievement. The Coalition Directors, program counselors, teaching staff, tutors, graduate students and READ Faculty Mentors provide a rich tapestry of support and advising. Scholars participate in retention activities tied to the existing student support infrastructure of The Minority Engineering Program (MEP), the Coalition, and other partner activities. Programs include academic workshops, tutoring, advising, industry internships and undergraduate research. Student academic communities are sustained and strengthened by continuing students, who frequently recruit, mentor, tutor and lead study groups.",
