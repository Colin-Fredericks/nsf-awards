 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial and government entities now spend around $10 billion per\r\nyear on software and hardware systems for managing \"data warehouses\",\r\nwhich are very large electronic data archives. Despite the size and\r\nimportance of this marketplace, existing data management solutions can\r\nbe painfully slow (see, for example, www.tpc.org/tpch/ for recent\r\nbenchmarking results). It is now possible to spend millions of dollars\r\nof hardware and software for a system that still takes hours to answer\r\nsimple analytic questions. This is unfortunate, because there is much\r\nknowledge to be gained by interactive exploration of electronic\r\narchives. Very long processing times make it likely that the data will\r\nstored away, and never looked at again.\r\n\r\nThe DBO Database System project is concerned with the design and\r\ndevelopment of a unique system called DBO.  Like traditional\r\nrelational database systems, DBO can run database queries from start\r\nto finish and produce exact answers over very large archives. However,\r\nunlike any existing research or production system, DBO uses sampling\r\nalgorithms to produce a statistical estimate for the final\r\nquery answer at all times throughout query execution. An example of\r\nthe sort of estimate produced by DBO is, \"There is a 95% chance that the\r\ntrue answer is between $1.75 million an $1.80 million\".  The longer a\r\nuser waits, the more accurate the estimate becomes.  The potential\r\nbenefit of such an estimate is that a user can stop execution whenever\r\nsatisfied with the accuracy of the estimate, which may translate to dramatic\r\ntime savings during exploratory processing. In this way, the goal of\r\nthe DBO project is to render interactive data analysis a reality, even\r\nover the largest databases.\r\n\r\nAll scientific and technical materials produced by the project, as\r\nwell as any software available for download, can be obtained from\r\nhttp://www.cise.ufl.edu/~cjermain/DBO .",
