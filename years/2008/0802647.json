 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop on Biosensing and Bioactuation will bring together 30-40 researchers from universities, government labs and industry who are experts in the diverse research topics of interest to those in the BIO, CISE, ENG and MPS researcher communities and who have a common interest in interdisciplinary research on biological systems and biologically inspired systems. Participants will be charged with formulating a vision for what might be possible through collaborations on the fundamental challenges pertaining to realizing revolutionary sensing and actuation capabilities that draw upon molecular biology, biochemical processes and both micro and macro biological systems for inspiration.  This will be a two-day workshop, to be held at the University of Maryland on Nov. 27th and 28th, 2007.  Prior to the workshop, participants will have posted a one-page vision statement that summarizes their individual perspectives of potential Grand Challenge Biosensing and Bioactuation research topics to the workshop web site.  The participants, all leaders in their respective fields, will use the small group working sessions to be conducted at the workshop to assess potential opportunities for collaborations that could lead to new insights and discoveries, and with that as a foundation, to develop a document for broad distribution in which participants contribute to identification of the state-of-the-art of Biosensor and Bioactuator research, and provide a visionary look forward that, with the benefit of the larger group for concept development, reflects opportunities for major research program areas that will comprise Biosensor and Bioactuator Research Grand Challenges in the coming decade.\r\n\r\n",
