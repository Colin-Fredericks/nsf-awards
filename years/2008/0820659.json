Lucas (University of California, Davis)\r\n\r\nPlants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. \r\n\r\nTwo research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. \r\n\r\nSeveral approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. \r\n\r\nA significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research. This project includes ample opportunities for participation by women and underrepresented groups in laboratory research. Project outcomes will be made available to the scientific community through a project website, which will be accessible via http://www.hort.iastate.edu/research/research-detail.php?id=1148.",

We have also discovered that two other related StBEL RNAs, StBEL11 and -29, also move through the phloem to underground stolon tips (where tubers form) to balance the signaling activity of StBEL5. Over-accumulation of StBEL5 and manipulation of the RNA-binding proteins that stabilize its mRNA endow transgenic lines with increased tuber yields. Based on our current understanding of the processes that control tuber development in potato, we may now utilize this information to produce transgenic potato lines that exhibit enhanced tuber yields and potentially, earlier tuber production. The key to this approach for yield enhancement is StBEL5&rsquo;s capacity to directly activate the tuberization pathway, and at the same time, to amplify the other important signals that regulate the timing and degree of potato production. We now understand that this process is implemented by activity of StBEL5 in the leaf, mobilization of its mRNA to stolons, and by enhanced activity of important tuber signals in stolons, eventually leading to increased tuber production.
