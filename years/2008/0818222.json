 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hibernation is utilized by 75 species of mammals to survive seasonally cold conditions.  Hibernation has thus been strongly favored by natural selection in many mammalian groups found worldwide.  The ecological constraints that may have restricted the evolution of hibernation in mammals are largely unknown.  One possible ecological constraint on mammalian torpor may be the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diets of free-ranging mammals.  This project will be the first to examine the effects of natural variations in diet PUFA contents on the over-winter survival of free-ranging hibernators, and, determine the physiological/ecological basis for geographic variations in the PUFA contents of the plants consumed by them.  The effects of natural variations in diet fatty acid composition on subsequent over-winter survival will be determined in a field study involving golden-mantled ground squirrels in the White Mountains of California.  Laboratory feeding/hibernation experiments will be conducted to determine the effects of body temperature on the degree of tissue damage that occurs during hibernation.  Field studies on the relationship between elevation, ambient temperature, and plant PUFA content will also be conducted.  The project will provide new insights into the physiological ecology of mammalian hibernation.  The results of these studies will permit the development of mathematical models to accurately predict the effects of climate warming on populations of hibernating mammals.  The participation of historically underrepresented students will be enhanced by including paid summer internships for undergraduates, senior undergraduate thesis projects, and graduate assistantships awarded to students from underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe scientific findings of this project project fall into two major categories:  a) the effects of recent climate change on hibernating species of mammals in alpine areas, and, b) the effects of White-nose Syndrome on 2 species of bats in New York State.   Research on hibernating mammals in alpine habitats involved free-ranging golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospemophilus lateralis) living in the Barcroft area of the White Mountains of California.  This study demonstrated that the ambient temperatures at which these rodents begin hibernation has risen by 2.7 to 3.7 C during the past 14 years.  During the past 8 years, the time at which these squirrels begin hibernation has become about 10 days later, and the hibernation period has shortened by 30 days in length.  The minimum body temperature maintained during hibernation has also risen by 0.8 C during this period as well.  Further research into this system has also revealed that the chemistry of the plants consumed by these squirrels (Polyunsaturated fatty acids) has changed in a manner that reduces hibernation ability.  These findings reveal that recent climate warming is adversely affecting populations of hibernating mammals in alpine areas.\n\n These second category of research involved in this project was the effects of a fungus called Geomcyces destructans on the hibernation and over winter-survival of both little brown (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) in New York State.  This fungus first appeared in NY during the winter of 2006-07, and appears to have come from Europe.  It was found to cause cutaneous (skin) infections in M. lucifugus during hibernation, producing what is now called White-nose Syndrome (WNS).   This study demonstrated that the cutaneous infections kill M. lucifugus by increasing the frequency at which these bats periodically arousal out of torpor during hibernation.  As a consequence of this greater arousal rate, the bats prematurely deplete their body fat reserves before spring, and die of starvation.  This study also revealed that hibernating E. fuscus do not develop skin infections when hibernating in areas where this new fungus is found, and they hibernate normally, consequently surviving the winter.  This study thus reveals that at least one species of bat (the big brown bat) is resistant to what is know as White-nose Syndrome.\n\nFunds from this project also provided  both research opportunities and training for 12 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in degree programs at Fordham University.  Several of these students were from historically underrepresented groups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig L Frank"
