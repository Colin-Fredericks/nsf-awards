 "awd_abstract_narration": "EMT/BSSE: A Controller for Autonomous Systems\r\nBased on Principles of Vertebrate Neuromodulation\r\nRobots and autonomous systems require some level of supervision and tuning of\r\nparameters to fit a particular domain. However, biological organisms have the ability to\r\nrespond quickly and appropriately in an ever-changing world. Because this adaptability\r\nis so critical for survival, all vertebrates have sub-cortical structures, which comprise the\r\nneuromodulatory systems. These systems regulate fundamental behaviors and set the\r\norganism?s internal and behavioral states. This research involves designing a controller\r\nfor autonomous systems that is modeled after the vertebrate neuromodulatory system.\r\nThis neurally inspired model enables robots to approach the behavioral complexity and\r\nflexibility associated with higher order animals, and would be a major improvement in the\r\ndesign of autonomous systems.\r\nNeuromodulators in the nervous system signal environmental changes to the nervous\r\nsystem that alter neuronal responses in such a way that the organism can respond\r\nquickly and accurately to these changes. There are separate neuromodulators that\r\nrespond to threats, reward anticipation, novelty, and attentional effort. However, each of\r\nthese neuromodulatory systems have a similar effect, that is, to cause an organism to be\r\ndecisive when environmental conditions call for such actions, and allow an organism to\r\nbe more exploratory when there are no pressing events. A design strategy, based on\r\nprinciples of the vertebrate neuromodulatory system, is used to control the behavior of\r\nautonomous robot systems. This research shows that such a system responds\r\nappropriately and adapts to environmental changes without human intervention.\r\nMoreover, this research shows that a controller, which is based on neuromodulation, can\r\nbe extended to any system in which an agent is situated in a dynamic, unconstrained\r\nenvironment.",
