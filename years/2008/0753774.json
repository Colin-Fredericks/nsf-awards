 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) hosts 10 students each summer to participate in the Research Experience for Undergraduate Site Program. The program is open to all undergraduate students, and stipends, room, board and travel are provided. Students conduct field research in ecology and evolutionary biology under the supervision of a senior scientist. The focus of the program is to help students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, consider and pursue a career in field biology. The primary emphasis of the program is an independent research project that students design and conduct under the guidance of a scientist at the RMBL. To assist both mentors and students, the RMBL conducts workshops in experimental design and statistical analysis. Upon completion of projects, all students in the REU program communicate their results orally at a summer-end symposium. Students are also required to submit a paper written in a scientific format to the program. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their papers to RMBL's online, peer-reviewed journal Undergraduate Research in Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution. Students interested in the RMBL's REU program should contact RMBL's Operation Manager (admin@rmbl.org, (970) 349-7231), or visit http://www.rmbl.org. PI is Dr Ian Billick, (director@rmbl.org).",
