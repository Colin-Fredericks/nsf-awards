The  analyses  will  include:  methane  isotopes  (delta-13CH4    and  delta-DCH4),  light  non-methane  hydrocarbons  (ethane,  propane,  and  n-butane),  sulfur  gases  (COS,  CS2),  and  methyl  halides  (CH3Cl  and  CH3Br).   The  atmospheric  burdens  of  these  trace  gases  reflect  changes  in  atmospheric  OH,  biomass  burning,  biogenic  activity  in  terrestrial,  oceanic,  and  wetland  ecosystems,  and  industrial/agricultural  activity.   The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  develop  atmospheric  histories  for  these  trace  gases  over  the  last  century  through  examination  of  depth  profiles  of  these  gases  in  South  Pole  firn  air.   The  project  will  involve  two  phases:   1)  a  field  campaign  at  South  Pole,  Antarctica  to  drill  two  firn  holes  and  fill  a  total  of  ~200  flasks  from  depths  reaching  120  m,  2)  analysis  of  firn  air  at  University of California, Irvine,  Penn  State  University,  and  several  other  collaborating  laboratories.   Atmospheric  histories  will  be  inferred  from  the  measurements  using  a  one  dimensional  advective/diffusive  model  of  firn  air  transport.  This  study  will  provide  new  information  about  the  recent  changes  in  atmospheric  levels  of  these  gases,  providing  about  a  90  year  long  time  series  record  that  connects  the  earlier  surface  and  firn  air  measurements  to  present  day.   The project  will  also  explore  the  possibility  of  in- situ  production  of  light  non-methane  hydrocarbons  in  firn  air  that  is  relevant  to  the  interpretation  of  ice  core  records.  The broader impacts of this  research  are that it has  the  potential  for  significant  societal  impact  by  improving  our  understanding  of  climate  change  and  man's  input  to  the  atmosphere.   The  results  of  this  work  will  be  disseminated  through  the  peer review  process,  and  will  contribute  to  environmental  assessments,  such  as  the  Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  Climate  Assessment  and  the  Word Meteorological Organization (WMO)  Stratospheric  Ozone  Assessment.   This  research  will  provide  educational  opportunities  for  graduate  and  undergraduate  students,  and  will  contribute  to  a  teacher  training  program  for  K-12  teachers  in  minority  school  districts.  \r\n\r\n",
