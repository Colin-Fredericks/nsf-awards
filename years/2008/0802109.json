Raymer, University of Oregon Eugene\r\n\r\nObjective: To advance the field of quantum-optical information technology, this program explores methods for creating entangled photons pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing in small-core optical fibers. This offers advantages, including creating photons that are well mode matched for low-loss fiber transmission. The work will be carried out by a collaboration of the Raymer group at the University of Oregon, the McKinstrie group at Bell Labs, and the Radic group at UC San Diego. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: They will use parametric interactions in highly nonlinear fibers and photonic-crystal fiber to enable several basic capabilities: 1) pair-photon generation in fiber with controlled degree of spectral correlation or entanglement, 2) frequency conversion (translation) of quantum states of photons and modes in fiber while maintaining spectral or entanglement properties, 3) generation of amplitude-entangled fields of modes in fiber, and 4) linear coupling of signals at different carrier frequencies through nonlinear Bragg scattering.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Wavelength agility of optical signals plays an important role in modern communication systems. Quantum frequency conversion would have at least two uses: 1) to enable wavelength-division multiplexing of quantum signals, including those used for quantum cryptographic key distribution, and 2) to provide a means to manipulate entangled photons between many channels for the purpose of quantum computation. The project brings together quantum opticians with optical device scientists at other institutions, providing the opportunity for PhD students to spend time interacting with diverse scientists and benefiting from their facilities and expertise. Nonlinear optics offers excellent opportunities to integrate research with science education.",
