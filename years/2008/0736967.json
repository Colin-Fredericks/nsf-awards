 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Science and Mathematics Education at the University of Maine continues its series of national conferences on providing professional development and resources for integrating mathematics and science education research into teaching.  The first part of the conference consists of three days of parallel presentations and discussions by nationally recognized experts along with short workshops.  The workshops provide first hand experience with either research-based STEM curricula or cutting edge STEM research projects that can serve as a basis for classroom instruction.  The purposes of the conference include bringing together 150 participants in all aspects of STEM education (researchers, teachers, administrators, and preservice students) to exchange ideas about research, curriculum and assessment, to help teachers integrate research based instructional strategies in their teaching, and to build sustainable collaborations between participants.  The second part of the conference is a two day summer academy in which about 60 participants have the option of (1) working on implementing a module of technology-rich curriculum in their classroom; (2) developing plans, curricular materials and assessments for involving teachers and students in a STEM research project; or (3) adapting and implementing a research-supported curriculum in their teaching.  The academy continues throughput the year.  A focus on research-based strategies that advance the successful participation of underrepresented groups is embedded in all activities.",
