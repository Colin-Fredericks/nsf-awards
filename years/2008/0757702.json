 "awd_abstract_narration": "String theory is the most promising candidate for the unification of the Standard Model with General Relativity in a framework consistent with Quantum Theory. The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) conjecture has revolutionized the field by providing a quantitative correspondence between Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions and string theory in 10 dimensions. The goal of the research proposed here is to improve our understanding of perturbative and non-perturbative string theory, including the dynamics of black holes, the time evolution of gravitational systems, certain aspects of QCD, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics in strongly coupled gauge theories, often through the AdS/CFT correspondence. Developing a precise quantitative prescription for superstring perturbation theory is also a goal of this proposal. The PIs plan to further their study of exact solutions of Supergravity theories with extended supersymmetry, investigate their AdS/CFT duals, and related interface conformal field theories. The broader impacts of this research group are as follows: the PIs run a weekly journal club on string theory and related topics, and  help organize a bi-annual seminar series with local institutions. They are actively involved in outreach and participate in the QuarkNet program. One PI developed and teaches yearly a \"Scientific Writing Course\" for UCLA's Graduate Assistants in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program, and presents \"Scientific Writing Workshops\" for UCLA's Office of Outreach, Diversity and Fellowship. D'Hoker is involved in the leadership of the Aspen Center for Physics.",
