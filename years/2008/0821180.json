 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to acquire a modern electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) to support several Old Dominion University (ODU) research programs, as well as activities at Norfolk State University (NSU) and Hampton University (HU), both minority-serving institutions, and the College of William and Mary (W&M). These research programs include the pioneering iron grain tracer technique, which employed the existing EPMA to measure grain chemistry over the last 16 years for research on Arctic sea ice and climate change, research on fish population dynamics using detailed (<10 \u00ecm) otolith-layer chemistry that is essential for future management of fish stocks, metal restoration for priceless marine artifacts such as the USS Monitor, investigations of delamination in Aluminum-Lithium alloys important to space exploration, studies of electrodes used in large particle accelerators (e.g., Jefferson Lab and Fermilab and the prospective International Linear Collider, a nine billion dollar project), and calibrations of new laser analysis techniques with wide applications for research and industry. The growing list of innovative research projects at ODU and other local institutions requiring an EPMA and other types of microanalyses has prompted a commitment by ODU to expand the building space and support for such equipment. ODU is committed to ensuring that a qualified, experienced EPMA operator is available full-time to facilitate this research and that the new EPMA is maintained properly. The requested EPMA will replace a 39 year old ETEC EPMA that is now well beyond retirement age. Recent developments in EPMA instrumentation has made extended overnight and weekend automated operation possible and safe with offsite monitoring. This allows for expanded usage of an EPMA because much of the currently funded iron grain work can largely be done after normal work hours, opening the instrument to greater daytime usage requiring hands-on operation.\r\n\r\nThe requested EPMA is part of a major research infrastructure plan at ODU. The new Research Facility that will house the EPMA and other microanalysis instrumentation is under construction and scheduled for completion in early 2009 and will be a regional microanalyses facility. The EPMA will provide ?hands-on? research experience for graduate and undergraduate students at ODU, NSU, HU, W&M, and other institutions. An estimated 12 faculty researchers, 21 graduate and 58 undergraduate students from these institutions will use the new EPMA in the first few years. Besides research, the EPMA will be used for classroom demonstrations and exercises for both graduate and undergraduate courses. The management plan provides for usage charges to cover a maintenance contract, supplies, and an experienced operator well beyond the three years of the grant. The long-term operation and maintenance is guaranteed by the College of Sciences as part of the College?s research infrastructure improvement plan.\r\n",
