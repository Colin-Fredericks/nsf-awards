The inverse problem for an electrical network is the problem of finding the conductivity of resistors and shape of a network when the boundary current response to boundary voltages (response matrix) is known. Resistances may be specified by directed or undirected edge functions or vertex functions.  Students will investigate the relation between the response matrix and the geometry of the network. The students will also pursue related discrete problems involving Bruhat orders, Schubert varieties and tableaux.\r\n",
