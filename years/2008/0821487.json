 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Professor Mark W. Severson and colleagues Amanda Bryant-Friedrich, Roman Dembinski from Oakland University will acquire a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with multinuclear capabilities.  The acquisition of the NMR will impact research in chemistry as well as biological, bioinorganic and radiation chemistry, and chemical toxicology. This instrumentation will aid in integrating research and education and will open new research avenues for members of the scientific community not only at Oakland University but also within Southeastern Michigan. The relationship between Oakland University and its neighboring community colleges and universities has facilitated the involvement of a record number of students representing many ethnic and cultural groups represented in southeastern Michigan in the scientific enterprise.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.",
