Holm\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator's principal focus in this proposal is group\r\nactions and reduction in symplectic geometry.  A fundamental problem\r\nin symplectic geometry is to relate the geometry and topology of a\r\nHamiltonian system to the combinatorics of the moment polytope, and\r\nvice versa.  The principal players on the geometric side include the\r\nsymplectic manifold itself and its symplectic reductions.\r\nCombinatorially, the vertices, edges, k-dimensional faces, and even\r\nthe chambers of the moment polytope play a significant role.\r\nGenerically, a symplectic reduction has orbifold singularities.  The\r\nprincipal investigator outlines a program towards understanding the\r\ngeometry and topology of such orbifolds.  These results will provide\r\ninsight into the structure of the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring,\r\nyielding information about orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants.  This\r\nwork has also naturally led to foundational questions regarding group\r\nactions on orbifolds.  Finally, the PI will distill the geometry and\r\ntopology of the Hamiltonian system into combinatorial data associated\r\nto the moment polytope.  This will shed new light on recent\r\ncombinatorial results concerning intervals in the Bruhat order on any\r\nCoxeter group.\r\n\r\nSymplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for describing\r\nphenomena in mathematical physics, from classical mechanics to string\r\ntheory.  The moment map is an important tool that translates the\r\nsymmetries of a physical system into discrete data.  An expert in\r\nsymplectic geometry, the PI will achieve a deeper understanding of the\r\nrelationship between the geometry of a symplectic manifold and the\r\ncombinatorics of the moment map data.  Her work will shed light on\r\nstringy invariants in this context.  The proposed activities will\r\nadvance our knowledge in the fields of symplectic geometry and\r\ncombinatorics, with applications to algebraic geometry, algebraic\r\ntopology and mathematical physics.  The PI's broader objectives\r\ninclude increasing the participation and visibility of women in\r\nresearch mathematics, and enhancing the undergraduate experience in\r\nmathematics.\r\n",
