Zhang, \r\nAssistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, \r\nInstitution: The University of Texas of Austin \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This is a travel grant for partial support for ten U.S. biomedical, biomechanical engineering, and chemical engineering  junior faculty and graduate students with research on interfacial aspects to participate in the 2007 MRS Symposium on Solids at the Biological Interface, November 26-30, Boston, MA. \r\n\r\nThe interface of materials science and biology is significant in applications ranging from the mechanics of whole tissue constructs to the cellular response from introduced nanoscale materials. Unique attributes of biological and physiological systems generate critical interactions that must be considered in the development of experimental protocols or models and in the use of solid materials in an environment complicated by the presence of salts, an immune system, and cells with preferential responses to material modulus, composition, and surface properties. Solid-state materials including silicon substrates, metals, ceramics, and polymers are increasingly being implemented in MEMS/NEMS, nanoscale technologies and materials, and in implantable diagnostic medical devices and tissue replacement and/or drug delivery systems. Solid materials are of particular interest due to their wide range of applications within biological systems. Bones, teeth, plant materials, and exoskeletons act in structural, protective, or masticatory functions. The four key topics are in the following areas, focusing on examinations of material interfaces in biological environments with respect to: \r\n\r\n. Mechanical characterization and/or modeling at multiple scales with particular focus on modulus mismatch between materials; material-fluid interactions; interface of two materials with like or highly dissimilar ultrastructures; time-dependent behavior in solid, composite materials; biomimetic materials; and the importance of structure at multiple scales \r\n\r\n. How well the material is tolerated by biology, including issues of biocompatibility or toxicity, cell adhesion, biofouling, or chemical interactions between the material from the surrounding fluid or cellular milieu \r\n\r\n. How interface characteristics are improved via natural adaptation; through the alteration of surface chemistry; and/or the addition of amino acids, peptides, enzymes, or cells \r\n\r\n. Synthesis and characterization of bioinspired materials systems \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: This workshop will bring together leading experts and young scholars in biomechanics, biophysics, chemical engineering, tissue engineering, and molecular imaging with researchers from more traditional life-science fields (e.g., anatomy, biology, chemistry, and medicine) to facilitate a unique and necessary discourse on the roles of solid materials in biological systems. This workshop seeks to explore these issues by examining the physico-chemical interaction of solid-state interfaces with biological environments at scales ranging from whole tissues to single biomolecules. \r\n\r\nThe support from NSF CBET will help junior academics and students to participate in this international conference to facilitate an exchange of scientific, intellectual and practical knowledge, in particular with engineers and scientists from industry. Students involved will gain invaluable experience through participation in this event; and, in many cases, this will be their first opportunity to present and publish their work. The organizers also want to ensure the discussion topics align well with CBET priorities.",
