Difficulties come from, among other\r\nthings, the irreversibility of these phenomena, and the fact that\r\nexisting models are essentially variational (static).  The\r\ngeneral strategy is to first develop quasi-static models that are\r\nconsistent with these variational principles, and prove existence\r\nand approximation results.  Next, the goal is to extend these\r\nresults to the fully dynamic setting.  The first step has been\r\nessentially completed for damage and brittle fracture, and the\r\ninvestigator works on developing corresponding methods for\r\ncohesive fracture.  Dynamic models and their analysis are major\r\nopen problems for all these phenomena, and are the main focus of\r\nthis project.\r\n\r\n     Material damage and fracture prediction are of fundamental\r\nimportance in the areas of materials and manufacturing, civil\r\ninfrastructure, etc., yet in the most physically realistic\r\nsetting (dynamics) there is no sound mathematical footing, making\r\nengineering models largely ad hoc.  The investigator works on\r\ndeveloping this mathematical support, as well as creating and\r\nrigorously justifying algorithms for computing approximate\r\nsolutions.  The project includes training mathematics Ph.D.\r\nstudents through work on important interdisciplinary problems.\r\n",
