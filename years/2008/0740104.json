 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I research project will investigate the feasibility of improving the addressing speed of Plasma-sphere. Plasma-spheres are hollow transparent shells that encapsulate a selected pressurized gas. When a voltage is applied across the shell, the gas ionizes and glows. Plasma-spheres are applied to flexible, electrically addressable arrays to form Plasma-sphere arrays for use as large area plasma displays. Plasma-sphere arrays, like standard plasma displays require secondary electron emitting materials to increases addressing speeds. Several promising materials, both thin and thick, will be investigated including Barium Oxide, Calcium Oxide, Strontium Oxide and strontium-doped LaMnO3 (LSM). This process presents a novel approach to produce video speed large area plasma displays. The Plasma-sphere array differs from other display technologies in that it allows for low-cost displays that are flexible, ultra-large, with full-color and full-motion video. \r\n\r\nThe Plasma-sphere array is a breakthrough in display technology. It moves away from the traditional semiconductor fabrication processes as practiced by many display manufacturers in Asia and replaces them with low cost plastic, glass, and printing processes practiced and well understood by US based companies. The successful development of high speed addressing will help move this product toward commercialization in the large and growing market of dynamic signage. Plasma-sphere arrays are an order of magnitude lower in production cost when compared with ultra large LED displays. The Plasma-sphere array can be made large like an LED display, while retaining many of the exceptional features of a conventional, rigid plasma display including good viewing angle, high brightness, excellent contrast, and full motion video.\r\n",
