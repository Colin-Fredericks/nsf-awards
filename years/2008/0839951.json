 "awd_abstract_narration": "DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH FREQUENCY SILICON CAPACITIVE\r\nRESONATORS FOR HIGH-Q OPERATION IN LIQUID MEDIA\r\nABSTRACT\r\n1. Objectives\r\nThis proposal is aimed at the design, fabrication, and characterization of bulk-mode capacitive\r\nsilicon resonators capable of high-Q operation in liquid for high-resolution label-free biochemical\r\ndetection and analysis. The goal is to demonstrate quality factors as high as 1000 in DI water for\r\nresonators in the 10-200MHz frequency range.\r\n2. Intellectual Merit:\r\nDespite recent developments in the silicon resonator technologies and speculations on the\r\nsuitability of such devices as high-precision mass sensors, no viable design or architecture for\r\npractical sensory applications has been demonstrated for such devices. In particular, operation of\r\ncapacitive micro-resonators in liquid with an acceptably high quality factor remains an open\r\nproblem. This effort will develop and demonstrate new design concepts and fabrication\r\napproaches for minimization of viscous damping caused by the surrounding liquid. The proposed\r\npartially encapsulated resonators will be designed, fabricated and characterized in aqueous liquid\r\nmedia.\r\n3. Broader Impact\r\nSuccessful development of the proposed resonators will pave the way towards implementation of\r\nhighly sensitive label-free biochemical sensor arrays with numerous applications in biology,\r\nmedicine and health sciences.\r\nThe expected outcomes of the proposed activities will fuel the PI?s ongoing lecture and lab course\r\ndevelopment activities under the NSF NUE grant. The PI will have research assistantship\r\nopenings for undergraduate students under this project. The financial support for the\r\nundergraduate students will be provided by the University of Denver through the Partners in\r\nScholarship (PINS) program. In selection of the undergraduate research assistants priority will be\r\ngiven to students from the minority and under-represented groups",
