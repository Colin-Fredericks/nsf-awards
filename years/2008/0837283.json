 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)  This project is creating and assessing a new style of textbook - an economical, succinct, and focused guide to the most important tenets of Geomorphology, the study of Earth's dynamic surface. This \"Shortbook\" is made up of 15 chapters, each 15 to 18 pages long, and each focused specifically on core concepts identified though a process of community consensus building. The goal of this book, and its accompanying public-domain e-media, is to organize and present the most important knowledge about Earth's surface in a concise fashion relevant to the way in which todays students deal with information. This project addresses a dynamic discipline of the geosciences and serves as a  model for textbook creation in the STEM disciplines. The textbook is being designed, printed, and distributed by a commercial publisher and is linked to a public-domain website that hosts a suite of e-media, referred to as \"Vignettes\". These are short (<1000 word) case studies that supplement the text and allow customization of the learning environment. Some vignettes are place-based examples; some are quantitative treatments of significant equations or problems in geomorphology; and others feature videos or animations that clarify difficult concepts. The vignettes are being created by experts, vetted by others, linked to the textbook, searchable on line, and available free, both on line and as PDF versions. The \"Shortbook\" concept comes from the recommendations of a 2006 NSF/National Academy of Sciences workshop, \"Reconsidering the Textbook\", which suggested that textbooks of the future would be short, economical, reflect community consensus, be student-centered, and be well and purposefully integrated with e-media. This project is testing the workshop recommendations by creating a new textbook in the growing discipline of geomorphology for which the existing texts were first published between 12 and 30 years ago. The assessment plan, which is integral to this proposal and the textbook development process is designed to improve the quality of the final product and determine whether the project has met its goal of creating a book that is widely accepted and useful for both students and faculty.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUsing support from the US National Science Foundation, we created the first in a new generation of student-centered, community-authored textbooks &ndash; a model for the textbook of the future.  The textbook we created, Key Concepts in Geomorphology, published in early 2015 and is already widely adopted and on its second printing.  To support the book, we worked with the community to create two online archives &ndash; a collection of photographs useful in teaching geomorphology and a collection of place-based Vignettes offering additional depth on topic covered in the book.\n\n \n\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/vignettes/\n\n \n\nhttp://www.uvm.edu/~geomorph/gallery/\n\n \n\nThe Intellectual Merit of our approach, catalyzed by NSF support, was centered on deep community involvement from start to finish so that the resulting booked reflected the needs and belief of the community rather than the idiosyncratic voices of the authors. We began by bringing together a small group of geomorphologists to create a list of chapters and outline those chapters.  Those outlines were reworked by 60 faculty at a meeting focused on teaching geomorphology.  We then selected 28 experts to serve as reviewers for the 14 chapters of the book (2 per chapter).  These experts further edited the outlines and then we set to work writing.  As co-authors, we each wrote 7 chapters and then cross edited repeatedly.  Each chapter was read and edited by two experts and by a development editor.  To ensure uniformity of voice and accuracy, a scientific editor, Alan Gillespie, read all 14 chapters as did two senior geomorphologists, Mary Savina and Thomas Dunne.  Between each of these edits, Bierman and Montgomery, edited the manuscript.  Two undergraduate students also read and edited chapters to ensure they were accessible to the book\u00c6s audience.  We worked with a doctoral student in geology, Luke Reusser, who was also an artist, to draft all new, full-color figures.  The figures were designed specifically to appeal to students and covey the most important concepts of each chapter.\n\n \n\nThe Broader Impacts of our work have been significant.  We have modeled a process by which textbooks can be created that serve a discipline broadly and which focus on the most important, core body of knowledge for that discipline.  Our new text has already been adopted by 80 schools in the United States and Canada and has sold as many copies abroad as it has in the United States.  Feedback from students (assessment supported by NSF but done by Carleton College) showed that students read the text, appreciated the readable, focused nature of the chapters, and found that the illustrations assisted their learning.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul R Bierman"
