 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project between the University of Alabama at Birmingham - Center for Nanoscale Materials and Biointegration (UAB-CNMB) and the Technical University of Lodz - Centre of Excellence NANODIAM (TUL-NANODIAM, Poland) addresses compositionally graded, and multiphase carbon-based materials fabricated in microwave (MW) at UAB, radio-frequency (RF) and combined RF+MW at TUL, plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) processes, as well as the interdisciplinary training of globally engaged students and young scientists in physics and chemistry of materials, nanoscience, and biomedical engineering technology. The scientific goals of the project are to advance the fundamental knowledge of the phenomena associated with the nucleation and growth of nanostructured diamond (NCD)-based materials in MW, RF, and RF+MW PACVD processes, to develop new approaches to fabricate NCD structures with predetermined microstructure and surface morphologies, and to further improve the mechanical properties and physiochemical performance of NCD coatings on metals, in particular, on biomedical alloys, through the optimization of the surface morphology of the coatings, smart design of the substrate/coating interface, and directed surface functionalization.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge will help the advancement of nanostructured NCD materials and devices with potential innovative applications in biomedical and other fields. The project provides exciting opportunities for participating students and junior researchers (at least 3-4 every year from each side) to gain international research and cultural sensitivity experiences through short- and medium-term visits to conduct joint experiments and to use complementary instrumentation at the partner?s institution, and through the participation in international conferences and seminars. The international education component will be enhanced by a unique joint virtual learning resource within the topics of the proposed network program, which will combine two graduate courses of similar content currently taught at UAB (PH732 ?Growth and Characterization of Thin Films I?) and TUL (049L8 ?CVD and PVD Methods in Surface Engineering?). In addition, undergraduate students in the UAB Science and Technology Honors Program and the UAB REU-Site will be exposed to the international collaborative research environment through their participation in the network project activities and through the interaction with visiting TUL researchers and students.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE). \r\n",
