The work builds on the PI's prior NSF-supported work that focused on equilibrium association and contributed to the basic theoretical understanding of supramolecular assembly, complexity and emergence. Freed is now generalizing this approach to consider several non-equilibrium processes including the reversible formation of branched clusters, self-assembly of compact clusters and the coupling of surface adsorption and desorption with self-assembly. \r\n\r\nThe theoretical and computational work being carried out by Freed and his group is expected to have a broad impact through application in both biology and materials science and to be a key component in developing effective strategies for \"bottom-up\" manufacturing and fabrication of functional nanostructures.",

Diversity of Equilibrium Self-assembly Processes\n\n \n\nThe self-assembly of dynamic clusters is a ubiquitous phenomenon in which the constituent molecules or particles form and disintegrate clusters of various geometries in a dynamical equilibrium. This dynamic clustering process is prevalent in biopolymer, polyelectrolyte, and ionic solutions, solutions of amphiphiles and molecules exhibiting supramolecular assembly with highly directional (hydrogen bonding, pi-pi, polar, and multipole) interactions.
