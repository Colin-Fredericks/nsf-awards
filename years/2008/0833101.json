 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the term  Data-Intensive SuperComputing (DISC) has been  gaining popularity and includes applications that perform large-scale computations over massive datasets.     Because of the increasing volume of data analyzed,  the amount of computation involved,  and the need for  rapid  or even interactive response,  these  applications   have an ever increasing  demand for computational power. \r\nStarting within the last 2-3 years, it is no longer possible to improve processor performance by simply increasing clock frequencies. As a result, multi-core architectures and    accelerators like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become  cost-effective means for scaling performance. Such architectures are, however, creating a  programmability challenge  for this class of applications. \r\n\r\nThis project targets a language-independent  compiler and runtime framework for enabling  data-intensive applications to be scaled on a variety  of   modern and emerging highly parallel  systems.  Specifically,  the target  \r\nwill be cluster of multi-core machines,   where each node could additionally have an accelerator like a GPU.   \r\nThe system proposed here will built on our prior work on   an \r\nearlier system, FREERIDE (FRamework for Rapid Implementation\r\nof Datamining  Engines). \r\nBuilding on the FREERIDE framework,  this project has the potential for an impact in the   areas  of high-end computing,   data mining,  \r\nand  scientific  data processing.   \r\n",
