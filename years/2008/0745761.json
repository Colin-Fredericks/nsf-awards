 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Munagala will develop theoretical models for the problems of\r\nuncertainty and imprecise information in computing and communication\r\nsystems such as wireless sensor networks and grid computers, and\r\ndesign algorithms and policies to ameliorate their impact on system\r\nperformance, thereby leading to more effective larger-scale\r\ndeployments of such systems.\r\n\r\nHe will also develop algorithms for computing dynamic information\r\nacquisition strategies in uncertain environments, that jointly\r\noptimize the cost of acquiring more information, together with the\r\ngain from exploiting the information to enhance system\r\nperformance. This class of problems falls within the larger area of\r\nstochastic control theory.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that computing and storing the optimal control\r\npolicies (or strategies) needs exponential time and space. However, in\r\nthe scenarios that Dr. Munagala will investigate, the system can\r\ntolerate certain suboptimality in the quality of planning decisions,\r\nbut the real requirement is that the policies be extremely lightweight\r\nto compute and execute. This motivates the formulation and design of\r\ncomputationally efficient approximately optimal policies for an entire\r\ngamut of fundamental control theoretic problems.\r\n\r\nThe PI will draw upon his expertise in approximation and online\r\nalgorithms to develop new insights to address important theoretical\r\nquestions in stochastic control theory, with emphasis on information\r\nacquisition and exploitation problems. In contrast with techniques\r\ndeveloped in the AI and operations research communities, the solutions\r\ndeveloped will have provable performance guarantees, in addition to\r\nbeing efficient to implement. The novel algorithmic principles\r\nemerging from this project will lay the foundations for developing a\r\nfresh theory of approximate stochastic control.\r\n",
