 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last several years chromatin structure has been shown to be a highly dynamic entity, one through which DNA-centered processes such as  transcription, replication, repair, and recombination are carefully controlled.  A vast multitude of protein complexes alter chromatin structure through the exertion of mechanical work (ATP hydrolysis) or chemical modification (acetylation, methylation, and so on). Yet little is known about the higher-order structure of chromatin or how these many complexes perturb it, and it is therefore imperative that better approaches for examining higher-order chromatin structure be developed.  In this project the investigator will engineer nucleosomes such that chemical modification and site-directed cross-linking can be used to monitor (1) the accessibility of a series of specific sites throughout the nucleosome and (2) their proximity to other regions.  With this monitoring ability, the investigator will be able to identify the nucleosomal regions involved in the compaction of chromatin fibers, and to model the structure of the higher-order chromatin. The investigator will focus particularly on the structural changes that occur as the chromatin fiber transitions from a 10 nm fiber to a 30 nm fiber, and then to self-associated arrays. Currently it is extremely difficult to probe the structure of higher-order chromatin due to its inherent complexity (size, heterogeneity, and protein composition).  So far most of the information available on higher-order structure has been derived from low resolution structures obtained by techniques such as electron and atomic force microscopy.  Successful completion of this project will provide key missing structural information that will complement that obtained by these conventional methods and will also address fundamental questions concerning cell development and the organization and regulation of the genome.\r\nThis project will provide an enhanced learning experience for the undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project.  As part of an undergraduate research class,  students will be organized into small teams to make histone mutants and to participate in the large-scale purification of the engineered histones.  Those in this project will meet weekly to present their own research, discuss recent publications on chromatin structure and function, and solve technical challenges.  This research will augment Southern Illinois University's tradition of  providing research opportunities to those from groups underrepresented in science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nDNA is not loose inside the cell, but is packaged\ninto structures that can be used to regulate access to DNA.  These structures are called chromatin and at\nits most basic level are made up of nucleosomes.  Nucleosomes are protein spools on which DNA\nis wrapped around.  Nucleosomes are arranged\ntogether to form long fibers and the focus of our research is to study the\norganization of nucleosomes when arranged in these chromatin fibers.  We have been working on two chemical methods\nto examine how nucleosomes are arranged in these fibers. Both of these methods\nuse the attachment of some type of a reporter at specific sites on the surface\nof the protein spool made up of eight histone proteins.  We found that we could quantitatively measure\nthe accessibility of specific sites in the histones and observe changes in\naccessibility as the nucleosomes change from a simple bead-on-a-string like to\na more compacted fiber structure. \nSimilarly we were able to identify some of the interactions that occur during\nthis transition by transferring a label from one site to another site that is\nin close proximity to the first.  There\nare also enzymes that alter fiber and chromatin structure which hydrolyze ATP.  We examined how chromatin organization might\ninfluence the enzymatic properties of these remodelers using these chromatin\nfibers\n\n\n\nThe structure of\nchromatin fibers is an important factor that regulates gene expression and cell\ndevelopment.
