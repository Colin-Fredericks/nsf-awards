 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the National Science Foundation, Professor John Anthony of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky will work with linearly-fused hydrocarbons (acenes) that are benchmark components of low-cost displays and plastic solar cells. However, materials only up to the pentamer (pentacene) are well-characterized. This project will significantly enhance understanding of these important molecules by expanding the acene series through a functionalization strategy that retards common decomposition pathways, improving stability and solubility. By developing stabilized hexamers and heptamers, new materials for use in display technologies and energy generation are envisioned. Applying these stabilization methods to even larger systems (octamers, nonamers) will develop a better understanding of the evolution of aromaticity with increased oligomer length, which will improve chemists' ability to engineer the electronic properties of this class of molecules.\r\n\r\nWith this award Professor Anthony's research program will adopt a comprehensive approach to the development of new materials for organic electronics, including the development of new synthetic methodologies, the design of novel functionalization strategies, and the application of designed molecules to thin-film electronics. This approach will lead to materials suited for several emerging technologies, and train students in both the synthesis and application of self-assembled organic materials.\r\n",
