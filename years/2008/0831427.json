The objective of this\r\nresearch is to investigate and develop meta-environments for Emulab-based testbeds. A\r\nmeta-environment is a set of testbed configurations, tools and processes developed for a\r\nspecific security domain that enables experiments to be conducted in a simplified,\r\nrealistic and consistent fashion. The first component of this research program is focused\r\non investigating tools such as traffic generators that can be used across all metaenvironments.\r\nNext, five specific meta-environments will be investigated and developed\r\nfor the following areas: 1) network intrusion detection, 2) firewalls, 3) honeynets, 4)\r\ndenial of service defense, and 5) security perimeter design. Finally, mechanisms for\r\nfederation between the Wisconsin Advanced Internet Lab, DETER and other Emulabbased\r\ntestbeds that will enable large-scale experiments and transparent access to\r\nresources will be investigated. The broader impacts of this project are that it will\r\nsimplify and accelerate the use of testbeds for security research, and enable consistent\r\ncomparisons between new security systems and tools. The expected results of this work\r\ninclude tools, configurations, and documentation for the five meta-environments and\r\ntestbed federation capability. The project also includes education and outreach activities\r\nthat will develop network security lab exercise materials. These web-based materials will\r\nbe openly available to the community, and will emphasize a hands-on approach intended\r\nto provide students with practical, relevant experiences.",

A meta-environment is an infrastructure and/or set of tools that is focused on a specific topic and is developed to complement more general experimental infrastructures such as the GENI or DETER testbeds.\n\nThe focus of the research studies conducted in this project was in four general areas: (i) network security such as perimeter defenses, (ii) Internet infrastructure and topology, (iii) Internet measurement and analysis, and (ii) Internet energy-awareness.  The outcomes on efforts related to network security include a game-theoretic method for obfuscating network honeynets, which are widely used to understand malicious activity.  This result has direct implications for new agile network defense methods, which are being studied today.  A series of studies also developed new methods for network anomaly detection and situational awareness.

To that end, the major outcomes of the project are a combination of published research papers and infrastructure/tools that are openly available to the community.  In terms of published research papers 20 manuscripts appeared in highly competitive peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals.  In terms of artifacts made available to the community, software distribuitons for 5 different tools are available online along with the Internet Atlas portal (http://atlas.wail.wisc.edu).\n\nFinally,  6 graduate students received support from this grant.  Through this support, they received training in networking, security, systems development and software engineering.  Two staff members also received support.  A large number of undergraduate students also benefitted directly from this project through the laboratory exercises that were developed as a result of the various studies.
