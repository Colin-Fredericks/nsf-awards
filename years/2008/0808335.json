 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0808335\r\nZoski\r\n\r\nThe goal of this 4 day-workshop on electrocatalysis is to develop approaches and guidelines, experimental and theoretical, to aid in the discovery of new electrocatalysts, especially those for technologically important reactions (like oxygen reduction and water oxidation) and to obtain a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms. It will bring together scientists and engineers in this field working on theory [e.g. density functional theory (DFT)], in situ catalyst surface characterization, biomimetic and combinatorial approaches to electrocatalyst synthesis, and reaction mechanism determination. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Interactions among theoreticians and experimentalists in both formal and informal settings will generate a better understanding of electrocatalyst materials, as well as new ideas, in this important area of research. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. This workshop will facilitate interactions between scientists with broad and complementary research interests in the area of electrocatalysis who would normally not have the opportunity to meet. Such exchanges and new interactions can lead to important advances in energy related-science, particularly in the development of alternative, cleaner, and more efficient energy technologies.",
