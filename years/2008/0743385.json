 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resource Predictability and Movement Strategies in Ungulates:\r\nDoes Temporal Uncertainty Lead to Nomadism?\r\n\r\n\tThe movements of all animals are affected by their need for resources such as food. Where and how quickly animals move often depends on where the best vegetation resources can be found and how predictable this food is from year to year. Some ungulate species with predictable environments migrate seasonally; caribou and wildebeest are examples of this. A few other species - gazelles, for example - appear to make large-scale, long-range movements that are seemingly unpredictable. This 'nomadism' likely occurs when the availability and location of resources varies considerably by season and by year.  To make sense of these seasonal and annual movement strategies, researchers will combine: 1) theoretical computer models, 2) landscape-scale satellite images of vegetation, and 3) detailed movement data from individual gazelles in Mongolia (new field studies) and caribou in Alaska (historical data).  \r\n\tBy understanding long-distance animal movements, we will be in a much better position to know how environmental variability affects animal behavior.  The conservation of these species and their habitats depends on understanding their large-scale movement patterns and ecology. Our research will help identify the mechanisms by which animals 'read' their environment to know when and where to move over complex landscapes.",

From a scientific point of view, it has long been known that migratory animals move long distances between distinct summer and winter ranges, but our first major discovery was that that gazelles exhibit a fundamentally different kind of movement pattern.  In common with more typical migratory animals, gazelles do move extremely long distances (hundreds to 1000+ kilometers total distances in a given year); however, they do not follow any kind of regular 'migratory' patterns between distinct summer and winter ranges.  We labeled this new movement pattern that we observed 'nomadism'.\n\nWe showed that these nomadic movements are likely driven by stochastic rainfall events and demonstrated that they have important conservation implications since individual fixed protected areas cannot be large enough to conserve gazelles.  The importance of unpredictability in long distance animal movements has been brought to a general audience with a publication in Science Daily that highlights our work:\n\nhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511142138.htm\n\nOur research also showed significant effects of human settlements on gazelles and we used our findings to communicate to stakeholders that new and integrative conservation strategies are needed that will pertain to the entire steppe region.  Our data were used in a report to the World Bank, and our study was instrumental for demonstrating the potential risks that fencing of new railroad projects may have on long distance movements and population viability of gazelles and other large herbivores such as khulan and goitered gazelle.
