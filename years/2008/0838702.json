 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the processes involved in communicating hurricane forecast advisories and warnings. Through a multi-method approach, a multidisciplinary team will examine: 1) the process through which advisories and warnings are developed, and the resulting content; 2) the communication channels used by  participants in this process; and 3) how at-risk coastal residents, including more vulnerable populations, comprehend and react to specific components of advisories and warnings. The ultimate goal is to improve communication of hurricane information in order to promote more effective public-protective decision making, thereby saving lives and property. \r\n\r\nA collaboration of researchers from the social and physical sciences (communication, sociology, economics, management information systems, and meteorology) will, in conjunction with key stakeholders, implement six research components in the greater Miami and Houston/Galveston areas. The first three components consist of semi-structured interviews and observations investigating message content development and communication channels with (a) National Weather Service forecasters, (b) broadcast meteorologists, and (c) emergency managers. The National Hurricane Center will produce forecasts for hypothetical storms that broadcast meteorologists and emergency managers will use to produce communication products. In the fourth component, the research team will synthesize findings from the first three components and create sample messages (text, graphics and video) for testing with the public. The fifth component examines how members of the public comprehend and react to these messages and their channel preferences, using (a) a household survey, (b) focus groups with vulnerable populations, and (d) a laboratory test including direct physiological observation. The project addresses the needs of vulnerable populations through focused research with non-English-speaking populations, the elderly, and new area residents. The sixth project component connects the findings back to meteorologists, emergency managers and other communities with the goal of helping improve hurricane warning messages and communication processes. \r\n",
