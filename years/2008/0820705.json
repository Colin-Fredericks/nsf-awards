 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe study of stereotyping and prejudice is a central research domain in social psychology. The reasons are apparent.  Social problems ranging from discrimination in housing or the workplace to genocide are based on ingroup/outgroup categorizations and the stereotypes and attitudes associated with those categories. The PI has conducted research in this area for the past 15 years and has emphasized the fact that stereotypes serve as judgment standards against which individual group members are evaluated. Indeed, the bulk of this research has documented shifting standards effects in judgment and behavior. The goal of the research proposed here is to examine the role of stereotypes and shifting judgment standards in the communication and translation of subjective language.  The present proposal outlines 4 experimental studies to examine the communication and translation of stereotype-based evaluations.  A unifying theme of the proposed research is that stereotypes exert a wide-ranging influence on social life in that they pervade our language, our interpretations of what others say and do, our decisions about others, and our thoughts about ourselves.  This research has clear possibilities for extension into domains as diverse as political and health communication.  In addition, the project research will enhance the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will work as research assistants.",
