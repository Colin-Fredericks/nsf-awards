This project integrates additional design-build experiences into the curriculum. The benefit of increased exposure to design-build activities has been demonstrated successfully by several consortiums of universities including the MEEP consortium (Learning Factory model), and the CDIO Initiative started by MIT. This project supports the purchase of Rapid Prototyping (RP) equipment and the integration of this equipment into core courses, particularly within the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. The Innovation Lab combines established facilities such as the PACE Computer Aided Design Lab, the Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop, the Fine Arts Model Shop, and the newly formed Design and Manufacturing Studio. Establishment of the GENIUS Innovation laboratory at Howard University allows the integration of practice-based curricular activities that have been successfully implemented at Penn State University, University of Washington, and others using the Learning Factory model.",
