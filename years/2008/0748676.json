 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of Punit Kohli of the University of Southern Illinois. Professor Kohli and his students will develop an integrated research and educational approach for the design and fabrication of a novel programmable nanotube-array based lithography system.  Array of individually addressed and programmable nanotubes will be fabricated in mechanical robust chips for controlled and high-throughput patterning of molecules and nanoparticles at sub-micron scale for potential applications in a wide range of fields including materials sciences, bioanalytical chemistry, medicine, and biochemistry.  Some applications of the proposed research includes probing molecular interactions for catalysis; protein-protein and protein-drug interactions; chemical- and biological-sensors; applications in the areas such as light-emitting and imaging devices, and alternative energy source devices.  The educational initiative involves the development and implementation of NSF-Encouraging Minority in Research (NSF-EMR) Program whose main objective is to encourage and involve minority students in research.  More specifically, a ten week summer program will be implemented in which one minority student and one assistant professor from the Department of Chemistry of Claflin University (a historically black college) will perform research in the PI's laboratory.  The NSF-EMR Program will provide an excellent environment for minority students and faculty to conduct interdisciplinary research in the nanoscience field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nControlled deposition and patterning of molecules and particles at will is important for the fabrication of devices used in materials, medicine, and biological sciences.  For example, deposited drug, nucleic acid (DNA), and protein molecules can used for investigating interactions with drug, protein, enzymes, and nucleic acids.  For example, these patterns can help providing information on what drug molecules would react and interact with a given nucleic acid or protein molecule.  This will help the scientists screen and evaluate drug molecules fast.  In our studies, we fabricated conical and parabolic pens for patterning, lithography, spectroscopic, and microscopic studies as well.  We have shown that applied electric field across pens can increase the deposition rate by more than three orders of magnitude over passive diffusion based patterning.  Similarly, we pattern molecules on surfaces ranging from sub-micron scale to many tens of microns using the same pen.  This latter technique is similar to a pen or paint brush that you can use to write or paint on a paper or surface of many different fonts and sizes.  This patterning technique is extremely useful for lithography for patterning of various materials (biological, metallic, non-conducting) of a range of pattern sizes without changing the pen.  We also have synthesized sensors that can detect and kill harmful bacteria in a bacteria containing solution.  Finally, we have also fabricated tiny microlenses that we have used to image features below 200 nm.\n\nThrough NSF funding, we published more than 18 peer-reviewed manuscripts; gave 14 invited talks at the US and international universities and institutes; 47 contributed talks and posters by the PI and his students at national and international conferences; more than 40 hands-on workshops, lectures, and demonstrations to K-12 students in Southern Illinois area; and eight MS and PhD degrees were awarded.\n\nWith the funding from NSF, we have submitted one patent to USPTO.  This patent deals with super-high resolution imaging using tiny lenses to resolve features below 200 nm.  We have acknowledged support from NSF for this patent application.\n\nWith the support from NSF, we have trained more than 31 high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Six of the undergraduate students, we mentored and trained in our lab were African American and two Hispanic.  Many of the undergraduate students went onto graduate programs.  Overall, the PI and his group are thrilled to motivate young men and women from underrepresented, minority, and majority groups to opt for a STEM career through hands-on demonstrations, experiments, and lectures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Punit Kohli"
