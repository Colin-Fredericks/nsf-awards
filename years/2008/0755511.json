 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University will offer undergraduates in biological sciences the opportunity to conduct comparative research in pollination biology in natural and manipulated ecosystems beginning summer 2009. During the 10-week program, each student will conduct an individual research project comparing native bee pollinator diversity and dynamic mutualistic interactions with local flora, at three ecologically diverse habitats. Participants will receive initial training on the main campus in Corvallis on research skills related to pollination biology, and on professional development as scientists. Prior to implementing their independent research project, undergraduates will learn about bees, flowers, and habitat diversity, and become skilled in identification of local bees and flowers. Professional development opportunities include gaining experience in grant writing and scientific communication. During the tenth week, participants will present their research results to a general audience at a Pollination Biology Conference. Nine students will be selected from the application pool for participation in the summer program. Applications from members of underrepresented groups are encouraged. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. and its territories. More information is available at http://oregonstate.edu/~raos/ or by contacting Sujaya Rao at 541-737-9038 or sujaya@oregonstate.edu.",
