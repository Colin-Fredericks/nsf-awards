 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Bruce Ault of University of Cincinnati, together with his graduate and undergraduate student researchers, will investigate the spectra of reaction intermediates in the gas-phase ozonolysis of alkenes and alkynes, including Criegee and Criegee-like species.  The transient species will be created in a merged beam and quickly deposited onto a cold, inert matrix, where the molecules will be studied via infrared spectroscopy. \r\n\r\nThe ozonolysis of unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules (hydrocarbon molecules which contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds) is an important processes in synthetic organic chemistry as well as in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds in the troposphere.  Research like that of Prof. Ault and his students is aimed at developing detailed, step-by-step models of the complex chemistry through which this process occurs.  This kind of knowledge can lead to improved methods for chemical synthesis or may lead to a better understanding of the chemistry of earth's atmosphere.  Prof. Ault will also continue his activities at increasing the numbers of members of underrepresented groups in chemistry through activities like his active participation in the Women in Science and Engineering Program at U. Cincinnati as well as his research mentorship of disadvantaged high school students through Project SEED of the American Chemical Society.",
