This project advances a modular, extensible framework for the programming of biological control systems, in which target expression levels can be up- or down-regulated in response to molecular inputs and the regulatory response properties can be tuned for specific applications, thereby expanding the utility of the platform to a broader range of applications. By providing a general framework through which to link diverse molecular information to cellular phenotype, RNA switches provide powerful strategies for generating new biological components exhibiting a variety of sensory, enzymatic, or regulatory activities. This project emphasizes the advancement of an enabling technology that has well-defined design strategies and that is transferable to a variety of different systems, increasing the utility to and impact on the larger scientific community. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\n\r\nEducational programs will be developed that merge research and education across different training levels, engage interdisciplinary teams of student researchers and mentors in open-ended research challenges and involve them in early phases of project definition and design, and emphasize community building and communicating research to different audiences. The programs will introduce cutting-edge engineering research to younger students and actively target involvement of underrepresented groups. The benefits of the research program to society are far-reaching as the resulting technologies will significantly impact our ability to interface with and engineer living systems.",
