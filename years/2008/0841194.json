 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first IEEE Energy 2030 Conference on Sustainable Energy Infrastructure will take place in Atlanta on November 17/18, 2008, at the Marriott Marquis hotel in downtown Atlanta. This new conference is being initiated by the IEEE, including the IEEE New Technology Directions Committee, IEEE USA, IEEE Standards Association, Power and Energy Society, and Power Electronics Society. \r\n\r\nConference themes include reduced carbon generation, smart grid and power delivery, replacement of fossil fuel consumption at the load point, improved energy efficiency, reduced energy consumption and impact of carbon cap and trade legislation on choice of technology solutions. The conference will include invited and original technical papers, industry presentations, and an exhibition providing an opportunity to showcase new and emerging technologies that will impact energy sustainability in the years ahead. \r\n\r\nIt is the objective of this award to support for the travel/registration expenses for a selected group of students and junior faculty to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nIssues related to sustainable energy are very complex, with interactions between public policy, economics, technology and social issues. This conference provides a first opportunity to bring together a diverse group of researchers, academics, industry practitioners, economists and policy makers, to begin a dialog, to identify the gaps, and to create the framework for achieving a sustainable energy infrastructure by 2030. The IEEE is uniquely positioned to help define what the transformed infrastructure is likely to look like, and to initiate the discussion on the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve success.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis conference is the first conference to focus on energy sustainability as a mid-term target, to be achieved on a global scale. This is possibly the most important issue facing society today. \r\n\r\nThe conference provides a great opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students and junior faculty to interact with leading international researchers in the area of sustainable energy infrastructures.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students and speakers from minorities and underrepresented groups.",
