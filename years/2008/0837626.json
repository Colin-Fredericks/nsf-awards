 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)  Spatial thinking can be characterized as the ability to solve problems that require both external and mental representations of spatial information while engaging reasoning abilities that generate information not provided in the original problem. This project includes: (1) understanding the nature of visual penetration, a form of spatial thinking in the geosciences; (2)  creating a learning module that uses three-dimensional interactive animation (3DIA) to support the acquisition of visual penetration skills by all students; and (3) evaluating the effectiveness of the learning module within the context of an introductory laboratory course in geology. This project builds upon the findings of a prior CCLI project that developed an instructional module designed to teach students how to interpret topographic maps and visualize topographic profiles. The use of this instructional module contributed to improvements in performance and learning. This project is examining the nature of spatial thinking in tasks involving geologic blocks and involves developing and evaluating an instructional module designed to improve students' abilities to perform those tasks. The same approach is being taken to develop 3DIA modules designed to improve visual penetration ability and subsurface visualization for a college-level geology course.  The results of this project are adding to the knowledge in the fields of cognitive science, multimedia learning, science education, and differential psychology. This project is helping to advance our understanding of the role that technology plays in aiding persons disadvantaged by low spatial ability in domains where spatial problem solving is central. As those domains readily exist in STEM areas, the outcome of the proposed work contributes to the improvement of delivery of undergraduate instruction in those areas. Because the proposed work uses low-cost technologies, the potential for widespread distribution is high. The approach being used to develop 3DIA learning modules can be applied to any domain in which spatial thinking is used (e.g., anatomy, chemistry, and mathematics).",
