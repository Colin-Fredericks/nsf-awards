 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Hope College to purchase an automated genetic analyzer for research and training in evolutionary biology, microbiology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics.  The instrument, which will be used by both faculty and students, will significantly impact multiple areas of research and teaching.  First, it will be used to collect DNA sequence data for evolutionary studies of the pineapple family, whose species have been under increasing risk of extinction due to extensive habitat loss.  Second, it will be used to examine genome evolution in the primitive eukaryote Giardia lamblia, the parasite that causes Giardiasis.  Third, the instrument will be used to learn more about how genes are regulated by fatty acids through a study in yeast.  Lastly, it will be used in a comparative analysis of virus genomes as part of the HHMI-funded Phage Genomics Research Initiative\r\n\r\nThe automated genetic analyzer will have broad impacts by helping to train Hope College undergraduate students and NSF-REU students in modern scientific techniques, thereby encouraging them to pursue careers in science.  It will strengthen Hope?s HHMI-funded program in phage genomics, which is an initiative targeted at retaining outstanding freshmen in science, and it will be used to foster faculty-student collaborative research in plant evolution, microbial genomics, cell biology, and biochemistry.  With its service in research laboratories as well as in several different classes, the instrument will provide at least 100 undergraduate students per year with hands-on experience in sample preparation, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing, and data analysis and interpretation.\r\n",
