 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work to be carried out under this award will develop the needed infrastructure and apply it to study realistic compact binary systems that can give rise to gamma ray burst phenomena. To this end the required physics modules will be incorporated in a new infrastructure framework able to exploit the new generation of high performance computers. The implementations of this infrastructure will allow study of  the system in depth, with the goal of predicting and interpreting aspects of observations of electromagnetic and gravitational\u00a0waves. \r\n\r\nThis work serves to advance computational and numerical techniques  for an exciting scientific problem, as well as the creation and dissemination of advanced tools for distributed computing. The research to be carried out has as its goal to give an unprecedented description of possible (short) gamma ray burst systems and to develop a new computational model to efficiently utilize petascale computing. Finally, this study involves the training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates.",
