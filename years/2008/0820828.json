 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA sequence is the primary means by which information is propagated from generation to generation.  However, information can also be propagated as chemical modifications of both DNA and proteins, such as histones, that are associated with DNA.  Heritable variation not associated with changes in the primary DNA sequence is called epigenetic variation. What makes epigenetic variation particularly intriguing is that it involves changes that can be both heritable and reversible. The rules governing how and why those changes occur remain poorly understood.  Transposons, or \"jumping genes\", exhibit an extraordinary degree of easily identifiable epigenetic variation, making them ideal models for understanding its causes and consequences.  Among transposons, Mutator elements in maize have proved to be particularly useful.  Using a series of genetic resources, particularly a maize line that carries a single active Mutator transposon, it has been possible to induce and propagate a wide variety of distinct epigenetic states.   The goal of this project is to determine the molecular correlates to each of these states.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ways in which epigenetic states can change over time, either over the course of the development of an individual plant, or over the course of multiple generations. These data are meant to complement global analysis of DNA and histone modification by providing functional assessments of particular patterns of these modifications in the context of a well-defined model system.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A sophisticated understanding of the means by which epigenetic information is retained, stored, inherited and altered has implications for fields as diverse as development, ecology, human disease and evolutionary theory.  In addition, because the Mutator system is a primary means by which genes are mutated in maize, an ability to modulate Mutator activity will benefit the entire maize community.  Material and information having to do with the use of Mu killer will be made freely available via web sites (http://tinyurl.com/6xftvh and http://tinyurl.com/59fdwo), the Maize Newsletter and the Maize Cooperation Stock Center.  The project will benefit from participation in project SEED, a program designed to expose historically under-represented high school students to research environments.  Through a collaboration with Berkeley High School, the project will also host two students as interns each summer.  Each student will work in close collaboration with the primary investigator on a specific problem, and each will present the results of their work at the end of each field season.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost of the DNA in most plants is composed of transposable elements (TEs).  TEs are stretches of DNA than can replicate and move within a genome.  Although they are important sources of variation, TEs can also cause damage to genes by inserting into them.  This has lead to the evolution of a sophisticated \"immune system\" whose function is to detect and silence these molecular parasites.\n\nTwo kinds of biochemical changes are associated with TE silencing.  One involves modifications of histone tails (histones are proteins around which DNA is wrapped), and the other involves the addition of a methyl group to cytosine residues (one of the bases that make up DNA).  These changes result in transcriptional silencing, which prevents TEs from producing transcript (mRNA) that would normally be translated into proteins that cause TEs to move.  Once these changes have been introduced they can be propagated over many generations.\n\nThe TE we study in maize, MuDR, is normally highly active, but it can be heritably silenced by a derivative of MuDR called Mu killer (Muk). The Muk transcript forms a \"hairpin\", which is composed of double-stranded RNA.  In plants, and many other organisms, double-stranded RNAs like that produced by Muk are processed into small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then use to direct DNA methylation and histone modification at sequences that match the siRNAs.\n\nOur goal for this project was to use silencing of MuDR by Muk as a model to better understand how new epigenetic information is added to genomes. This has important practical implications because many of the same biochemical pathways that regulate TEs can also regulate genes important for plant traits such as disease and stress response.\n\nExpression of the two genes encoded by MuDR (mudrA and mudrB) is controlled by sequences at the ends of the element, the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs).  We found that the TIR driving expression of mudrA (TIRA) becomes heavily methylated in the presence of Muk, and that the histones associated with TIRA are modified into their repressive form.\n\nWe found a surprising degree of variation in these modifications as plants carrying MuDR and Muk develop.  Maize plants undergo a transition from juvenile to reproductively competent adult growth, a process called vegetative phase change. We found that all of the silencing marks were present in juvenile and adult leaves, but were entirely absent in leaves at the transition stage.  This transient loss of silencing turned out to be the result of the loss of transcript from a Lbl1, a gene that is known to be involved in suppression of viruses as well as a number of plant genes, some of which are involved in stress response.  This suggests that the maize plant undergoes a dramatic shift in epigenetic regulation of many genes during this important transitional stage of development.

Our data suggests that this mechanism may also be mediating multi-generational silencing of our TE (and perhaps some genes) as well.\n\nCollectively, our data demonstrates that a single TE in..."
