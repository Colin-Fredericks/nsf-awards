 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a self sustaining two-week summer course on the modeling and measurement of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions. The course provides students and faculty with a solid foundation for addressing a very critical component of regional to continental scale processes. It introduces earth-systems researchers to the tools, theories and approaches required to evaluate current trends and predict future patterns of mass and energy exchanges between ecosystems and the atmosphere. The course represents an excellent combination of morning lectures (focusing on theory) and afternoon 'hands on' sessions in which students will make some limited measurements, analyze data, and use advanced models. Faculty for the course will be drawn from the top researchers in the fields of plant physiological ecology, biometeorology, biogeochemistry and atmospheric physics. \r\n\r\nThis course differs from existing courses in emphasizing theory and modeling. As such, it has the likelihood of longer term impact than existing courses and is clearly critical in preparing the next generation of scientists to use the NEON infrastructure.\r\n",
