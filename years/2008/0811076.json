 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ADVANCE IT-Start proposed project, ?Establishing the Foundation for Future\r\nOrganizational Reform and Transformation @ RIT? (EFFORT@RIT) is a two-year study across RIT?s four Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) colleges. engineering and science at Rochester Institute of Technology. In order to achieve our mission, the goal of our institutional transformation start-up project is to develop an evidence-based approach toaddress factors resulting in the under-representation of women in STEM faculty positions at RIT. Objectives supporting achievement of this goal include: 1) Identify barriers for current women faculty in regards to rank, tenure and leadership role progression, 2) Examine faculty recruitment patterns in terms of gender equity, and 3) Establish how well RIT does in addressing these factors when compared with the competition. Through initiatives currently underway, from the Women in Engineering Program?s tremendous growth to the President?s launching of an Equity Scorecard program, RIT has gathered momentum to position itself for institutional change in regards to gender inclusiveness and equity within faculty ranks. The proposed NSF project will allow RIT to build upon this energy and accelerate the transformation process through careful data driven studies of our current position.\r\n\r\nOur proposed activities fall into assessment and evaluation general categories using: a) current climate with respect to gender inclusiveness, and b) benchmark data comparing RIT against peer institutions in regards to policies, hiring/retention/promotion patterns. The project team is a blend of dynamic leaders from the four STEM colleges, who share an active\r\ninterest and agenda related to women in STEM. Together, the group creates a strong, well-integrated core with high levels of synergy who will work with the Advisory Board in overseeing all aspects of the EFFORT@RIT project.\r\n\r\nEFFORT@RIT assessment and evaluation results will be disseminated broadly.\r\nFirmly grounded with clear organization, innovative assessment tools, and seasoned leadership, EFFORT@RIT will inform RIT of necessary institutional transformation activities.\r\n",
