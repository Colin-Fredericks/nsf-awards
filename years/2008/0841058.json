 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nThe objective of this effort is to investigate the feasibility of a highly sensitive microsystem for chemical sensing based on an indium phosphide substrate.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThis proposal explores the possibility of optical detection of chemicals using an integrated system on an indium phosphide substrate.  It will include a laser source, integrated directly with a microcantilever and photodetectors, that will permit the precise tracking of the resonant frequency of the cantilever.  Functionalized coatings on the cantilever will be used to absorb chemicals from the environment and this interaction will change the mass, and consequently, the resonant frequency, of the cantilever.  The system implementation will include a servo-control circuit.  The integration of a micromechanical and photonic system is expected to yield very high sensitivity.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nThis project has substantial interdisciplinary scope, encompassing photonics, micromechanics, and chemical sensing.  In addition to its research outcome, it promises to be a good vehicle for teaching students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  The research results will be disseminated through classroom instruction and workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
