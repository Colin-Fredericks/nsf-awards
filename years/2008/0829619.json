 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Conceptual Development and Planning project integrates sustainability concepts throughout undergraduate computing education.   An interdisciplinary team of faculty from engineering, computer science, and cognitive science plans to test, develop, implement, and evaluate an educational model for sustainability integration into the curriculum.  The team plans to develop models, projects and courses for beginning and upper level students, including a new course in green computing. The group envisions a focus on the power consumption of large data centers aspects of sustainability. The goal is to prepare students with the computing competencies, multi-disciplinary knowledge, and computational thinking methodologies to create a sustainable future. \r\n  \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the importance and currency of the topic and clear need for such changes in computing education to prepare the upcoming generation of computing professionals.  The cross-disciplinary project team includes researchers with significant expertise in both the computing discipline research that underlies the implementation and in educational innovation. The project has the potential for providing new research models in an emerging field critical for future generations as well as the current one.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project lie in the potential to address changing demands on computing professionals and to attract a diverse audience of students. The project has the potential to provide innovative models for transforming computing education that are of value to other colleges and universities across the nation.",
