 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSR-DMSS, SM: Design and Evaluation of a Scalable Meta-Event\r\nDissemination System\r\n\r\nProject Abstract:\r\n\r\nEvent dissemination systems offer a powerful middleware for\r\ndistributed applications such as electronic trading platforms, news\r\naggregators, and network intrusion detection systems. Such systems are\r\nusually based on the publish-subscribe paradigm: published events are\r\ndelivered to clients who have a supplied a matching\r\nsubscription. While most current publish-subscribe systems support\r\nsubscriptions that evaluate to true/false on a per-event basis,\r\nemerging applications need support for subscriptions to higher level\r\n\"meta-events\", which correspond to combinations of basic events. The\r\nchallenge in tracking such subscriptions is that there is no single\r\nevent, when processed in isolation, permits the evaluation of a\r\nsubscription to true or false.\r\n\r\nThis project designs, implements and evaluates an event dissemination\r\nsystem that supports tracking of meta-events. The system converts\r\nuser-defined subscriptions into \"triggers\", and efficiently maintains\r\nthe state of the triggers using algorithms inspired by the literature\r\non data stream processing. The system scales with increasing numbers\r\nof subscriptions through merging triggers by identifying commonalities\r\nbetween them, and through indexing triggers for fast detection of\r\nmatching subscriptions for events. The system is evaluated using an\r\ninternet-scale testbed, such as Planetlab. Such a meta-event\r\ndissemination system will provide a more expressive interface to the\r\ndesigner of distributed and web applications, thus transforming the\r\nway in which distributed applications are authored. This is expected\r\nto impact the application of information technology in various fields\r\nsuch as healthcare, finance, and security. The project enhances\r\nundergraduate and graduate education through strengthening the\r\nfreshmen engineering course in Electrical and Computer Engineering and\r\nthrough developing a strong algorithmic foundation for research\r\nstudents in networking and distributed computing.\r\n",
