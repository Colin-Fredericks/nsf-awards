 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: PRACTICAL ALGORITHMS FOR NEXT GENERATION AIR TRANSPORTATION \r\nSYSTEMS\r\n\r\nThe core insight in this proposal is that by analyzing the large amounts of weather and airline data, we can \r\n(1) use weather forecasts to determine schedules that are robust to uncertainty, (2) design market-based mechanisms that manage airline competition for scarce resources, and (3) incorporate environmental considerations into our optimization framework.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThis proposal simultaneously addresses three challenges: robustness, competing entities and \r\nenvironmental concerns. Doing so will improve on the status quo, leading to novel optimization \r\nalgorithms and market-based mechanisms that can handle increasing air traffic loads. Understanding \r\nweather phenomena and their effect on operations will allow better strategic and tactical control of air traffic. Equitable resource allocation algorithms will encourage truthful reporting of operational data by the airlines, provide incentives for information sharing, and improve passenger experience. Green air traffic management algorithms will support increased air traffic loads with a tolerable environmental impact. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: \r\nThe results of this research will offer a more efficient, robust and safe air transportation system by \r\naccommodating regulatory constraints, and shape air transportation policy. Collaborations with MIT Lincoln Laboratory and NASA Ames Research Center will enable the implementation of the results of this research through the development of decision support tools for air traffic controllers. The education plan includes the development of a new MIT course on optimization and control techniques applied to infrastructure systems. The plan also includes the development of interactive web-based materials to demystify air traffic control to the general public, and to educate K-12 students on an important engineering challenge.\r\n",
