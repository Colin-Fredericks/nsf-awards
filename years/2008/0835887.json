 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory effort at Savannah State University will develop and test the framework of an innovative Business of Engineering Education Model (BEEM) which facilitates understanding and measuring the impacts of teaching, mentoring, and advisement upon student outcomes such as retention, graduation, and career success. After research to develop the model is complete, a pilot test of the model will be conducted for a selected number of K-12 middle and high school students, engineering faculty, and engineering students at the freshman and sophomore levels. Data from the pilot test will be compared to model predictions to test the accuracy of the model. Several workshops will be held, and dissemination of results and findings will use a dedicated web site for the business model and publications. This project will be the first step toward the development of a sustainable and effective full-scale business model that will be available for widespread use by other members of the engineering education community. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the number and diversity of engineering students is necessary to provide the technical workforce needed for the future. This project will take steps toward understanding factors that influence retention and graduation rates from a business model perspective which will be developed in collaboration with K-12, higher education, and business/industry partners.\r\n",
