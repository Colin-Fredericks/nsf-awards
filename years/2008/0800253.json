The current  state of knowledge about  this problem,  particularly counting or  bounding the numbers of  solutions, will be the focus  of a workshop to  be held at the  Bernoulli  Center  in   the  EPFL  (Swiss  Federal  Technological Institute) in Lausanne,  Switzerland the week of April  21 to April 25 in  2008.  This  is embedded  within a  semester long  program  at the Bernoulli  Center  on  real  and tropical  algebraic  geometry.   This project  will fund  the participation  of scientists  from  the United States at this workshop.\r\n\r\nIt is  notoriously difficult to extract any information about real solutions  to  equations  without  first solving  them completely  by finding all  complex solutions.  Recent breakthroughs have led to new insights about  bounds, both  upper and lower  for the number of real solutions to  some structured systems of  polynomial equations.  There are also new algorithms for only computing the real solutions.  At the same  time,  a  better  understanding has  arisen  about  average-case behavior,  and other  scientists have  begun to  apply  these results.  This workshop will  be small (about 20 participants)  and very focused on  current  developments  and  future prospects  for  this  important problem of understanding the real solutions to polynomial equations.\r\n",
