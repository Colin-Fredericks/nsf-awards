 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pawluk\r\n0754629\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphical visual representations of objects and scenes have always been important for conveying unfamiliar information: from teaching a young child new vocabulary words, to introducing a worker to new machinery or devices, to learning about a faraway city to go to on vacation. These representations are also very valuable in creative environments, such as when artisans must imagine design patterns or engineers new devices they are developing. Unfortunately, for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, there are a dearth of tools and appropriate representations to provide them with access to this type of graphical information, which is commonly available in their environments. This lack of access affects these individuals beginning at a very young age and progresses cumulatively over their lifetime. It likely explains, at least in part, the very high unemployment rate of 74% for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, which is significantly above the rate for those with other disabilities.  The most frequent method of representing 2-D graphical information for individuals who are blind or visually impaired is the use of static raised-line drawings. However, this method is very poor in relaying information in unconstrained tasks, such as understanding unfamiliar objects and object scenes. More recently, a more effective, textured-enriched graphical representation has been proposed as an alternative. This method uses texture to encode critical picture information (i.e., the separation of objects into their subparts, and the orientation of their parts) that is otherwise very difficult to obtain. The general objective of this proposal is to develop a system to maximize the transfer of information using these textured-enriched graphics by developing: (1) a cost-effective, portable and easy to maintain dynamic tactile device capable of presenting a range of textures; and (2) an appropriate texture set to use on the device for encoding purposes, which maximizes its discriminability even under tactile masking and adaptation effects. Both the device and the textures will be designed to maintain the advantages of texture enriched graphics, over raised-line drawings, of being able to immediately provide encoded information on contact (through texture) and in parallel across the fingers, while avoiding the costs and bulkiness of static production methods. The display and texture set will also be developed with feedback from the community of people who are blind or visually impaired, and validated experimentally.  The proposed research will assist in the development of an active partnership between the PI and the community of people who are blind or visually impaired, and their teachers, through several organizations. The PI?s laboratory will further be developed as a place where students who are blind or visually impaired can effectively engage in research, whether for this project or any other. This project will also include training of both graduate and undergraduate students in understanding the needs of the community of people who are blind or visually impaired.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis research project was expected to address several goals.  The first goal was to develop a moveable hand held device that is tracked on a table and provides multi-contact tactile feedback on a finger pad which is cost-effective, easy to manufacture, easy to maintain and easy to use.  Unfortunately regular computer mice cannot be used for this purpose due to their large inaccuracy in describing absolute position.  We produced a device under $400 with off-the-shelf parts that provides significantly more accurate tactile feedback, can produce a range of vibrations or texture-like patterns and multiple amplitudes.  The ability to display texture like patterns is important as it has been shown that the use of texture in presenting 2-D diagrams haptically is critical for their understanding and greatly improves performance.\n\n In order to choose an appropriate texture set for use with the display, two key questions were asked: (1) how does the perception of roughness (a fundamental component of texture and the most commonly used) vary on tactile displays compared to using the bare finger or a hand held probe; and (2) how does the perception of roughness change over time and how does this compare to using a bare finger or a probe.  Answering the first question is important for the practical generation of textures.  Answering the second question is important as tactile sensors in the skin are known to adapt (decrease in sensitivity) to vibrations applied over time.  It has\nbeen speculated that this would negatively affect the performance of a tactile display. \n\nWe found that roughness created by spatially varying 1-D square waves (a simple, mathematically defined texture) was an approximately linear, decreasing function of Groove width, and an inverted U-shape function of Ridge width. This suggests that both these parameters are relevant to creating differentiable textures on this type of display (this was in contrast to the bare finger and a probe, where Ridge width has negligible impact).   We also found that the area of contact (i.e., how many pins were activated) also had a significant effect.  This will be an important consideration for diagram design as this means that a thin line or a large area with the same physical \"texture\" could be perceived as different roughness. The results of the adaptation experiment comparing adaptation to spatially varying 1-D square waves for the bare finger, a probe and our virtual display showed that our matrix display, at least in response to the particular texture stimuli used, is not very susceptible to adaptation.  This provides significant support that adaptation will be no worse than that already experienced by users of paper tactile graphics.\n\nThree graduate students and six undergraduate students were supported on this grant in full or in part.  All were trained in understanding the issues of individuals who are blind or visually impaired through our partner organizations who provide services for individuals who are blind or visually impaired and the individuals themselves, and in developing assistive technology.  This is intended to increase the development capacity of assistive technology.  The graduate students contributed to the main body of research.  However, undergraduate students made some significant contributions.  The most important of these is that they found that the device shows considerable\npromise in being used as a virtual, full-page Braille display by presenting\neach Braille character statically within a given physical area.  This also allows the Braille to be easily distinguishable from graphical information, a problem that exists for physical, paper diagrams.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dianne Pawluk"
