 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe emergence of low-cost, highly-autonomous vehicles equipped with control, communication, sensing\r\nand computing capabilities is paving the way for the deployment of mobile sensor networks in a wide range\r\nof applications. Examples include environmental monitoring, oceanographic research, high-stress, rapid de-\r\nployment operations, and health monitoring of civil infrastructure. In these envisioned applications, many\r\ncritical processes occur at temporal and spatial scales that cannot be effectively sampled with current ap-\r\nproaches. Mobile sensor networks hold the promise to provide the rich, in-situ spatio-temporal data needed to\r\nrevolutionize the detection, estimation, and monitoring of dynamic natural phenomena. Controlled mobility\r\nintegrated with distributed data fusion capabilities will enable sensor networks to provide broad spatial cov-\r\nerage, react to short-lived events in real time, and track key processes that occur away from fixed sites.\r\nThe state of the art in distributed data fusion only considers static networks, and therefore is not directly\r\napplicable to ad-hoc, dynamically changing mobile networks. The state of the art in motion coordination\r\nof networked systems has only developed centralized approaches to estimation and signal processing. As a\r\nresult of these limitations, current mobile networks are too rigid to cope with the small-scale features and\r\nthe rapid evolution characteristic of many key physical processes.\r\nIntellectual Merit. The major objective of this project is the synthesis of scalable coordination algorithms\r\nfor mobile networks performing spatially-distributed sensing tasks. Distributed strategies that maximize the\r\ninformation content of collected data will allow future sensor networks to adapt to changing conditions in a\r\nrapid, autonomous and optimal fashion. To make this vision a reality, this project will address the distributed,\r\nin-situ aggregation of data collected by mobile networks in dynamic scenarios, and the information-driven,\r\nscalable coordination of the network mobility to optimally perform the required sensing tasks.\r\nThe research plan will adopt an ambitious integrative approach composed of three thrusts: (i) a sound,\r\nunifying framework where different cooperative strategies can be rigorously formalized and compared. This\r\neffort will facilitate the modular design of cooperative strategies for complex sensing tasks via the combination\r\nof simpler algorithms performing more basic objectives; (ii) system-theoretic tools to evaluate the correctness,\r\nrobustness and scalability properties of coordination algorithms. To assess the optimal trade-offs between\r\nperformance and energy allocation in combined communication, motion, and sensing scenarios, this research\r\nwill evaluate complexity measures for cooperative strategies and spatially-distributed tasks; and (iii) novel,\r\nsystematic design methodologies that allow to break down global sensing tasks into local objectives for\r\nindividual agents. This effort seeks to synthesize fault tolerant, scalable algorithms that sit at the limits on\r\nthe achievable performance, operational time and energy consumption of mobile networks conducting data\r\nfusion and estimation tasks. The innovative technical approach builds on a set of very promising results by\r\nthe PI and collaborators, hinging upon disciplines such as cooperative and topology control, automata and\r\nhybrid systems theory, robotics, wireless communications, and operations research.\r\nBroader Impacts. The techniques developed in this work will help design autonomous and efficient mobile\r\nnetworks performing critical tasks in homeland security, industrial processes, health care and the environment.\r\nThe proposed research will lead to crosscutting and synergistic technologies applicable to a wide range\r\nof scenarios where real-time information gathering and data exploitation are important. The results will\r\nbe transferred to oceanographic and disaster management applications in collaboration with the Monterey\r\nBay Aquarium Research Institute, and NASA Ames, respectively.\r\nThe proposed educational activities are integrated into the research plan and consist of the following\r\ninitiatives: (i) involvement of undergraduate students in research via design projects, summer internships\r\nand engineering research demonstrations in a newly-created laboratory environment; (ii) development of an\r\nundergraduate course on \\Motion Coordination\" and a graduate course on \\Cooperative Mobile Networks\";\r\n(iii) offering of a course on control and robotics in the California State Summer School for Mathematics and\r\nScience for high-school students, and expository and research talks at community colleges near UCSC. Re-\r\nsearch and educational materials will be made available to high-school teachers, the scientific community and\r\nthe general public via an interactive website. Regular activities for broad dissemination (journal publications,\r\nconference presentations, lecture notes) will also be pursued. The evaluation of the educational activities,\r\nbased on the educational process and the students' outcomes, will be done in collaboration with the UCSC\r\nCenter for Teaching Excellence. Special attention will be paid to integrate inclusive teaching practices into\r\nthe daily educational activity to address retention issues concerning underrepresented students.\r\n",
