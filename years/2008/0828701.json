While theory has predicted unusual transmission, reflection, and emission with negative index materials, little has been done on the design and fabrication of metamaterials for tailoring thermal radiative properties. A new type of metamaterial is proposed that consists of a layer of periodic grating coupled with an opaque metallic film via a dielectric spacer. By realizing diamagnetic response and by coupling a negative permeability material with a negative permittivity material, this structure can tailor the emission and absorption properties. Rigorous modeling as well as an effective medium theory will be developed to study the interaction of thermal radiation with the fabricated nanostructures. Infrared spectrometry and emissometry will be employed to verify the theoretical predictions.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This transformative research will result in novel material structures and a better understanding of the electromagnetic wave interaction with complex materials. Moreover, this project will provide an unprecedented way of designing radiation emitters for thermophotovoltaic systems and absorbers for infrared radiation detectors. \r\nBroader Impacts: Students involved in this multidisciplinary project will gain fundamental knowledge of electromagnetic wave and thermal radiation, as well as experience in micro/nanofabrication and spectroscopic experiments. By encouraging underrepresented students to participate in research, this project will increase the opportunity for women and minorities in engineering. Undergraduate curriculum will be enhanced by the proposed Nanoscale Energy Transport course. The PI will organize conferences and give seminars to serve the community as well as to educate the public about nanoscale thermal engineering.",
