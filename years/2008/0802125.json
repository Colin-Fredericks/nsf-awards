Jena, University of Notre Dame\r\n\r\nObjective: The objective of this research is to invstigate whether thin strips of graphene of varying widths can be used to mimic semiconductor heterostructures which form the backbone of many high-performance electronic devices.  The approach is to pattern graphene into nanoscale ribbons of varying widths and to investigate the charge tranport and switching properties of such lateral bandgap-engineered devices.  Using a combination of theoretical modeling and carefully designed experiments, it is proposed that the device potential of lateral bandgap engineering in graphene nanoribbons will be investigated, leading to the demonstration of the basic building blocks of complex electronic circuits such as rectifiers and switches.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research proposed here is expected to lead to the development of methods to use graphene nanoribbons in a wide range of applications such as transistors, and long-wavelength optical emitters and photodetectors.  Since carbon nanostructures are not constrained by lattice-matching requirements, they can be built on any substrates such as glass or flexible/strechable substrates.  Their superior electronic properties and low-cost is expected to lead to future generations of large-area electronic, optoelectronic, and sensor technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project supports two undergraduate students and two graduate students.  An outreach program comprises an on-site experimental demonstration of nanoscale scanning probe techniques for local high-school students with the collaboration with a high-school teacher.  The dissemination of research results by publications and presentations at conferences, and its inclusion in courses taught by the investigators will ensure the outreach of the research proposed to the widest possible audience.\r\n",
