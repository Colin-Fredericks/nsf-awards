 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has been a very active field in recent years. Two\r\ntheoretical techniques, S-matrix theory and effective field theory, allow the systematic\r\ntreatment of many-electron systems, with the former being most useful for highly\r\ncharged ions and the latter for neutral, few-electon atoms.\r\nGiven the success of the theory, another important direction the field is going in is the\r\nuse of the high precision of both experiment and QED theory to make atoms testing\r\ngrounds for non-QED physics. The most striking use has been parity nonconservation\r\n(PNC) in heavy atoms, and another important use is in nuclear physics.\r\nA first major focus of this research will be in the fine structure of helium as a way of\r\ndetermining the fine structure constant. The extreme complexity of the electron g-2\r\napproach, recently shown by an error found in Kinoshita?s calculations, indicates the\r\nvalue of an alternative approach. Independent checks of a recent calculation of\r\nPachucki are proposed.\r\nA second focus will involve research on highly charged ions, continuing a long standing\r\ncollaboration with K.T. Cheng of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Completion\r\nof calculations of the spectra of sodiumlike ions along with extension to copperlike ions\r\nis proposed. Hyperfine splitting in highly charged ions will also be studied.\r\nA third research area is recoil corrections. The treatment of recoil in a highly relativistic\r\nsystem has been treated only by one other group. G. Adkins and I have been working\r\non an independent approach to the problem, and continuation of this research is\r\nproposed. Another use of recoil techniques is in the treatment of photon-Z boson\r\nexchange diagrams, which have a binding singularity that has not yet been evaluated in\r\na Bethe-Salpeter framework.\r\nA final goal, with broader impact, is writing a textbook on bound state quantum field\r\ntheory. Most of the techniques used in the research described above have not yet been\r\nwell described in textbook form, and doing this, along with giving a much needed update\r\nof Bethe and Salpeter's monograph, is the intention of this work.",
