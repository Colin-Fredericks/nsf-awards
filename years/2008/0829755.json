 "awd_abstract_narration": "IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations & exhibits.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to seek l funding for TCPP to allow 20 awards (at $500 per student), to be split evenly between IPDPS student author and inaugural TCPP PhD forum travel support.\r\nThis would particularly allow several underrepresented women and minorities to be awarded travel support, increasing the likelihood of their participation. Each award will provide up to $500 for reimbursement of actual travel, accommodations, and registration expenses.\r\nIn making these awards, the TCPP gives priority to individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend and to students presenting their own published work.\r\n",
