 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThe Linux Integration Networking Connections (LINCS) project is helping to meet the need for Linux technicians by preparing students to have a strong practical and theoretical knowledge base, to adapt to technological advances, and to participate in creating new information technology solutions using Linux and other open source technologies.  The project has four key elements: (1) a 2+2+2 articulation plan beginning in high school, transitioning to a community college, and completing a bachelor's degree in IT; (2) a distance education option with curricula based in part on workplace competencies identified by business partners; (3) active learning opportunities using Linux clustering and virtualization that provide students access to remotely served networks on demand from almost any location and platform; and (4) a cross-institutional open source course management system to provide students with consistent distance learning experiences and greater opportunities for interactions among and between students and teachers at participating institutions.\r\n\r\nThe LINCS project improves student learning in computer science and engineering education programs by increasing student access to hands-on application experiences through remote access virtual labs.  It also increases access to a geographically diverse population of potential students, many of whom would not otherwise be able to participate.  The project leverages already established strengths of the participating institutions with a long history of collaborations with the business community.\r\n\r\nThe resulting prototype being developed serves as a national model for technology education because it creates an educational pathway into the IT field and supports life long learning opportunities.  A community advisory board comprised of IT business partners plays an integral role in the project, including: identifying necessary skill sets; field-testing of course content; and providing field experience opportunities for students. All products (learning units, curricula, infrastructure design, and best practices) are being made available on the LINCS wiki site to facilitate replication by other institutions.",
