 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research involves the development of automated negotiation protocols \r\nfor autonomous agents in negotiation networks, where each agent can only \r\nnegotiate with few selected neighbors. That is, we develop agents that can \r\ncarry out any number of simultaneous negotiations with other selfish agents. \r\nFor example, they could be routers in the Internet negotiating over which \r\npackets to route and which to drop, or purchasing agents in a supply chain \r\ndeciding what to buy and at what price, or web services deciding who to \r\nprovide services for and at what price, or sensors in a sensor network \r\ndeciding which measurements to make and who to forward the results. Our \r\nresearch involves building the negotiation strategies for selfish rational \r\nagents that individuals and companies will want to use, along with the \r\nnegotiation protocols that ensure the agents'\r\ninteractions result in efficient global resource allocations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of negotiation networks combines features of characteristic \r\nform games and bargaining games from game theory, combinatorial auctions \r\nand distributed mechanism design from Economics, network exchange theory \r\nfrom Sociology, and distributed algorithm design from computer science. \r\nOur research brings together results from these disparate fields into \r\none framework and provides algorithmic solutions for the dynamic, \r\ndistributed problem of resource allocation among self-interested parties, \r\nin contrast with game theory and Economics' solutions which are typically \r\nsteady-state axiomatic solutions. Success in this research is potentially \r\ntransformative as it will provide the foundation for the engineering of \r\nprotocols and efficient algorithms for distributed resource allocation, \r\nwhich is a pervasive problem in our ever-growing highly-interconnected \r\nsociety.",
