 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) has been a very active field in recent years. Two\r\ntheoretical techniques, S-matrix theory and effective field theory, allow the systematic\r\ntreatment of many-electron systems, with the former being most useful for highly\r\ncharged ions and the latter for neutral, few-electon atoms.\r\nGiven the success of the theory, another important direction the field is going in is the\r\nuse of the high precision of both experiment and QED theory to make atoms testing\r\ngrounds for non-QED physics. The most striking use has been parity nonconservation\r\n(PNC) in heavy atoms, and another important use is in nuclear physics.\r\nA first major focus of this research will be in the fine structure of helium as a way of\r\ndetermining the fine structure constant. The extreme complexity of the electron g-2\r\napproach, recently shown by an error found in Kinoshita?s calculations, indicates the\r\nvalue of an alternative approach. Independent checks of a recent calculation of\r\nPachucki are proposed.\r\nA second focus will involve research on highly charged ions, continuing a long standing\r\ncollaboration with K.T. Cheng of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Completion\r\nof calculations of the spectra of sodiumlike ions along with extension to copperlike ions\r\nis proposed. Hyperfine splitting in highly charged ions will also be studied.\r\nA third research area is recoil corrections. The treatment of recoil in a highly relativistic\r\nsystem has been treated only by one other group. G. Adkins and I have been working\r\non an independent approach to the problem, and continuation of this research is\r\nproposed. Another use of recoil techniques is in the treatment of photon-Z boson\r\nexchange diagrams, which have a binding singularity that has not yet been evaluated in\r\na Bethe-Salpeter framework.\r\nA final goal, with broader impact, is writing a textbook on bound state quantum field\r\ntheory. Most of the techniques used in the research described above have not yet been\r\nwell described in textbook form, and doing this, along with giving a much needed update\r\nof Bethe and Salpeter's monograph, is the intention of this work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n Research was carried out which leads to understanding and control of the dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, including electrons escaping from atoms, trapped atoms, ultracold gases, and molecules.  These systems obey the laws of quantum mechanics, which are abstract and sometimes counterintuitive.  The methods we use are called \"semiclassical\";   this means that we use classical mechanics (Newton\u00c6s Laws), and incorporate just enough quantum theory to get an accurate description of the behavior of atomic systems.  Our methods are more intuitive than quantum theory, they are often far more efficient and effective, and they take advantage of the new knowledge and the insights that arise from modern classical mechanics.  Our work is unusual, and appreciated by the scientific community in the US, because these semiclassical methods are often used in Europe and China, but are not so commonly used here.\n\n We have used these methods to describe the structure of highly-excited bound states of atoms in strong  electric and magnetic fields, escape of electrons from atoms in electric and magnetic fields, escape of particles or waves from a vase-shaped enclosure, and to describe transport of ultracold atoms from one reservoir to another.  Our calculations support experimental measurements being carried out in Lyon, France, in Minnesota, and new experimental measurements being set up by a young faculty member at William and Mary. \n\nTwelve papers were published in front-line journals, and several more are being prepared.  Two students completed PhD\u00c6s, two more are progressing toward a PhD, and several undergraduates also contributed to the research.\n\n Broader Implications\n\nControl of quantum systems is one of the \"grand challenges\" of modern physics. This research cuts across many disciplines in physics, mathematics and chemistry. Our study of ionization of atoms in fields is directly connected to theories of chaotic transport and theories of stability of dynamical systems. The general outline of the theory was first developed by Poincare to study the gravitational three-body problem (moon-earth-sun or earth-Jupiter-sun).
