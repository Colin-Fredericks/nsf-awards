 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research to be conducted by Professor Cynthia Zoski at her research laboratories at the New Mexico State University, and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program in the Division of Chemistry, will study how nanoparticles interact with metal surfaces and various types of support platforms and to provide wide-ranging knowledge on the relationship between nanoparticle size and its catalytic activity. An innovative aspect of the research is the use of addressable nanoelectrode membrane arrays to control the number and size of nanoparticles deposited/attached onto each contact electrode with subsequent measurement of the corresponding voltammetric profles in different reaction media by scanning electrochemical microscopy. Zoski's research will provide vital knowledge to understanding the electrocatalytic activities of nanoparticles in reactions of relevance to fuel cell chemistry, molecular recognition, sensing, drug delivery, and other such areas. Post-doctoral fellows and graduate students involved in the research will gain knowledge and training in state-of-the-art nanotechnology research, and will be involved in aspects of the project ranging from writing research papers, to disseminating experimental results at scientific and educational conferences, and training undergraduate students in basic chemical research methods.",
