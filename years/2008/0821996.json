KnoTSS participants are teams of mathematicians and educators who co-teach two courses (one mathematics course and one methods of teaching mathematics course) aimed at building integrated knowledge of content and pedagogy. KnoTSS research will answer the following questions: How do collaborations develop and evolve? How can they be fostered within institutions? What is the intellectual terrain co-created and traversed by collaborators? How do they negotiate its boundaries? How do they position themselves with respect to it and to each other?\r\n",
