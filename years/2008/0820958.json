 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant was awarded to Chicago State Univeristy to acquire a scanning electron microsope (SEM).  This instrument will enhance the resources of the core electron microscopy facility. The newly installed SEM will yield excellent secondary electron images in standard high vacuum mode and provide the capability to image uncoated and partially hydrated samples in the low vacuum mode using the backscatter detectors. Moreover it will allow easy collection of high-resolution digital images for presentation and publication. The WEB-SEM option that will allow us to actively use the microscope from a remote location, like an elementary school classroom, to support our outreach efforts. Research projects include developing zinc oxide films for solar cells; monitoring the products and processes of microwave enhanced chemistry; developing self-healing bone cement; and understanding the biochemistry of the assembly of the microtubule associated protein Tau; understanding the changes in starch granule breakdown in alfalfa; exploring the differentiation and apoptosis of cells in the colon and ileum after thermal injury; and understanding the role of truncated actin binding proteins in altering the dynamics and structure of the cytoskeleton.\r\n\r\nThe SEM will be used to support the educational and outreach goals of the university. The equipment will be used extensively in the Techniques in Electron Microscopy course and less extensively to support introductory courses for biology and science education majors. Two summer enrichment courses for minority students use the SEM for workshops and to support independent research projects. Taken together, these two programs address the needs of high school and early college students in developing their STEM skills. The WEB-SEM module will allow us to develop an outreach program where 6-12 teachers in the Chicago Public Schools can use the microscope from a remote location to support their classroom curriculum. Given Chicago State's predominantly minority student population and the demographics of the surrounding community, we strongly feel that we are in the position to effectively use the requested equipment to bolster both research and science education among underrepresented groups.",
