 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steven L. Suib and Anne M. Gaffney\r\n0827800\r\n \r\nThis GOALI project between the University of Connecticut and Lummus Technologies (LT) focuses on the preparation various nano-size zeolites (Y, \u00e2), Mesoporous TUD-1, and mixtures, which are used in many catalytic processes. Novel in situ mixing (I) ultrasonic nozzle (N) microwave (M) methods (IN, IM, INM) will be used. These methods have advantages of use of non-traditional reactors, highly reduced synthesis times, production of very small (nano-sized) zeolites with more uniform crystal size than conventional methods, and being continuous processes at atmospheric pressure. Synthesis, characterization, and catalytic studies [alkylation with (Y), biomass conversion of glycerol to acrolein (\u00e2)] will be done at UCONN and samples will be sent to LT for Alkylation of isobutane with C3-C5 olefins to form high octane alkylate gasoline. These environmentally sound, commercially viable catalytic applications will benefit from a reduced zeolite size and improved heat and mass-transfer. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Fundamental knowledge of synthesis, growth, nucleation, and characterization (Raman, NMR, FTIR, acidity, X-ray powder diffraction, BET, pore size distributions, others) of synthetic intermediates and nano-size zeolites is important in petroleum catalysis, adsorption, and sensors. Suib (UCONN) and Gaffney (LT) have collaborated in the past on oxidation catalysts, co-developed the INM method, and both have considerable experience with zeolite and molecular sieves. This work advances fundamental studies of growth of zeolites and Mesoporous materials using various M methods to understand factors that control size and shapes of nano-materials in general. Students will visit LT to help with catalytic experiments and LT researchers will visit UCONN to help with synthesis experiments. Resources are available at both facilities to carry out this work, and other experiments such as small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) will be done in collaboration with Dr. P. Thiyagajaran at Argonne National Laboratories. Specific aspects of the hypotheses should lead to an improved understanding of INM, zeolite and mesopore synthesis, nucleation, particle size and mass transfer effects, characterization, catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. LT's AlkyClean reactors with a focus on longterm (14 d) runs will be used to study activity, selectivity, breakthrough time, RON, and recyclability of catalysts provided by UCONN researchers. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Research skills and education of academic and industrial collaborators will be integrated in this program. Microwave engineering and science is presented for one week by the PI and outreach personnel at UCONN in our Kids are Scientists Too (KAST) K-12 summer program, co-sponsored by CEM and Milestone Corporations. KAST and other outreach programs target diverse and underrepresented groups in major CT cities (Hartford, Bridgeport) and offer a special laboratory for students with disabilities. Undergraduate (majors and REU) and graduate students at UCONN will be involved in this research and actively participate in quarterly joint meetings. Joint chem. eng./chemistry courses in catalysis and nano-science will continue to be offered. Undergraduate lab experiments in zeolite synthesis and in microwave syntheses of zeolites are part of the undergraduate curriculum and are done each year. Recruiting of graduate students with diverse and underrepresented backgrounds is an ongoing activity financially supplemented by UCONN. LT is two hours away by car from UCONN. Results of this work will be published, patented, and presented at national and international meetings. Added value in this collaboration comes from the diverse experience of all of the researchers and work will be done that is not possible by either sole organization alone. The current solid acid catalyst (SAC) market growth rate is 50,000 barrels per stream day (BPSD) or 2.5% of current worldwide installed capacity; a 3 million pound per year catalyst volume; and an SAC average market value for the first 10 years of commercialization of 36 million/year. An international symposium on microwaves in catalysis will be organized by the PIs in 2009.",
