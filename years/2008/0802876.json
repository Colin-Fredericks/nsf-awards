 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the legacy of the two previous Sloan Digital Sky Survey programs (SDSS and SDSS-II).  This project consists of four surveys. \r\n\r\nThe NSF funding is primarily for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).  This survey will measure redshifts of 1.5 million luminous red galaxies and Lyman-alpha absorption towards 160,000 high redshift quasars. These measurements will permit the absolute cosmic distance scale to be determined to a higher precision (1.0-1.5%) than previously achieved and will provide constraints on the equation of state of dark energy.  Some of the NSF funds will also be used to support the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).  This survey will use high-resolution and high signal-to-noise infrared spectroscopy to penetrate the dust that obscures the inner Galaxy from our view, measuring radial velocities, spectral types, and detailed elemental abundances of 100,000 red giant stars to an H magnitude limit of approximately 13.5 across the full range of the Galactic bulge, bar, and disk.\r\n\r\nThe first of the non-NSF funded surveys is SEGUE-2 which will measure radial velocities, spectral types, and elemental abundances of 350,000 stars in numerous target categories to a g magnitude limit of approximately 19, which will probe the kinematics and chemical evolution of the outer Milky Way. The final survey, also non-NSF funded, is the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey (MARVELS).  This will monitor the radial velocities of 11,000 bright stars, with the precision and cadence needed to detect gas giant planets with orbital periods ranging from several hours to two years.  These observations will provide a critical statistical data set for testing theories of the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems.\r\n\r\nThese surveys will produce large, well calibrated, easily accessible public databases supporting astronomical research and educational activities at many levels. The project also includes an active program of education and outreach promoting the data and tools to K-12 and university educators and to the broader public. \r\n",
