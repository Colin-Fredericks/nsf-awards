 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobility is central to various applications, from the classical\r\nproblems of searching for a moving target and rescue mission in\r\nmilitary and disaster settings, to deploying mobile ad-hoc/sensor\r\nnetworks for surveillance and data communication over hostile\r\nterrain and underwater. While the random mobility pattern of nodes in\r\nthese networks has been considered as the main source of uncertainty and\r\ndisruption of communication links, it can also facilitate reliable and\r\npredictable performance, if properly controlled and actively exploited.\r\nMost existing approaches have taken advantage of nodes' mobility only as\r\npassive vehicles for data forwarding upon contact by chance, with an\r\nover-simplifying assumption that every pair of nodes is making contacts\r\nwith each other according to a Poisson process, which is recently\r\ncontradicted by empirically observed non-Poisson nature with high degree\r\nof heterogeneity in various mobile networks.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research is to develop a unified methodology\r\nfor efficient protocol design and control of nodes in heterogeneous\r\nmobile ad-hoc networks and delay/disruption-tolerant networks under\r\nnon-Poisson contacts. The goal further extends to the use of mobile\r\nnodes with controllable mobility that can autonomously exploit the\r\nchanging diversity. The broader impact of this research lies in its\r\ninterdisciplinary nature in addressing the analysis and design of\r\nalgorithms running on mobility with heterogeneous non-Poisson contacts,\r\nwhich is also central to other scientific areas such as epidemiology,\r\nforaging ecology and biology, all driven by contacts among living\r\norganisms. This tight relationship between mobile ad-hoc networks\r\nand various phenomena in nature will serve as a vivid example for\r\nundergraduate students at a freshmen level or even to general public.",
