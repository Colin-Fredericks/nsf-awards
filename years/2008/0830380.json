 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prevalence of advanced computing technology has resulted in\r\n> increasingly complex simulation models of manufacturing,\r\n> telecommunication, logistic, transportation, supply chain and other\r\n> engineering systems. Such models often lack mathematical properties\r\n> that have traditionally been essential to the development of efficient\r\n> computational procedures for determining an optimal system design.\r\n> Consequently, the need arises to develop new optimization algorithms\r\n> that remain efficient even in the absence of simplifying mathematical\r\n> structures. This research investigates the analytical and practical\r\n> potential of computationally efficient variants of Fictitious Play\r\n> (FP), an iterative technique from the mathematical theory of learning,\r\n> as an optimization paradigm to achieve this goal.\r\n>\r\n> The key idea is to model the optimization problem as a game of common\r\n> interest between artificial \"players\" that correspond to components of\r\n> a carefully chosen partition of the design variables. The shared\r\n> interest of these players is to optimize the metric of system\r\n> performance. Theoretical justification for this approach is rooted in\r\n> the well-known fact that for games of common interest, limit points of\r\n> FP are Nash equilibria and thus may be viewed as a type of local\r\n> optimum. The research builds on the investigators' earlier work on\r\n> Sampled Fictitious Play (SFP), a modification that replaces the\r\n> exceptionally demanding expected utility calculations in FP with their\r\n> sampled approximations while still preserving FP's theoretical\r\n> properties. The work will culminate in a powerful and rigorous suite\r\n> of algorithms the investigators term Approximate Fictitious Play\r\n> (AFP), where the \"players\" interact with one another by calculating a\r\n> best response to a sample of strategies independently and adaptively\r\n> chosen from a probability distribution over their history of past best\r\n> responses. A major computational benefit of AFP is that the best\r\n> response subproblems are embedded in and significantly smaller than\r\n> the original optimization problem, leading to a dramatic increase in\r\n> efficiency compared to finding jointly optimal strategies.\r\n> Traditionally, simulation models of complex systems have been employed\r\n> as descriptive tools to test \"rule-of-thumb\" alternatives suggested by\r\n> a knowledgeable user. The AFP paradigm promises to make these models\r\n> prescriptive as its convergence and optimality properties do not rely\r\n> on regularity conditions that such systems and models are unlikely to\r\n> exhibit.\r\n",
