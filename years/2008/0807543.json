In Part 1, the\r\nobjective is to develop a group-theoretic method by which\r\nexplicit expressions that delineate the effects of\r\ncrystallographic texture on material tensors of weakly-textured\r\npolycrystalline materials can be derived systematically.  A\r\nrepresentation theorem is proved that reduces the problem to that\r\nof finding irreducible tensor bases of the rotation group.  A\r\nmethod is developed to generate irreducible tensor bases for a\r\ngiven tensor space.  The method delivers representation formulas\r\nat once applicable to all texture and crystal symmetries. \r\nSpecific instances important for applications in\r\nacoustoelasticity and plasticity are fully worked out.  Part 2\r\nconcerns nondestructive inspection of subsurface residual stress\r\nby ultrasonic measurements.  The material body in question is\r\nmodeled as a vertically heterogeneous, prestressed, anisotropic\r\nhalf-space.  An extension of the Stroh formalism is developed to\r\nrelate the dispersion of the Rayleigh wave to the vertical\r\nheterogeneity of stress and/or texture.  In Part 3 a\r\nphenomenological theory is developed for the interpretation of\r\nresonance shifts and line shapes in ultrasound resonance\r\nspectroscopy of sheet metals.  The sheet metal in question is\r\nmodeled as a textured, largely elastic material with a small\r\npower-law viscosity.  An attempt is made to draw information on\r\nresonance shifts, line shapes, and frequency dependence of\r\nattenuation through analysis of the basic initial-boundary-value\r\nproblem. \r\n\r\n     The crystal grains that constitute polycrystalline materials\r\n(e.g., wrought and cast metallic alloys) often carry preferred\r\norientations (or crystallographic texture) that strongly affect\r\nmechanical behavior of the aggregate material (e.g., the\r\nformability of sheet metals).  Part 1 of this project delivers\r\nformulas that describe quantitatively how crystallographic\r\ntexture affects the behavior of a polycrystalline material in\r\nelastic and plastic deformations.  Part 2 arises from the\r\nindustrial need for a nondestructive measurement technique that\r\nallows monitoring of the retention of subsurface residual stress\r\ninduced by surface conditioning treatments on metal parts for\r\nlifetime enhancement against fatigue failure and stress corrosion\r\ncracking.  The availability of such nondestructive technique\r\nalso allows emerging surface-enhancement technologies (e.g.,\r\nlaser-peening, low plasticity burnishing) to be more cost\r\neffective and improves quality control of surface conditioning\r\nprocesses.  Part 3 helps lay the mathematical foundations for the\r\ndevelopment of an ultrasonic technique for monitoring of texture\r\nand material microstructures in sheet metals (and hence of their\r\nformability) on the production line.",
