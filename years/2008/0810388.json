 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will extend the capabilities of magnetic current imaging to detect open failures in semiconductor packages with an accuracy of 30 microns to facilitate the integration of semiconductor components and devices into systems. The largest, most difficult problem encountered in packages is electrical opens due to increasing shrinking and complex technology in leading edge designs. The only available techniques are time domain reflectometry with practical resolution of 1-2 mm and time consuming layer-by-layer deprocessing. It is proposed to use magnetic current imaging with a SQUID sensor to solve this critical problem through increasing the frequency detection limit of the equipment to detect high frequency signals at the defect location.\r\n\r\nThe semiconductor industry has a critical need for localization of buried open defects in packages with resolution below 30 microns. The proposed technology is targeting a 30 micron resolution to fill a known gap in fault isolation technology for packaging. For the semiconductor companies it will enable the packaging manufacturing sites to isolate open defects and improve their manufacturing processes to minimize or eliminate these defects quickly so that they can get high quality reliable products to market faster. \r\n",
