 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Institute of Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience Research and Nervous Systems Disorders.  Recognizing that the neurosciences are a vibrant and dynamic area of research, with protean implications for biology, medicine, and understanding the human condition, the Forum will serve as a mechanism to engage interested communities of science, government and industry in a coordinated effort to address issues of mutual interest and concern.  This activity will strive to enhance understanding of research associated with the nervous system among the scientific community and the general public, and provide a vehicle to foster partnerships among stakeholders. Understanding how the nervous system develops, works and ages is the challenge confronting neuroscientists.  It is anticipated forum activities will help to address the need for new scientific resources and tools that will benefit all neuroscience research.\r\n\r\n",
