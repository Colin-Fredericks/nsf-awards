 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNAi is the process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing.  Remarkably, in C. elegans and other organisms, dsRNA-mediated gene silencing can spread between cells and tissues within the organism and can even be transmitted to progeny in a phenomenon known as systemic RNAi.  Further investigation of this phenomenon may uncover novel roles for intercellular RNA transport in cell-to-cell signaling during development and other important physiological processes.  For example, systemic RNAi in plants transports antiviral silencing signals ahead of an incipient infection, thereby providing immunity to uninfected cells. Specific goals include identifying and characterizing genes required for distinct transport steps, such as export and inter-tissue transport, and genes that function to regulate RNA transport. The long-term goals of this research into systemic RNAi are to understand how dsRNA is transported, how transport is regulated, and to determine the significance of dsRNA transport in animals. \r\n\r\nRNA interference refers to a means by which cells use an RNA-based signal to target genes for silencing.  In plants and a few investigated animals, this silencing signal is transported between cells.  In plants this cell-to-cell silencing is important for anti-viral immunity but a function for the spreading in animals is unknown.  The focus of this study is to identify proteins that regulate and mediate the transport of silencing signals between cells in animals.  In addition to the scientific findings, the project will result in the training of future scientist and educators. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRNA interference is a powerful gene regulatory mechanism that acts to silence gene expression (turn genes off).  What makes RNA interference special is that one can target any gene simply by providing a gene specific guide molecule, a small interfering RNA.  RNAi interference has been used to silence disease causing genes, viruses, etc.  It is also an extremely useful tool in the laboratory, greatly accelerating biological research.  Finally, it is also being used in agriculture to control pest.  A significant challenge in each of these settings is delivering the guide RNA to each cell in an organism.  This is a common problem with most pharmaceutical drugs, but with RNA interference the guide RNA is large and the common modifications that help drugs get into cells interfere with the activity of the guide RNA. \n\nRNA interference was discovered in the nematode C. elegans.  One reason it was discovered in C. elegans is that it works very well in this animal and the primary reason it works so well is that the guide RNA molecules are naturally mobile, and can very easily move between cells &ndash; thus in contrast to humans, the targeted gene can be readily silenced in all cells.  To understand how this works, we identified genetic variants that disabled this transport system and then identified each broken component. Several of the components we identified are similar to proteins that function in human cells. This suggest the possibility that changes to the guide RNA molecules may enhance delivery in mammals.  We are still trying to understand how these proteins function together to regulate guide RNA mobility.  We also identified factors and pathways that normally limit the activity of RNA interference.  When disabled, RNA interference was more potent. \n\nThis award not only supported the described research aims, all of the work was performed by students and postdoctoral fellows training to become scientist, medical doctors, and scientific legal professionals.  Learning how to formulate scientific questions (hypotheses), design and perform experiments to test these hypotheses, and communicate the results is an integral part of modern scientific education.  Finally, the results were reported in six peer reviewed publications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig P Hunter"
