 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTERDISCIPLINARY: 99\r\n\r\nThis project uses a common living system, an aquarium, to deliver STEM education to a wide audience to enhance STEM education at all levels. An aquarium is an exquisite combination of interacting systems which can be analyzed using multidisciplinary engineering principles. While children are familiar with an aquarium via personal aquariums or school field trips, they seldom make a connection to the engineering and science related to the system. Therefore, the idea of adapting this living system is a good educational tool. Students are engaged in the scientific discovery process using hands-on activities to introduce them to chemical, mechanical, electrical, civil, and environmental engineering principles such as mass and energy balances; fluid flow; work, energy, and efficiency; forces and levers; material strength and stresses; water quality and treatment; and electrical signal processing. The aquarium theme also adds to the need for an understanding of biological systems, ecosystems, pollution and sustainable development. \r\n\r\nThe modules developed in this project expose a broad audience (K-12 students and teachers, science and engineering college students and faculty) to multidisciplinary engineering and science principles in a hands-on, team-oriented learning environment using modern, computer-based measurement and instrumentation. An important feature is a website showcasing real time data and images of the aquarium. Postings on the website allow schools and colleges to explore an aquarium without the work and expense of setting one up. Experimental details, laboratory manuals, course materials such as problems and lecture slides are posted on the website for easy access by schools, colleges and institutions.",
