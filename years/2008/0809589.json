 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to Professor Tobin J. Marks of Northwestern University supports studies on both fundamental and technologically-oriented aspects of new catalytic transformations involving lanthanide and related early transition metals.  The proposal has been divided into four subtopics: 1) exploratory catalytic metal-heteroelement chemistry, 2) organolanthanide-mediated materials synthesis, 3) multinuclear catalysis and 4) other metals and supporting ligands for f-element catalysis.  Titration calorimetry will be used to quantify the strengths of metal-ligand single and multiple bonds and to \"anchor\" bond enthalpies on an absolute scale.  The research includes the study of selective C-N, C-O, C-S, and C-P bond-forming processes, the study of a range of precursor structures, the characterization of reaction rates, selectivities, and substituent effects, as well as the comparison of intramolecular vs. intermolecular processes.  These transformations may produce efficient, atom-economical, catalytic processes for the production of fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals and other commercially-important chemicals.  This research also addresses the national need for researchers trained in basic heavy element chemistry for the nuclear industry.",

Our objective to elucidate principals for inventing new, efficient, useful, atom-efficient, and environmentally acceptable \"green\" catalytic processes.

There is also a national need for researchers trained in basic heavy metal chemistry for the nuclear industry. This NSF-funded project focuses on organometallic/catalytic/materials chemistry with the goal being to effect, characterize, understand, and disseminate to the community, unusual and potentially useful new stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity principals, as well as new insights into bonding and bonding energetics. Such a research/-education activity deliberately involves young scientists in all aspects of this knowledge creation.  ..."
