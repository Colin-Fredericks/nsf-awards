 "awd_abstract_narration": "Going beyond in-person conference and symposium events this workshop develops and evaluates new types of Creative-IT community events that incorporate IT and IT artifacts of the Creative-IT community and leverage these in distributed online events. The events will focus on Creative IT community and knowledge development through participant engagement, generative activities, and reflective critique. Initially the distributed will be developed by curating (i.e., selecting, facilitating, and hosting the events) three events. The initial events will focus on three themes of this community, including: (1) Creativity Support Tools, (2) Multifaceted Creative Experiences with IT, (3) Creativity-IT Theories and Methodologies: An Evolving Canon. This project effectively defines a workshop that is distributed in time and space. The 2 major goals are to bring the CreativeIT community together using the technologies that are claimed to enable creativity, and to provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate the application of these technologies with a group of researchers that tend to be both creative and early adopters. The long term impact of the proposed work is to create, a series of interactive creative experiences that would become a self-motivated process of self-definition and growth that is owned by the Creative-IT community as a whole, or a rotating facilitating group of members.",
