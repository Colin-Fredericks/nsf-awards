The conference will run for three days.  Particular attention will be given to supporting women, young mathematicians, and members of under-represented groups. The primary use of the NSF funds will be for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe study of function spaces and their operators has advanced rapidly in recent years, and is still undergoing development. It is important to take this opportunity to expose young researchers to recent developments, to assess these developments, and to plan for future work.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the conference will be broad and lasting. One of the goals is to integrate young mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups into the working infrastructure of the profession. Putting them into contact with mature and experienced scholars, and exposing them to current research problems, will help to boost their careers, and give them something of permanent value to take away from the conference.\r\n\r\n",
