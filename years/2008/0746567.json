 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation \"Nanoscale Science and Engineering\" (NSF 01-157), category NIRT. Novel electrodeposited nanostructured multilayered alloys for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) will be developed. High sensitivity magnetic sensors and hard materials for micro-cutting tools and molds will be fabricated. Compositionally modulated multilayered alloys offer a variety of improved properties including enhanced giant magnetoresistance for thin film magnetic sensors, and superior hardness for high aspect ratio microdevice components, compared to their coarser microstructural counterparts. It is expected that the nanometric feature of the layers will contribute to a change in the physical properties and microstructure.  Electrochemical processing will be used to fabricate both thin and thick nanomaterials with pulsed waveforms. \r\n\r\nMagnetic, electronic and mechanical properties will be examined, including electrical resistivity, magnetoresistivity, DC/AC magnetization and susceptibility, and hardness.\r\nInvestigators at LSU/CAMD, Argonne and Brookhaven National Labs will work\r\ntogether towards characterization of the electrodeposited nanolayered alloys with student\r\ninvolvement at the national labs.  Student outreach will be conducted through PI participation in the Society of Women Engineers and the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.  The proposed electrodeposition techniques have the potential to significantly improve the quality of multilayered nanostructures, especially those with curved and recessed substrates.\r\n",
