 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualizing Scientific Discovery Workshop\r\nSusan E. Cozzens, Georgia Institute of Technology\r\nThe development of visualization tools made possible by advances in cyber-infrastructure offer intriguing possibilities for tracking the impact of\r\ninvestments in science. These possibilities range from tracing the path from basic research discoveries to patents and innovation, to the changing structure of scientific disciplines, and from examining the importance of social networks to the dispersion of scientific innovations to comparators of international performance in science.\r\nThe potential contribution to NSF programs is far-reaching. Program\r\nofficers could use information from such tools to examine whether one particular type or level of investment has been better than another for achieving a particular short-term outcome, use the information to restructure or balance their funding portfolio, as well as to provide information to outside queries about the value of particular investments. In addition, NSF staff could use the tools to describe the impact of cross-cutting initiatives, such as cyber-infrastructure and ITR. NSF staff might also be able to expand by mapping the complex structures of multidisciplinary collaborations and using the information to identify members of scientifically dispersed communities as well as emerging leaders in science and innovation.\r\nHowever, before such a vision is achieved, many questions remain about\r\nthe robustness, validity and usability of the visualization tools. The workshop is designed to bring researchers from a broad range of disciplines to examine the open questions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The workshop will explore the research frontier of an\r\nexciting area of the social sciences, surveying the current state of the art and identifying key issues for further development.\r\nBroader impacts. The workshop will increase the usability of results from\r\nthis research area. It involves a postdoctoral scholar and doctoral student fully in the work, and thus contributes to human resource development in the science of science policy.",
