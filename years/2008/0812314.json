It proposes to use melody, rhythm, and to some extent lyrics to index musical databases. The PI proposes to build a search engine for music that takes sung examples as input for searching relevant songs. The search engine adapts to individual needs through feedback and ongoing personalization to improve the search results. Finding ways to automatically index, label, and access multimedia content (such as music documents) is a research question that is increasing in importance as multimedia databases proliferate and grow.\r\n",
