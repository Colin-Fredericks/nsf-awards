 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET- 0756263\r\nFrey\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks the development of a consistent and well-detailed methodology for the determination and modeling of vehicular emissions on different temporal and vehicular scales. Successful development of such a methodology would be a step forward for planners and regulators who often struggle as to which currently available model may most accurately predict local/regional vehicle emissions. The PIs have a well-documented history in the field of on-board vehicular measurements, meshing the fields of environmental and transportation engineering. The project appears well-organized and the PIs have carefully explained their experimental, modeling, and dissemination plan, including details on planned statistical analysis and a fairly in-depth description of the dissemination plans. The listed resources at the home institution seem more than sufficient to accomplish the proposed tasks. The proposed work is well organized and represents a valuable step forward in the ultimate quantification of vehicular emissions. The budget seems appropriate and sufficient. The FUEMS methodologies proposed not only advance the state-of-knowledge, but the very project plan enhances training and learning by the implicit inclusion of a number graduate and undergraduate students in the raw research, and further student exposure by inclusion of breaking data, and the process of data reduction, in various courses. The results are to be further disseminated through webpages, local political organizations, and presentations and publications via professional organizations. The recruitment of students into the program seems to be mostly in-house, but will be advertised through the school's minority program offices. \r\n",
