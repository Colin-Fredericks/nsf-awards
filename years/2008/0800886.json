 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support the investigation of metal electrodeposition mechanisms on carbon nanofiber surfaces so that multi-functionalized materials with desired physico-chemical properties can be produced and evaluated for large scale engineering applications. Carbon nanofibers have comparable sizes and unique properties as multiwall carbon nanotubes but are available in large quantity with a competitive cost. Incorporating metallic coatings or particles onto the nanofiber surface can further improve its electric/thermal conductivity, magnetic field response, electromagnetic wave absorption, and catalytic activity. After being assembled into a paper sheet form, the carbon nanofibers can be reproducibly handled and used as electrodeposition electrodes. Electrodeposition provides an effective approach to introduce surface functionalization. Yet the metal nucleation, growth and bonding on these carbon nanomaterials remain largely unknown. This research will fill this critical gap by exploring the relationship between the synthesis parameters and the coating morphology and microstructures. \r\nThe research can lead to the cost-effective handling and functionalizing carbon materials for their assembly into specific architectures in a reproducible fashion. This can help utilizaion of carbon nanofiber structures in applications such as lightning strike prevention, reinforced composites, electromagnetic shielding materials, static discharge, vibration/acoustic dampers, catalyst substrates, supercapacitors and bio/chemical sensors development. The broader impact on society will also be accomplished through education outreach efforts to show the opportunities and rewards of a career in science and engineering. In addition to support undergraduate and graduate research and modernize materials engineering curriculum, special emphasis will be placed on high school teacher and student education and training.",
