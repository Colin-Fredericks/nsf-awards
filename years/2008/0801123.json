 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will work on two projects connected with number\r\ntheory and arithmetic geometry. The first project is to study\r\ngeneralizations of Hilbert's Tenth Problem. The problem in its\r\noriginal form asked for an algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary\r\nmultivariable polynomial equation with integer coefficients has an\r\ninteger solution. In 1970 Matiyasevich proved that no such algorithm\r\nexists, i.e. Hilbert's Tenth Problem is undecidable. This motivated\r\nstudying analogues of this problem by considering equations and\r\nsolutions in other commutative rings. The biggest open problem in the\r\narea is Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the rational numbers. The PI has\r\nproved the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various\r\nfunction fields. These generalizations have used tools from\r\narithmetic geometry, such as the study of rational points on elliptic\r\ncurves. One research goal is to extend these results and prove\r\nundecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the function fields for which\r\nthe problem is still unresolved. The biggest open problems are\r\nfunction fields of one variable over an algebraically closed field.\r\nAnother goal is to explore Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various\r\nsubrings of number fields. The second project is to study several\r\nproblems that deal with computational aspects of curves and their\r\nJacobians. Elliptic curves and, more generally, Jacobians of curves\r\nof small genus have many applications to cryptography, and the second\r\nproject focuses on these applications. One goal of the second project\r\nis to explore curves of small genus and work on constructing curves\r\nthat are suitable for cryptographic purposes. The PI will also work on\r\napplications of pairings to cryptography.\r\n\r\nBoth projects involve studying the solutions to multivariable\r\npolynomial equations. Looking for solutions to such equations over the\r\nintegers or rational numbers has a long history that goes back to\r\nancient Greece. For the first project the investigator will study the\r\nfundamental question of whether it is possible to find a procedure\r\nthat determines whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation\r\nhas a solution in a given number system. The second project focuses\r\non computational aspects of certain special classes of equations that\r\nhave applications to cryptography. For these applications one usually\r\nlooks for solutions to these equations over finite fields.\r\n\r\n",
