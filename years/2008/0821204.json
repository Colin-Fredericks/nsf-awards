 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to San Francisco State University (SFSU) under the supervision of Dr. Diana Chu to purchase a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope for the Cell and Molecular Imaging Center (CMIC). The instrument includes efficient and sensitive spectral detectors to allow analysis of high-resolution, 3-dimensional reconstructions of fluorescently-labeled samples. This will advance studies that uncover mechanisms of embryonic development using Xenopus and chick, intracellular signaling in plants, and the design of cancer therapy compounds. Multiple lasers and precise control over excitation and emission wavelengths will enable the simultaneous use of a broad range of fluorophores that are required to understand chromatin function in worms, gene expression in ants and crabs, and chromosome positioning in mammals. On-site access will allow live imaging to capture rapid chromosome movements in C. elegans and transient cell signals in chick muscle development. The sensitivity, resolution, and speed of this instrument will permit SFSU researchers to employ advanced imaging techniques to address new research questions at the forefront of their respective fields in developmental biology, chemistry and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe research SFSU scholar-teachers conduct will be integrated with closely mentored training using this system to enhance the career development of SFSU students, 35% of whom are under-represented minorities and 58% women. This diversity is reflected in the 11 investigators included in this proposal, which includes 5 women, 3 Latinos, and 1 Native American. Individual research projects and courses in fluorescence and confocal microscopy will prepare students for success at PhD institutions and biotechnology companies. Affordable access to this system will also enhance collaborations between researchers at neighboring institutions and the diverse faculty and students at SFSU.",
