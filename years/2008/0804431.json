The following five general areas are explored:\r\n(1) identification and characterization of dense packings of\r\nnonspherical particles for a wide class shapes in two and three\r\nspace dimensions; (2) study of sphere packings of maximal density\r\nin high Euclidean dimensions; (3) identification of low-density\r\njammed sphere packings in various dimensions; (4) studies of\r\njamming on the unit sphere in arbitrary dimensions; and (5)\r\npursuit of improved order metrics to characterize the degree of\r\nrandomness in a packing.  Important scientific advances and\r\noutcomes are likely to emerge from the proposed research.  This\r\nvery multidisciplinary project joins the applied mathematics,\r\nstatistical and condensed-matter physics, materials science,\r\nengineering, and pure mathematics communities.  Unifying these\r\ndifferent perspectives and goals is a challenging task, but one\r\nthat offers great rewards to the scientific community in general. \r\n\r\n     Packing problems, such as how densely solid objects fill\r\nspace, have fascinated people since the dawn of civilization, and\r\ncontinue to intrigue scientists because of their connection to a\r\nhost of problems that arise in the physical sciences,\r\nmathematics, engineering, and biology.  While optimal packing\r\nproblems are intimately related to solid states of condensed\r\nmatter, disordered sphere packings have been employed to model\r\nthe glassy state of matter.  Sphere packings in high dimensions\r\nhave relevance in communications theory.  The way that viruses\r\npackage DNA in protein containers is a packing problem.  What are\r\nthe densest packings of spheres in dimension greater than three? \r\nWhat are the densest packings of nonspherical objects in two and\r\nthree dimensions?  Can random packings ever fill space more\r\ndensely than ordered packings (implying disordered or \"glassy\"\r\nground states)?  Can \"randomness\" of a packing be quantified in a\r\nmeaningful and precise manner?  A greater understanding of\r\npacking problems has implications for the synthesis of novel\r\nmaterials, our ability to efficiently design communications\r\nchannels to send digital signals over large distances, and the\r\ndesign of new drugs, just to mention a few examples.",
