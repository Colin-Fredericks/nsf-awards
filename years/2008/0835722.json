 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's propose organising and hosting a workshop to identify the key elements necessary to build an empirical infrastructure that will advance research on one of the key building blocks of science and innovation policy: organizations. This will provide an empirical basis for the scientific study of science and innovation policies that affect innovation, business performance, and change in organizations. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held in NSF meeting space in Arlington, Virginia, on July 23, 2008. It will be adjoined by a Pre-Conference for the 2008 Kauffman Symposium on Entrepreneurship and Innovation Data on July 24, 2008\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop organization will be in the form of five highly structured sessions lasting a total of one day and with a maximum of 35 participants, with about 20 participants involved in the program in some way (as speaker, panel moderator, or discussion facilitator). All sessions will include a floor discussion. The three organizers will act as both facilitators and rapporteurs\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThe primary intellectual merit of the proposal is that the new data and tools that the workshop seeks to develop would provide an evidence based platform for science policy.  It would (1) permit researchers to examine the innovation process ? both successes and failures ? and (2) explore business performance and business dynamics at the level of the appropriate economic entity. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the need for better metrics of innovation and business performance was underscored by the America COMPETES Act and the Innovation Metrics report of the Department of Commerce (DOC). By fostering transformative research that would advance the scientific understanding of innovation and its relation to policy and business strategy, the new infrastructure will respond to these high-level concerns.  \r\n",
