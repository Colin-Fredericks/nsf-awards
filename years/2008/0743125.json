 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensive laboratory research indicates that a relatively small number of male and female reproductive proteins play key roles in determining differential success of gametes. These molecules are regulating complex communications in what may be antagonistic interactions between male and female reproductive interests. Little is known about the molecular basis for these interactions and their relative importance in the wild. This study will identify the genetic basis for male-male and male-female interactions, determine how associations between genotype and phenotype vary when the male competitor?s genotype varies, and directly identify which male reproductive genes mediate male x male interactions. This study also will investigate how mating status varies across the day, the season, densities and as a function of the female genotype and allow the most direct tests possible of the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation in nature.\r\n\r\nAmong its broader impacts, this study will inspired a diverse collection of undergraduates through direct participation in research projects by engaging them in honors projects, giving them opportunities to present results at international meetings, and motivating them to pursue careers in scientific research. This study also will produce shared infrastructure, including a large number of Drosophila cultures that are openly available, and a publicly available Bayesian estimator for association testing using brood-structured data. \r\n",
