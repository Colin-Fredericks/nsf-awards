 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies of the interaction of tropical cyclones with their large-scale environments have focused primarily on environmental controls on storm tracks and, more recently, rapid changes in intensity. Through a combination of review and analysis of archived storm observations and idealized simulations employing the NCAR/PSU MM5 mesoscale model nested down to 3-km horizontal resolution, this research will investigate the previously unexplored issue of what environmental factors control tropical cyclone size (i.e., diameter) and other broad structural aspects of these storms. Since the large-scale environments in which tropical cyclones are embedded are generally well represented by existing operational weather forecast models, it follows that identifying those environmental characteristics that are most important to determining cyclone size and structure will improve forecasts storm structure and its evolution.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research centers upon achieving improved understanding of fundamental physical processes that control evolution of hurricane size and broad structural configuration of accompanying envelopes of damaging winds and heavy precipitation.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this work include training of university graduate and undergraduate students and support of the participation of underrepresented groups. Improved techniques for forecasting changes of tropical cyclone size will in-turn impact operational products including storm surge prediction and proper scoping (in space and time) of coastal evacuation plans in the face of landfalling hurricanes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis modeling project has improved understanding of basic factors in the environment associated with tropical cyclone wind field changes.  For the same ocean temperature, an initially warmer and moister environment will have higher convective potential but lower air-sea fluxes because of a smaller air-sea temperature and vapor-pressure difference.  A colder and drier environment will have lower initial convective energy, but higher ocean fluxes.  Thus, in the warmer environment, convection will rapidly initiate causing a weak tropical cyclone to rapidly intensify.  However, once the convective energy is depleted, the low fluxes from the ocean are not enough to replenish the convective energy in teh atmosphere and the tropical cyclone stops intensifying and does not grow in size.  In the colder environment, the convection is slower to trigger and the tropical cyclone intensifies more slowly.  However, the high ocean fluxes quickly build up convective energy in the boundary layer, vigorous convection develops and the tropical cyclone rapidly intensifies and expands in size.\n\nWhile it is very inmportant that the atmospheric profile is unstable such that convection can develop, the main key to these differences appears to be the ocean-atmospheric temperature and vapor-pressure difference.\n\nBetter understanding of factors that cause a tropical cyclone to expand or contract its wind field, will lead to future improvements in forecast warnings of related impacts of tropical cyclones upon landfall including the extent of damaging winds and storm surge.  This will help improve preparations, evacuation, and mitigation activities.  This information has been communicated to the scientific/forecasting community through peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference presentations, and seminars at higher institutions.  Furthermore, the information has been used in the K-5 classroom to teach elementary school students about hurricanes in particular, weather in general, and the scientific method. \n\nThis project has supported an undergraduate and several graduate students for short periods of time and in one case through her Masters and much of her Ph.D work.
