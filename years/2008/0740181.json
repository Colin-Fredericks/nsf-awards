 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to provide an information technology based software system that will support productivity for Tribal grantees using a culturally comprehensible, project management tool. The intellectual merit of this project is an enabling technology that integrates Native ways of knowing and learning with Native ways of doing technology. Research efforts will identify and document business, technical, and cultural requirements to develop the function and constraints of the software. Strategic partnerships include a multinational software company, a rural Alaskan Tribal consortium, and Academic institution. The specific Phase I objectives are to 1) investigate the design requirements and user features for an information based software system that promotes efficiency and success for Tribal grant projects management; 2) assess the commercial potential of the software system compatibility and potential to be manufactured for targeted markets, and 3) provide a best practices model for IT educators, researchers, and developers to integrate cross-cultural approaches into technology design and use. \r\n\r\nThis project has the potential to impact a broad market of Tribal grantees and commercial software industries and will enable Tribal staff to take ownership of their grants in a way that contributes to successful programs, and to learning and career advancement. Technology design will help entry-level staff effectively manage projects while learning about administrative requirements and program implementation. Successful, culturally comprehensive development of the software interface will foster cross-cultural technology design opportunities and will present a best practices model for the IT industry in developing culturally relevant products.\r\n",
