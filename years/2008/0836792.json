 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a  3-day-long workshop designed to explore the applications of high-resolution laser mapping to analyzing changes at the surface of the Earth.The objectives of this workshop are 1) to bring together scientists who are using high-resolution topographic datasets to develop and test intellectually significant ideas regarding Earth surface processes, and 2) to provide scientists with direct, hands-on opportunities to learn about new\r\nresearch advances and future directions of research in Earth surface processes. The workshop includes ~12 oral presentations which will be up to 1.5 hours in length. Each of these will be followed by relatively long discussion periods in which participants can ask questions about the data, the scientific goals, the results, and the techniques used to obtain the\r\nresults. All participants have the opportunity to present posters in one large room  for the entire duration of the workshop. Blocks of time will be devoted toviewing the posters, and we anticipate that this will provide many opportunities for students to interact with experienced investigators. The workshop participants will prepare a report thaht will be used as a basis for stimu;ating research in this area.\r\n\r\nThe general themes of the workshop include the following topics:\r\n1. Geomorphic transport laws: current knowledge and future directions\r\n2. Landslides, landscapes, climate and land use\r\n3. Bedrock fracturing, topography, and landscape evolution\r\n4. The significance of topographic scaling\r\n5. Channels in three dimensions\r\n6. Tectonics, climate and topography\r\n7. Landuse legacies, river restoration and rivers revealed\r\n8. Glacial and periglacial landscapes \r\n9. Coastal and tidal landscapes\r\n10. Forest and ecosystem dynamics\r\n11. The state of the art in Earth surface processes, and future directions of research.\r\nThe outcomes of this workshop will have significant benefit for investigating major problems of value to society, such as river flooding, landslides, effects of agriculture and development on the landscape, and water resources issues.",
