 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0813598\r\nBorca-Tasciuc\r\n\r\nAlthough there are several ambient energy sources suitable for energy scavenging applications including solar, thermal and kinetic energy sources, mechanical vibration energy harvesting is often most appealing as vibrations are ubiquitous. However, environmental vibrations are in the low frequency range (<200 Hz). This makes difficult the development of efficient microscale converters based on the harmonic oscillator approach since the fundamental frequency of these devices is orders of magnitude higher. The research outlined in this study focuses on proof-of-concept demonstrations of a novel concept for kinetic to electrical energy conversion via magnetic fluids (suspensions of magnetic particles in a liquid). The idea is to employ the motion of a liquid induced by mechanical vibrations in order to actuate a periodic change in the net magnetic moment of a collection of magnetic particles suspended in the liquid. In the proposed mechanism of power harvesting, the liquid motion periodically rotates the particles along with their magnetic moment and the collective effect gives rise to an electromotive force in a nearby coil. To provide the collective effect, alignment of the magnetic moments of the particles in the fluid is obtained by subjecting the fluid to a uniform magnetic field. Wireless, autonomous sensor networks could enable continuous, pervasive monitoring and control in numerous applications such as equipment diagnostic and control, motor vehicle, plane and structure monitoring, in-vivo, real time biomedical monitoring, smart clothing as well as intelligence and surveillance operations. Furthermore, a rapidly emerging application of wireless sensors and actuators which is of critical importance is home automation networks, where they play a key role in the management of power consumption. Essential to the successful implementation of any microsensor network is developing local, microscale energy sources to provide electrical power to individual sensors/actuators, since in many cases using batteries is not a viable solution.",
