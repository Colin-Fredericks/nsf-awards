 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pseudoscorpions, an arachnid order with at least 3300 species, are distributed worldwide yet they remain understudied. This grant explores the evolutionary diversification of one genus of pseudoscorpions, Synsphyronus Chamberlin, which occurs in Australia and New Zealand. This project aims to 1) assess the diversity and evolutionary relationships of Synsphyronus in southwestern Australia, where the group has diversified on habitat islands formed by granite outcrops and 2) to understand the evolutionary origins of the outcrop-endemic species of Synsphyronus. Relationships among populations will be inferred using DNA sequences. Specimens will also be examined with scanning electronic microscopy to search for distinguishing morphological traits. The resulting phylogeny will be used to test hypotheses about outcrop colonization events and character evolution.\r\n\r\nA critical issue facing the biological community is to describe the biota of recognized global biodiversity hotspots, while facing a decline in the number of taxonomists, particularly in lesser-known groups such as pseudoscorpions. Southwestern Australia is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot and while its floristic richness is well known, documentation of its invertebrate fauna lags behind. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research through an international partnership with a pseudoscorpion taxonomist in Australia. A graduate student will be trained in taxonomy by her collaborator and together they will describe up to six new species that have been discovered through her fieldwork.\r\n",
