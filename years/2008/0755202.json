 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a summer REU program with an intellectual theme of investigating aspects of the terrestrial environment using correlated space-based and ground-based observations. Project objectives include for (1) Student Participants: learn fundamental aspects of climate science and comparative planetology, ? develop competence and familiarity with basic research skills (literature review, selection of events, acquisition of data, data analysis, computer programming, oral and written presentation), - enjoy a sense of excitement and satisfaction associated with scientific discovery and spacecraft missions, - learn to work effectively as part of a research team. (2) Departmental Objectives: - promote increased participation of underrepresented groups in geosciences while gaining exposure for a new graduate program. \r\n\r\nThe students to verify previously reported results and explore new research directions with guidance from accomplished research scientists. The faculty team includes academic and research faculty experienced in education and student research. All involved are active members of their respective scientific communities, and expert in various aspects of physical science and geosciences. Hampton University is PI institution for several space instrumentation projects and the research center offers access to observations, analysis tools, and expertise necessary to support the planned research and educational activities. The research will focus on employment of data from multiple resources with the emphasis on atmospheric, space and planetary sciences. \r\n\r\nBy its nature, the program promotes teaching, training, and learning in activities associated with basic research investigations which are advancing knowledge and understanding in several areas of geoscience. The program promotes understanding of environment by the student participants, including basic observational evidence related to global climate change, which is a topic of interest extending well beyond the bounds of the scientific community, and this is a significant broader impact. Because the program takes place on the campus of an HBCU, and because recruitment will target minority serving institutions, it will promote broad participation of under-represented groups in geosciences.\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
