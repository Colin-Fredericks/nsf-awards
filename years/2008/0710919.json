 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of particular interest (and controversy) in geophysics and seismology are the mechanisms\r\ncontrolling brittle-like failure at depths of several hundred km or more where deep earthquakes\r\noccur. At these depths frictional sliding, the fundamental failure mechanism operating under the\r\nlower confinements present at shallower depths, is nominally suppressed. We propose new\r\nexperiments and modeling aimed at elucidating the characteristics and the fundamental physical\r\nmechanism(s) that underlie localized brittle compressive failure under high confinement.\r\n\r\nAmong the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain brittle-like failure under high\r\nconfinement, dehydration embrittlement and transformational faulting are the two most often\r\ncited. They act to reduce confinement locally, in effect allowing low-confinement frictional\r\nfaulting to continue into the high-confinement regime. However, changes in earthquake seismic\r\ncharacter at greater depths are possibly consistent with a change in the physical mechanism of\r\nrupture for the deepest earthquakes. An alternative mechanism, and the one we propose to\r\ninvestigate, is plastic faulting. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the other two: it\r\nis a non-frictional shear instability aided by adiabatic heating.\r\n\r\nSpirited by past success in using ice as a model material for rock--Kirby's [1987] discovery\r\nof transformational faulting, and our own discovery [Renshaw and Schulson, 2001] of what\r\nappears to be a universal mechanism of low-confinement brittle failure--and encouraged by its\r\nmineralogical simplicity and by its marked similarity to the behavior of rocks and minerals, we\r\npropose a series of systematic compression experiments on granular ice to determine the effects,\r\nif any, of confinement, grain size and strain rate on both the terminal failure stress and the failure\r\nmode, with attention to microstructural detail. Preliminary experiments demonstrate a transition\r\nin brittle-like failure mode with increasing confinement and that the high confinement faults\r\nappear not to be friction controlled. Nor do they appear to be related to either mode II cracking,\r\ndehydration embrittlement, or phase transformations. Our working hypothesis is that plastic\r\nfaulting is at play. In addition, we propose to develop quantitative models of high confinement\r\ncompressive failure, using as inputs direct observations of the physical processes.",
