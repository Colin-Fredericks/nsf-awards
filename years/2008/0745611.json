Localized in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria, algae and plants, PSII catalyzes light-induced electron transfer from water to plastoquinone with concomitant evolution of oxygen. The life history of PSII is intriguing in that its normal function leads to rapid turnover of this large integral membrane protein complex.  This process, undoubtedly carefully orchestrated to maintain critically important water oxidation activities, must require a host of assembly factors, very few of which have been identified to date. Also, oxygenic photosynthetic organisms in general, and cyanobacteria in particular, inhabit almost every ecological niche on the planet, surviving in temperatures from 4 degrees Celsius to 75 degrees Celsius, under widely varying nutritional environs.  Recent genome level data suggest that among such organisms, PSII exhibits a high degree of plasticity in both composition and regulation to optimize its function. For example, N2-fixing cyanobacteria such as Cyanothece 51142 are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis and N2 fixation in single cells. These two metabolic processes are at odds with each other, since the N2-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase, is highly sensitive to O2. To resolve this conflict, these organisms have developed a type of temporal regulation in which N2 fixation and photosynthesis occur at different times throughout a diurnal cycle.  Again, little is known about how the form and function of PSII are regulated so that every night, PSII becomes inactive.\r\nThe specific aims of this project are:\r\nI.\tTo investigate the dynamic forms of PSII under diverse environmental conditions.\r\nA.\tTo examine diurnal regulation of PSII activity in Cyanothece 51142.\r\nB.\tTo elucidate the effect of chloride concentration on the composition of the lumenal proteins of PSII in Synechocystis as well as Prochloroccous.\r\nII.\tTo examine the assembly intermediates of PSII in Synechocystis 6803.\r\nA.\tTo investigate PSII assembly intermediates over a time course.\r\nB.\tTo define the functions of various lumenal proteins in PSII biogenesis.\r\nC.\tTo elucidate the role of the assembly intermediate operon (aio) in PSII biogenesis.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nBy harvesting solar radiation, the PSII complex contributes to nearly half of the biomass and bioenergy production on our planet.  A detailed understanding of the dynamic nature PSII is necessary to fully comprehend the mechanism of photosynthetic O2-evolution. This project will encompass a broad genomics based approach to provide a multi-disciplinary training environment for all researchers. The project will also help train a number of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in the general area of bioenergy. Finally, the on-going tradition of all researchers in this project participating in significant outreach activities will be continued.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhotosystem II (PSII) initiates the photosynthetic process that converts sunlight into usable forms of chemical energy for nearly all life on Earth.  Though crystal structures provide a detailed picture of the active form of PSII, much less is known about the complex cycle of damage and repair that PSII undergoes roughly every 30 minutes in a living cell.  In this project we studied key aspects of this process, including the role of accessory proteins and cellular mechanisms for optimizing PSII function under various conditions. \n\nTo determine the structural location of several accessory proteins not detected in the PSII crystal structures, we employed the mass spectrometry-based techniques of chemical cross-linking and protein footprinting.  Our application of these cutting-edge techniques to study PSII has provided a molecular-level understanding of the binding site and functional aspects of the Psb27, PsbQ, and Psb28 proteins. Each of these proteins binds to a distinct site on the PSII complex at a particular stage of assembly, and serves a specific purpose.  Our results show that the PSII life-cycle is a tightly regulated process that employs multiple strategies to prevent harmful premature electron transfer activity before its multiple components are fully assembled.\n\nAnother major goal of this project was to understand how the cyanobacterium Cyanothece 51142 performs nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis in the same cell, despite the fact that the oxygen produced by PSII inactivates the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase.  We discovered that during periods of nitrogen fixation, which occurs at night, the D1 protein of PSII is replaced by a copy with a slight, but functionally significant, alteration.  When the altered copy, which we call sentinel D1n (sD1), is incorporated into PSII, oxygen evolution can not occur, thus allowing nitrogen fixation to take place.  During daylight hours, when nitrogen fixation is not occurring, sD1 is replaced by a normal functional copy of D1, and photosynthetic activity resumes.  Many nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria contain sD1, suggesting that the sD1 \"switch\" is a widely employed mechanism among unicellular nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.\n\nOverall, our results have increased significantly our understanding of the dynamic regulation of PSII during its life-cycle, and deepened our understanding of the early events in photosynthesis.  This knowledge provides an improved foundation for bio-inspired efforts at harnessing solar energy, either via artificial photosynthesis or through the production of various biofuels.  In addition, our application of mass spectrometry-based structural proteomics techniques to photosynthesis research has demonstrated that such techniques can answer important questions about membrane protein complexes, a growing area of interest in biology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Himadri B Pakrasi"
