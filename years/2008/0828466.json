In order to keep the temperature of devices such as semiconductors and lasers to be cooled within a few degrees Celsius using microchannels, novel coolants with high heat capacity are needed. This project proposes the use of novel high heat capacity nanomaterials for active thermal management. For this purpose, fundamental issues associated with the nanomaterials will be studied in intricate detail. This research will focus on the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, the compatibility of the nanoparticles with water, and the measurement of thermophysical properties of the novel fluid. Special attention will be given to the structure-property correlation, the size- and interface-dependent phase change behavior of nanoparticles. The ultimate goal of the project is to integrate the areas of nanomaterial chemistry, heat transfer and thermodynamics in the form of nanoparticle synthesis, surface modification, thermophysical property measurements and microchannel heat transfer to study the fundamentals of next generation coolants with large heat capacity at a desired temperature range. The concept to use nanoparticles to increase heat capacity is important, and the realization of such a system in heat transport could potentially impact the area. \r\nIntellectual merit: Most of the research in nanofluids until now has focused only on improving the thermal conductivity; the concept of using nanomaterial in a carrier fluid and thus increase the heat capacity of the coolant is creative and original. This has the transformative potential to significantly impact the field of heat transfer. If successful, this research project will provide new knowledge on size- and interface-dependent thermophysical properties of nanomaterials (i.e. melting temperature and latent heat of fusion), which are indispensible for the rationale design of novel heat transfer fluids. The synergistic efforts of the PIs combining the fundamental aspects of surface and colloidal chemistry with those in thermodynamics and heat transfer would pave the way for a novel multidisciplinary approach. As a result, research especially in the areas of nanomaterial synthesis and novel cooling solutions of high heat flux electronics would be intellectually impacted. \r\nBroader impact: The encapsulated nanoparticles are important for low temperature heat removal in microelectronic devices. The outcome of this project broadly helps in the advancement of the science of physical chemistry and the technology of active thermal management of high power microelectronics and lasers. The proposal also outlines plans on how to use this novel concept of heat transfer to provide a broad impact on education at various levels. The clear pathway to the exploratory concepts will be attractive to middle and high school students, helping to ignite their interests in science and engineering. The activities associated with the development and characterization of encapsulated phase change nanoparticles are highly instructive for graduate students in developing scientific habit of critical thinking, creative problem-solving and building advanced engineering platforms on fundamental technologies and advanced materials. The proposed research will form the cores of two PhD dissertations.",
