 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work pursues the development of a new algorithmic framework which\r\nallows for the first time efficient computation of higher-order\r\ninteractions in biomolecules. Algorithms are created to demonstrate\r\ntwo important applications on much larger scales than were previously\r\ntractable, each representing a new door to a larger class of further\r\npossibilities: Axilrod-Teller (3-body) simulation, and Hartree-Fock\r\n(4-index) quantum-level simulation.  The multidisciplinary project\r\nbrings together experts in computer science, protein folding, and\r\nquantum chemistry.\r\n\r\nBiomolecular simulations usually break down complex chemical systems\r\ninto a balls-and-springs mechanical model augmented by torsional\r\nterms, pair-wise point-charge electrostatic terms, and simple\r\npair-wise dispersion (van der Waals) interactions. However such models\r\noften fail to capture important, complex non-additive interactions\r\nfound in real systems.  Though the criticality of multi-body\r\npotentials for more accurate and realistic molecular modeling has been\r\nargued by various authors, their evaluation in systems beyond tiny\r\nsizes has not been previously possible due to the unavailability of an\r\nefficient way to realize the computation, which is cubic or higher.\r\n\r\nThe work augments a framework for computational problems called\r\nGeneralized N-Body Problems, which contains any such higher-order\r\nphysical potential. The framework was originally developed to\r\naccelerate common bottleneck statistical computations based on\r\ndistances, utilizing multiple kd-trees and other space-partitioning\r\ndata structures to bring down computation times both asymptotically\r\nand practically by multiple orders of magnitude.  This work extends\r\nthe framework with higher-order hierarchical series approximation\r\ntechniques, demonstrating how to do a fast multipole-type method for\r\nhigher-order interactions for the first time, effectively creating a\r\nGeneralized Fast Multipole Method.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms are validated in biochemical systems chosen to clearly\r\nillustrate many-body interactions: hydrogen bonds and three-body\r\ndispersion interactions. Parameters for potential functions are\r\nobtained using customized machine learning methods on dual data sets\r\ngenerated by the co-PI's labs: high-quality quantum mechanical\r\nbenchmark data and experimental protein structures.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to demonstrate working many-body codes able to explore the\r\neffect of modeling higher-order interactions on a larger scale and\r\nmore systematically than ever attempted previously.  The intellectual\r\nmerit of the work is the elucidation of the first multi-tree multipole\r\nmethod capable of accurately and scalably performing these fundamental\r\ntypes of higher-order physics computations.  The potential broader\r\nimpact is the ability to perform more accurate next-generation\r\nmolecular modeling, with implications for fundamental biology and drug\r\ndesign.  \r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page at \r\nhttp://www.cc.gatech.edu/~agray/gfmm.html",
