Gross\r\nIOS-0745782\r\nMorphogenesis of the Vertebrate Eye\r\n\r\nWhile eye formation is a well-conserved process across animals, the molecular mechanisms and the cell and tissue movements that facilitate many aspects of the process remain unclear. Research in this CAREER award focuses on understanding the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vertebrate eye development.  Of particular interest to the Gross lab are the mechanisms that lead to the formation of the ventral optic cup, which subsequently undergoes a number of distinct cellular movements that are required for normal eye formation.  To identify these mechanisms and genetic components required for ventral optic cup formation, the Gross lab utilizes the zebrafish embryo as a model system in which genetic, molecular and in vivo imaging techniques can be applied. The research addresses two central questions in eye development: (1) What are the regulatory components that lead to ventral optic cup formation, and how do these components interact as a network to facilitate this process? and (2) What are the cellular mechanisms that govern optic cup morphogenesis, and how are these regulated?  \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project lies in a betterment of the understanding of the molecular and developmental mechanisms underlying eye formation, processes that have not been well characterized in any organism.  The Broader Impacts of the project are threefold: (1) numerous training opportunities are provided for graduate, undergraduate and high school students in contemporary molecular and genetic techniques; (2) the research is integrated into a cutting edge laboratory course for undergraduate students that involves them first-hand in the research process and enables them to gain a unique research experience as part of their undergraduate training; and (3) the PI, graduate and undergraduate students participate in a number of outreach programs designed to attract and retain underrepresented students in the sciences, and to provide meaningful research experiences to these students.",
