 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steganographic and Steganalytic Methods\r\nfor Timing Channels with Side Information\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses dual problems of steganography (design of\r\ncoding techniques for covert communications) and steganalysis\r\n(design of statistical methods for detection of covert communications)\r\napplied to timing channels on asynchronous networks. Hidden messages\r\nare embedded by modulating the timings of a cover packet stream\r\n(e.g., SSH file transfer data; keystroke data for instant messaging\r\nor other interactive session) which plays the role of side information\r\nfor the encoder. The encoder is also subject to causality and latency constraints.\r\nHence the objective of this research is to construct and analyze novel methods\r\nfor covert communications over timing channels with side information,\r\nas well as novel methods for detecting them.\r\n\r\nThe project is organized around four research thrusts:\r\n1) Develop mathematical formulations and research the information-theoretic\r\n\tlimits of timing codes with side information. The problem formulation\r\n\tincludes a statistical model for the input packet process (e.g., \r\n\ta renewal process, or a Markov process), steganographic constraints\r\n\t(to guarantee statistical undetectability of the embedded messages),\r\n\tcausality constraints, and latency constraints.\r\n2) Develop and analyze a family of practical codes that satisfy the above\r\n\tconstraints. These codes are nonlinear and stochastic (they inject\r\n\tan optimized amount of ``noise'' via a queue) and\r\n\twe refer to them as queue-based steganographic codes.\r\n3) Develop an efficient computational framework for optimizing\r\n\tinformation-theoretic functionals associated with queueing processes.\r\n4) Construct a steganalysis learning machine (based on empirical data\r\n\tand various timing codes) which returns a binary decision about\r\n\tthe presence of hidden data.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact and Intellectual Merit:\r\nThis project is highly multidisciplinary and involves a synergy between\r\nresearch and educational activities in random processes, communications,\r\ncoding, queueing theory, information theory, statistics, and learning\r\ntheory. The project addresses fundamental questions with applications\r\nto information protection and cybersecurity.\r\nOther impact includes computational methods for queueing processs,\r\nsteganographic methods for signal processing and other timing channels, etc.\r\nMany graduate students are interested in moving into such an\r\nattractive research area, which combines breadth and strong emphasis\r\non fundamentals with practical relevance. We intend to train these\r\nstudents for leadership roles in information technology.",
