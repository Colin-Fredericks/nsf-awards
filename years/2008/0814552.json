The purpose of this meeting is to enable US researchers to become more engaged in this field, which is being led by researchers from outside the US.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, inverse problems impact a wide variety of interdisciplinary engineering fields, including (but not limited) to thermal transport.  Significant advances have been made primarily outside the US, indicating that US researchers are lagging their international counterparts.  It is thus very important for US researchers to be involved with this meeting, particularly junior investigators.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include support for a number of junior, female, and under-represented minority researchers to attend this meeting.  A key goal of the conference is to enhance international collaboration opportunities.  Results from the meeting will be disseminated by publication in the Journal of Physics:  Conference Series, an open-access web-based journal.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.",
