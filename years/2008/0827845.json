To achieve these goals a better understanding of events at the bone-material interface is needed, as well as the development of new materials and approaches that promote osseointegration.  Profs. Popat and Grimes propose the use of well controlled nanostructured titania interfaces to enhance implant osseointegration.  The integration of controlled nanoscale titania architectures into existing implant materials can promote osteoblast differentiation and matrix production, and enhance short- and long-term osseointegration.  Moreover, the ability to create model nanodimensional constructs that mimic physiological systems can aid in studying complex tissue interactions in terms of cell communication, response to matrix geometry, and effect of external chemical stimuli.  The fabrication routes developed by the group of Prof. Grimes in collaboration with Prof. Popat are flexible and cost-effective, enabling realization of desired topologies and chemistries on existing bulk implant materials with sufficient stability and strength.  Such control over the nanoscale interface can prove advantageous for a broad range of biomaterial applications.  Since the reality of creating a new biomaterial technology is predicated upon achieving affordable, biocompatible and durable materials that are able to withstand complex physiological environments, the intellectual merit of this project is to integrate nanotechnology with biology by: (a) Developing technologies that can be easily adopted to exiting technologies in market; and (b) Understanding what influences and controls bone-material interfaces.  A further Broader Impact of the work is the training of next generation of scientists and engineers, and providing outreach-oriented laboratory internships for undergraduates and underrepresented students in science/engineering to work in this vitally important interdisciplinary field.",
