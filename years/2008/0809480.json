 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor J. Paul Devlin of Oklahoma State University is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his project to explore the process of formation of clathrate hydrates at low temperatures and pressures. Clathrate hydrates are solid water networks that resemble ice, but include cage-like structures containing trapped small guest molecules such as methane, carbon dioxide or even hydrogen. Professor Devlin and his undergraduate research students will use Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of icy nanoparticles to study the formation rates of clathrate hydrates in the presence of small amounts of special guest molecules (proton-acceptor molecules), which can catalyze clathrate hydrate growth even at low temperatures (100 - 150 degrees Kelvin) and pressures (a few thousandths of an atmosphere).  The Devlin group will also study the exchange rates of guest molecules within the clathrate hydrate structure, for example the replacement of trapped methane with carbon dioxide. Professor Devlin will work with theoreticians, including Professor Victoria Buch of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem to compare his experimental results with simulations based on ab initio molecular dynamics code. The transport of guest molecules to (or from) reaction zones at ice - hydrate interfaces has been identified as rate controlling. The computer simulations should reveal the most basic steps of this transport. \r\n\r\nThis research project will reveal important fundamental information about an interesting class of ice-like solid materials. The undergraduate students involved will receive a rich and rigorous experience in spectroscopy, kinetics, and physical chemistry in general. The research may ultimately be relevant to future carbon capture and sequestration technologies.",
