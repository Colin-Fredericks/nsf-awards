Modern algorithms\r\nshould be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical\r\nquantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the\r\ncomputational effort and making realistic 3d simulations\r\nfeasible.  Mathematical models in biophysics (such as\r\nbiomembranes in both fluid and gel state), in materials science\r\n(such as crystal surface morphologies and bilayer actuators), and\r\nin shape optimization (including both fluid and solid mechanics)\r\nare typical yet quite distinct examples addressed in this\r\nproject.  Their multiscale structure manifests in rapid\r\ntransients and slow motion regimes in time, as well as point and\r\nline singularities (interfaces) and thin layers in space.  Large\r\ndomain deformations, perhaps leading to topology changes, is\r\nanother intriguing feature.  The goal of this project is to\r\ndesign, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite\r\nelement methods for these multiscale problems, most governed by\r\ngeometric partial differential equations, with space-time error\r\ncontrol based on a posteriori error estimation.  This project\r\nbuilds upon, and in fact extends and enhances, the work of the\r\nprior NSF Grant DMS-0505454.  It is organized in a number of\r\nsmall but interrelated topics permeated by the roles of geometry\r\nand adaptivity throughout, from issues in numerical analysis and\r\ncomputation to applications. \r\n\r\n     This project blends quite delicate analytical,\r\ncomputational, and modeling issues in several areas of research\r\nof strategic importance such as nanotechnology, materials and\r\nmanufacturing, biotechnology, and high performance computing. \r\nDesigning smart electro-mechanical devices as well as\r\nunderstanding key functions of lipid membranes in living\r\norganisms, both at the nano and microscales, require powerful and\r\nflexible computational algorithms capable of dealing with large\r\nshape variations.  This project develops such tools.  It is a\r\ncollaborative and interdisciplinary project involving a number of\r\nscientists in the US (four of them engineers and physicists) and\r\nabroad, as well as several students and postdocs.  Because a\r\nsubstantial effort is devoted to education and human resource\r\ndevelopment, most resources are used to partially support\r\nstudents and postdocs. \r\n\r\n",
