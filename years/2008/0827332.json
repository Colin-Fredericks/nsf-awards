 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests partial support for physics graduate students, young and minority faculty to attend an interdisciplinary workshop and conference on complex systems to be held in 2008 at the University of Illinois.  Some of the topics to be covered emergence and control of solitary waves on fractal networks, including the dynamics shock waves, pulse creation and propagation on neurons, the emergence and control of traffic congestions, and epidemics. Other topics are the origin of cascading power and their suppression and the spread of infections in form of epidemics, including the spread of ideas and new technologies. Modeling the transition from peace to war, the emergence of terrorism, and the rise and fall of social organizations will be covered as well.\r\nThe broader impact is that the conference is one of the primary networking conferences for people working in cross-disciplinary areas.  Women and minorities are encouraged to attend by being provided with support.  Also more than 50% of the attendees will be graduate students and the students will be exposed to the latest methods in dynamical systems and learn how they can be applied in very diverse situations. \r\nThe funds will be used for travel and lodging expenses for the scientists, primarily graduate students, un-tenured assistant professors and minority faculty.\r\n",
