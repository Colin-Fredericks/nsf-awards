 "awd_abstract_narration": "Along with the rapid development of Internet Protocol (IP) based technologies and wireless networks, telecommunication and Internet services providers (SPs) are showing great interests in technologies for integrating wireless access networks, wireless backhaul networks, and Internet backbone into a seamless IP solution. One of the fundamental issues towards this ambitious objective is that each network along an end-to-end path needs to be properly dimensioned and managed for quality of service provisioning, for which this project is expected to make significant contributions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project will develop accurate capacity planning tools, efficient medium access control protocols, and dynamic resource sharing techniques for highest resource utilization in both wireless access and backhaul networks. In particular, all the developments are neatly organized under a generic cross-layer framework, where the complex interplay between the upper-layer IP application data arrival process and the lower-layer wireless medium access control are accurately captured and modeled.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: On the education front, this project incorporates theoretical studies in the areas of queueing theory, optimization, and wireless networking, with practical investigations including computer simulations and testbed experiments. This interdisciplinary research will not only provide various training projects to undergraduate and graduate students, but also inspire students to pursue high-quality research with a creative, open-minded, cross-disciplinary perspective. On the industry front, the success of this project will produce techniques that not only facilitate the SPs to squeeze the most out of the wireless networks for highest revenue, but also trigger new customer/SP interplay models and new network integration models.\r\n",
