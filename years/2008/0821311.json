In following years, the campus aims to purchase 32 new compute nodes annually to create a 128-node cluster. The initial purchase was jointly funded by institutional seed money and contributions from individual faculty and several departments. This award  provides funding to be used by these researchers from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics to contribute money for 16 compute nodes to this facility for a total of $80,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Izu and co-workers [Biophysical Journal, pp. 88-102 and pp. 103-120, 2001]. It consists of a system of three time-dependent partial differential equations, so-called reaction-diffusion equations, which are coupled through non-linear reaction terms. The most important component in the driving terms of the equation for the calcium concentration is the superposition of Dirac delta distributions that models the CRUs as point sources.\n\nRealistic simulations can only be obtained using mathematical models that discretize the the three-dimensional cell domain with a high-resolution numerical mesh.  Therefore, a special-purpose computer code is needed that pays great attention to the efficient use of computer memory and that is able to pool the memory from several nodes in a parallel computing cluster.  Moreover, large final times are required to reach laboratory time scales and to simulate for long enough to allow several waves to propagate through the cell.  The numerical solution of this problem is made additionally challenging by the discontinuities caused by the Dirac delta distributions, for which the classical finite element theory does not apply. This means that standard numerical analysis cannot guarantee the convergence of the numerical method, which is necessary to trust the computed solutions.\n\nInitial work by graduate student Alexander Hanhart [M.S. thesis, 2002], funded by a UMBC DRIF grant, demonstrated that a parallel implementation can achieve the required high resolution of the numerical mesh.
