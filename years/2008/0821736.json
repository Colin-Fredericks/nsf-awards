The instrument will house and evaluate the techniques for locating 9-1-1 callers, securing public safety answering points (PSAPs), ensuring continuous availability of 9-1-1 services during large-scale emergencies, providing neighborhood notifications, improving interagency coordination, and enhancing 9-1-1 services for the deaf and hearing-impaired through video phones and instant messaging. Additional goals include measuring the performance of  LoST (location to service translation), LCP (location configuration), and SIPLC (SIP location conveyance) protocols used in PSAP; developing a tool for performance measurements for call processing and security (PSAP), translating the development efforts to engineering guidelines, and disseminating the results across government organizations, standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) and 9-1-1 centers. NENA and Denco 9-1-1 center support testing and validation of the tools and instrument. Thus, the project develops \r\n-\tA flexible, high performance instrument and tools for locating callers, specifically to investigate security and scalability of next-generation 9-1-1 technology,\r\n-\tThe instrumentation required for investigation of several research issues related to 9-1-1 notifications during disaster, and\r\n-\tA dissemination and educational program to transfer the results to industry and government agencies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n This project enables new research and education in 9-1-1 services. Workshops will be organized (3 have been held in VoIP security) and dissemination will be forthcoming. The research projects enabled will be helpful to deaf and hearing- and speech-impaired individuals.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Next Generation 9-1-1 systems will bring with them an enormous level of potential.  The use of SIP as a major infrastructural component allows for extending 9-1-1 operator capabilities in new and exciting ways.  The wide array of sensors within smart phones allow new types of information to be gathered beyond the traditional audio or even video.\nLocation Detection in High Rise Buildings\nLocating a person calling 9-1-1 is not a trivial task, particularly when they are in a building where GPS is not available.  Using the magnetometer on a phone and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, we developed a methodology of determining an individual's location based on the surrounding magnetic field with &gt; 90% accuracy.  Our methodology leverages the magnetic field variations within a building caused by the building's structure, materials, and electrical power systems.  These variations give different locations within a building a unique fingerprint.  In turn, these fingerprints can then be compiled together to create a \"magnetic map.\"\nCommunication Quality\nWe used ClearSight Analyzer to measure RTP video quality in reference to different resolutions, frame rates, and codecs.  Some of the codecs used included Theora, H.261, and MPEG standard.  Quality was measured using \"VQFactor\", a proprietary ClearSight metric.  When bit rate was varied using a constant video resolution, quality was seen to correlate directly with bitrate.  When bitrate was held constant and resolution was varied, we found that quality declined with increasing video resolution.  Furthermore, based on our experiments, we concluded that large screen size is not necessarily required for perceived video quality to be good.\nSmart Phone Resource Strain\nVideo calls will put a much higher strain on smart phone hardware than audio calls.  We found that during a video call on the Google Nexus One, a phone with a 1 GHz Qualcomm Scorpion CPU, video takes up an average of 12-15% of CPU time during a call.  We also found that video with movement has negligible impact on CPU usage compared to still video.\nNew Capabilities\nSIP may be extended to give the operator a greater amount of information by creating new types of SIP INFO messages.  For example, an INFO message may carry information about a caller's health status or phone capabilities.  However, we also found that there is potential for issues with some SIP proxies as they may filter out unknown INFO messages.\nRemote Media Control\nA smart phone is equipped with a wide array of capabilities, many of which are not available in a telephone application or may be very difficult for a caller to find.  We developed a SIP INFO message based protocol designed to allow the operator to query the caller's phone for capabilities which are then used to control the phone remotely.  This implementation allows new features to be added to a phone with no change on the operator side which eliminates any platform dependence.\nHeart Rate Monitor\nUsing a phone's camera and flash, an individual's heart rate may be monitored.  We were able to find the heart rate with an accuracy of at least 95% compared to a commercial heart rate monitor.  This information may then be sent back to the operator and emergency medical services.\nBlood Pressure Monitor\nSimilarly, we used a smart phone to estimate an individual's blood pressure through the use of linear regressions.  Our software automatically looked for correlations between heart rate, pulse transit time (the time for a pulse to go from the heart to the finger tip), and ejection time (the time between the \"lub\" and \"dub\" of a heartbeat) relative to both systolic and diastolic pressure.  The average accuracy of the calculated blood pressure was greater than 90% in all measurements when compared with commercial off-the-shelf blood pressure meters.\nBreathing Monitor\nOne of the most important vital signs to a 9-1-1 operator is breathing and whether breathing is normal or not.  We found that using a smart phone..."
