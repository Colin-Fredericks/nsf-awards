 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is based on the concept of sea-ice system services as a unifying theme. The proposal focuses on the role of sea ice as a provider of services that are crucial to a range of users, such as parts of an ecosystem, indigenous populations, the oil and gas industry, or humanity as a whole, through the climate regulating services provided by the ice. This proposal has four elements (1) Conduct a sea-ice field course that provides a comprehensive, integrated perspective on the state-of-the-art in field studies of sea ice, using sea-ice system services as a unifying concept to link course modules and aid with research design. (2) Develop a handbook and multimedia products comprising high-quality digital video, animations, and supporting computer programs that serve as resources for (under)graduate education, professional training, and as a reference work for scientists in a range of relevant fields. (3) Distill an outreach multimedia product out of the materials referenced above that can serve as an entry point for members of the public interested in following up on media reports on sea-ice change as well as a teaching tool in K-12 curricula. (4) Create a documentary record of the state-of-the-art in studies of the sea-ice system, the services it provides to a broad range of users, and the (field) methods employed in its study during IPY-4 that can serve as a reference point and legacy product for future outreach as well as studies of science history and science culture. Using these three methods, the project intends to address five major aspects of sea ice:  (1) the changing role of sea ice as an important habitat for microorganisms at the center of Arctic marine foodwebs, (2) the status of the polar bear and other marine mammals heavily depending on sea ice, (3) the role of sea ice as a hazard to shipping and coastal infrastructure, (4) the reduced stability of coastal sea ice as a source of concern to indigenous hunters, (5) sea ice in the context of environmental security, e.g., clean-up of oil spills in ice-covered waters. The project will train a cadre of interdisciplinary researcher to address sea ice issues and leave a legacy for International Polar Year. The project also integrates the sea ice knowledge of Alaska Natives living in Barrow. \r\n\r\n",
