 "awd_abstract_narration": "Size-dependent ?super-piezoelectricity? in nanostructures\r\n\r\nThis grant provides funding for a combined theoretical and experimental study to understand the emergence of size-dependent ?giant? piezoelectricity in ferroelectric nanostructures. Modeling approaches ranging from quantum mechanical atomistic calculations to continuum methods will be employed to understand the basic science underpinning this phenomenon. Flexure, artificial cracks and indentation based experiments on inhomogeneously strained nanostructures will be conducted to verify the predictions. \r\n\r\nThe expected benefits of the program will be both educational and societal. Piezoelectricity, the development of electrical polarization upon mechanical stimulus and thus the conversion of mechanical to electrical energy, has numerous applications ranging from simple consumer products such as cell phones to complex technological advancements: atomic force microscopy, sonars and artificial muscles among many others. Accordingly, anticipated research outcomes are in next generation sensors and actuators, energy harvesting, artificial muscles that exhibit simultaneously large motion and force and an enhanced understanding of how to design multi-functionality. The educational impact is that both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in emerging and interdisciplinary research that falls at the intersections of materials science, mechanics, and physics. The grant puts specific emphasis on research experience for high school students and undergraduate students and in particular female scholars. Research findings will be incorporated into courses, modules specifically targeted towards grade school students and broadly disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and the PI?s websites.\r\n\r\n",
