 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project focuses on hardware features \r\nto improve the security of software systems.\r\nBy refining the coarse-grained protections available in\r\ntoday's architectures, the project will aim to protect\r\nthe integrity of individual software objects or components.\r\nThe hardware mechanisms force tight controls on \r\nthe execution of software components, which\r\nprogrammers can define to be as large as entire\r\napplications or as small as individual objects. \r\nThe goal is to rapidly detect and also recover from attacks that\r\nimproperly access memory or take over the CPU.\r\nThe approach also includes hardware-supervised\r\nrecovery, to enable systems to return to normal \r\noperation after an attack and to protect the recovery \r\nprocess itself from attacks.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this project include the ability to \r\nthwart a large class of attacks and the potential of\r\ndeveloping more robust software systems in the future.\r\nRecovery, which has received somewhat less attention than\r\nattack prevention or detection, is especially important for \r\nembedded systems that do not have the luxury of intervention \r\nby human operators.\r\n\r\nThe project will be used to train graduate students and to \r\nfeed material into graduate courses taught at the three \r\nparticipating universities. Modules will also be developed for \r\nuse in K-12 education with the aim of drawing students into \r\nconsidering careers in computer science and engineering.",
