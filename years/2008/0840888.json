This two-day workshop will bring together three traditionally disparate groups: engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists. It will open up this new area in a significant way, allowing people from greatly different disciplines to communicate with each other and form cross-disciplinary bridges. It will add value to the existing series of workshops in establishing a Cyber-Physical Systems community by identifying the challenges in cross-disciplinary communication and publishing the commonalities and differences so that new researchers can be brought into the Cyber-Physical Systems community.",
