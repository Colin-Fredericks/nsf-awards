 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Biology-Inspired Super Artificial Compound Eyes (SACE) and Their Medical Applications\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop biology-inspired \"super\" artificial compound eyes and to explore their laparoscopic applications.  The approach is: 1) developing on hemispheres tunable microlens arrays in which each lens element can be individually tuned by thermal-responsive hydrogels as artificial muscle; 2) developing a prototype laparoscope that has the scanning and focusing capability; 3) applying nanotechnology and surface engineering to improve upon the robustness and the spherical aberrations of the microlenses. The PI also proposes a coherent and comprehensive educational plan that aims to promote interdisciplinary education, the involvement of underrepresented students, and outreach to the local communities and general public.\r\nThis research can advance biomedical imaging and benefit many fields of surgeries.  The microlenses can form functionally complex arrays used as physical, biological, or chemical sensors or surveillance tools.  This technology could have ophthalmologic applications such as in ocular surgery, intraocular lenses, and correction of presbyopia.  This interdisciplinary research can contribute to many research areas, including functional soft materials, micro-optics, microfluidics, and lab on a chip.  \r\nThe proposed research has a broad range of applications related to public health, biodefense and environmental monitoring, thus having great potential economic impact.  This project will generate great opportunities for students at both college and K-12 levels, benefit college curricula, advance interdisciplinary education, and encourage undergraduate and underrepresented students to conduct frontier research.  The strong outreach program by partnering with local schools and established programs for K-12 and public education on science and engineering will have profound societal impact.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
