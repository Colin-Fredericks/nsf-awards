The space\r\nof all complex projective structures on a fixed surface is a\r\ncontractible manifold which has two natural but very different\r\ncoordinate systems: A classical analytic approach uses the\r\nSchwarzian derivative to identify the moduli space with a\r\nholomorphic vector bundle over Teichmuller space, while a more\r\nrecent geometric approach builds each projective structure from\r\nhyperbolic and Euclidean pieces in a process known as grafting.\r\nThe major goals of this project are to understand the relation\r\nbetween these two coordinate systems (both theoretically and\r\nusing computer experiments), and to use that understanding to\r\nstudy Teichmuller spaces and deformations of Kleinian groups.\r\nThe PI will also explore ways in which the techniques used to\r\nstudy complex projective structures could be adapted to other\r\nlow-dimensional geometric structures, such as real projective\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThe study of the shapes and configurations of geometric objects\r\nhas applications to diverse areas of science and engineering,\r\nfrom understanding the folding of proteins or the formation of\r\ngalaxies to programming autonomous robots that must navigate\r\ncomplex terrain.  In a mathematical abstraction of this type of\r\nproblem, one studies the space of all possible shapes, or \"moduli\r\nspace\", of a geometric object.  This project focuses on the\r\nmoduli space of complex projective Riemann surfaces, a class of\r\ngeometric objects that encode information about 3-dimensional\r\nspaces (hyperbolic manifolds) in 2-dimensional form.  Through\r\nboth theoretical study and computational experiments, the PI will\r\ndevelop new tools for analyzing these structures, enhance the\r\nconnections between 2- and 3-dimensional geometry, and expand\r\napplications of these structures in related fields.  The project\r\nwill also produce computer images of the moduli space, displaying\r\nits rich structure and complexity in a way that can be\r\nappreciated by scientists and non-scientists alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
