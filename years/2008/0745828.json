 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many species are introduced into new habitats, but only a small percentage survive and become harmful. This project will explore the genes that undergo natural selection after a species invades freshwater lakes and reservoirs from saline habitats asking: Are the same genes involved during repeated and independent invasions? The study uses as a model a small crustacean, the copepod Eurytemora affinis, that was introduced to freshwater systems in North America through ship traffic. The project (1) will identify genomic regions that are directly linked to freshwater adaptation and (2) analyze whether shared genetic mechanisms might be involved across independent invasions. The genes, or locations in the genome  will be identified through quantitative trait loci (QTL)-mapping, using both standard and high-resolution approaches. These analyses will be performed for multiple independent invasions to determine whether the same genomic regions are involved.\r\n\r\nBiological invasions have enormous impacts on ecosystem integrity, commerce, and public health, with economic costs of  approximately $150 billion per year in the US alone. The Great Lakes are heavily affected, and serve as a major corridor for inland invasions. Knowing the genes and traits that undergo selection during invasions would provide insights into why only certain species invade, potentially providing the means to stop them. The project will also help train undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research in my laboratory focuses on why some species are able to invade new habitats, whereas other cannot.  In the past few decades many species have invaded the North American Great Lakes from more saline habitats.  For example, some of the most harmful invasive species into the Great Lakes originated from the more saline Black and Caspian Sea region, such as zebra mussels, quagga mussels, and the fishhook waterflea.  The environmental and economic damage caused by such invaders approximate $120 billion per year in the US alone (Pimental 2005).  Brackishwater species might make particularly good invaders because they come from fluctuating and unstable environments and would tend to more readily tolerate environmental change (Lee &amp; Gelembiuk 2008).  However, upon invading freshwater habitats, they must survive the low salinity conditions in order to become successful as invaders.  How do invasive species survive while invading novel stressful environments?\n\n \n\nMy laboratory has been using the copepod (small crustacean) Eurytemora affinis as a model system to understand how a brackish/saline species could invade freshwater environments.  Within the past century, this species has invaded freshwater habitats multiple times independently in different geographic locations throughout the world (Lee 1999).  This species provides a particularly good experimental model because of their short generation time and ease of growing in the lab.  The short generation time allows us to conduct multigenerational (selection) experiments and also create genetically inbred lines, which is needed for powerful approaches that could identify genes that underlie important traits. \n\n \n\nMy laboratory has identified physiological and evolutionary changes associated with freshwater invasions by the copepod E. affinis (Lee et al. 2003, 2007, 2011).  We have identified evolutionary shifts in ionic regulation associated with invasions from saline into freshwater habitats (Lee et al. 2011).  We have found evolutionary changes in ion uptake activity and expression (of V-type ATPase and Na,K-ATPase) following freshwater invasions, and parallel shifts associated with independent invasions in the wild and selection experiments in the laboratory.  We have also found increased body fluid regulation (hemolymph osmolality) associated with invasions into freshwater habitats (Lee et al. In Review).  In addition, our preliminary results suggest that some genes that underlie ionic regulation might be undergoing natural selection during invasions.  We have begun developing more rigorous tests of selection that incorporate demographic effects, in collaboration with Yuseob Kim at Arizona State University (Kim &amp; Gulisija 2010).\n\n \n\nOverall, our results indicate that ion regulatory mechanisms are likely undergoing natural selection during freshwater invasions, suggesting that traits associated with ionic regulation are limiting freshwater invasions.  Understanding the specific mechanisms that underlie and limit invasions will allow us to make predictions on which species could invade and on the types of habitats that might be vulnerable to invasions.\n\n \n\nFour graduate students have been involved with this project.  We have trained over ~20 undergraduate students in quantitative and molecular genetic techniques to carry out this project.  Several undergraduate students completed honors theses and contributed to scientific publications.  Results from this study were presented at a workshop on invasive species in 2009 and a public outreach symposium on Applied Evolution at the University of Wisconsin in 2010.  The symposium on Applied Evolution was organized to discuss how evolutionary research could provide important insights into solving problems in medicine, agriculture and environmental conservation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/02/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carol E Lee"
