The approach is to develop an effective atomic layer deposition process to synthesize epitaxial dielectric thin films on wide band gap semiconductor with improved interfacial and electrical properties.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is on materials selection, synthesis, interface engineering, and device integration that would enable the design and fabrication of future generations of improved electronic devices.  By combining experimental studies using state-of-the-art analytical techniques with theoretical analysis using density functional theory, ultra thin and lattice matched metal oxide thin films will be designed and synthesized on wide band gap semiconductors to enhance the functionalities of power electronics and radio frequency integrated circuits.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research is on the education and training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school summer intern students through engineering courses and hands-on research.  Research outcome will be integrated into two courses developed by the principal investigator to maximize the impact of the research.  Two graduate students will be supported under this program to pursue their doctoral studies.  Senior research projects and summer internship positions will be offered to undergraduate and high school students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, to work on materials characterization and spectroscopic analysis outlined in the proposed research and to help their long term career development in academia and industry.  \r\n",
