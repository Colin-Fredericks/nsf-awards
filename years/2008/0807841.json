In order to offer competitive research and research training programs in science and engineering, it is imperative that all US faculty, including faculty at minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and students conducting research have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation enabling them to perform high quality research. MSIs have an essential role in the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of under-represented college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. Ensuring the competitiveness of faculty and students enhances diversity in STEM and helps the science and engineering enterprise achieve the objectives outlined in the America Competes Act. \r\n",
