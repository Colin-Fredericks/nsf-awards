 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have witnessed a dramatic change in the goals and modus\r\noperandi of malicious hackers. In particular, hackers realized the\r\npotential monetary gains associated with Internet fraud. As a result,\r\nthere has been an integration of sophisticated computer attacks with\r\nwell-established fraud mechanisms devised by organized crime. This\r\nprocess has created a vibrant underground economy.\r\n\r\nRecent research has mostly focused on the visible aspects of the\r\nunderground economy, such as botnets, spam, and phishing. However,\r\nlittle has been done to understand this economy as a whole and to\r\nanalyze and model its characteristics. What is needed is a holistic\r\napproach to the study and analysis of the underground economy that\r\nincludes all aspects of the criminal process. In this project, novel\r\ntechniques and tools are developed that help to analyze the\r\nunderground economy and obtain a comprehensive picture of the complete\r\ncriminal process. More precisely, the underground economy is analyzed\r\nand modeled from two different vantage points: First, the analysis\r\nidentifies the actors participating the underground economy and models\r\ntheir different roles. Second, the analysis examines the\r\ninfrastructure that is used by criminals to carry out their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project are techniques and tools to gather\r\ninformation about the infrastructure of the underground economy and\r\nthe involved actors. The broader impact is a reduction in the amount\r\nand severity of crime performed in the Internet. Moreover, the results\r\nof this project support the task of cyber crime law enforcement in\r\ntheir fight against the underground economy.\r\n",
