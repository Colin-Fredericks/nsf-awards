 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Automated intrusive algorithms for numerical\r\nsimulation of partial differential equations via software-based\r\nFrechet differentiation \r\n\r\n\r\nComputers were invented to automate tedious and error-prone numerical\r\ncomputations; ironically, programming computers is itself a tedious\r\nand error-prone task. Given the importance and expense of developing\r\nscientific simulation programs, it is worth studying whether computers\r\ncan improve the development, as well as the execution, of these\r\nprograms.  This project focuses on the open-source software Sundance,\r\nwhich automates transition from high-level mathematical abstractions\r\nto high-performance, parallel partial differential equation (PDE)\r\nsimulation code, freeing users from the burden of low-level\r\nprogramming.  This approach can reduce simulator development time from\r\nmonths or years to days or even hours. Less obvious, but equally\r\nimportant, benefits of basing software firmly on mathematical\r\nabstractions are that internal performance improvements can be\r\nautomated, and that intrusive algorithms -- algorithms that require\r\ntransformation of the equation set to produce nonstandard operators --\r\ncan be implemented much more easily because such transformations can\r\nbe carried out automatically.\r\n\r\nThis is enabled by formulating programming tasks as mathematical\r\nproblems whose solutions are then automated. Central to this is a \r\ntheorem establishing Frechet differentiation as a ``bridge'' between\r\nhigh-level symbolic programming and high-performance numerical\r\ncomputing.  Previous work has laid the foundations for this; this\r\nextends those results work to other aspects of PDE simulation and to\r\nnon-PDE paradigms such as density functional theory (DFT), and \r\ninvestigates intrusive preconditioners for coupled multiphysics\r\nproblems.  The combination of automatic high performance and\r\nthe ready availability of efficient intrusive algorithms for\r\npreconditioning, sensitivity analysis, and PDE-constrained\r\noptimization makes it possible for a high-level, general-purpose tool\r\nsuch as Sundance to actually outperform hand-coded special-purpose\r\nsimulators.  The ready availability of advanced optimization\r\nalgorithms with finite element discretizations for nonlinear coupled\r\nsystems, all with efficient implementation and a short development\r\ncycle, will be transformative to how computational scientists work. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
