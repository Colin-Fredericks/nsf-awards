 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probabilistic databases have many important applications in areas such as \r\ncrime fighting, data cleaning and integration, moving object tracking, and \r\nscience, and have recently moved into the limelight of data management \r\nresearch. Probabilistic databases are expected to allow for new data \r\nmanagement applications to arise that currently require substantial \r\nbootstrapping and development effort, if they are feasible at all. \r\nProbabilistic databases allow for very flexible ways of representing and \r\nmanaging incompleteness and are a possible foundation for a new breed of \r\nmore encompassing and powerful data integration systems. Probabilistic \r\ndatabases could give rise to more effective, lazy integration systems, in \r\nwhich the input is initially inserted into the database with a high degree \r\nof uncertainty, which is subsequently reduced using various forms of \r\ncorpus data, evidence, and probabilistic mappings and rules.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to perform foundational research and \r\ndevelop a probabilistic database management system that can support such \r\napplications. The first aim of this project is to work on efficient query \r\nprocessing techniques, with a particular focus on the essential problems \r\nof computing tuple confidence values and the closely related problem of \r\nconditioning a probabilistic database. Both are known to be \r\ncomputationally hard, and efficient techniques are expected to have to \r\nmake use of the state of the art in algorithms for constraint \r\nsatisfaction. In some applications, such as ad-hoc query processing for \r\ndecision support, exact query results are not necessary. Previous work has \r\npointed out efficient approximation techniques for simple queries, namely \r\nfor the ranked retrieval of results of conjunctive queries together with \r\ntheir confidences; however, there is currently no work on approximating \r\nqueries that themselves make use of confidence values, for example in \r\nselection operations. \r\n\r\nApproximating expressive, compositional queries on \r\nprobabilistic databases is a second main focus of the planned project. \r\nThirdly, nearly all previous work on probabilistic databases has focussed \r\non designing representation systems and query languages and laying the \r\nfoundations for efficient query processing. For real data management \r\napplications to use probabilistic database systems in the future, it must \r\nalso be possible to update such databases, and to run transactional \r\nprograms on them. While no work on this exists in the literature, \r\nuncertainty in the data poses a number of fundamental challenges to be \r\naddressed as the third main aim of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe homepage of the MayBMS project which is the subject of this proposal \r\ncan be found at   http://www.cs.cornell.edu/database/maybms/ .",
