The idea of\r\nphase field methods is to introduce a set of phase field\r\nvariables to implicitly track the moving surfaces of\r\nmicrostructures, which can be very complex and nonlinear.  In\r\nthis project, the investigator and his collaborators apply phase\r\nfield methods to study biological microstructures, especially\r\ncell membranes.  The project is mainly concerned with further\r\nanalysis on phase field methods, and the broadening of\r\napplications in studying the evolution of biological\r\nmicrostructures for which phase field methods and related\r\nconcepts can be used as a basis for more convenient or efficient\r\ntreatments.  The project includes modeling, numerical methods,\r\nand theoretical analysis. \r\n\r\n     The investigator studies some theoretic and algorithmic\r\nproblems in phase field methods that still remain unsolved or\r\npartly unsolved today, such as asymptotic behavior of phase field\r\nvariables (which is related to the De Giorgi conjecture), the\r\nconsistency of the fluid coupled phase field model to the sharp\r\ninterface model, topological information retrieval formulations,\r\nand convergence and acceleration of some popular algorithms.  He\r\nalso applies the theoretical results to the modeling and\r\nsimulation of some complex microstructure systems, especially\r\ncellular adhesion and rolling in a shear flow, which can be used\r\nin the study of blood flows.  Cell motility is another complex\r\nbiological phenomenon that can be simulated using phase field\r\nmodels.  Also considered is the simulation of acto-myosin driven\r\ncell oscillations, which can be applied to study cell division\r\nand migration, two of the most important functions of living\r\ncells.  Besides simulating some observed phenomenon, phase field\r\nmodels can also be applied to predict details of some structures\r\nthat are not yet fully known, such as highly folded membranes. \r\n",
