 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by first-order unexplained differences among rocky planets in our solar system and by the fascinating range of exoplanets now being discovered, Dr. Linda Elkins-Tanton (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) will create forward models of planetary formation to allow observations to be linked to formation processes and conditions. The terrestrial planets in our solar system differ in their core fractions, water content, earliest crustal compositions, and in the isotopic characteristics of their mantles, all of which form important constraints on bulk composition and formation process. Many differences remain to be understood, for example, the large size of Mercury's core, the effects of high temperature on Mercury's surface, and the formation processes of smaller bodies like Vesta. The discovery of exoplanets has introduced a wide new range of planet models.  Most of the 250 exoplanets now known exhibit characteristics and exist under conditions different from those in our solar system; little context exists in which to understand these planets.  The main goals of the research component are to (a) provide a compositional context for understanding the masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions of newly-discovered exoplanets and (b) use modeling results compared to observations of Mercury, Vesta, and the available list of smaller exoplanets to better understand the processes that created their current measured characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with the Northeastern University School of Education, Dr. Elkins-Tanton will bring new understanding of planetary evolution to science curricula in secondary school, and will link interested undergraduate science majors, including those participating in the research, with in-service secondary-school teachers. Many middle- and secondary-school Earth and space science teachers are primarily trained in biology, chemistry, or physics, though Earth and space sciences are required K-12 topics in Massachusetts. The tasks that promote these goals are to (a) bring cutting-edge research knowledge to in-service middle- and high-school science teachers in relevant formats within summer professional development courses, (b) introduce science teaching as a career to undergraduate science majors, focusing on those from universities without education departments, by incorporating undergraduates into the workshops, and (c) support teachers as they develop inquiry-based Earth- and space-science units.  Use of the material in the subsequent school year will be tracked and supported and a web site will facilitate communication and distribution to a wider audience.  In addition, this project will forge critical relationships between disciplines (experimental and theoretical planetary geology and petrology, and observational and theoretical astrophysics). In addition, two to three graduate students and two to three undergraduates will be supported and trained in research.",
