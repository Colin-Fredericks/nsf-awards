 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inquiry in the Community: Building Science Capacity in Volunteer Leaders\r\n\r\nInstitutions:  Girls Scouts of Western Washington and Seattle University\r\n\r\nGirl Scouts of Western Washington (GSWW) is collaborating with Seattle University to develop an innovative new model for science learning in youth programs.  The project is designed to increase the use of science inquiry among Girl Scout Leaders, facilitate learner-centered inquiry, change the culture of program delivery, and enhance science literacy.  New parent volunteers, who are Girl Scout troop leaders, will be trained to deliver inquiry-based science to girls ages K-3 in environmental science, wildlife biology, and botany in a manner which makes scientific questioning and exploration integral to the girls' experiences.  Deliverables include a training curriculum adapted from the NSF-funded Fundamentals of inquiry, quarterly training workshops for adult volunteers in inquiry-based science methodologies and content, an enhanced volunteer support system (including online and peer networks, science activities, and resources), and a replicable model for incorporating science in community youth programs.  The inquiry activities will be modified for use in an informal learning setting  and may be easily  integrated into the existing science activities for Brownie Girl Scouts such as community service, camping, cookies, and \"Try it\" events.  Potential strategic impact includes the advancement of a new model for volunteer training which scondarily changes the organization culture and expands the current understanding of how science learning occurs in community contexts.  The proposal includes a comprehensive mixed methods evaluation to be conducted in the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology.  It is anticipated that this project will reach 360 women and over 1,600 girls in disadvantaged urban and rural communities in western Washington.",
