 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE COMPSAC2009 will be held in Seattle, Washington from July 20 to July 24, 2009. \r\nThis preeminent technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research \r\nresults in the computer systems and software: theory and applications along with a number\r\nof workshops with topics such as Security, Trust, Privacy for software; Barriers towards \r\nInternet-Driven Information Services, Software Cybernetics, Open Complex \r\nSystem - Metasynthesis of Computing Paradigms, and is widely attended by researchers and\r\npractitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as COMPSAC is of paramount\r\nimportance for the research and career development of graduate students. Participants\r\nhave the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote talk sessions, and\r\ninteract with many others performing leading-edge research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to support approximately 12 graduate students in the United \r\nStates to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will target graduate students,\r\nin particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences\r\nis an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel \r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n",
