 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract\r\nThe algorithmic complexity (efficiency) of many geometric algorithms depends mainly on the size\r\n(combinatorial complexity) of the structure to be computed. The Principal Investigators study a\r\nvariety of problems originating in robotics, computer graphics, cellular networking, bioinformatics,\r\netc., that belong to this category. To bound the complexity of the corresponding structures, they\r\noften need sophisticated techniques drawn from several branches of mathematics and theoretical\r\ncomputer science. In most cases, the bulk of the work is devoted to the study of arrangements of\r\ncurves and surfaces in Euclidean spaces, which lies at the heart of the field. During the process,\r\nthey develop important new results in several classical mathematical disciplines ranging from Helly\r\ntheory to Tur\u00b4an- and Ramsey-type extremal graph theory. Specifically, the PIs are studying:\r\n(1) Combinatorial, topological and algorithmic problems related to structures in arrangements\r\n(lower envelopes and cells, levels, vertical decompositions, incidences with points, etc.) of surfaces\r\nin higher dimensions.\r\n(2) Applications of these results to geometric optimization and range searching, to various visi-\r\nbility and intersection problems in computer graphics, to generalized Voronoi diagrams in higher\r\ndimensions, to motion planning in robotics, and to many other geometric problems at large.\r\n(3) Combinatorial, topological, and algorithmic problems involving planar arrangements of seg-\r\nments or curves, including graph drawings.\r\n1",
