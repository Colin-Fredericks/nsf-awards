It will build the capacity of the IGERT program by facilitating a learning organization where lessons learned, curricular enhancements, and emerging research are archived and made available to newly funded projects. The resource center will also enrich the ability of projects to collaborate by providing a suite of interactive online tools and online events. The resource center will further IGERT's goal of expanding and diversifying the STEM talent pool by enhancing individual project's recruitment and dissemination efforts. Further, the resource center will provide trainees with an expanded collegial network to other faculty, mentors, affiliated IGERT partner institutions and current and alumni IGERT trainees. Finally it will provide a centralized, searchable, content rich, online resource for IGERT industry partners, stakeholders, policy makers and the public at large to learn from innovative graduate education programs that bridge disciplinary and institutional boundaries.",
