 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Phase  I  project  is  directed  toward  fulfilling  the  need  of  business  and  Government  organizations  to  more  effectively  monitor  and  protect  their  electronic  networks.  Network  security  devices  (NSDs)  such  as  Antivirus,  Intrusion  Detection/Prevention,  spam/phishing  filtering,  and  bandwidth  anomaly  detection  systems  have  become  an  integral  part  of  our  networks  as  they  provide  invaluable  services  in  maintaining  data  integrity  and  confidentiality,  while  protecting  the  availability  of  our  computing  resources.   This  research  aims  at  significantly  increasing  the  timeliness,  accuracy  and  cost-effectiveness  of  NSDs  in  combating  fast changing  and  ever more  sophisticated  network  security  attacks.  If successful, this effort will provide  an  effective  subscription  service  to  update  the  security  policies  based  on  global  information and MetaFlows will increase  the  usability  of  NSDs  by reducing  false  positives.  This will have the effect of improving  network  security and cost-effectiveness  as  a  whole.     \r\n  \r\nThe  programming  and  maintenance  of  NSDs  is  today  a  significant  obstacle  to  their  wider  adoption.  The  most  common  and  significant  complaints  are  (1)  too  many  false  positive  events  (events  that  should  not  be  generated)  and  (2)  the  tremendous  expertise  required  in  the  management  of  these  devices.   These  obstacles  limit  NSDs'  adoption  by  many  smaller  companies  that  cannot  afford  to  hire  network  security  experts.  This  research  effort  will improve  the  manageability,  accuracy  and  return  on  investment  of  many  existing  NSDs.  Future  extension  of  this  technology  will  generalize  this  subscription-based  approach  to  all  other  types  of  NSDs.  Besides  improving  the  objective  security  of networks,  these  services  and  their  future  extensions  will  also  promote  a  wider  adoption  of  network  security  products.\r\n",
