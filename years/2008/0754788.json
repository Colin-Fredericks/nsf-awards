 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Kevin Austin and Howard Thomas at Fitchburg State College to develop instrumentation for recording and analyzing bat echolocation calls.  The remarkable ability of bats to seek out, recognize and capture small flying insects while navigating at high speeds in total darkness is well-documented.  Bats that eat insects generate loud, high-pitched bursts of sound that are beyond the range of human hearing.  These \"ultrasonic\" bursts bounce off of various objects in the environment and carry information back to the bat.  It has been suggested that bats' brains process the echoes to form an internal representation of space.  Many bats are thought to be able to select particular insects from a wider array of prey.  This suggests that a bat's experience of the environment, acquired through the perception of ultrasound echoes, must be quite rich.  Indeed, controlled scientific experiments suggest that bats can distinguish physical properties of objects such as hardness, size and texture.  Theories of how bats might accomplish this feat are numerous, but few have been empirically tested.  Most theories make particular assumptions about the echoes associated with various environmental objects.  One goal of this project is to provide data to validate the assumptions made about the character of ultrasound echoes from various environmental objects and prey insects.  The investigators plan to do this by developing a light-weight device that will be attached to bats to record echoes in flight.  The device will be equipped with two microphones (one for each ear) connected to radio transmitters.  The goal is to eavesdrop on the echoes actually heard by the bat and send the signals to a ground-based computer for storage and analysis.\r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge of bat calls comes from recordings made using ground-based microphones.  Field recordings of this kind are routinely made in wildlife surveys designed to quantify the distribution of particular bat species over a geographic area.  This type of recording is not well suited to the detailed study of echolocation because ground based recordings are subject to Doppler shift, a well-known phenomenon, where the observed frequency differs from the actual emission due to the relative motion of the source with respect to the observer.  To know the precise character of a bat call (and the echo) it is necessary to mount the recording device on the bat itself.  Drs. Austin and Thomas have formed a interdisciplinary collaboration intent on developing instrumentation that will allow direct recordings of bat calls in flight by mounting small radio transmitters connected to microphones on the bats themselves.  Additionally, these devices will, for the first time, enable investigators to analyze the actual echoes heard by bats.  This information promises to provide a better understanding of how bats perform navigation and feeding in total darkness.  \r\n\r\nA better understanding of how bats navigate using echolocation may allow the future development of devices that can navigate environments using auditory rather than visual information.  Robots based on this technology may be of use in search and rescue operations associated with locating people trapped in dark places like mines or caves.  A detailed understanding of bat echolocation may also lead to the development of assistive technologies for the visually-impaired.  \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students from the Biology and Computer Science departments will participate in this research.  In the process the students will have the opportunity to focus their talents on the solution of real-world research problems.  They will learn how to work across disciplines and have the opportunity to present their work at professional conferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBats are remarkable creatures.  They can navigate the forest in darkness while flying at high speeds hunting for food.  Echolocation is the process bats use to both avoid obstacles and pursue flying insects to eat.  Bats echolocate by producing  powerful vocalizations (called bat calls) at high frequencies (called ultrasound) that people cannot hear.  When bats hear the ultrasonic echoes that return a short time later, they can identify the things in front of them and tell where they are.  The sonar systems used to locate objects underwater use echolocation but not as sophisticated as a bat's biosonar.  Scientists don't exactly know how bats use ultrasound so well.  For many years, scientists have studied bat calls and associated behaviors using stationary ultrasound microphones at fixed locations. \n\nOur task was to form an interdisciplinary team of biologists and engineers to develop instrumentation that would help us understand how bats use ultrasound.  Funding from the NSF provided 13 students with training, travel and internship opportunities, full-time summer and part-time academic year employment and thesis projects.  Equipment purchased through this work will enhance the classroom experience for years to come.\n\nWhen we began our work, quite a bit was known about bat calls.  However, almost nothing was known about what bats heard.  Bats learn about the objects before them by hearing.  Our goal was to study what bats hear to better understand echolocation.  Thus, we developed a small wireless ultrasound microphone (WUM) that transmits what a bat hears to a radio receiver.  This was difficult because even the largest bats in our region (New England) weigh between 15 and 25 grams.  Our WUM had to weigh less than a penny if a bat was to successfully fly and hunt while wearing it. \n\nThe bats used for most device testing were Big Brown bats because they are the largest commonly found bats in our region.  Initial tests were performed in the forest using bats tethered to a zip line.  The WUMs were glued just behind the necks of bats captured for the experiments.  The bats generally flew tethered to the 80 foot zip line without difficulty.  It took around 8 seconds for a bat to fly the full length.  As the bat flew, we recorded the ultrasound it heard using a specially-equipped laptop computer.  After several experiments, the device was recovered and the bat was released unharmed.\n\nThe zip line tests allowed us to perfect the WUM.  Our many recordings revealed that bats echolocate normally while tethered to the zip line.  Scientists classify bat calls into three general categories, namely: search, approach and buzz.  Bats flying our zip line demonstrated all three types of call.\n\nNo one had ever recorded ultrasound from the bat's perspective before so we had to develop software tools for analyzing the data.  During a single flight down the zip line, a bat may generate over 100 calls and each call may result in echoes from multiple objects.  Echoes are difficult to visually identify in the raw waveform due to their low amplitude.  Spectral analysis is generally useful in cases like this.  Spectrograms provide a way to visualize sound in terms of its frequency content where  pitch (or frequency)  is plotted vertically, time horizontally and amplitude on a color scale.  Spectrograms can help us distinguish the echoes from the noise based on pitch. \n\nOur problem was that (like the bat) we have objects in the physical world that we would like to track based on their ultrasonic echoes.  Hospitals routinely use ultrasound to create pictures based on ultrasonic echoes from within the body called sonograms.  We wondered if we could create sonograms from spectrograms to help us visualize echoes.  A sonogram is an image made up of horizontal lines that vary in intensity according to the strength of an echo.  We developed a method that allowed us to generate one sonogram line for each call.  After solving some tricky scaling issues we were ..."
