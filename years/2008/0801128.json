 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrative, Hybrid and Complex Systems\r\nOliver Collins, University of Notre Dame\r\nPractical Approach Multi-User Channels with Unknown Fading\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop practical and useful communication schemes and receivers for channels with fading characteristics that are unknown to the transmitters and receivers.  The fundamental approach pursued is iterative estimation and interference cancellation.  Specifically, the research seeks to develop simplified receivers and estimators so that the techniques can be applied to real systems\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This work considers practical schemes for achieving capacity approaching performance limits for multi-user channels with unknown fading.  Essentially all channels in the physical world have unknown fading.  However, because of analytical difficulties, most work assumes side information about the fading is available at the receivers and/or transmitters.  Thus, the existing body of knowledge does not accurately account for the potential dramatic reduction in capacity produced by the fading process when it is unknown.  This research attempts to address this deficiency.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the project include the construction of higher-capacity wireless communications systems at a much lower cost, and with the ability to provide service to a far larger area, than present cellular voice and data networks.  The research, thus, has the potential to facilitate mobile and/or rural wideband services, increase access to emergency services, and improve scientific data collection.  The research also establishes connections between theory and practice that is essential for attracting new students into engineering.  The project aids in creating and expanding a pipeline for U.S. students to enter advanced engineering education.\r\n",
