The research aims at defining and assessing the interactions between the negatively charged protein filaments from two physical origins: orientational ordering and solution electrostatics. Specifically, experiments are planned to quantitatively determine the effects of phase transitions and weak electrostatic interactions on the morphology, motion, and rheological properties of F-actin under physiologically relevant concentrations. \r\n\tThe planned research serves several related missions. From a biological perspective, it promotes understanding of the molecular properties and the physical principles that drive protein assembly and interactions. The knowledge acquired may lead to biomedical applications by manipulating properties related to protein aggregation. From the fundamental physics perspective, various interactions that are of physical nature will be quantitatively defined. The experimental data to be obtained will be crucial for testing predictions from theoretical treatments and computer simulations that are applicable to an important class of systems involving the hierarchical assembly of filamentous macromolecules. From a material science perspective, the insight acquired through this particular system of study is also useful for interpreting similar physical properties in other systems involving solutions or gels consisting of charged and semiflexible polymers. The program, therefore, contributes a general strategy to the characterization of a range of soft materials. Finally, the program provides training in multidisciplinary research at the interface between the nanoscale mechanics and biological science. A collaborative approach is taken to provide research opportunities to selected science students and teachers from local schools. \r\n",
