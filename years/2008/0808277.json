 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support the conference IAU Symposium 258, \"The Ages of Stars\" to be held in Baltimore, MD, 13-17 October, 2008. Stellar ages play an important role in a wide variety of astrophysical contexts, from following the evolution of stars to constraining the process of planet formation to disentangling the history and structure of the Milky Way. The recent developments in theoretical models of stars and their physics (better reaction rates, treatments of diffusion, inclusion of rotation effects, etc.) coupled with new observational tests of ages such as white dwarf cooling sequences, and the ever-increasing importance of understanding ages at the young end (i.e., star and planet formation), make now an ideal time for this conference. Towards this end, several significant questions will be addressed during this meeting and a number of astrophysical questions that can be answered once ages of single or groups of stars can be estimated will be discussed. The support will be used for travel costs of attendees (preferentially directed at US and early career researchers), meeting infrastructure (projector rentals, poster display boards, etc.), and disseminating the proceedings.",
