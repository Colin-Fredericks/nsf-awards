 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and its extension, the Born-Huang\r\nexpansion, is at the core of molecular physics but only in the past two decades has the\r\nfull richness of the underlying theory been explored. From the traditional perspective,\r\nmolecular forces are expressed in terms of a mean scalar field generated by the\r\ncollective behavior of the fast degrees of freedom (i.e. electrons).\r\nThis mean field, the Born-Oppenheimer potential, acts upon the slow degrees of\r\nfreedom (vibronic coordinates) and it determines the vibrational structure of molecules\r\nand the collision properties of atoms. The modern expression of the BO theory, and its\r\nmultichannel extension, allows for the presence of effective vector, gauge, potentials.\r\nThese potentials can generate velocity dependent forces, as if from an effective\r\nmagnetic field, acting upon the slow degrees of freedom. M. V. Berry coined the term\r\ngeometric magnetism to describe the latter. They can also lead to the appearance of\r\ngeometric phases.\r\nIn this research, a Rydberg electron in orbit around a complex core is considered for\r\ninvestigation of the non-Abelian geometric phase in atomic systems. If the core has\r\nnon-vanishing angular momentum the Rydberg electron experiences an effective,\r\nnon-Abelian, gauge potential. The potential has magnetic monopole-like structure and\r\nthere are interesting analogues with phenomena familiar in particle theory. An effective\r\nspin-orbit interaction is derived and is related to the screened charge of the monopole.\r\nThe effect of that interaction on the level structure will be calculated and compared with\r\nexperimental measurements. Rydberg atoms can also be manipulated to form coherent\r\nwave packets, so called designer atoms, and a study of numerical wavepackets\r\nin the field of the monopole is proposed. This work will advance the fundamental\r\nunderstanding of Rydberg systems that have possible applications to quantum\r\ninformation and computing.\r\nIn addition to Rydberg systems, similar gauge structures arise when describing the\r\ncollision of atoms. In the scattering problem, serious difficulties in application of the\r\nBorn-Huang method arise. The mathematical framework of gauge theory promises to\r\nshed new light on some of these long standing difficulties. There is lots of interest,\r\ngenerated by advances in the laboratory realization of cold molecules, to develop\r\nadvanced capabilities for tests of parity violation and the variation of fundamental\r\nconstants. Full understanding of molecular dynamics is required in order to account for\r\nall systemic effects, including those of induced vector potentials, that might influence\r\nhigh precision measurements.",
