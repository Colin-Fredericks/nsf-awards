 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12). This project is developing a two-semester, project-oriented biochemistry laboratory sequence with twin goals of improving students' understanding of how science is conducted and increasing students' ability to apply principles to new situations.  The guided-inquiry laboratory sequence is being organized around a single molecule, hemoglobin, to provide the context for developing skills in experimental design as well as an experience in independent, small team research projects.  Independent assessment is utilizing a mixed method design with an external evaluator and includes both formative and summative evaluation.  The broader impact of this proposal is in enhancing interdepartmental collaborations among chemistry and biology faculty and developing a novel adaptation that can serve as a model for preparing students for independent research.  The materials and results are being disseminated at local, regional and national conferences; chemistry and biochemistry educational journals; and at the project web site.",
