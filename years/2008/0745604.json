 "awd_abstract_narration": "At least 59 species of native birds have become extinct in the Hawaiian Islands since humans arrived there some 1000-1300 years ago. Early reports indicate that the endangered Hawaiian Petrel once \"darkened the skies\", but later declined in numbers until it was nearly extinct by the early 20th century. This study will address: 1) how large the Hawaiian Petrel population was before human arrival, 2) if Hawaiian Petrels on different islands are genetically distinct subpopulations, 3) if the diet and feeding location of Hawaiian Petrels changed over time, and 4) how changes in the population genetics or feeding ecology relate to human activities. These topics can be unmasked by analyzing DNA sequences, stable isotope values, and radiocarbon dates from bones of petrels that died during the past 3000 years - beginning before and continuing after human arrival.  The study will also assess whether dramatic declines in numbers of breeding seabirds affected Hawaiian plant communities by reducing the flow of nutrients from ocean to land in the islands.\r\n\r\nThe effects of humans on island and ocean ecology can be understood through studies like this one.  By analyzing modern and ancient bird bones, Hawaii's past is brought to life and offers a baseline for ecological restoration and management.  For example, understanding marine nutrient flow could prove important for forest and watershed conservation, and reconstructing change in petrel diets over time can enlighten fisheries management.  The project engages several students and captures the interest of young Hawaiians who participate in the fieldwork, and also the interest of the press (e.g. http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Aug/07/ln/hawaii708070352.html). It will include the development of creative media for the public and K-12 students.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The forebears of modern Polynesians first spread eastward into the Pacific Ocean approximately 3500 years ago and by 800 years ago had colonized virtually every inhabitable island in Oceania.  The vast marine ecosystem and islands of the central Pacific were essentially untouched by human ecological impacts until then.  It is well known that human impacts in the Pacific caused ecological change to island ecosystems leading to the extinction of hundreds to thousands of bird species and forests.  The myriad of islands in the Pacific provide a network of breeding sites to seabirds, which are important carnivores in the marine ecosystem but particularly vulnerable to predation on land.  During the Human era in Oceana, paleontological and archaeological records document extirpation of many colonies, predominantly of procellariids, a group of seabirds that includes the Hawaiian Petrel (HAPE).\n\nIn the Hawaiian Islands, the Hawaiian terrestrial ecosystem was strongly affected by human-induced change.
