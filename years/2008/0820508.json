 "awd_abstract_narration": "The small molecule abscisic acid (ABA) is an important hormone that regulates many aspects of plant growth and development and plays a critical role in plant response to environmental stress. As a stress hormone, ABA is a critical regulator of how plants cope with extreme changes in the environment such as droughts or unexpected freezes. Because of its importance during exposure to environmental extremes, the ABA response pathway has been reengineered by modern biotechnologists to create plants with improved yields under conditions of drought. Thus, research on the biology of ABA has had, and will continue to have, an impact on agriculture and human welfare. \r\nABA, like many hormones, works by binding to receptors that turn on signaling pathways that ultimately control downstream physiological processes. Recent studies have identified three receptor proteins that bind ABA. The receptors identified to date all show strong exclusive preference for the natural form of ABA, but several studies have suggested the existence of undiscovered receptors that can bind to both natural and non-natural forms. A detailed understanding of how ABA is perceived is a major goal in plant biology and will require identifying all of the receptors that recognize ABA.\r\nThe Principal Investigator's has discovered a family of 5 new proteins that are candidate receptors for both natural and non-natural ABA isomers. Because these are the first candidate proteins to interact with both natural and non-natural forms of ABA, the research should fill a current gap in our understanding of how ABA works in plants. The research project will use biochemical and molecular genetic approaches to understand the function of these proteins in plants. In addition, modern biological research requires training students to be confident moving between fields to solve problems. The investigator's lab engages in interdisciplinary research at the chemistry-biology interface and is an ideal environment for training scientists able to meet the challenges of modern scientific endeavors. The project will include activities focused on training undergraduate students and expose students to multidisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry and biology.",

The lack of sufficient water during a growth season is one of a number of adverse environmental conditions that scientists generally refer to as abiotic stresses; other abiotic stresses include high soil salinity, early freezes and flooding, to name a few. Given the devastating consequences that abiotic stresses can have on crop yields and prices, there is broad scientific interest in understanding the internal mechanism that plants use to cope with abiotic stresses so that these mechanisms can be modulated in crops to improve yield under adverse growth conditions. For example, as soil water levels decrease, plants produce increased levels of a hormone called abscisic acid (ABA). ABA limits water use by closing small pores on leaf surfaces (called stomata) and induces other physiological changes needed to cope with reduced water. The ability of ABA to mitigate the effects of drought has been known since the 1970&rsquo;s, however the underlying molecular mechanism by which ABA elicits its effects was unclear when this NSF proposal was submitted.
