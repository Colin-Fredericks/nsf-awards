 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for student travel to and participation in the 2008 Gaseous Electronics Conference. The meeting focuses on combining aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with electric gas discharge physics, chemistry and engineering.  The Gaseous Electronics Conference brings together members of the atomic, molecular, and optical physics communities with researchers interested in applications of gas discharges and plasmas. The conference is being held in Dallas, TX from 13-17 October, 2008. Support is limited to students enrolled in a Ph.D program in the United States who are presenting a paper at the conference. Support is competitive and will be based on the anticipated contribution by the individual to the success of conference.  Support is provided by both the Plasma Physics Program  in the Physics Division and the Combustion and Plasma Systems Program in the Divison of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.",
