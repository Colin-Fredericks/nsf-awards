 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of bijections between combinatorial objects\r\nhas always remained an attractive part of Enumerative\r\nand Algebraic Combinatorics.  Despite their wide\r\napplicability, their remains a complete lack of formal\r\nunderstanding as to which bijections are equivalent,\r\nand which one are \"good\" in a sense that they preserve\r\nthe natural structure of the combinatorial objects.\r\nWe initiate the study of asymptotic properties of\r\npartition bijections and claim that a large class of\r\nwell known bijections are in fact \"asymptotically stable\".\r\nUsing CS-style reduction ideas we propose the first\r\nformal way to formulate that all classical Young tableau\r\nbijections are in fact linear tie equivalent.  Other\r\ncombinatorial objects and several new directions\r\nare also discussed.\r\n\r\n \r\nSince the early days of mathematics, combinatorial objects\r\nhave played an important role.  These objects, which\r\ninclude various sets of graphs, trees, partitions of\r\nintegers, tilings of regions with smaller shapes, etc.\r\nFinding or estimating the number of such objects is a\r\nfundamental problem which has been resolved in some\r\ninstances and remains open in many other case.  Sometimes\r\none is able to relate the number of such objects to the\r\nnumber of other objects by means of a direct combinatorial\r\nargument (a bijection).  We propose an in-depth study of\r\nthe nature of these bijection, as to whether (and how)\r\nthey reveal not just the number, but structural results\r\non these combinatorial objects.\r\n",
