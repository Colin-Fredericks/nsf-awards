 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to provide an improved understanding of snow depth ? climate relationships and the physical mechanisms involved. An extensive body of scientific literature describes the linkages between snow extent anomalies and climate, but snow extent alone does not tell the whole story. Variations in snow depth, which do not necessarily coincide with variations in snow extent, may have a distinct and considerable impact on climate over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recently completed research by the PI clearly distinguishes the climatic significance of snow depth, and complements the somewhat limited existing literature on snow depth ? climate linkages. This serves as motivation for this proposal to identify the responsible mechanisms.\r\nThe snow depth - climate relationship is likely to be very complicated, and involve different dynamic and thermodynamic processes across varying spatial domains and scales. Some facets of this overall relationship are better understood than others, while still other facets may benefit from updated analyses using more recent data and/or modeling resources. Therefore the proposed work will specifically target two aspects of the overall snow depth ? climate relationship where our current state of understanding is incomplete. Two hypotheses are investigated, the first involving a remote climatic cause for snow depth variability over North America, and the second involving a local climatic consequence of snow depth variability.\r\nA key resource for this proposal is a newly released, long-term, gridded, daily snow depth dataset covering all of North America (Dyer and Mote 2006). Its availability offers exciting new opportunities to study snow depth and its interactions with climate, especially in northern regions of North America where snow depth information has historically been lacking but is expected to vary considerably. Hence this frequently neglected parameter can be empirically evaluated over a broader domain than previously was possible. Furthermore, snow depth perturbation experiments will be performed using both a one-dimensional snowpack model and a regional climate model, to comprehensively evaluate the thermodynamic and near-surface dynamic processes associated with anomalous snow depth.\r\nDiagnosing specific climatic causes and consequences of snow depth variability, rather than an exploratory and unfocused study of the overall relationships, hold the strongest prospects for success and impact within the hydrologic and climate science communities. Recognition of snow depth as an important contributor to climate variations will promote continued improvements in the still relatively crude snow parameterizations in climate models, and also in snow depth remote sensing techniques. The concept of distinct snow depth and snow extent linkages will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of snow ? climate relationships, and provide new information to help identify additional regions/seasons which may hold some predictive capability for climate. This in turn would have far-reaching societal benefits for water resource management, hazard mitigation and anthropogenic climate change.\r\nThe proposed research will be managed to maximize its broader impacts on education. Despite its focused scope and relatively modest budget, the project will support three students at dramatically different stages of their educational career. An existing doctoral candidate at the PI?s institution will complete her dissertation, and ensure a smooth and efficient transition to a new doctoral student for the duration of this project. Furthermore, one high school student at New York City?s prestigious Bronx High School of Science will be sponsored, whose research on this project will be entered in the Intel Science Talent Search competition (http://www.sciserv.org/Sts/). Such early exposure to research can inspire students to pursue careers in science and engineering, and foster the development of the next generation of researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe amount of snow that covers the ground over North America can vary quite a bit from one year to the next, and also within any single year.  The goal of this project is to better understand why these variations occur, and what these variations may mean for the climate of North America.  This is a\ncomplicated relationship to untangle, since many different factors can produce snow, and the fleeting nature of snow on the ground makes it hard to pinpoint how it may affect other aspects of climate.  Furthermore, while most previous studies investigate the presence or absence of snow on the ground, this study focuses on how much snow is on the ground.  These two features of a snowpack are clearly related but not identical, so looking specifically at snow depth may reveal patterns and relationships that are not apparent when looking only at snow extent.\n\n \n\nThe specific objectives of this project are to target two pieces of this puzzle.  First, many decades of climate data are analyzed to identify preceding and remote conditions that trigger unusual snow depths over North America.  Second, computer models that simulate the evolution of a snowpack, and the climate over North America, are used to isolate what would happen if unusually deep or shallow snow covered the ground over the course of a single snow season.  Thus this project is designed to diagnose climatic causes and consequences of snow depth variability over North America.\n\n \n\nThe climate data analysis found that one of the main climate indices that regulate the Northern Hemisphere, the Pacific-North American pattern, can influence winter snow depths throughout North America.  This climate pattern has already been linked to both temperature and precipitation variations over North America.  These previously established relationships are each shown to subsequently affect snow depths in different regions.  Taken together they result in broad variations in snow depth that span virtually the entire continent.\n\n \n\nThe computer modeling found that unusually deep snow serves as a thermal blanket which insulates the warmer ground from the colder atmosphere.  By trapping more heat underneath the thicker snowpack, the air becomes colder.  This result is consistent with previous studies that used less direct methods to demonstrate this insulative effect of a snowpack.  Furthermore, the atmospheric cooling that results is shown to extend beyond the immediate area of the snowpack variation, both downwind and upwards.  This suggests that unusually deep or shallow snow depths over a broad geographic region may have the potential to influence climate in other parts of the world.\n\n \n\nOverall, this work contributes to the idea that snow cover over mid-high latitude land surface regions can be linked with climatic behavior, analogous to the way that tropical ocean temperatures are linked with global climate pattern.  While only about 30% of the earth\u00c6s surface is covered by land, in the mid-high latitudes of the northern hemisphere it is about 50%, and is comprised of two large, contiguous land masses.  Thus there is considerable potential for large, sustained variations in snow cover and its interactions with climate on a hemispheric scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gavin Gong"
