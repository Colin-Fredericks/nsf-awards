 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR) provides a focal point for National Research Council activities related to the earth sciences.  Under the aegis of the Board, ad hoc committees provide independent advice to the federal government on a wide range of earth science issues, including research, the environment, natural hazards, resources, data, and education.  It also provides guidance related to U.S. participation in international earth science programs.\r\n\r\nThe Board and its six standing committees (Committee on Earth Resources; Geographical Sciences Committee; Committee on Geological and Geotechnical Engineering; Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data; Committee on Seismology and Geodynamics; and Mapping Science Committee) hold approximately two meetings each per year.  At these meetings, potential studies are discussed and developed.  Many of these activities are in response to requests from agencies of the federal government for advice on specific technical or policy issues.  Other activities are federally mandated, or initiated by the Board in accordance with its efforts to support the continued health of the earth sciences.  The Board responds by establishing an ad hoc committee or panel to address the specific issue.  The Board continually seeks to provide accurate and timely input to support wise decision-making in government, academia, and industry.\r\n\r\nPresently, BESR is overseeing eight ad hoc studies with the several more expected to begin in 2008.  Studies presently under way are:  Challenges and Opportunities in Earth Surface Processes; Critical Mineral Impacts on the U.S. Economy; Deep-Time Geologic Records for Understanding Climate-Change Impact; FEMA Flood Maps:  Accuracy Assessment and Cost Effective Improvements; Grand Research Questions in the Solid-Earth Sciences; The Earth System Context for Hominid Evolution; National Requirements for Precision Geodetic Infrastructure; and Strategic Directions for the Geographical Sciences in the Next Decade.\r\n",
