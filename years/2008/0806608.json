 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partnership with Industry for Engineering Cooperative Experiences and Scholarships (PIECES) builds on existing programs and relationships with regional employers and professional organizations to provide financial assistance, academic and social support, and opportunities for work experience to talented students entering the School of Engineering. The objectives are to increase the quality and diversity of engineers, computer scientists, and construction managers entering the regional workforce. PIECES provides financial assistance for the first two years in order to include more students in the program. Afterwards, students have opportunities to work as interns in area firms to gain valuable experience and to provide continued financial support. In addition to internships, students have a variety of other opportunities to interact with practicing professionals. \r\n\r\nPIECES funds three cohorts of approximately 16 students (48 total). The areas that are served are economically-depressed rural counties and the inner-city schools of a large city which provides a diverse applicant pool. Recruitment strategies build on existing recruitment efforts and scholarship programs. Recipients are selected based on financial need, academic merit, communication skills, and professional motivation. PIECES also benefits the general population of students in the School of Engineering as the culture of partnership with industry during students academic careers becomes established and local employers increasingly seek these graduates. In addition, commitments from local employers to consider funding the program after the NSF grant ends provide much-needed long-term scholarship assistance to attract freshman into engineering when the employers see the benefit of PIECES and are more willing to invest in student early academic careers.",
