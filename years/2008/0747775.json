 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to develop the thermo-mechanical models of concrete under multi-axial loading and realistic thermal environment.  Under severe fire conditions the mechanical behavior of concrete and of structural elements made of concrete is currently not well understood, and the engineering data and models needed to design concrete structures under such thermal environment are not available.  Experiments will be conducted in the thermal testing facility especially developed for this purpose to simulate real fires such as short duration high intensity and progressive burning.  Testing methodology will be developed to measure the permanent damage due to load related strain, thermal induced strain, and transient strain in confined concrete. Based on the experiments on scaled models, the thermo-mechanical material properties and models will be established to predict temperature profiles, deformation, and damage characteristics in large scale concrete members subjected to real fires.  The results of the study will be widely disseminated to educational and professional communities involved in the performance-based design of structure for fire safety. \r\n\r\nThe completed project will have significant impact on the development of design codes and on the implementation of the performance based design concepts for fire safety.  First, the data from this research will provide experimental evidence in the area of thermo-mechanical modeling - a corner stone in performance based design for fire safety.  Second, the developed control fires and test methods for quantifying thermo-mechanical damage during confined testing can be applied in the development of national and international codes and standards for the fire protection of buildings.  Third, graduate and undergraduate engineering and architectural students will benefit directly through class room instruction as well as participation in long and short term research opportunities.  Finally, the educational videos developed in this project will be available to the university and professional communities.",

A performance-based design approach entails a thorough understanding of the material\u00c6s behavior as well as the changes in its mechanical and physical properties in response to fire and loading.\n\nIn the last few decades there has been a lot of research in this field, but research pertaining to state-of-the-art materials such as recently introduced concrete mixes utilizing close-to-real-scale specimens and realistic fire scenarios is still in its nascent stage.

The fire tests were performed in the large-scale Fire/Load Test Chamber (see images).  More than 90 fire tests were performed throughout the duration of this project.\n\nThe purpose of this research was to evaluate concrete exposed to the fires within the limits of real-world structural fires. Data from experimental tests conducted on concrete using fires with burning and decay phases will allow the designers to create models that will facilitate a performance-based structural fire design.  This study focused on the deformation characteristics and residual properties of normal-strength, high-strength, and very-high-strength concrete exposed to fire and structural loads. \n\nDue to the complex behavior of concrete at high temperatures, the traditional design assumption that concrete has no strength beyond 500&deg;C may be insufficient.

The new concept of Characteristic Temperature of concrete can be used as an upper-bound limit for the performance-based design of structures when the transient strains from sustained structural loads are considered in the analysis.\n\nThe structural condition after a fire is also of concern in performance-based design.  The post-fire condition can be assessed from residual properties.  To simulate what happens to structural members that have gone through a fire, the concrete deformations due to sustained load through the cooling (decay) phase were investigated and residual properties were quantified.  It was observed that su..."
