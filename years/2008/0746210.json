 "awd_abstract_narration": "0746210\r\nGesquiere\r\n\tThe study of the photophysical and optoelectronic properties of a functioning conducting polymer Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaic Device (BH-OPV) is extremely complicated due to the complex nanostructure and overall morphology of the conducting polymer materials applied in these devices. As a result, device performance has remained below expectations and controversies have arisen about the appropriate active layer composition and thickness. To fundamentally address the issues of light absorption and conversion of absorbed light to free charge carriers in active conducting polymer materials for solar energy conversion we will develop a new class of composite nanoparticles that will be studied in a device environment. These nanoparticles contain a limited number of molecules but exhibit bulk properties, and are therefore highly suitable for the study of complex processes in highly heterogeneous materials. Of particular interest are the mechanism and kinetics related to interfacial charge separation/recombination, properties that are crucial to the function of BH-OPVs and are directly affected by molecular conformation, architecture and electronic structure. By the proposed single nanoparticle studies we will gain molecular and nanoscale level insight that will yield detailed knowledge on the bulk material that would not be accessible otherwise. In particular, we will obtain an improved understanding of interfacial charge transfer and separation processes occurring at molecular and mesoscale electron donor-acceptor interfaces while developing new techniques and methodologies for research on materials for solar energy conversion.\r\n\tThe proposed research will be integrated with a novel educational approach. The  vision for science related (STEM) education is to increase interest, excitement, and retention of teachers and students in STEM education and careers through inquiry based learning, and development of a sustainable learning community between the involved learning partners (students, teachers, parents, and the community at large). In addition, current issues in STEM education are primarily motivation issues in dealing with subject areas that are considered ?very difficult?. Therefore, we propose an approach that targets both interesting deliveries, and emotional support and development for students and instructors.\r\n\tThe proposed research program also has implications beyond academia.  Solar energy is the main candidate to meet the energy needs of our society, both from the perspective of supplementing our existing energy resources as well as from the perspective of harvesting a fuel that will reduce the pressure that our society is putting on its living environment. In the short term the societal impact will also be reflected in the education and support of two graduate students from underrepresented groups at the University of Central Florida. On a broader scale, Orlando and Florida in general have highly diverse communities at the social, economic and ethnic levels. We have a large population of Hispanic and African American students of diverse social and economic backgrounds in the community. The proposed program is built to actively reach out to and include these groups in promoting STEM education and careers. The local community will also be involved in encounters with research for designed for a broad audience through exhibitions and open-house events. In addition, we have a major resource available for community outreach in the Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC). FSEC has been a leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency research and training for 30 years. FSEC is also distinguished as the largest and most active state-supported research and training institute in the United States in the area of renewable energy and building energy efficiency, and also provides additional community services including increasing community awareness to energy related issues, system testing, certification, continuing education and disaster relief among others.\r\n",
