 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual focus of this REU Site program is Biomedical Engineering research. Promising undergraduate students will learn technical skills, develop personal and project management abilities, make oral and written presentations about their work and be exposed to ethical and FDA regulatory issues related to biomedical research. The participants will be required to make a minimum of three formal presentations at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), and some students will present at regional or national meetings.  An ethics training program is included among the lectures given to the students, which also include chemical, radiological and biohazard safety, animal use in research, paper-writing, grant writing, Good Laboratory Practice regulations, and Bibliographic Resources and Searching. \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will focus on undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. All engineering and technical degree fields and some life sciences students will be considered for the program.  The program will increase the students' confidence, ability to work independently, understanding of research as a scientific endeavor, and encourage them to seek post-graduate education and research as a career objective.\r\n",
