 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project is to study molecular plasmonic materials. The methodology is to introduce tethered dyes onto the surface of flat gold nanoparticles in conjunction with a matrix monolayer. The resulting dye-molecule/gold-nanoparticle hybrid will be characterized by single nanoparticle spectroscopy (light scattering and fluorescence), atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. Parameters to be investigated include the dye-flat gold nanoparticle spacing, orientation of transition dipoles with respect to the metal surface, absorption and fluorescence wavelength of the attached dyes, and patterned placement of dyes with respect to the particular flat gold nanoparticle's higher-order plasmon intensity pattern (mode structure). The project aims to establish general techniques for functionalizing and patterning surfaces of gold nanoparticles, and to experimentally test applications using nanoparticle?s higher-order plasmon modes for wavelength-controlled direction of photon energy. The project will also investigate the effect of adding two different dyes to spatially separated regions of the flat gold nanoparticle to further explore plasmon mediated fluorescence resonant energy transfer.\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of importance to materials science. Through an increased understanding of plasmonic materials, the project is expected to contribute to the development of practical devices such as optical detectors, optical switches, and chemical sensors. The project constitutes an effective integration of research and education through training of graduate and undergraduate students in a technologically significant area. Through the inherent interactions between the directed synthetic work in the chemistry laboratory and measurements in the physics laboratory, students will gain first-hand experience functioning in an interdisciplinary and integrated research program. The research project has synergistic overlap with an undergraduate nanotechnology lab that the co-PI has developed and an organic teaching lab the PI co-supervises. The undergraduate research support can extend the experience of students though hands-on experience in either of these collaborative research laboratories. Research dissemination will be through departmental web postings, presentations to undergraduates at institutional and regional research days, and presentations at conferences as well as publication.",
