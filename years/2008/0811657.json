 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commodity systems are changing the face of storage and I/O. Commodity disks\r\nare cheap, but unreliable. Commodity file systems are widely used, but bug\r\nprone. Despite these critical problems, people rely increasingly on commodity\r\ncomputing systems to store data of critical importance, whether from an\r\nemotional (e.g., family photos), business (e.g., a customer database), or\r\nlegal (e.g., your tax return) standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Arrays in Software Project (WASP)    tackles the problem of\r\nbuilding the next generation of robust and reliable commodity RAID\r\nsystem. Such a RAID system must be reliable, detecting and recovering from a\r\nbroad range of disk faults correctly. Such a system must also integrate\r\nproperly into existing systems, thus delivering high performance and proper\r\nrecovery in the case of system crashes. Finally, such a system must be\r\nflexible, enabling new protection strategies to be developed and deployed to\r\ncope with new problems as they arise.  WASP has two major components: the\r\nfirst is a RAID design checker known as Sting, which ensures that protection\r\nschemes correctly protect data from a given set of disk faults.  The second is\r\na framework to allow the specification and automatic generation of\r\nsophisticated RAID systems; known as WASP Nest, this part of the project\r\npromises a new higher-level design methodology for commodity RAIDs.\r\n",
