 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lead-Zirconium-Titanium Oxide (PZT) is a piezoelectric material widely used as actuators for bulk structures.  Lately, PZT micro-actuators have received wide attention, because they could potentially outperform traditional micro-actuators (e.g., comb drives or thermal drives) in terms of bandwidth, energy density, and actuation strength.  As a result, PZT micro-actuators enable various new impacting applications, such as minute hearing implants and miniaturized diagnostic tools that are less invasive. To enable this new technology, PZT micro-actuators must employ PZT thin films to maintain a proper aspect ratio to function and fundamental studies are needed to enhance actuator performance by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to enhance performance of PZT thin-film micro-actuators via multi-scale and multi-domain approaches that encompass nanotechnology and mechanics.  There are two specific goals to achieve.  The first goal is to use nanotechnology to enhance material properties and yield of PZT thin films.  In particular, (a) PZT thin films via seeded nano-PZT particles and electrophoretic deposition and (b) Platinum bottom electrodes with nano-textures and indentation will be developed.  The second goal is to introduce stress relief grooves in PZT thin films to maximize actuator displacement.  \r\n\r\n",

As a result, PZT microactuators enable various new killer applications, such as minute hearing aids and miniaturized diagnostic tools that are less invasive.\n \n\nTo enable this new technology, PZT microactuators must employ PZT thin films to maintain a proper aspect ratio to function.  With PZT thin-film technologies at their infancy, the objective of this award is to enhance performance of PZT thin-film microactuators via fundamental research in nano-materials, mechanics, design, manufacturing, and metrology.  Major research outcomes and achievements resulting from this award are explained as follows.\n\n \n\nFirst, this research shows that residual stresses can substantially reduce actuator displacement.  Two actuators with identical dimensions could deliver totally different actuation displacement because of their difference in magnitude of residual stresses.  Significant residual stresses are likely to appear, when fabrication processes of PZT thin films involve high temperature environments, such as sintering processes.  When residual stresses are present, they can increase stiffness of the actuators by orders of magnitude resulting in reduced actuator displacement.  Therefore, residual stresses should be minimized during manufacturing processes of PZT thin-film actuators. We have also devised a couple of alternative means to alleviate residual stresses. One is to apply a DC bias voltage when driving the actuators.  Presence of the bias voltage will generate internal stresses that tend to balance the residual stresses thus increasing actuator displacement.  The other means is to pole the actuators at an elevated temperature to enhance piezoelectric constants of the PZT films.\n\n \n\nThe second major outcome is proper configurations of top electrodes that maximizes actuator displacement.  In a PZT thin-film microactuator, the PZT thin film is sandwiched between one or more top electrodes and a bottom electrode.  Voltage drop across the top and bottom electrodes forms the electric field that drives the actuator. If a single top electrode is employed, maximal actuator displacement is achieved when the electrode size is about 50%-60% of effective actuator size.  If two concentric top electrodes are employed, actuator displacement can be further increased by adjusting phase difference of the voltages driving the two top electrodes.  \n\n \n\nThird, we have developed a simple experimental method to accurately measure piezoelectric coefficient d33 of PZT thin films.  PZT thin films are only several microns in thickness; therefore, they need to be hosted on a supporting structure known as substrate.  Accurate measurements of PZT thin film piezoelectric coefficients thus become extremely challenging.  For one reason, any experimental measurements will unavoidably contain effects from the substrate.  Also, PZT thin films are fragile and have very small dimensions for testing.\n\n \n\nOur major achievement here is development of a very simple, low-cost, yet accurate method to measure piezoelectric constant d33 of PZT thin films.  The method adopts a mini-impact hammer (about the size of a Q-tip swab) to generate a minute impulsive force.  A load cell at the tip of the hammer measures the impulsive force, and a charge amplifier measures the charge generated by the PZT film.  Prior to the experiment, a finite element analysis is conducted to estimate a calibration constant to compensate for the substrate effects associated with the specimen.  From the measured force, charge, and the calculated calibration ..."
