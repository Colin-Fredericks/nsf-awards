 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shape analysis is a fundamental problem in computer vision.  Object recognition requires comparison of two shapes and determination of similarity.  The challenge is that an object?s shape may vary due to articulations, non-rigid deformations, or natural variations between different instances of objects from the same class.  It is important to understand how to represent shape, how to match shape allowing for deformation, and how to learn the types of variations that can occur for a particular class of objec5ts.  The PI has a number of new approaches to shape matching and has been applying them to the construction of devices for plant species identification.  The system can be used to monitor distribution or discover new species.  Shape analysis has a wide range of additional applications, from military ones to medical ones.  The PI will use the funds to develop new collaborations in statistical models of shape.",
