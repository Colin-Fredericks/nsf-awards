 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social cognition research studies how people form impressions of each other, a critical topic in today's global village. The PI  contributed the first text on this topic, and continues to conduct cutting-edge research linking social cognition to neuroscience. The European Social Cognition Network's annual conference provides a unique forum for international scientific exchange, focusing on recent developments. Funds are requested for the PI and one senior graduate student to attend the 10th annual conference in Volterra, Italy, in early September, 2008. The PI is an invited plenary speaker, and the graduate student will present a related poster. Both use the PI's Stereotype Content Model showing two fundamental dimensions of social perception; People judge each other first on warmth (intent for good or ill) and then on competence (ability to enact intents). The PI's research supports these two universal dimensions with evidence from the brain, from first impressions, from surveys, and from cultural comparisons. The model has been generated research by international colleagues, so this conference provides an opportunity to consult and collaborate. The conference mixes junior (70%) and senior (30%) researchers, from 15-20 countries, mostly but not all European; all present research and receive concentrated feedback. Attendees interact formally and informally, fostering international research collaboration and general networks for future contact, serving to integrate the younger researchers into the international scientific community.",
