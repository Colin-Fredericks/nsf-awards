The research approach is two-pronged.  The first component is a joint design method for hybrid services to be natively supported in a collaborative cellular network.  The second component of the research is a method for dynamic spectrum reuse within an extended cognitive radio (IEEE 802.22) framework.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project addresses theoretical questions and associated system design issues underpinning the transition of next-generation digital broadcasting to broadband collaborative networks. The problems addressed are relevant to the recent availability of new radio frequency spectrum for broadcast and emerging industry standards, such as MediaFlo and Mobile WiMAX, that similarly seek an evolutionary path towards such a convergence. The project, while not specific to the above technologies and standards, is intended to result in cross-cutting commercial impact.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The research seeks new architectures to provide significant capacity gains and spectrum saving in converged networks as compared to traditional, isolated wireless networks.  Integral to this work is the cross-training of information technology professionals and scientists in communication and information theory as well as in networking and practical wireless system design. Further, the investigators plan to communicate results from this research to inform the IEEE Task Group 802.22 in its consideration of standards for network convergence.\r\n",
