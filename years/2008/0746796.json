 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this CAREER project is to understand how noise in gene expression is controlled. Gene expression, similar to many other biochemical reactions involving small copy number components, is inherently stochastic. Such stochasticity inevitably leads to considerable noise in gene expression. However, \"noisy gene expression\" is intuitively at odds with the incredible precision cells and organisms achieve during development and growth. How do cells cope with noise, adopting a robust growth pattern while the underlying molecular events are inherently stochastic? In this work, real-time gene expression dynamics in single E. coli cells with unprecedented single molecule sensitivity is followed and the full noise spectrum of gene expression, both the amplitude and frequency, is quantitatively analyzed. Knowledge obtained from this study may bring in the possibilities of designing and building synthetic networks with desired properties to carry out specific functions. The educational component of this project focuses at two levels: K-12 and college. An annual Fun with Science Summer Camp that is freely open to local low-income, underserved students in eight adjacent city elementary schools will be organized to provoke their interest in learning science. At the college level, an elective course Single Molecule Methods will be developed and offered to graduate students in the School of Medicine. The integrated research and education plans allow the PI to expand the participation of underrepresented minority students in scientific research, provide broad training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students and advance the understanding of the noise control mechanisms in gene expression.",

To achieve this goal, the first step we took was to develop a single-molecule gene expression reporter to follow the expression dynamics of transcription factors (TFs, (Hensel, Feng et al. 2012).

We also developed an analytical framework for isolating different components of noise in gene expression to aid the quantitative modeling of gene regulation (Feng, Hensel et al. 2012).\n\nNext, we developed a high-resolution, single-molecule imaging method in live E. coli cells to investigate the role of TF-mediated DNA looping  in gene regulation (Hensel, Weng et al. 2013). TFs can often bind distant DNA sites to form a DNA loop. In vivo gene reporter assays have shown that changes in distal TF binding site affect gene expression, and in vitro biochemical assays have visualized the formation of DNA using purified DNA and protein components. However, formation of DNA loops in live cells have not been directly visualized and its influence on gene regulation not quantified. We were able to label two DNA loci only 2.3 kilobases apart and track their separations with ~40 nm accuracy in live E. coli cells. Combining looping frequency measurements with independent CI expression level measurements in different DNA binding sequence mutants, we showed quantitatively that DNA looping activates transcription and enhances repression.\n\nFinally, to further investigate how TFs mutually regulate each other's expression, we developed a dual, single-molecule gene expression reporting system (Fang, Hensel et al. 2014). We were able to monitor the expression dynamics of two mutually repressing TFs, CI and Cro, in real time and analyze the temporal correlation between their  interactions. We found that CI and Cro's productions are largely anticorrelated with a fast response time; most interestingly, in addition to two well expected expression states of the two TFs (high CI low Cro and low CI high Cro), there existed a third expression state where both CI and Cro are expressed at high levels. We are currently in the pro..."
