 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts research into a new class of artificial nonlinear nanophotonic materials, which makes use of the investigators ability to use nanofabrication in conjunction with intrinsic materials properties to tailor the optical response of those metamaterials. The main challenges towards a comprehensive understanding and experimental realization of nonlinear optical properties of metamaterials are that a theory of surface and bulk nonlinear optics of metamaterials is yet to be developed, and a practical means to fabricate and test such a theory is missing as well. The central rationale for this collaboration is that it matches a strong UK group at University College London with demonstrated theoretical capabilities in nonlinear optics and focused-ion-based fabrication capabilities, with a US group at Columbia University with a demonstrated record of integrated and plasmonic fabrication, optical testing, and materials preparation. Interactions with the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Nanocenter as well as that with the London Centre for Nanotechnology are also important for fabrication. The materials of interest include periodic nanostructures in ferroelectrics and in plasmonic metals. Several nanophotonic structures are examined, including photonic crystals, negative index metamaterials, and tuning of these materials using electrooptical effects in thin membranes.  New theoretical aspects are also examined, including nonlinear effects in plasmonic scattering and plasmonic enhancement of optical absorption in thin films.\r\n\r\nThe research undertaken here has several areas of broad impact. First, it fosters an interdisciplinary examination of the fundamental materials science of artificial nonlinear metamaterials, including fabrication and growth, materials physics, optical physics, and theory. Second, it enables two groups in the US and the UK, with a strong history of interactions and complementary expertise and capabilities, to collaborate. This work involves the opportunity for both graduate and undergraduate students to collaborate and travel in an international setting. Third, the project has concrete plans and procedures to seek out recruitment of diverse student collaborators via four outreach talks to undergraduates at Columbia University and one outreach talk at University College London, UK.  It also enables active participation of students in the undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP) at Columbia. Fourth, the project enables students to collaborate via extended visits and shorter trips with a major US National Laboratory, i.e. Brookhaven, in their new Nanocenter, as well as the London Centre for Nanotechnology.\r\n",
