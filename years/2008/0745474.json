 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program seeks to study how standards recommendations regarding a student-centered approach to mathematics instruction can be actualized so that systematic investigations of its impact on students? learning can be carried out. I propose (1) sensitizing studies: to understand the contexts in which mathematics faculty in community colleges teach; and (2) probing studies: to test conditions under which teaching strategies designed to influence planning, classroom interaction, and verification practices affect instruction. I use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. This work will develop our understanding of artifacts in teaching, how planning is affected and how classroom interaction can be changed in undergraduate classrooms. The results will highlight the critical conditions under which mathematics is delivered in community colleges and contribute to raise awareness of the need to support them as they strive to improve their practices.",
