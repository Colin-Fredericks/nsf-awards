 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project investigates further development of a mixed reality (MR) haptics-based virtual reality system in preparation for commercialization. This MR system will aid the physical rehabilitation of stroke patients with upper extremity disabilities. This MR system includes hardware and software designed to induce neuroplastic changes and increase mobility through mental practice, video capture body movement, and engaging mixed reality scenarios. The goals of this project will be to file the appropriate paperwork for regulatory approval of the system in preparation of use on the market, improve the system in scenarios, add mental practice and video capture scenarios, program metrics into the system, develop sensor tracking interface and telerehabilitation capabilities, and conduct clinical trial to determine system safety and efficacy. Headed by a collaborative team of qualified investigators from The Virtual Reality Medical Center, the University of Central Florida's Institute for Simulation and Training, and Kindred Hospital (consultant), this project will increase the understanding of state-of-the-art adjuncts to traditional stroke rehabilitation therapy. To date, no MR rehabilitation tool that facilitates mental practice, includes video capturing, and aids physical therapy, has ever been commercialized. The resulting marketable product will be sold to rehabilitation facilities.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase II project will lead to the commercialization of new software and hardware that can be used for further technological developments in mixed reality systems, including those for other applications such as prosthetic limb rehabilitation for amputees. The success of this project will also add to the scientific knowledge base on what is known about mental practice in rehabilitation. With over twelve million families in the U.S. alone that have members with a physical development, success in this project will therefore pave the development and commercialization of future rehabilitation systems to help this broad and underserved population. By increasing stroke patients' upper extremity mobility and rate of recovery, this system will also increase their activities of daily, enable at-home physical therapy, relieve some of the burden of caregivers, and decrease costs in lost productivity and hospital length of stay. The commercial spin-out company resulting from success of this project will be located near the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine where future joint projects will include recruiting and training students (including those from underserved populations) in research. The commercial spin-out company will also create new jobs, taxable revenue, and income within the Florida High Tech Corridor.",
