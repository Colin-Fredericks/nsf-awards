 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite significant advances in information theory and its application \r\nto point-to-point communications, a general theory governing optimal \r\ninformation flow over networks does not yet exist. Except for a few \r\nsimple network models, the capacity region of a general memoryless \r\nnetwork remains unknown, due to the complex tradeoff between \r\ncompetition and cooperation among many nodes in the network. Modern \r\napplications such as sensor networks, peer-to-peer systems, and \r\ndistributed storages further bring up a new set of challenging \r\nproblems spanning control, estimation, compression, computation,\r\ncommunication, as well as networking.\r\n \r\nThis research program provides a common set of conceptual, \r\nmathematical, and algorithmic tools for the emerging convergence of \r\ncomputation, control, and communication over networks, with the \r\nultimate goal of developing a unified framework for characterizing \r\nfundamental performance limits of such systems. Towards this goal, we \r\nfocus on three concrete problems representing the intersection of \r\ncomputation, control, and communication -- 1) the capacity of the \r\nrelay channel (how to summarize the relay's noisy observation of the\r\ncodeword: a list intersection technique via coding for distributed \r\ncomputing), 2) networked control (how to summarize the observation to \r\nstabilize a linear dynamical system: a variant of rate distortion \r\ncoding for control), 3) collision avoidance for multiple access (how \r\nto build cooperation from a common source of randomness: a distributed \r\ngeneration of correlated random variables). Novel coding schemes will \r\nbe proposed, while classical coding techniques will be reinterpreted \r\nand extended to broader applications. An algebraic framework for \r\ncapacity regions is also developed to check the optimality of such \r\ncoding schemes. The research program is complemented by educational \r\nactivities that include the curriculum development for a graduate \r\ncourse on network information theory and the writing of an accompanied \r\ntextbook.",
