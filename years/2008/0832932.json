The programs will be infused with content regarding the importance of URM presence in faculties that will include mentoring workshops to faculty advisors as well as support for successful placement of BD students in the workforce with an emphasis on appointments within the professoriate. \r\n\r\nThe program include a rigorous evaluation to collect formative and summative data for program improvements and comprehensive analyses.
