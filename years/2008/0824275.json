 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop technologies and methods towards realizing a miniature implantable many-channel wireless neural-recording device.  The approach is to develop and assemble sub-systems that can be programmed by neuroscientists to investigate scientifically and medically relevant neurophysiology.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed wireless neural recording system consists of scaleable sub-system components that can be configures to acquire a broad range of neural signals.  Furthermore, it includes a digital-signal-processing architecture that performs on-chip spike detection and alignment steps in the digital domain, which are typically performed off-chip in software.  The proposed system also must operate while being subject to varying electrode conditions (i.e., impedance and offset voltage) while dissipating no more than several milliwatts of power to avoid tissue heating and enable (future) methods of wireless power transfer.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impacts include of the proposed work include: (1) technological transformation of important fields of research in neuroscience and neurology, (2) updating and enhancing the technological capabilities and experience of doctoral students training to be brain researchers or neuroengineers, (3) the involvement of undergraduate engineering students from underrepresented groups, and (4) the general education of California high-school teachers and community-college instructors that participate in annual UCLA-sponsored continuing-education events during the summer.",
