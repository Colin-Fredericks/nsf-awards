Of critical importance to quantum computation and communication is quantum error correction, the mathematical-physical mechanism that protests the fragile quantum states from unwanted evolutions, thus enabling robust implementation of quantum processing devices and reliable transmission over noisy quantum channels. Proof-of-concept and the first constructive quantum error correction code did not appear until 1995, and the research is still at its infancy. \r\n\r\nThis research entails serious theoretic and algorithmic study to advance the state of quantum error correction. New methods will be investigated to provide a refreshing angle to the systematic construction of better families of quantum stabilizer codes and especially unrestricted low-density parity-check (LDPC) stabilizer codes. New and efficient decoding algorithms will be designed to revive several existing stabilizer codes. New concepts and tools will be developed to analyze and evaluate quantum codes. The tools used in the research is highly mathematical-physical, and involve quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, linear algebra, Euclidean/projective geometry, matrix theory, graph theory and convex optimization. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
