 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to refine an algorithmic approach and develop prototype software for workforce optimization with a focus on diversity planning and management. This project is expected to achieve the following four major objectives: 1) further enhance and extend the core technology created during Phase I and endow it with added capabilities that will be valuable for marketability as well as effectiveness; 2) enhance external communications - the software must communicate effectively with the user and database systems. In Phase I, rudimentary communications were established. During Phase II, the system will be greatly enhanced to allow for more effective use; 3) develop software as a service architecture - for greatest market penetration, the software will be deployed via the web. The system architecture will be redesigned to accommodate this requirement; and 4) perform alpha-testing - internal and external testing is critical to releasing a high-quality product. The Phase II research will strengthen the technical aspects of the product while significantly improving its ease of use, producing a system ready to enter the market.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications anticipated for the software system are to first enhance the performance of workforce diversity planning and then evolve to supporting the optimization of the entire workforce. The technology is expected to have a significant impact on the broader inclusion of under-represented talent in the workforce. We also expect the technology to lead to improved organizational performance by enabling better decisions in recruitment and retention of all employees. The software will permit an organization to model and simulate critical patterns between policies, programs, initiatives, as well as other factors such as practices and compensation. The impacts of this research include the potential to: 1) design a more effective approach (simulation/optimization) to diversity planning and workforce optimization, increase workforce diversity, capabilities, and performance; 2) support a significant social and economic initiative; 3) become appealing to attract investments as it significantly increases return and minimizes risk in diversity and workforce planning; 4) add to the body of knowledge in human resource management and decision sciences that may be leveraged to permit additional research and development.",

The original focus for the software was to support diversity planning but based on feedback from companies selected as prototypes, the software scope expanded to encompass enterprise strategic planning that includes diversity.  We currently have two customers and are now marketing the software to more organizations. The following description provides an overview of the software.\n\n \n\n \n\nOPTFORCE OVERVIEW\n\nOptTek\u00c6s software for strategic workforce planning, OptForce, is based on a bottom-up approach to predicting talent behavior patterns.  The simulation technology focuses on accurately predicting individual decisions based on demographic characteristics, as well as work-related and external stimuli.  Individual behaviors are then aggregated into cohorts of interest so that large-scale effects can be analyzed.  This approach is fundamentally different from traditional top-down or trend-based approaches used by most workforce planning tools in the market, and produces more statistically reliable results based on a careful model calibration and verification procedure.  In addition to improved accuracy, OptForce enables the evaluation of the impact of alternative programs, benefits, and hiring practices on employees based on their unique set of attributes, the work environment, and the state of the economy.  OptTek\u00c6s optimization system takes this process one step further, by enabling the planner to identify the best set of retention and recruitment programs, policies, benefits, etc. that are most likely to achieve the organization\u00c6s goals within budget.  OptTek\u00c6s simulation optimization system provides an accurate predictive tool combined with a decision support system for producing optimal workforce performance.\n\nOptForce is unique in many ways.

On a very practical level, it easily allows clients to examine multiple scenarios and determine the best options to meet their goals, and helps clients understand how to navigate the current turbulence in the economy. Most importantly, the application continuously learns and can re-calibrate itself to further improve its predictive capabilities based on new data and history that is introduced.
