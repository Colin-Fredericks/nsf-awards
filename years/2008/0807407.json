 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancing Careers of Excellence (ACE), based on Miami Dade College's prior successful NSF CSEMS/S-STEM scholarship initiatives, is identifying and recruiting 27 academically promising, low-income students and providing them with scholarships, a full range of customized student services, and special enrichment and motivational activities. ACE enables low-income, minority, and/or female students, who meet established academic criteria, to obtain Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degrees in biological, physical, or mathematical sciences, computer and information sciences, geosciences, engineering, and technology areas associated with them. These students are then eligible to transfer to a university or enter the workforce directly. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This collaboration of seven Miami Dade College (MDC) campuses brings together a diverse and experienced group of educators, students, and business partners, including local science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) firms. By capitalizing on MDC's successful experiences with mentoring and outreach, this program continues to broaden participation of underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Student support services include: (a) mentoring by faculty from STEM disciplines; (b) Web portal for students to communicate with each other, their mentors, and project personnel; (c) academic and career planning for scholarship recipients; (d) opportunities for students to interact with STEM professionals on and off campus; and (e) internships for scholarship recipients \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Project ACE helps to alleviate the critical shortage of scientists and engineers in the Florida Department of Labor targeted occupations for Miami-Dade County. Since MDC awards the most associate degrees of any college or university in the country to both Hispanics and African Americans, and has a student body that is over 50% low-income, the project provides opportunities for under-represented and economically disadvantaged students. Participants make an economic contribution to the community and serve as role models for other students.",
