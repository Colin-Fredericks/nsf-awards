 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the CUNY Science Now GK-12 project, City University of New York doctoral students will collaborate with science teachers in New York City high schools to engage students in ?real world? science that is based on the Fellows? own research. Teachers and Fellows will collaborate to develop and teach innovative Authentic Research Modules in Science that focus on scientific content and process skills together with basic literacy and numeracy skills. CUNY research faculty will assist in this process, producing a unique three-way partnership. Fellows will master a wide range of knowledge and process competencies regarding learning, instruction, and the communication of science through the project?s rigorous training program, the curriculum development process, and a high school teaching experience. The project will enrich the graduate training of CUNY?s STEM doctoral students and equip them with the skills they need to become effective science communicators in the 21st century. Involving high school students in highly engaging, research-based instructional modules will help them to master the content and process skills needed to succeed in college-level science courses and promote greater interest in science. The project will provide a rich professional development opportunity to teachers and also address the issue of making science education at the high school level more inquiry based. The Science Now GK-12 project will develop a nationally replicable, professional development model that demonstrates its simultaneous impact on doctoral students, high school teachers, research faculty, and high school students, while also leaving in place curriculum modules that can be adopted by schools.",

Thus, while each Fellow developed a different ARMS, they all experienced common core training by designing an ARMS according to a standard template influenced by best practices in learning theory, instructional design, assessment and evaluation.  This training experience began each year with a 10-day summer workshop and continued throughout the academic year with additional workshops, intended for both Fellows and teachers.  This training enhanced Fellows\u00c6 competencies related to understanding and using: written and oral communication, principles of cognitive science, inquiry pedagogy, team work, assessments, developing curriculum development, and technology for instruction.\n\nA unique professional development element of the program included a monthly writing assignment, providing Fellows an opportunity to reflect upon, contextualize, and examine all aspects of their experience, from ARMS development and classroom activities to their own research and graduate education.  Working with a writing expert, Fellows received feedback on their essays and discussed the results in monthly meetings. These writing assignments served two purposes. It enabled Fellows to develop their narrative writing skills in the context of analytical reflection, a type of writing uncommon in the sciences and unfamiliar to most Fellows when they begin the GK-12 project. Second, the assignments enabled Fellows to reflect on the links between science education, to the point where some Fellows reported thinking about their research and career paths differently. To sustain the training initiated by the program, a post program summer workshop will be offered to CUNY doctoral students in STEM fields to provide them with exposure to the design and implementation of inquiry-based instruction, as well as more general teaching issues. \n\nAuthentic Research Modules in Science (ARMS) Outcomes \n\nTo date, CUNY GK-12 Fellows and teachers have developed and pilot tested 19 ARMS that focus on the Fellows\u00c6 research and engage high school students in research projects related to their own neighborhood. By investigating their own \"backyard,\" students acquire science research and process skills (e.g., formulating questions, making observations, sampling, analyzing data) and learn how to communicate their research. Furthermore, by participating in these ARMS, students have not only expanded their knowledge base of authentic science, they also gained an expanded insight into their own communities in terms of the physical features (both natural and altered by humans) as well as how intenti..."
