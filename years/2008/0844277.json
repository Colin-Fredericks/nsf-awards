 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe University of Central Florida is taking responsibility for the operation of a unique long-path secure laser range facility on Air Force property on Merritt Island, just south of the Kennedy Space Flight Center. This facility, the Innovative Science & Technology Experimentation Facility, (ISTEF), provides unsurpassed options for laser-based experiments in rocket and satellite hyper-spectral imaging, precision laser illumination and ranging, atmospheric propagation across water, swamp and dry land, and other applications. This project plans to locate at this facility several laser-based experimental programs that are long-range extension studies of programs currently ongoing on the UCF campus. They are programs pursuing (i) the propagation of self-channeled femtosecond laser light through the atmosphere for unique propagation and interaction effects, (ii) the development of stand-off optical technologies for trace element explosives detection(iii) high-power eye-safe, (2\u00ecm) laser propagation, ranging and imaging of rockets and satellite instrumentation. The intellectual merit of the proposal is rooted in the new avenues of fundamental science of long range laser propagation and effects that will be enabled by this proposal. This science will have direct benefit to technologies needed by the nation?s intelligence community for national security needs. Providing access to the NCMR university partners, to UCF and other universities will open access to this facility for field station student training in advanced concepts of laser propagation, interaction and effects, spectroscopy, sensing and imaging. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
