 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participants in human-human conversation often entrain to one another, adopting the\r\nvocabulary and other behaviors of their partners.\r\nEvidence of this has been found from laboratory studies and observations of real life\r\nsituations. We are investigating many types of entrainment in two large corpora of\r\nhuman-human conversations to improve system behavior in Spoken Dialogue Systems\r\n(SDS). We want to discover which types of entrainment occur generally across\r\nspeakers and which seem to be speaker-specific, which types of entrainment can be\r\nreliably linked to task success and perceived naturalness, and which types of\r\nentrainment can be automatically modeled in SDS.\r\nOur research has importance for the construction of better SDS.\r\nCurrently, research SDS have attempted to entrain users to system vocabularies to\r\nimprove speech recognition accuracy: Since users are likely to employ the same\r\nvocabulary in their answers that systems use in their queries, systems have a better\r\nchance of recognizing user input correctly if they can predict word usage. However,\r\nthere has been little attempt to create SDS that entrain to user behavior, despite\r\nevidence that human beings rate humans and systems that behave more like them\r\nmore highly than those that do not. Our work focuses on determining which types of\r\nsystem entrainment to users will be most important to users and most feasible for SDS.\r\nOur results will be disseminated through papers and presentations at speech and\r\nlanguage conferences. We will also provide publicly available annotated corpora for\r\nfuture research by others.\r\n",
