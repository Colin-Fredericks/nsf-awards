 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to apply innovative nanotechnologies for creating acoustic emission (AE) sensors for real-time monitoring of structures. The proposed AE sensors are composed of Nanoscale Active Fiber Composites (NAFCs) and the project involves the design, manufacturing and characterization of the sensors consisting of piezoelectric Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) nanofibers.  This work will result in advanced acoustic emission sensors with high sensitivity, excellent conformability and suitability for being imbedded into or attached on the surface of structures. These sensors are very cost effective to produce and self-powered and can thus be conveniently applied for real-time monitoring of civil engineering structures such as bridges, dams, towers, roads, etc. Networks of NAFC sensors could be used to detect defects such as cracks in structural elements as well as delamination and debonding in various composite and sandwich components. In addition, this project also aims to develop and deploy nanotechnology-related educational materials and contribute to motivating k-12 students and students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. Through this project, the students will have the opportunity to participate in a stimulating multi-disciplinary environment in an exciting research field, more students will benefit from cybertechnology-enabled education modules documented during the process",
