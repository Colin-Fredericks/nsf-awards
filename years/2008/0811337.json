 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chihuahuan Desert is one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the world and was once rich in megacarnivores.  Due to extensive predator control, jaguars, grizzly bears, and Mexican wolves were extirpated with only mountain lion and black bear remaining in the Big Bend Transboundary Ecoregion.  This research will evaluate the effectiveness of using black bear and mountain lion as umbrella species for biodiversity conservation.  Specific objectives are to (1) evaluate movement of individual mountain lions and black bears across the border between Texas and Mexico, (2) evaluate the metapopulation dynamics of black bear and mountain lion in Texas, and (3) identify international corridors and priority areas for conservation of these species and all biodiversity in the area using an umbrella species approach. \r\n\r\nConservation of biodiversity across political boundaries poses many social, economic, and political difficulties.  Wildlife have no political affiliation and movement from source populations in Mexico are necessary to sustain many exploited wildlife populations.  However, increased efforts by the U.S. to control immigration could significantly reduce species ability to move freely across the border.  This study will illustrate the need for increased bi-national collaboration and the potential impacts of border closings in the Big Bend Transboundary Ecoregion.\r\n",
