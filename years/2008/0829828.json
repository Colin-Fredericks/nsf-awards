 "awd_abstract_narration": "EMT: Collaborative Research: Primate-inspired Heterogeneous Mobile and Static Sensor Networks \r\n\r\nAlthough previous bio-inspired models have concentrated on invertebrates (such as ants), mammals such as primates with higher cognitive function are valuable for modeling the increasingly complex problems in engineering. Understanding primates? social and communication systems, and applying what is learned from them to engineering domains is likely to inspire solutions to a number of problems.\r\nThis research involves studying and modeling modes of group behavior and communication of coppery titi monkeys, rhesus macaques, and other primate models, and applying what the investigators learn to the distributed control of heterogeneous mobile and static sensor networks. The investigators will model the social and communication behavior of these primates, which will provide biological inspiration for solving problems in communication and networking. The phases of this research include: 1) identification, interpretation, and translation of primate behavioral models, 2) assessment of the effectiveness of small and large group formations based on primate grouping models in heterogeneous mobile and static sensor networks, 3) development of bio-inspired message-based communications, and 4) development of bio-inspired behavior-based communications. This research aims to achieve a deeper understanding of effectiveness of bio-inspired communications and networking by studying primates, and to establish interdisciplinary research and education in the fields of biological modeling, sensor networking, and robots control.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have been developing a general agent-based modeling framework for modeling primate called Primate World.  In this system, primates can have motivations such as hunger, thirst, sleep, need for contact and grooming, etc.  Different age classes and the sex of individuals can be modeled.  They can aggregate and interact with each other. Thus, the behavior of a primate agent can depend on its motivations, its age, sex, and personality dispositions.  For example, if a primate agent is very hungry, has moderate motivation for grooming, and is not very thirsty, then with a high probability that it will engage in foraging behavior.  If, however, it is a juvenile that is not very hungry or thirsty, it may seek out other juveniles for play. \n\nWe are currently developing two models in Primate World.  The first is a model of wild baboons foraging in a natural environment. The motivation to maintain aggregation is fundamental to their behavior in this model.  For primate agents to remain aggregated and move in as group, the motivation for aggregation probabilistically dominates all other.  This allows group decisions to emerge.  For instance, group movement to a water hole only occurs when a number of primate agents become thirsty (it need not be more than 50% of the agents, since group movement will depend on the motivations dominating other, less thirsty agents).  This emergent group decision making is illustrated in Figure 1. We anticipate submitting a manuscript on our results during the spring or 2012.\n\nThe second is a model of rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) as they live in large groups at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis.  The model system will ultimately represent the detailed structure of each primate pen (currently not implemented yet, see Figure 2).  During the winter of 2010, we collected data on group formation, composition, and locations of animals of different age and sex classes. We will use these data to test the predictive and explanatory adequacy of our model. This model has rules and motivations for animals of different age and sex classes to aggregate and interact. Our aim is to understand how groups of different composition will interact and behave.  Anticipated completion of this manuscript for publication is the fall of 2012.\n\nThese models, as well as other interpretation and consultation regarding primate social systems, was provided to our engineering colleagues at the University of Alabama.  Primate social systems were used as a model for biologically inspired systems for computing and communications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen L Bales"
