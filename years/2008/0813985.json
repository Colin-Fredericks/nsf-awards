  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBACKGROUND\n\nThis service proposal as a part of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) provided for the field collection and analysis of chlorophyll samples during hydrographic surveys in spring and summer in the eastern Bering Sea.  This data was merged with hydrographic data to examine how sea-ice affects along- and across-shelf gradients of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, oxygen, nutrients and currents by integrating data from multiple hydrographic surveys in spring and summer with trajectories from satellite-tracked drifters and data from long-term moorings that were funded separately by NPRB.\n\nThis service proposal supported the study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf to investigate the productive marine ecosystems with extraordinarily valuable fishery and subsistence resources.  But sub-arctic seas are predicted to be one of the regions most sensitive to ocean warming. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on the extent, duration and timing of sea-ice over the Bering Sea shelf. Sea-ice in turn controls the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, water column temperature and salinity, and provides a platform for marine mammals to haul out on. Thus, the most urgent priority of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) was to examine the role of changing sea-ice conditions on the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the ecosystem.\n\nIn the Bering Sea, there is a sharp transition in temperature, salinity, nutrients and oxygen concurrent with the southernmost location of seasonal sea-ice coverage.  It is obvious that measurements of chlorophyll-a are required to understand and how this physical and chemical transition might impact upper trophic levels. \n\nThe primary goal of this proposal was to collect core chlorophyll-a observations on the spring and summer cruises as a service to the BEST program, and provide these critical biological data to all BEST investigators.\n\n\n\n\nRESEARCH ACTIVITIES\n\nDuring the 2008-2010 field program, hydrographic cruises in the eastern Bering Sea were carried out in spring and summer.  At each hydrographic station, total chlorophyll was sampled at 10 m intervals from the surface to 40 or 50m (depending on the depth of the chlorophyll maximum).  At every 2 or 3 stations, chlorophyll was sampled from two size fractions, &gt;5 &micro;m and &lt;5 &micro;m.  In addition, total chlorophyll was sampled from the ship\u00c6s underway system to calibrate the underway chlorophyll fluorometer, and in 2008 and 2009, samples were collected from ~10 cm sections in ice cores. \n\nThere are two competing methods for analysis of chlorophyll; a traditional acidification method, and a Welschmeyer method, both of which were used during the BEST program.  To make the mesoscale chlorophyll survey pertinent to all groups, each sample was processed using a unique procedure that allowed the determination of chlorophyll from both methods. \n\nPersonnel from the University of Washington and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) participated in the collection and analysis of samples including a graduate student at UAF, and assistance from members of the hydrography team.  In all, over 11,000 samples were processed during the seven expeditions.  After the samples were processed, the data were merged with the hydrographic and nutrient data, and submitted to the BEST program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rolf E Sonnerup"
