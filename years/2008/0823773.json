This is a major forum, held every four years, providing excellent opportunity for the exchange of scientific information and ideas in area of earthquake engineering.  The project will provide the US researchers an opportunity to present technical papers for dissemination of their research results, to interact with international researchers who are working in the area of earthquake engineering, and to participate in the post?conference technical event.  With the recent occurrence of a devastating earthquake in Chengdu area,  there are likely be several presentations in this conference about the effect of this earthquake, and this project will also provide excellent opportunity to the US scientists to participate in these discussions and learn from the most recent field observations.",
