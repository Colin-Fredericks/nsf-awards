 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the mechanisms of speciation allows us to understand how biological diversity has been generated in nature. This research will unravel the genetics of speciation by studying populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. This species is an excellent model system in which to study the early stages of reproductive isolation, because it has populations that are dramatically genetically differentiated but can be crossed in the lab. Thus, they show only partial reproductive isolation and speciation is not yet complete. Two specific genetic systems will be examined, both of which play central roles in metabolism and energy generation in animals. The study will probe how interactions between genes can reduce fitness in hybrids and contribute to reproductive isolation. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of reproductive isolation in Tigriopus contributes to understanding of speciation in general and improves understanding of the mechanisms by which interactions between proteins can change between diverging groups. The research includes both graduate and undergraduate training and will seek to involve underrepresented groups and females in the research process.  \r\n",
