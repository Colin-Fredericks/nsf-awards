 "awd_abstract_narration": "This HBCU-RISE proposal seeks support to implement a new Neuroscience PhD program and to build and develop our state-wide neuroscience network at Delaware State University. The project will support student stipends and research supplies, start up and release time for new faculty with neuroscience-related research and support for a weekly neuroscience seminar that will rotate among consortium institutions and be live streamed to all of them. The RISE project will provide resources for new educational opportunities for minority students and increase their opportunities to be involved in cutting edge research in an area with growing career opportunities and scientific importance. This project integrates research and education by supporting graduate students, supporting new faculty members to establish independent research programs at an HBCU and fostering scientific collaborations among faculty at DSU and partner institutions. The strengthened research and research-training infrastructure at DSU will increase the number of minority students successfully pursuing PhD degrees in the Life Sciences and increase faculty productivity. The neuroscience network will serve as a national model for successful partnership between HBCUs, majority institutions, research institutes, and industry.\r\n",
