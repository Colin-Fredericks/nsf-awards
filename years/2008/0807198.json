 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the achievement of higher education degrees by talented but financially disadvantaged students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by providing scholarships. Academic and student support infrastructure for successful graduation of scholarship recipients includes classes and programs through the college's high quality STEM departments, faculty advisors for each student in his/her discipline, and connections to student support services and professional organizations. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project advances current knowledge of best practices in student success strategies for computer science, engineering, mathematics, and science preparation programs for two-year colleges. Key personnel have extensive experience on other NSF projects, and several have been recognized nationally for innovative approaches at two-year colleges. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project addresses the severe shortage of students entering STEM fields. Therefore, it benefits society by enabling more students to enter STEM programs at four-year universities and/or the workforce. It allows the college to respond to the state's and the nation's economic needs by cultivating a workforce with the knowledge, skills, and education level in STEM fields needed to compete in and contribute to the increasingly knowledge-based global economy.",
