 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the continued operation of, and analysis of data from, a closely-spaced array of four search coil magnetometers (induction antennas) the installation of which began in September 2006 on Svalbard, Norway, for studies of ULF waves and associated phenomena in Earth?s space environment. In addition to induction coil magnetometers, instruments on Svalbard include numerous auroral imagers and photometers, multiple radars including EISCAT, SPEAR, and SuperDARN, and the northernmost stations in the IMAGE array of fluxgate magnetometers. Such a complete suite of instruments enables the association of various features in the observations with specific magnetospheric regions, such as the plasma sheet, low latitude boundary layer, cusp proper, or plasma mantle, with more confidence and reliability than in earlier studies at other locations. The role of induction coil magnetometers is to detect magnetic fluctuations in the frequency range 0.02 - 5 Hz. This project is part of an international effort by the space science community to better understand the dynamics of Earth?s magnetosphere and of its interaction with the solar wind and IMF.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Grant ARC-0806196, awarded to Augsburg College, together with NSF Grant ARC-0806338 to the University of New Hampshire, supported a collaborative research effort to use data from a closely-spaced array of search coil magnetometers, built at the University of New Hampshire, to study the Earth\u00c6s high-latitude space environment.  These instruments were deployed on Svalbard, an island archipelago in the high Arctic that is also the site of a number of other scientific instruments deployed by the international space science community.  The combination of data from these multiple instruments has provided a synergistic understanding of some of the processes in Earth\u00c6s ionosphere and magnetosphere that are still not well understood.  Search coil magnetometers are of particular use in detecting ultra-low-frequency (ULF) plasma waves that are generated high above Earth\u00c6s atmosphere.  By combining our observations of several varieties of these ULF waves with data from optical spectrometers that can detect which molecules impinge on the atmosphere from space, all-sky cameras that observe the overhead aurora borealis, and specialized auroral radars that can sensitively map the motions of the ionospheric plasma, we have been able to make significant advances in our understanding of the origins and propagation mechanisms of two different kinds of ULF waves.  These detailed studies help the worldwide space science community to better understand \"space weather,\" the natural variability in Earth\u00c6s space environment driven by activity on the sun, and to be able to better predict and prepare for the magnetic storms that can disrupt or even seriously damage many components of our world\u00c6s high-tech electrical infrastructure and electronic communications.  This grant has also provided research training to five undergraduate physics majors at Augsburg College.  Of the three who have now graduated, two are employed in STEM fields in the Minneapolis &ndash; St. Paul area, and one is in a Ph. D. program in Space Physics at Dartmouth College.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/22/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark J Engebretson"
