 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copper amine oxidase (CAO) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) belong to a family of proteins that contain quinone cofactors that are formed post-translationally from tyrosine, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-phenylalanine quinone (TPQ), and lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the modification of biogenic amines and play roles in cell signaling and collagen formation. The structure/function study of these quinone cofactors is essential to characterize the differences in their chemical properties. Although the chemical function of TPQ in CAO catalysis has been well studied, very little is known about LTQ. Further, the role of copper in catalysis in both enzymes remains unclear. The research project will further define the chemical properties of TPQ and LTQ and the role of copper in CAO catalysis, as well as develop a model system to understand the chemical function of LTQ in LOX. The research utilizes the tools and techniques of biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinorganic and synthetic organic chemistry. The results of this research will not only broaden understanding of quinoproteins but also impact fundamental understanding of other cross-linked quinones that are widely found in nature. This will aid in understanding the evolutionary advantage of selecting one quinone cofactor over the other in biological systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This multidisciplinary project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to study at the interface of chemistry and biology and participate in an international collaboration. An outreach program will be initiated to invite female students from local high schools to spend two weeks in the Chemistry department at the University of Kansas. The students will work in the laboratory and meet with female faculty and graduate students to discuss both science and the issues facing women in chemistry. These experiences are intended to encourage more women to follow careers in chemistry by demonstrating at the outset that the academic environment can be supportive to women. The workshop will also show that chemistry is a diverse subject that is much broader in scope than what would typically be taught in high school. In concert, a chemical biology course targeting upper level undergraduate and graduate students will be developed to demonstrate how chemical methods are used to understand fundamental aspects of biological systems. The course will include protein chemistry, especially post-translational modifications as well as a survey of cutting edge discoveries, intended to show students that chemists can make important contributions at the cutting-edge of biological science. Students participating in the Initiative for Minority Student Development (IMSD)-Bioscience Initiative program at the University of Kansas will be encouraged to enroll in this course. The principal investigator will actively recruit minority undergraduate students through this program into her laboratory to help them in pursuing graduate studies and a research career in the field of chemical biology.",

We initially assessed the mechanism of LTQ cofactor biogenesis using a bacterial CAO from Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) by incorporating a lysine residue in the active site and/or conducting the quinone cofactor biogenesis of AGAO in the presence of exogenous small amines.

In order to understand the molecular function of the LTQ cofactor of lysyl oxidase family of proteins, we prepared a recombinant form of lysyl oxidase-like 2 and studied the extent of post-translational modifications including LTQ formation and N-glycosylation. We found for the first time that LOXL2 secreted from mammalian cells are N-glycosylated at Asn455 and Asn644 and the N-glycans at both positions are essential for protein secretion. We also itentified the LTQ cofactor and its precursor residues as Lys653 and Tyr685. The LTQ cofactor is not essential for LOXL2 secretion, however the positive charge of the amino acid at 653 is essential for N-glycosylation and secretion. We found that when N-glycosylation was disrupted either at Asn455 or Asn644, LOXL2 accumulates in nuclei of breast cancer cells and induce epithalial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes cell proliferation and invasion, <em>in vitro</em>, in an LOX amine-oxidase dependent manner.</p>\n<p>Broader Impact: We made changes to our outreach proposal to involve pre-school and elementary school children, as well as their parents in our outreach activity.
