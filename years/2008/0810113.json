 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves three projects. The first concerns modeling and\r\nefficient simulation of heteroepitaxial growth using kinetic Monte Carlo \r\nand will build from prior NSF support which resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of a Fourier multigrid method for the fast solution of\r\ndiscrete elastic equations for complex geometries.  This work will be \r\nextended to develop methods for obtaining inexpensive upper bonds on\r\nrates, the use of local computations for elastic equations, and the inclusion of\r\nintermixing of multiple species.  The second project involves the \r\nsimulation of grain boundary motion in two and three dimensions using\r\na recently developed multiphase variational level set framework which\r\nallows one to systematically deduce level set equations for a network of\r\ngrains moving under curvature flow. We plan to extend this formulation to \r\nallow the simulation of thousands of seeds by using only a few level set\r\nfunctions.  The efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation \r\nand the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation is the third\r\nproject. The proposed algorithm is based on the observation that most of \r\nthe time, in these limiting regimes, the solutions are very localized \r\nin the wavenumber domain. This can be exploited by solving the equations in this\r\ndomain using a fast local convolution. It is planned to update the solutions\r\nby  the computation of the matrix exponential using a Krylov subspace\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nEach of the proposed projects has the potential to have a significant impact \r\non problems that are both fundamental and technologically important. \r\nHeteroepitaxial growth is scientifically interesting since it has effects\r\non both nanoscales and mesoscales.  It is technologically relevant since\r\nquantum dot materials are made in this way.  Our proposed techniques will\r\ngreatly increase the simulation speed  thereby facilitating  model development.\r\nThe study of grain boundary motion using curvature flow is a classic problem \r\nin applied and computational mathematics which has importance in material s\r\ncience. Since there are no robust simulations of a large number grains in \r\nthree dimensions the proposed project should have significant impact. \r\nThe efficient computation of high frequency wave propagation has important \r\nfacets ranging from antenna design to seismic sensing.  On the other hand,\r\nfast simulation of the semi-classical limit of the Schrodinger equation \r\ncould  provide deeper insight into chemical reaction dynamics, \r\nmolecular-surface scattering, and photodissociation, for example.\r\n",
