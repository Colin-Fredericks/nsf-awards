This will create low cost and high volume manufacturing of integrated photonic systems seen in current silicon-based electronic technology. The approach to achieve this goal is based on combining heterogeneous thin film photonic device integration with a self-assembly technique. Precise device alignment will be automatically achieved through surface driven capillary effect using a controlled attracting medium and shape in a binding site. This integration method may well revolutionize integrated photonic systems by combining photonic technology with current microelectronic technology into a batch process and bring a significant advance and impact towards wider deployment of photonics into various applications\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The power of this research is in the ability to bring and combine different materials and devices into a single material platform to realize the full potential of integrated microsystems. This leads to numerous interdisciplinary applications within the fields of electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, and applied physics. This will be a great opportunity for students to obtain interdisciplinary knowledge and research experience through their participation in the research activities. Students will gain unique experience in micro-fabrication technology and theoretical model development. This will better prepare students for industry and graduate study in nano/micro technology areas upon their graduation. Located in the New York City area, The City College of New York is committed to providing a high-quality education to its predominant minority students. Research opportunities resulting from the proposed program will promote more underrepresented minority groups to pursue in advanced degrees in science and engineering and assure their success in future careers. It will also enhance engineering curriculum at The City College through various seminars, undergraduate senior projects, and hands-on experience with advanced photonic devices resulting from the proposed research. \r\n",
