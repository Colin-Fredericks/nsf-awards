 "awd_abstract_narration": "Translation of mRNA into protein is an essential molecular process of cellular metabolism. Plant protein synthesis is similar to that of other eukaryotes, but there are differences.  The presence of the isozyme form of eIF4F and the apparent lack of regulation by 4E binding proteins (primary regulatory point in mammalian translation) suggest that plants have some fundamental differences, particularly in the regulation of initiation of translation.  Elucidating the roles of the isoforms of eIF4F in plants will provide a better understanding of how plants regulate the production of proteins which will lead to improved plants that resist environmental insults or virus infection, and provide better quality protein for food.  \r\n\r\nThis research project will be used for the training of high school, community college, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students and the results disseminated through publication and the Factors In Arabidopsis Translation (FIAT) website.  The training of undergraduates will be through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI). The FRI teaches freshman about research and trains them to do research in what are called \"research streams\". The PI is a stream leader for 25 freshmen students.  The students are trained in methods relevant to the PI's research and contribute to the PI's overall research and specifically will contribute to the proposed project. One of the goals of the FRI is to attract and retain students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research we carry out seeks to understand the mechanism used by plant cells to start the process of protein synthesis also called translation.  We have created a suite of tools to study and dissect the process of protein synthesis in plants, in particular the early stages of translation known as initiation.  Initiation of translation occurs when the messenger RNA (generated in nucleus from the DNA template) binds to the ribosome (the bio-machine that will read the code) and starts the assembly of the protein.  In particular we have focused on the proteins involved in recognizing the messenger RNA and preparing it to bind to the ribosome.  These proteins are called messenger RNA cap-binding complexes.  The tools we generated include purified cap-binding complexes from both wheat (an important food plant) and Arabidopsis (a model plant).  We have generated antibodies to each of the components of the cap binding complexes and have Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants that functionally knock out each component, as well as double and triple mutants that remove entire cap binding complexes.  The T-DNA mutants are useful for assessing the role of each gene and determining if there is functional overlap between genes in the plant life cycle.  We have learned that there are overlapping, but not equal functions to the many of the subunits of the cap binding complexes.  One form of the cap binding complex is unique to plants and we are using our tools to understand its specific role in plant growth and development.  High school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students have been involved in this research project.  Undergraduates are engaged through the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), a unique program at the University of Texas at Austin for training students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.  Freshmen learn about research and are taught the skills to do research during their undergraduate years and beyond.  In addition to training future research scientists, this project generated  new information about how plant cells make proteins.  This knowledge may be applied to improve plants to better resist environmental insults or virus infection and to provide better quality protein for food for humans and livestock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen S Browning"
