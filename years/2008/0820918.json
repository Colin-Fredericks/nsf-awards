This IRES program consists of research activities, cultural activities, student presentations, and networking opportunities that will help students prepare for careers in the global workplace.  During each of three summers, a group of students will spend two weeks at the University of Pittsburgh and ten weeks in Korea.  The students will learn new micro-/nano-fabrication techniques by investigating carbon nanotube assisted nanodevices, and become familiar with state-of-the-art research equipment.  Selected research projects will be published in a peer-reviewed journal as well as oral presentations and posters to the scientific community via submitted and invited talks.  The students will present their IRES experience to the annual Pittsburgh Junior Academy of Science (PJAS) Nanotechnology workshop, which was designed for junior and senior high school students.",
