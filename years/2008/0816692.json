 "awd_abstract_narration": "CHEMISTRY (12)\r\nThe problem of how to approach the teaching and learning of interdisciplinary material, such as the chemistry necessary to understand even introductory molecular biology, is complex and difficult to solve (otherwise it would have already been done). This project supports the research based development of an integrated curriculum for an introductory chemistry sequence for science majors, entitled \"Chemistry and the Logic of Life.\" The project is completing the following activities: A text using the emergence and evolution of life as the scaffold and context for introduction of chemistry concepts; Learning objects such as interactive electronic materials that can be used separately or in conjunction with each other to enable students to learn concepts, principles, how to solve specific types of problems and how to handle and manipulate data; Formative and summative course assessments and concept inventories are developed and tested. In conjunction with the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute, the project is also developing an examination that can be used nationally as an assessment of chemistry principles in biological contexts. Instructor resource materials help guide instructors in effective ways to use the materials. Since this approach is new, the project provides considerable instructor support. A student workbook provides activities for large and small classes that reinforces the concepts and skills needed to understand the material presented in the text.",
