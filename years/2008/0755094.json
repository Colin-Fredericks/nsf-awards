 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0755094: \r\nThis award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Rutger's University. The program will support ten students during a ten week summer research program. The intellectual focus of the program is provided by access to the LEO-15 ocean observing platform and related technologies. Advances  in  remote  sensing,  ocean  observatories,  autonomous  vehicles,  numerical  modeling,  and  molecular  biology  are  changing  oceanography.   The  faculty  and  research  facilities  at  IMCS  allow  undergraduates  to  explore  these  technologies  to  understand  estuarine  and  costal  ecosystems.  An  initial  five-day  orientation  introduces  students  to  ongoing  research,  focusing  on  the  continental  shelf  off  New  Jersey,  the  Hudson  River/New  York  Harbor,  and  the  Mullica  River/Great  Bay  systems.   The  two  estuaries  provide  a  sharp  contrast  in  their  human  impacts  on  coastal  ecosystems.   The  orientation  includes  two  days  at  the  Rutgers  University  Marine  Field  Station  in  Tuckerton,  with  hands-on  experience  in  the  coastal  LEO-15  research  area,  and  on  the  Mullica  River. The program will include independent research projects by the students, participation in a bi-weekly summer lecture series on topics such as scientific writing, science careers, ethics and data presentation. It will conclude with a written report and student poster presentations. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.\r\n\r\nThe site will be supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program. \r\n",
