 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saint Joseph?s University has received funding from the National Science Foundation for a laser scanning confocal microscope to be used for research and research training by faculty, Master?s students, and undergraduate students in Physics and Biology.  The researchers who need this capability are addressing a range of topics, including properties of colloidal suspensions, how cells maintain their shape and move sub-cellular particles, and how disease-causing organisms interact with their hosts.  The two departments are working together to broaden the impact of overlap in research interests, especially given the current importance of interdisciplinary approaches in Biophysics, and this equipment will provide a focal point for collaboration.  Availability of confocal microscopy will also help attract applicants for a new Biophysics faculty position that will promote truly interdisciplinary research.  \r\nAs a primarily undergraduate institution with a traditional MS program in Biology, Saint Joseph?s is committed to the faculty-student research model.  Each year about 30 students do summer research in math and science, including those seeking a five-year combined BS in science/ MS in education.  Graduate and undergraduate students with interests in biophysics, and cell/ molecular fields will especially benefit from experience with confocal microscopy.  As a Jesuit university, Saint Joseph?s seeks to promote an understanding of social justice issues and constructive action addressing inequalities.  Each year some of the most talented research students bring hands-on science to underserved children through NSF GK-12-funded activities.  The equipment provided by this funding will help faculty provide these future scientists with training in current techniques, coupled with experience in how to share what they have learned as widely as possible.  \r\n",
