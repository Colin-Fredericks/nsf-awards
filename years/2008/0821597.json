The instrumentation includes the development of high data rate acoustic modems (Aqua-Modems), energy efficient integrated underwater nodes (Aqua-Motes), and experimental underwater sensor network (lab and field) testbeds. The Aqua-Modems lead the new generation of acoustic modem design supporting two features: \r\n-\tHigh data rate and robust data transmission and \r\n-\tAdvanced networking functionalities.\r\nThe aqua-Motes will be the first generation of 'true' integrated underwater sensor nodes, similar to Berkeley Motes for terrestrial sensor networks. The two types of Aqua-Motes will be constructed with different processors for easy adaptation to a wide range of applications. The lab and field testbeds with Aqua-Modems and Aqua-Motes will be used to test various algorithms and protocols designed for UWSNs. UWSNs are novel and significantly different from any terrestrial sensor network. Due to the high coefficient of electromagnetic absorption, radio does not work well in water. Instead, acoustic communication is usually employed. The unique characteristics of acoustic underwater communication, such as low bandwidth, long propagation delay, and high error rate, pose grand challenges to underwater acoustic modem and network designers as existing terrestrial wireless sensor network techniques cannot be applied. New research at every level of the protocol suite and new experimental instrumentation are needed to implement, test, and compare design alternatives and potential solutions. This instrument enables the latter to address the continuing and growing interest in observing oceanic processes as they evolve. There is an increasing need to monitor the marine environment for commercial exploration, coastline protection, and tracking processes that contribute to the observed complexity. By deploying distributed and scalable sensor networks in a 3-dimensional underwater space, each underwater sensor can monitor and detect environmental parameters and events locally.  Processes occur within the water mass as it advects and disperses within the environment in the dynamic ocean system. Therefore a langrangian observation system with passively mobile sensors (with water currents) allows observation of oceanic processes in situ on appropriate time and space scales. A self-organizing network of lagrangian sensors also provides better support for sensing, monitoring, surveillance, scheduling, underwater control, and fault tolerance. Thus, the UWSN will provide this support.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n This project promotes progress on the multiple issues facing UWSNs towards practical solutions in a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it impacts education in several fronts: supporting graduate students in their advanced research and undergraduates summer interns (including community college students participating in programs that promote STEM disciplines to underserved minorities) and bringing together investigators from different disciplines (e.g., ocean science, sensors, low energy, and networking) to learn from each other and collaborate across departments and campuses.",
