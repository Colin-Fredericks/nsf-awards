Lott\r\n\r\nThe Institut Henri Poincare (IHP) in Paris will host a\r\ntrimester-long program on Ricci Flow and Ricci Curvature over\r\nApril-July, 2008.  As part of this French activity in a\r\nrapidly-developing area of geometric analysis, an International\r\nConference on Ricci Flow is scheduled for June 30-July 4, 2008 as\r\na conclusion to the trimester.  Topics of the trimester and\r\nconference are expected to include Ricci flow in the\r\ngeometrization of three-manifolds, Kaehler-Einstein metrics and\r\nKaehler-Ricci flow, metrics of constant scalar curvature, Ricci\r\nflow in dimensions four and higher, analytic aspects of geometric\r\nflows, Einstein metrics and recent developments in geometric\r\nrelativity, synthetic Ricci curvature, and Ricci limit spaces.\r\nThis landscape was transformed by Perelman's work on Ricci flow\r\nin three-manifolds and all of these areas have enjoyed recent\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for expenses of US-based\r\nparticipants in the Paris conference, particularly graduate\r\nstudents and junior researchers.  The subject of the workshop is\r\nthe Ricci flow and its extensions.  This differential equation\r\nand technique in geometry became celebrated with its application\r\nby Perelman and Hamilton to the Poincare Conjecture on the\r\ntopological uniqueness of the three-dimensional sphere, one of\r\nthe great challenge problems of mathematics.  The technique\r\nconsiders a single space with a large number of metrics (ways to\r\nmeasure distance in the space) by using the Ricci curvature at\r\neach metric to determine a direction for evolving the metric that\r\nis likely to make the metric more symmetric -- loosely speaking,\r\nwe try to change in the direction of ever rounder metrics.\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to control all the details\r\nnecessary to make such an argument succeed, geometers have found\r\nthat this idea identifies optimal metrics in a variety of\r\nimportant situations.
