 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a web of conjectures about the surgery theoretic classification of high-dimensional manifolds, culminating in the Farrell-Jones Conjectures in K- and L-theory.  The conjectures are closely related to splitting manifolds along codimension one  submanifolds.   This splitting problem is in turn related to nil  groups in algebraic K- and L-theory.  This project has several different aspects.  One is to solve the connected sum problem -- when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum?  Another is to provide a strengthening of the Farrell- Jones Conjecture in L-theory, similar to that achieved by Davis-Khan- Ranicki in K-theory.  Yet another is to classify involutions on a torus, using the computation of the L-theory of the infinite dihedral group and the proof of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in L-theory for crystallographic groups, joint with Connolly.  There are some middle and low dimensions problems too, involving mapping tori of self- homotopy equivalences of lens spaces and a certain aspect of link concordance.\r\n\r\nThe goal, as usual in geometric topology, is to use a variety of algebraic, geometric, and analytic techniques to find and compute invariants for classification. Geometric topology is the study of manifolds. An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point. Many physical phenomenon are represented by manifolds, and as such, understanding the global structure of a manifold, and what possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the sciences, as well as to mathematics.  Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as with physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics.",
