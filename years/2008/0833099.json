 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Noyce program is recruiting 24 highly competent research-trained undergraduate mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics majors into teaching. Of this cohort, seven students are from Fisk University through an existing partnership between the two schools. The goals are to: 1) recruit students in their first and second years into paid summer internships that place prospective teachers into educational settings; 2) provide scholarship recipients with intensive junior year mentoring opportunities in high-need secondary partner schools; 3) establish reflective triads that include the students, their mentor-teachers, and senior CWRU STEM faculty (all of whom have prior experience working with teachers); and 4) continue the mentoring process through the first several years of teaching through outreach that prolongs relationships established through steps two and three. CWRU scholarship recipients receive $15,000 for each of two years. Fisk University scholarship recipients receive $15,000 for a junior year spent at CWRU where they participate fully in the Noyce program and are integrated into undergraduate research programs. Teacher education at CWRU is offered through a collaborative program with John Carroll University (JCU). Students are highly trained in their disciplines and take their pedagogy courses at JCU. In addition, CWRU is partnering in this program with secondary schools in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Shaker Heights City Schools, and Cleveland Heights-University Heights City Schools.",
