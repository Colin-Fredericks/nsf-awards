The requirement of addition of high concentrations of reducing gas to produce metallic particles has limited extension to base metal production. In our approach, the cosolvent decomposes in the reactor to produce small amounts of hydrogen, less than the flammability limit in air, reducing metal salt crystals to metallic powders. The process is governed by both kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Chemical kinetic modeling of the decomposition process will be used to predict hydrogen evolution while thermochemical modeling to determine equilibrium phase relationships as a function of oxygen concentration and temperature will be used, together with a mass and energy balance based process model, and statistical based quality control concepts to guide process design. With this project, the team will take the process from bench scale single component proof of concept stage to multicomponent alloy powder formation, including process scale up and applications testing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The target application is thick film conductive pastes used in the production of microcircuit materials, for example in hybrid integrated circuitry, embedded passives to enable shrinkage of components and metallization of multilayer ceramic capacitors. End products containing microcircuit materials are ubiquitous, ranging from cell phones to solar cells to automobiles. Better quality materials will lead to improved communications and safety, greater energy efficiency, and other improvements affecting quality of life. Aerosol-based production routes, which are rapid and often single step, and which produce solvent and ligand free product powders, also present a general opportunity for promotion of sustainability in manufacturing. Beyond electronic materials, metal powders are of interest for dental and medical implant applications as well as medical devices such as in glucose monitors for diabetics, and thus results from this research may impact these industries as well. Elements of the value added by the proposed industry-university collaboration include: (1) fusion of fundamental principles of reaction engineering, aerosol technology and materials science with industrial process development and scale up activities, and (2) interactions between industry and university researchers and students that will allow participation at all stages from laboratory innovation to applications testing and extension of the research to inform teaching and outreach activities with a real world perspective.",

Glicksman\n\n The research activities supported by this award advanced the development of spray pyrolysis routes for production of metal microparticles important for applications in electronics, energy conversion technology and biomedical devices.  The process under study is an improvement over existing technology in terms of environmental impact and process safety as the final product is solvent-free, and the metal powders are produced without addition of hydrogen or other hazardous reducing gas.  Our process enables low cost base metals to be incorporated with silver and other precious metals to reduce the cost of the metal powders.  In Figure 1, examples are given of bicomponent metal microparticles, produced with controlled morphology.   We have investigated the reaction process for both single and multicomponent particles in detail, and the results can be used to design processes to make particles with desired properties. \n\n We have also investigated the physics of the ultrasonic droplet generation process, important for maximizing efficient delivery of precursor solution to the reactor.  Results of imaging of the droplet generation process can be seen in Figure 2.  Our results indicate that the solution viscosity is the major factor governing the final droplet size distribution as well as the droplet generation rate.  The project builds upon the expertise of the principal investigators in aerosol technology, industrial chemistry and statistical quality control.  The project also builds on the strengths of the student participants, in particular the materials science expertise of the graduate student, Mr. Kai Zhong, and the quality enhancement training of the undergraduate students who are enrolled in the University of Maryland\u00c6s QUEST program.\n\n These activities have promoted the teaching and training of students from high school through post doctoral scholar.  We have strived to broaden participation and four of the 10 project participants are women, with three students of the 10 from underrepresented groups (Latino and African American).  The project has enhanced our facilities for powder generation, and we have developed new collaborations as a result of this project, most notably with Prof. Andre Marshall, an expert on droplet and spray technology in the Department of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland.  Outreach activities involving hands on demonstrations of particle technology in cosmetics and screen printing applications have impacted roughly 70 high school students over the duration of the project.  Materials from the project have been used in high school recruiting presentations, reaching hundreds of students over the duration of the project.  Research results have been disseminated via conference presentations and journal articles, and we have filed a joint patent application.  The benefits to society of this project include:  lower cost metal powders for conductive paste applications and lower cost products including solar cells, glucose monitors, and hybrid microcircuits as a result.  Benefits also include training of engineering graduates at the BS and PhD level, and incorporation of current research into exciting hands on demonstrations and recruiting materials aimed at increasing high school student interest in careers in engineering and science.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheryl H Ehrman"
