 "awd_abstract_narration": "A National Conference on Benchmarking Student Evaluation Practices uses the Student Evaluation Standards, published by the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation, to engage a broad array of educational organizations in improving student achievement in STEM education through better evaluation practices that assess for learning.  Participants learn more about the Student Evaluation Standards and use them together with a benchmarking process - distributed to them in the form of a toolkit - to enhance student evaluation processes.  The conference and the follow-up activities are oriented around four goals: 1) to increase awareness and knowledge of the Student Evaluation Standards and the role student evaluation plays in student interest and achievement; 2) to promote research on student evaluation that increases the effectiveness of the use of Evaluation Standards by practitioners; 3) to develop and disseminate a model and tools for benchmarking evaluation practices in relation to student interest, achievement and instructional equity; and 4) to provide a structure to serve long-term studies of the impact of the Standards.  \r\n\r\n",
