 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Dennis J. Clouthier of University of Kentucky, together with his graduate student researchers, will study the spectroscopy of molecular radicals containing boron, arsenic or phosphorous atoms.  These species will be studied with laser-based spectroscopic methods.  The goal of these studies is two-fold:  to study the electronic structure and molecular properties of some interesting chemical species and to build-up a database of spectroscopic fingerprints for these molecules -- a database that could be used by astronomers or industrial process chemists interested in the chemistry in these unusual environments.  \r\n\r\nThe silicon electronics industry fabricates useful devices through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes.  These processes are chemically complex, and much is unknown about the actual gas-phase chemical species involved in the deposition process.  Prof. Clouthier and his students aim to provide spectral fingerprints for a number of radical intermediates that have been postulated to be important species in CVD process environments.  In addition, a number of the compounds of interest are interesting targets for astronomical researchers.  The graduate students mentored by Clouthier have gone on to successful positions in the technical workforce, and Prof. Clouthier has created a welcoming environment for undergraduate students from other schools (e.g. Eastern Kentucky University, Oklahoma Baptist University) in which to pursue physical chemical research.\r\n",
