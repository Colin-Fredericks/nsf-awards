 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will lead to advanced, functional nanomaterials not seen previously and provide general guidelines for the design of nanocomposites at all concentration levels through a more complete understanding of the nanocomposite?s components (nanoparticle, interphase material, and matrix) and their associated networks. We are testing the hypothesis that processing protocols may produce tensegrity-inspired structures from polymer nanocomposite materials.  Tensegrity structures are composed of isolated compression members connected by a tensile web, occurring in nature and engineering design. They have a unique combination of high mechanical properties, high resiliency, and low weight.  In this research, these structures will be created from nanocomposites where nanoparticles will serve as the compression members, and the polymer will serve as the tensile web.  \r\nThe research activities will emphasize (1) understanding the impact of the processing steps (solution and melt) on the evolution of the microstructure with nanoparticle shape and concentration, (2) characterizing fully the interphase material in nanocomposites and use/adapt appropriate physical models to describe the effect of nanocomposite components on mechanical properties and (3) creating a tensegrity-inspired structure from nanocomposite materials.\r\nThe broader impacts involve an integrated research and educational plan allowing interaction with a broad population of engineering and science students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels.  The investigator will continue her work with chemistry teachers at Mays High School in the Atlanta Public School System.  This high school has a population consisting almost entirely of underrepresented students.  Each year, the investigator and a teacher will work together on nanocomposite research leading to the development of inquiry-based learning modules.\r\n\r\n",
