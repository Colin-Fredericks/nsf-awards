 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Infinite Possibilities Conference promotes, educates, encourages and supports minority women interested in mathematics and statistics.  This national event assembles female mathematical scientists from underrepresented groups for a two-day conference at North Carolina State University.  The plenary speakers include the following inspiring mathematical scientists:  Dr. Alicia Carriquiry, professor of statistics at Iowa State University and editorial board member of several Latin American journals of statistics and mathematics; Dr. Iris Mack, the second African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Harvard University; and Dr. Freda Porter, President and CEO of Porter Scientific and founding member of the North Carolina American Indian Chamber of Commerce.  These speakers showcase the importance of mathematics and statistics in forensic, financial and environmental applications. \r\nParticipants present research projects during the poster session and concurrent research talks.  Also, participants learn how to best write a proof and improve technical writing skills at workshops. Through the Dialogues in Mathematics sessions, the conference creates a forum to discuss experiences unique to minority female mathematicians and statisticians and identifies factors leading to success in the mathematical sciences for underrepresented minority women.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Infinite Possibilities Conference, by presenting examples and showcasing role models, is to make all participants aware of the unlimited ways in which mathematicians and statisticians contribute to the scientific community and society at large.  This conference provides a forum for underrepresented minority females to share experiences in mathematics and statistics as well as an opportunity to share resources and build networks. Participants include high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals from the various fields in mathematics and statistics.  The Infinite Possibilities Conference increases awareness of existing organizations and programs that support women and underrepresented minority groups.  In addition, it celebrates and honors the achievements of minority women in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\n",
