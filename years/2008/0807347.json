A\r\nthird thrust lies at the boundary between mathematics and\r\nfinance, namely (c) examining the impact on markets of\r\nheterogeneous beliefs or \"irrational investors.\"  Concerning (a):\r\nthe PI seeks a unification of two widely-used but apparently\r\ndistinct approaches -- one based on step dynamics, the other\r\nusing a fourth-order partial differential equation.  Concerning\r\n(b): the PI continues his recent work on a\r\nchange-of-variable-based cloaking scheme; in particular he\r\nexplores the design of \"near-cloaks,\" obtained using regular\r\nrather than singular changes of variables, at finite frequency. \r\nConcerning (c): the PI explores how the heterogeneity of\r\ninvestors' beliefs can lead in some settings to speculation and\r\nmarket \"bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n     The project addresses topics where mathematics can have\r\ngreat impact on other areas of science.  Thrust (a) -- involving\r\nthe evolution of a crystal surface -- addresses a core topic in\r\nmaterials science, of great importance for the design and\r\nmanufacture of electronic devices.  Moreover, its goal is the\r\nlinkage of models with different length and time scales -- a\r\nrecurring issue in many areas of modern science.  Successful\r\ntreatment of this example establishes a paradigm that could also\r\nbe useful in other settings.  Thrust (b) -- involving schemes for\r\n\"cloaking\" regions of space -- addresses a current frontier in\r\noptics.  If the proposed cloaking schemes can be realized in\r\npractice, they will provide a means for making objects difficult\r\nto \"see\" using, for example, radar.  But the PI's focus is not on\r\ndevice design; rather it is on the fundamental correctness of a\r\nspecific \"cloaking\" scheme recently proposed by other\r\ninvestigators.  Thrust (c) -- involving of heterogeneous beliefs\r\nor \"irrational investors\" -- addresses a central problem of\r\nmodern economics.  Real-world markets are complicated, but many\r\nof their key features can be understood using simple models.  The\r\nrecent \"internet bubble\" is a reminder that, even in the most\r\nefficient markets, the market price of an asset can greatly\r\nexceed its intrinsic value.  The PI explores models in which this\r\ntype of behavior is explained by the heterogeneity of investors'\r\nbeliefs.",
