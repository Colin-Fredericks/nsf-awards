 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)\r\n\r\nThe project is combining the Just-in-Time-Teaching (JiTT) approach, which uses student responses to web-based, pre-class study question sets to frame the day's classroom inquiry activities, with Inquiry Learning Lesson (ILL) activities.  The integration of JiTT and ILL as a teaching, learning, and monitoring strategy is referred to as JiTTILL.  To implement this strategy in an introductory material science and engineering course, the investigators are creating modules that consist of pre-class concept questions, typical student response misconceptions, content for informational mini-lectures, follow-on classroom inquiry learning activities, closure, and question sets to be completed later on-line.  In this approach they intend to reveal prior knowledge, monitor student understanding, enhance learning skills, and promote student learning of material science and engineering content through conceptual change. The dissemination effort includes establishing website resource portals, distributing a CD containing the material, presenting and publishing papers at conferences and in journals, and offering faculty workshops.  Project evaluation involves experienced evaluators and is determining the impact of the JiTTILL approach on student learning and conceptual understanding using a material concept inventory, student interviews, and focus groups.  The broader impacts include the broad dissemination of the approach, the modules, and the material concept inventory, particularly through the faculty workshop.\r\n",
