 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry supports the research groups of Professors Purnendu (Sandy) Dasgupta, Xiyun Guan, Subhrangsu Mandal, and Kevin Schug at the University of Texas - Arlington for collaborative research with scientists at the Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, to design, test, and implement field-portable and affordable metal detection systems involving novel nanopore sensing and charge detection technologies and unique metal-selective sample preparation techniques, utilizing room temperature ionic liquids and novel nanosorbents.  The researchers use mass spectrometry techniques that they have developed for rapid characterization of binding of metals to other agents, including proteins.  If cell-secreted specific metal binding agents are found, they will be used as gateways to otherwise nonspecific sensors.  The derived ability to selectively detect and measure both harmful metals such as arsenic and essential nutrients such as zinc may have important applications in environmental, medical, and biochemical research.  This international collaborative research project is supported jointly by NSF and the National Science Foundation of China.  The study is also supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) at NSF.  \r\n\r\nResulting instrumental advancements will be incorporated into teaching curricula.  Cross-disciplinary training of engineering undergraduates, minority participation, and the annual participation of 4-5 competitively chosen high school students are an integral part of this project, designed to convey both the experience and the pleasure of carrying out meaningful frontline research and applying it to real samples in a useful manner.",
