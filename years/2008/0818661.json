 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins involved in the binding of sperm and egg cells (gametes) during fertilization are known to be some of the fastest evolving and often differ greatly between species. These differences are thought to be the basis of some reproductive incompatibilities between species, and potentially between members of the same species. The goal of this study is to determine how natural selection causes the rapid accumulation of changes in the structure of gamete binding proteins. This will be accomplished by conducting a suite of fertilization experiments between mussels that differ from each other at the sperm protein M7 lysin. Also, the geographical distribution of different versions of M7 lysin in mussel populations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean will be assessed.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will add important information for understanding the process by which populations become reproductively isolated, and the mechanisms underlying successful fertilization in general. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and all will be from groups currently underrepresented in the sciences. This experience will provide these students with a platform to start their careers in scientific fields.\r\n",
