 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species introductions are one of the major threats to global biodiversity.  Current models designed to explore risks of extinction for native plant species have not considered two important mechanisms by which introduced species may harm native species: altered relationships between native plants and their consumers, and hybridization between native and introduced plant species.  This research represents the first time these factors will be used in an extinction risk model.  Experiments will be used to measure plant reproductive rates and the effects of consumers on them; genetic studies will be used to measure hybridization rates. These results will be used to design models that will evaluate the effects of consumers and hybridization on population growth and long-term viability of a federally-endangered, native plant species.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will have important implications for the conservation of the focal plant species, which is endangered and only found in 14 populations within Northern California.  More broadly, this study should pave the way for future research on these two rapidly-acting extinction risks to our native flora.  Such studies are of critical importance, since consumers and hybridization may threaten countless rare plant and animal species.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEndangered species often face multiple threats, and population ecologists strive to quantify which of these threats are most important using field experiments and mathematical modeling.  These models can project how habitat restoration might mitigate these threats and allow for endangered species recovery.  The overall goal of this research was to quantify how two common but less frequently modeled threats influence the population dynamics of the endangered California plant, Lupinus tidestromii: indirect competition (competition between an invasive plants and the focal plant through a shared seed predator) and hybridization (between the endangered plant and its common congener).  We documented that the presence of the invasive plant species European beachgrass (Ammophila arenaria) threatens Lupinus tidestromii both by increasing predation levels by native seed predators and by stabilizing the sand dune habitat.  Dune stabilization threatens native dune species that are highly adapted to frequent sand movement and early successional microhabitats.  We had a rare opportunity to test the predictions of our mathematical models in the context of an 80 ha European beachgrass removal at our main study site, Abbott\u00c6s lagoon.  Our research contributes to a basic understanding of how several ecological factors can alter the population dynamics of plants. \n\nOur research contributed to the conservation of habitats at Point Reyes National Seashore.  Our research was used to justify the expansion of dune restoration projects at this national park.  Specifically, our NSF-funded research on the endangered plant, Lupinus tidestromii, provided the most robust scientific support that the restoration increases the viability of endangered species.  In addition, we provided unpublished data to the Fish and Wildlife Service that they have incorporated into the revised recovery plan for the endangered species Lupinus tidestromii.  Our research identified a new threat to the species (hybridization), and provided clear management guidelines for dealing with existing threats (European beachgrass removal will reduce predation rates and restore early successional microhabitats). \n\nOur research provided many educational opportunities.  First, we trained Postdoctoral Associates and undergraduate students in experimental design, field research, demographic data collection, pollination ecology, GPS data collection, GIS geodatabase management, and population modeling through their participation in this research project.  Second, we organized a workshop in population modeling that benefited students and postdoctoral associates at Washington University and our collaborators at other institutions.
