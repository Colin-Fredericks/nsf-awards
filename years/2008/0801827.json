 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of quantum mechanics famously places restrictions on the amount of information we can ever gather about some physical system.  One route for exploring the limits of quantum metrology is the measurement of motion of macroscopic mechanical oscillators, for example nanofabricated cantilevers or membranes of various types. While these systems have yet to reach quantum limits of sensitivity and state-preparation, they hold promise for addressing the intriguing question of whether quantum mechanics retains its validity for describing ever-larger objects.   This project represents a novel approach to micro-mechanics and quantum measurement.  In it the collective motion of a macroscopic ensemble of ultracold atoms takes the place of the nanofabricated mechanical resonator.  The advantages of using this system are that the resonator can be cooled directly to its quantum-mechanical ground state and that the mechanisms for actuating and measuring the resonator are founded solidly on quantum optics.  In this work, the PI and his students will investigate quantum limited measurements, classical and quantum aspects of bistable motion, and, ultimately, the effects of strong coupling between the quantum fluctuations of a mechanical object and a single-mode light field.\r\n\r\nThis work will inform the development of quantum technologies of various types, including superconducting quantum-interference (SQUID) amplifiers and nanomechanical resonators, by giving clear guidelines for approaching quantum limited performance.  Achieving quantum limits for detecting the motion of cold atoms is also directly applicable to cold-atom-based interferometric sensors that are being presently developed and deployed.  Finally, in training graduate students at the intersection of quantum optics, atomic physics, and condensed-matter physics, the project will help to develop the quantum scientists and engineers who will realize the benefits of nascent quantum technologies.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most audacious scientific projects in recent times is the attempt to measure gravitational waves that emanate from distant massive objects and travel toward and past the Earth.  The instrument for such detection, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), uses an intense beam of light that reflects many times off a massive mirror in order to measure its response to the feeble force modulation from a gravitational wave.  Such a detector is generically called a cavity optomechanical sensor.  As instruments such as LIGO reach for the highest sensitivity possible, scientists expect to encounter distinct quantum mechanical effects as the quantum fluctuations of the mirror position and of the probing light field become intertwined.\n\nIn our research, we created a miniaturized mock-up of a LIGO detector in order to observe and characterize such quantum mechanical effects.  The mechanical element in our optomechanical system is an extremely cold gas of atoms, the motion of which influences the properties of an optical cavity in which the gas is trapped.  Our alternate and unusual approach to studying cavity optomechanics allows us to search for, and indeed to observe, those distinctly quantum mechanical phenomena that are sought after in larger optomechanical sensors.\n\nOur project has yielded several important results.  First, by studying the evolution of the atomic gas as the optical cavity was constantly probed, we quantified the disturbance of the gas due to the back-action of a continuous quantum measurement, finding such back-action to be precisely as strong as is required by quantum mechanics.  Second, we developed a new experimental system that permitted us to study optomechanical effects both in the linear and quadratic coupling regime, where the cavity is used to measure either the position or the strain of the atomic gas, respectively.  Ours was the first observation of optomechanical effects -- namely the nonlinear optical response of the cavity -- in the quadratic coupling regime.  Finally, we have just completed a measurement of the squeezing of light caused by optomechanical interactions, an effect known as ponderomotive squeezing that is of great interest for future generations of LIGO.  Such squeezing occurs as the inescapable vacuum fluctuations of light cause the mechanical element to jiggle in such a way as to suppress those very fluctuations, producing a beam of light with abnormally small fluctuations.\n\nDuring this work, we developed also a new set of ideas for how the optical cavity field might interact with the internal magnetism of the trapped atomic gas.  Following the analogy of cavity optomechanics, we predicted several phenomena that may result from such interactions, including nonlinear optics and bistability, and an alternate route to optical squeezing.  We demonstrated the ability to measure atomic magnetism through the optical response of the optical cavity by implementing a form of magnetic resonance imaging.  This last result is highly significant to the extensive efforts to study many-body quantum physics using cold atoms.\n\nThis project was successful owing to the talent, creativity, and perseverance of the undergraduate and graduate students, and the postdoctoral fellows, who worked such long hours in the laboratory.  In return for their hard work, this research team acquired invaluable experimental skills and experiences that developed their creativity and scientific judgment. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan M Stamper-Kurn"
