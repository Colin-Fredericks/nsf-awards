 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work has led to a number of surprising results that challenge many of the conventional viewpoints regarding the essential physics of magnetic reconnection. This project will re-examine the physics of reconnection utilizing a Particle-In-Cell plasma simulation code. An important aspect of the simulations is that they will be run using an open boundary model rather than the traditional periodic boundary condition. The initial results from this approach appear quite promising since the artificial recirculation that is inherent with periodic boundary conditions is completely eliminated.  Plasma and magnetic flux is allowed to enter and exit the system as needed. The resulting simulations effectively mimic a much larger system than is possible with periodic boundary conditions. These simulations have led to a new understanding of the structure of the electron diffusion region and its effect on fast reconnection. An innovative aspect of the code is that it has been adapted for cell-based computers which are likely to be the future of large-scale computations with expected speed gains of a factor of 40 over existing simulations. \r\n\r\nThe project will examine several important questions related to magnetic reconnection that are relevant to the Geospace Environment Modeling program's focus groups.  The specific topics to be investigated include: (1) the relative roles of anti-parallel reconnection versus component merging, (2) the role of plasma turbulence on the rate of reconnection, (3) the dependence of the onset of reconnection and its subsequent nonlinear development on the plasma beta parameter (the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure), and (4) the evolution of asymmetric current sheets in the reconnection region.\r\n\r\nThe educational aspects of the project includes support for several undergraduate students at UCSD to participate in the research. Two graduate students at the University of Iowa will also be involved.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMagnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma transport mechanism in collisionless plasmas. It provides a mechanism to convert magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy and occurs in a variety of applications from astrophysical to laboratory plasmas.  At the Earth\u00c6s magnetosphere, magnetic reconnection plays a dominant role in transferring the solar-wind energy into the magnetosphere.  Despite its importance, some of the most basic questions regarding the details of the reconnection process remain poorly understood.  The goal of our research was to  address one of the fundamental questions in reconnection: Why is reconnection quasi-steady at times and intermittent at other times? Using state of the art kinetic simulations, we were able to address this question and identified mechanisms that lead to time dependent behavior of reconnection.  Electron physics plays a key role in magnetic reconnection.  In order to validate the simulations, it is important to compare the simulation data with spacecraft measurements of reconnection events in the Earth\u00c6s magnetosphere.  One of the challenges has been to find diagnostics that would signal the crossing of the electron diffusion region by the spacecraft.  We used our simulations to develop such diagnostics and were able to find the first resolved crossing of the electron diffusion region in the spacecraft data.  This detection gave further confidence in our simulation study and also showed evidence for some of our recent predictions based on 3D simulations. Our work led to 10 publications in prestigious scientific journals. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Homayoun Karimabadi"
