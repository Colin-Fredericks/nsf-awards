 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate charge transport properties in interface-controlled organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using light scattering techniques, with a long term goal of applying OFETs in memory devices. The approach includes (1) layer-by-layer growth of polymer films using pulsed laser deposition to control the semiconductor-dielectric interface in OFETs; (2) probing the dielectric-semiconductor interface using Raman spectroscopy from biased OFET structures and correlating the changes in the vibrational spectra with theory to identify the structural changes upon charge transport; (3) charge modulation spectroscopy of OFETs; (4) surface-enhanced Raman scattering from metal nanoparticle doped dielectric and organic semiconductors for memory applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research takes a comprehensive approach to probe charge transport in OFETs by combining light scattering techniques with conventional current-voltage characteristics, yielding information on electron-phonon interactions and structural changes at the interface. Such a technique has a potential transformative character as it promises to become a standard probe for studying charge transport mechanisms in a host of other optoelectronic devices. This hypothesis will be further put to test in organic memory applications where surface-enhanced Raman scattering studies will be carried out to gain insight into the operation of memory devices.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the work is demonstrated by recruitment of undergraduate interns including underrepresented minorities from Lincoln University (a Historically Black College & University) to give them opportunities in cutting-edge research. The proposed work involves participation and training of graduate students which will contribute to the US workforce in the area of organic optoelectronics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
