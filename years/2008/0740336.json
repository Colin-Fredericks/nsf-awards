 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will investigate a novel approach for converting heat into electricity. The proposed device, known as a thermophotovoltaic (TPV), is similar in operational concept to the more widely recognized technology of solar cells (photovoltaics); however, while a solar cell converts visible light (sunlight) into usable electrical energy, a TPV converts infra-red radiation (heat) into usable electrical energy. Adding to the innovative approach being used in this project, the TPV will be enabled using nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nTPV generation of electricity is an elegant and practical alternative source of electrical energy generation. For example, TPV generation of electricity could supply electrical energy from industrial waste heat that consumes huge quantities of energy supplied by natural gas, fossil fuels, and other sources.  Another application is co-generation, in a simple example, excess heat created from coal, oil, or wood being burned to heat a home could be recycled to augment the electrical needs of the structure. Further, TPV generators can be constructed to supply electricity when and where it is needed.  TPV technology has advantages of low weight, no mechanical parts, low noise and multi-fuel capability that can be exploited in portable, military, space/satellite and emergency power generation applications.\r\n",
