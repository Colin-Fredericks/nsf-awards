 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will work on two projects connected with arithmetic\r\ngeometry.  The first project is to study the existence of rational\r\npoints in algebraic families of varieties, and to build a library of\r\ndiophantine subsets of the field of rational numbers, where a\r\ndiophantine set in this context means the set of rational parameter\r\nvalues for which the corresponding variety in a family has a rational\r\npoint.  In particular, the investigator will explore families whose\r\nfibers are Chatelet surfaces or more complicated conic bundles, for\r\nwhich the Brauer-Manin obstruction produces interesting diophantine\r\nsets.  A long-term goal of the first project is to construct a model\r\nof the integers using diophantine sets, because this would disprove a\r\nconjecture of Mazur regarding topology of rational points and\r\nsimultaneously prove the undecidability of the problem of deciding\r\nwhether a multivariable polynomial equation has a rational solution.\r\nThe second project is to study countable unions of subvarieties over a\r\ncountable algebraically closed field, such as the field of algebraic\r\nnumbers, and in particular to prove that in naturally occurring\r\nsituations, there exists a closed point outside the countable union,\r\nas required for various constructions.  Examples include the union of\r\nrational curves in a non-uniruled variety, the moduli space locus of\r\nabelian varieties isogenous to a Jacobian, the locus in the base of a\r\nfamily of varieties where the Picard number of the fiber jumps, and\r\nunions of subvarieties arising from iteration of endomorphisms of\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nArithmetic geometry lies at the intersection of number theory and\r\nalgebraic geometry: like algebraic geometry, it studies the solutions\r\nto multivariable polynomial equations, but it does so under the\r\nnumber-theoretic restriction that the coordinates of the solutions be\r\nintegers (whole numbers like -37) or rational numbers (fractions like\r\n-3/5) or perhaps elements of some other number system different from\r\nthe traditional systems of real numbers or complex numbers.  Such\r\nquestions were studied for their intrinsic interest since the time of\r\nthe ancient Greeks, and in the 20th century they found unforeseen\r\napplications to cryptography and error-correcting codes.  The\r\ninvestigator's research focuses not on these applications, but on the\r\nfundamental questions underlying and surrounding them, such as the\r\nquestion of whether it is possible to write a computer program to\r\ndecide whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation has a\r\nsolution in rational numbers.  The research covered by this grant will\r\nstudy patterns in families of equations in the hope of deducing a\r\nnegative answer, while also proving the existence of solutions\r\nsatisfying infinitely many constraints in a larger number system.",
