The ultrasound component will provide information regarding shape and location of unidentified tissue masses. The microwave component utilizes nonlinear time domain inverse scattering techniques and would provide quantitative information regarding the dielectric constant and conductivity of the tissue. Unlike the current systems that require verification, the proposed imaging system could provide a definitive diagnosis of the tissue mass /lesion significantly reducing the percent of false positive and false negative reports. When used in combination with the ultrasound shape functions it could provide an imaging system with increased resolution, spatial fidelity, and ability to quantify and characterize the tissue type. Initially the US and MW measurements will be taken simultaneously and independently during the early stages of algorithm development. The proposed imaging system could possibly provide a resolution of  less than 5mm.",
