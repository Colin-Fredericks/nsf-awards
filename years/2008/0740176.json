 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop novel chemically and thermally stable, highly fluorinated mixed matrix polymeric membranes with high selectivity. The program's objective is to apply enhanced membrane separation as an alternative to distillation separations that deal with high temperature and aggressive chemicals. Distillation is a major separation process in the chemical industry and consumes significant energy and capital costs. Many aggressive chemicals are difficult to separate by distillation. While membranes offer potential, most are limited by difficulties with aggressive chemicals and temperature limitations. Compact Membrane Systems has developed a family of perfluorinated membranes featuring high temperature capability, ability to operate in aggressive chemicals, and high flux. The chemical process industry would benefit from perfluorinated membranes with high upper use temperatures of 240\u00baC with improved separation factors. This program addresses this particular need by developing mixed matrix membrane having perfluorinated base polymer and highly fluorinated additives. By introducing greater quantities of additives as well as appropriate choice of additives, we expect to significantly modify flux and separation properties of the base perfluoropolymers while retaining their unique stability.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from this technology could reduce energy consumption in the chemical process industries. Distillation consumes one-third of chemical process industry energy. Enhanced membrane processes with superior chemical and thermal properties can be used to replace/improve many of these distillation separations. The largest market is the ethanol dewatering market. Ethanol is expected to grow to upwards of 40% of U.S. fuel. If this occurs the market is 50-60 billion gallons of fuel per year. This project could lead to an energy-efficient process to produce ethanol as well as reduce the energy consumption of the chemical process industries.",
