 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 9-week summer  REU Site program will allow undergraduate students to participate in cutting-edge research in the field of electrical engineering and expose them to interdisciplinary aspects of research through a carefully designed program of individually mentored research projects and team activities such as: 1) Weekly Scientific Seminars; \r\n2) Professional Development Workshops in Ethics and Entrepreneurship; and 3) Field Visit Programs. The REU students will be mentored and guided by highly qualified professors and supported by state-of-the-art laboratories.  Their research achievements will be documented in the EEREU Annual Research Journal which will be published yearly by this program.  The main objective of this program is to strengthen the participants' educational experiences and to motivate them to select electrical engineering research careers or to enter into advanced graduate study.  \r\n\r\nThe involvement of undergraduates in engineering research with exposure to ethical issues in technology and society has implications beyond the technical scope of the individual research projects, and the inclusion of entrepreneurship will show how research products from the lab transitions to products that impact society.  \r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be carried out nationwide, with emphasis on junior students, especially those from underrepresented groups and in colleges with limited research opportunities.\r\n",
