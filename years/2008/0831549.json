 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cross-layer design problems in wireless networks are usually very complex, \r\nsince they require simultaneously optimizing a large amount of algorithms \r\nand parameters. Most existing solutions for cross-layer optimization rely \r\non heuristic procedures to solve this problem. However, to obtain an optimal \r\nutility for the wireless user, cross-layer optimization should be formulated \r\nrigorously as a sequential decision problem that takes into account the \r\ncapability of the various layers to autonomously make forecasts about their \r\nexperienced dynamics, and perform foresighted adaptation, while adhering to \r\nthe existing layered network architecture. To address this challenge, the \r\ninvestigators study a new, systematic framework for cross-layer optimization \r\nthat allows each layer to make autonomous and foresighted decisions on the \r\nselected transmission strategies (e.g. protocol parameters and algorithms), \r\nwhile cooperatively maximizing the utility of the wireless user by optimally \r\ndetermining what necessary information should be exchanged among layers.\r\n\r\nThis research involves two main thrusts: (a) Develop a novel cross-layer \r\noptimization framework with message exchange among layers in which each layer \r\noptimizes its own protocol parameters and algorithms based on its own \r\nexperienced dynamics and the information exchanged with other layers, in \r\norder to cooperatively maximize the wireless user?s utility in a foresighted \r\nmanner while adhering to the layered network architecture; (b) Design layered \r\non-line learning algorithms for the cross-layer optimization to allow each layer \r\nto interactively learn the experienced dynamics and other necessary information \r\nfrom other layers, such that the cross-layer strategies can be optimized \r\ncooperatively. This research leads to a fundamentally new way for designing \r\nwireless networks, systems and applications, where devices evolve and become \r\nsmarter, by learning from their interactions with the environment over time.",
