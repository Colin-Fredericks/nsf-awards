It is known that existing wastewater treatment often cannot, and does not remove pharmaceutical chemicals from waste streams. In the proposed project, the PIs will test the degradation of four common pharmaceuticals in bioreactors and relate the degradation to the microorganisms present and the reactor configuration. The PIs hypothesize that ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and heterotrophs work in concert to degrade pharmaceuticals and that bioreactor configuration plays a role in defining the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals and their transformation byproducts.",
