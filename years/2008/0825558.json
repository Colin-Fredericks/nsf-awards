 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) to have a significant impact on the production and distribution of electricity, key barriers to commercialization must be overcome. The durability and reliability of electrode-electrolyte interfaces has been identified as a weak point for SOFCs. Thus the research objectives of this award include the following: a) identification of fundamental stress-based, materials-based, and environment-based reasons for degradation and failure of electrode interfaces and b) development of high fidelity finite element models appropriate for optimizing electrode interfaces exposed to thermal transients. The work will include a range of experiments for determining materials properties and for elucidating failure mechanisms. The experimental results will also be used for developing and validating the numerical models designed to optimize electrode interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe research team at The Ohio State University (OSU) will work closely with scientists and engineers at NexTech Materials, Ltd (NTM). Through controlled experiments and realistic models with production-ready materials and devices, the university-industry team aims to deliver both new scientific understanding of electrode interface failure issues and ultimately more viable commercial SOFC products. The team members and close associates from both OSU and NTM will benefit from having access to the facilities and knowledge of their respective counterparts. The Team will also work together to disseminate general information about energy production and use to middle and high school students in the Columbus area. This effort to provide broader understanding of energy issues will take the form of visits to classrooms, age-appropriate curriculum materials and assignments, and fuel cell demonstration kits. \r\n",
