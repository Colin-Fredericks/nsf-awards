 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CPATH Conceptual Development and Planning project creates linkages between computer science and many other disciplines at the University of Nebraska through a redesigned computing core and an infusion of computational thinking concepts and learning environments into a broad range of courses and academic disciplines.  The faculty team plans to use a holistic approach called Renaissance Computing that covers both computer science and other disciplines and creates a computing student population with multidisciplinary backgrounds. The activities include arranging workshops and meetings to determine the needs of the many participating departments, designing a cohesive curriculum to support computational thinking, conducting a pilot study of two interdisciplinary courses, and developing an implementation plan for full scaled institutional transformation. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in expertise and commitment of a large interdisciplinary project team from a number of different academic divisions across the campus. The holistic approach and computational thinking vision are sound and timely. The project has the potential for national impact and to provide new models for computing education of the future.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project lie in the potential to address changing demands on computing professionals and to attract a diverse audience of students. The project has the potential to engage the entire faculty and student body and to foster computational thinking throughout each academic program, thus producing students much better prepared for the computational intense professional careers of the future. The project includes outreach to high school students as well as dissemination of resources and results to a broad computing community.\r\n",
