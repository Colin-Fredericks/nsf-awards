 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nDiaphanous-related formins (DRFs) are a conserved family of Rho GTPase proteins that coordinate the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks.  Therefore, these proteins influence cellular shape, motility, and cytokinesis; and it is critical that they are regulated and activated only in response to cellular signals.  The proteins are autoinhibitory and are normally maintained in an inactive state.  DRF proteins are activated by the binding of Rho GTPases.  However, recent studies of mammalian DRFs have demonstrated that binding of Rho GTPases alone is insufficient and that another signal may be involved in DRF activation.  Although the nature of this additional signal is unknown, preliminary studies indicate that p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) specifically phosphorylates the mouse formin mDia2.  This project will identify the specific amino acid residues involved in the mDia2-PAK1 binding interaction and determine if PAK1 plays a role in mDia2 regulation by examining the effects of PAK1 phosphorylation of mDia2 on cellular localization, interaction with Rho GTPases, and actin nucleation ability.  In addition, this project will identify specific intramolecular interactions involved in the regulation of the DRF proteins, Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis-1 (DAAM1) and mDia3 to understand DAAM1/mDia3 localization, function, and regulation in cells.  By specifically characterizing regulatory interactions in three specific members of the DRF family, this research will significantly advance the understanding of cytoskeletal regulation by DRF proteins.  Due to the conservation of DRF proteins in organisms as diverse as slime molds, yeast, worms, fruit flies, mice, and humans, as well as the prevalence of the autoinhibitory regulatory mechanism in cellular proteins, the results of the project will be applicable to a broad array of biological systems.  Using the knowledge of the specific amino acid residues involved in the regulation of formin proteins, this project will also provide fundamental insight into the cellular localization and cytoskeletal effects of full length DRFs.  In addition, the cellular signaling relevance is even more substantial with the potential regulation of DRFs by PAK1, an enzyme known to be involved in a host of relevant cellular processes, such as cell death, cell survival, cell cycle regulation, and neuronal outgrowth.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis project will provide research experiences to undergraduate students.  The approach of using a combination of biophysical spectroscopy, biochemistry, and cell and molecular biology previously resulted in a publication with undergraduate co-authors.  The ability of two undergraduate students to significantly contribute to that study indicates that projects of these types are ideal for cutting-edge undergraduate research.  The majority of the current research will be conducted by undergraduates; half of whom will be first generation and/or non-traditional college students.  The undergraduate students will be mentored through independent research projects in order to provide comprehensive training in the sciences.  As a result of a full-time hypothesis based research experience, the undergraduate students will learn a variety of scientific techniques, increased critical thinking skills, and gain an accurate understanding of experimental science.  This will also provide for stronger students in medical and professional schools, as well as in the workplace.  While one of the strengths of Grand Valley State University is the significant number of high quality undergraduate students, completion of the RUI projects will provide valuable experiences for even more deserving students and serve to strengthen the research environment of Grand Valley State University.  The results generated from this RUI proposal will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, as well as presented by undergraduate researchers at local, regional, and national meetings.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn many ways, cells contain the equivalent of a system of \"bones\" and \"muscles\" that contribute to many important cellular processes.  This cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, such as the maintenance of cell shape, the ability of cells to move in response to external stimuli, and the regulation of cell division.  While the main protein components of the cytoskeleton are known, there exist numerous other proteins that serve to regulate the structure and function of the cytoskeleton.  Among these cytoskeletal regulators is a highly conserved family of proteins, the Diaphanous-related Formins (DRFs), which serve to help control the structure of the cytoskeleton.  Since the DRF proteins are an important focal point which can affect so many cellular processes, it is vital that DRFs are themselves tightly regulated and only activated in response to a cellular signal.  Proper regulation in cells is absolutely critical, since uncontrolled cytoskeletal functions can result in dire consequences for a cell.  As with all signals in cellular processes, the regulation of DRFs is dictated by a complex set of protein-protein interactions.  Using a combination of protein biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, and biophysical chemistry, we have characterized some important regulatory interactions in three mammalian DRF proteins, mDia2, mDia3, and DAAM1.\n\nThe scientific discoveries which came out of this project centered on two different themes.  The first discovery was that mDia2 was modified by another cellular protein called PAK1.  Known to be involved in a host of relevant cellular processes, such as cell death, cell survival, cell cycle regulation, and neuronal outgrowth, we found PAK1 phosphorylated a couple of specific amino acids in mDia2.  An interesting aspect of this type of modification is that it is reversible and is used by a host of proteins involved in the regulation of almost all cellular processes.  While it was known that DRF proteins were able to be regulated by simple protein interactions, the potential for another type of regulation (phosphorylation) opens the doors for much more future research in this field.  The second main theme of the work focused on identifying specific amino acid residues within the DRF proteins that serve to keep the protein inactive in a normal cellular state.  For all three DRF proteins, we used molecular biology to change only one amino acid in each of these proteins (all three proteins contain over 1,000 amino acids), thereby creating continually active versions of the DRF proteins.  Expressing these proteins in cells allowed for the observation of their effects on cellular localization and cytoskeletal reorganization of constitutively active full-length DAAM1 and mDia3.  While it has been common to \u00e6truncate\u00c6, or only use certain regions of proteins to study their specific functions in cells, our work has shown that it is very important to study the full-length protein in order to obtain the most accurate depiction of its cellular localization and function. Indeed, we discovered that expressing a DRF protein missing a small section (truncation) caused a completely different cytoskeletal architecture than did the single amino acid full length protein.  It is our hopes that future researchers are mindful of using full length constructs, as much as they can, to study cellular effects of specific proteins.\n\nAnother \u00e6product\u00c6 of these research projects is the talented group of undergraduate students that collaborated to perform a significant amount of work.  With the consistent need for highly trained scientists in our country, it is critical that the proper foundation is provided at the undergraduate level.  In the last three years, a total of eleven undergraduate students were mentored during their NSF-funded full-time summer research internships (six of them were first-generation college students).  Three of these students are currently in doctoral graduate p..."
