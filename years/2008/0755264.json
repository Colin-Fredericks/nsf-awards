 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Entomology at Texas A&M University is committed to: 1) expanding the opportunities for undergraduate involvement in scientific research, 2) diversity in the scientific workforce, and 3) advancing the appreciation by the general public of the nature and importance of entomological sciences. The principal goals of this REU are to 1) build skills in analytical thinking, quantitative analysis, and written and oral communications, 2) increase awareness of interconnections between human and insect populations and the relevance of entomological science, and 3) increase diversity in the student population studying entomology by recruiting and outreach in historically underrepresented populations, and in regions with large proportions of first generation college attendance.  REU students will work closely for ten weeks with one of eight faculty mentors and conduct independent research projects in areas that may include biochemical analyses, DNA sequencing and extraction, analysis of gene expression, molecular marker development, physiological and toxicological bioassays, and stereomicroscopy, compound microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.  Students will also gain experience in applying research results to practical problems while conducting their research projects in their faculty mentor's laboratory. Research experiences will be supplemented with involvement in campus-wide REU science discussion groups and social activities, experimental design practicums, short courses to introduce and/or review quantitative methods used in entomological research, and workshops in developing effective oral and written presentations.  More information is available at http://insects.tamu.edu/students or by contacting Ms. Rebecca Hapes (rhapes@tamu.edu or 979- 845-9733, or the PI, Dr Kevin Heinz (kheinz@ag.tamu.edu).\r\n",
