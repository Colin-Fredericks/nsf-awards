 "awd_abstract_narration": "A digital camera capable of 5400 frame-per-second time resolution will be equipped with diffraction gratings previously built by the investigator to document optical emissions from naturally occurring lightning flashes beneath thunderstorms. Spectral data will be obtained in the 380-850 nm range from the entire visible portion of lightning channels encompassing flash elements that may include return strokes, stepped and dart leaders, M-strokes, and episodes of \"continuing current\" (thought to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of lightning damage to structures and equipment) at spatial and temporal resolutions of 10's of meters and microseconds, respectively. These data will be analyzed to provide measures of channel temperature, electron density, and other thermodynamic information. Observing activities will be conducted during the climatological springtime thunderstorm maximum at a primary site located at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, and during the off-season at the principal investigator's home institution (Texas A&M University) in southern Texas. Extensive supporting meteorological facilities and special measurements are available at the Oklahoma site, and include finely resolved (nanosecond-scale) optical imaging of lightning channels recorded by another NSF-supported investigator based at the University of Oklahoma. Both sites are encompassed by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) as well as more specialized lightning mapping array (LMA) equipment. Together, these ancillary systems will provide contextual 4D information on lightning channel location, geometry and propagation (both visible and in-cloud), as well as the polarity, estimated peak current and flash multiplicity (i.e. number of return strokes) for lightning channels reaching the ground.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research centers upon improved understanding of the spectroscopically-derived properties of natural lighting viewed at fine spatial and temporal resolution, which will lead to improved understanding of the physics of natural lightning. Additional insights are also possible concerning lightning's contribution to key atmospheric chemical processes. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this work will include training of university graduate and undergraduate students, outreach to K-12 educational institutions, and increased collaboration between multiple university and government facilities involved in lighting research.",

With the  increasing number of tall structures being built, there will be a  corresponding increase in the number of upward lightning flashes from  these structures. Quantifying the contribution of upward lightning to  the total flash production in the vicinity of a tower will show how  anthropogenic activity likely is increasing the total number of  lightning flashes to ground in the vicinity of tall towers and to what  scale. A better understanding of how nearby flashes trigger upward  lightning will help to quantify the increased rates of lightning events  and the increased exposure of these objects to lightning current. It may  also result in methods to reduce or eliminate the initiation of upward  leaders from tall structures or in improved lightning protection  standards, since existing protection standards are based on attachment  of downward, CG lightning.\nIn order to understand  the conditions for triggering upward leaders from tall objects by nearby  lightning flashes and to determine a quantifiable flash component  (e.g., return stroke, horizontal negative leader development)  responsible for this triggering, the following questions will be  addressed:\n\n\nWhat types of flashes  (intracloud or CG) and their properties (spatial development relative to  the towers, electrical potential, polarity, and current) affect or are  critical for the initiation of upward leaders from tall towers?\n\n\nWhat  types of storms (e.g., mesoscale convective systems, supercells,  multicells), region of storms (e.g., anvil region, convective core,  trailing stratiform area), and storm development stage (e.g., mature,  dissipating) are present when upward lightning occurs?\n\n\nWhat conditions are required for triggering upward leaders on multiple tall objects during the same flash?\n\n\n\n     As in the past, optical  observations will be obtained using GPS time-synchronized high-speed  cameras operating from 1,000 to 100,000 ips, along with standard-speed  video and digital still-image camera systems. The electric field  environment will be sampled using sensors measuring the ambient electric  field (electric-field meter) and electric-field change (fast and slow  antennae). Furthermore, two VHF interferometers will be used to locate  three-dimensional leader development. These electromagnetic data will be  time-correlated with optical observations along with NLDN data, which  will provide flash type, timing, location, polarity, and peak current  for tho..."
