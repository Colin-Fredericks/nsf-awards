 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nThis project is investigating the connections between two pedagogical approaches, increased student autonomy and disciplinary integration, and the desired improvement of student motivation, competency development, and self-directed learning abilities in an undergraduate engineering environment. The project is leveraging a previously developed integrated course block, titled Paul Revere: Tough as Nails, that combines material science and history of technology topics, and examining pedagogical issues rather than course content. The research is answering the following four questions: Do integrated and self-directed project environments increase student motivation? Do disciplinary integration and autonomy in projects foster students' development as self-directed learners? Does disciplinary integration increase broad competency development or technical performance? Do integration and learner autonomy produce gender-specific changes in motivation, attitudes, self-perceptions, competency development, and self-directed learning? The results from this research project are being widely disseminated to a diverse audience through active collaborations, workshops, and publications.",
