White's research group has developed new insights into the fundamental origins of complex phase behaviors in mixtures of polyolefins.  Using advanced solid-state NMR experiments with chain-level resolution, his research first identified entropically-driven miscibility in multiple polyolefin blends.  However, the direct connections between chain and constituent monomer structure and required positive configurational entropies of mixing in macromolecules have not been established, particularly for mixtures of polyolefins that are most commercially relevant.  During the next funding period, Professor White and coworkers will use recently-developed advanced magnetic resonance methods on solid polymer blends, in concert with polymer synthesis and thermal analysis, to identify the structural parameters needed to create miscible blends in various mixtures of polypropylenes, polyethylenes, and their copolymers.  Collectively, such polymers represent the most economically valuable class of macromolecules.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Summary.  Professor Jeffery White and his research group have adopted a long-term strategy to understand how to create important polymer materials whose properties are attractive for economic applications.  Using advanced experiments that unravel the most important fundamental aspects of complex organic materials, he has demonstrated how desirable new materials actually form stable structures from their individual components.  This class of organic polymers, known as polyolefins, is extremely valuable to the U.S. economy, with new markets and applications accessible only through creation of new materials.  Professor White and his research group use the techniques learned in the laboratory, as well as past industrial experiences, to educate elementary school students and their teachers on the benefits of science to society.  Specifically, Dr. White has created a novel new teaching tool, called \"I-PROD\", to interest young students in pursuing science and engineering careers and help address future domestic competitiveness in technology, as highlighted in the recent American Competitive Initiative.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany challenges exist in creating new materials that can offer better performance, reduced environmental impact, or new capabilities.   The PI's group, through the work supported by this NSF award, has developed experimental strategies that allow researchers to understand, at a molecular level, how combinations of macromolecules combine to form new materials.  Historically, it has been difficult to understand why certain macromolecular blends actually mix at a molecular level, thereby forming a new material or new phase, while most combinations phase separate.  This characteristic is particularly true for the most common type of macromolecular mixtures, known as polyolefins, whose mixtures are used in a variety of consumer products.  However, product lifetimes or application performances are often very short due to the fact that the polymer mixtures phase separate.  What scientists need is more information about what is happening at the molecular level in blends of these very large macromolecules, which has heretofore been challenging for many blends since the amorphous, or non-ordered, regions of the macromolecules are difficult to study by traditional techniques.\n\nUsing advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the PI has developed a series of experimental approaches which quantitatively demonstrate that entropy increases for miscible (that is, single-phase) blends of polyolefins and polydienes, which previously was not recognized as an important factor.  Amorphous materials are characterized by glass transitions temperatures, and the PI's work has dispelled long-standing notions about how the glass transition temperatures of the individual macromolecules in macromolecular mixtures change when a miscible blend is formed.  The experimental methods developed in this work can be used for any type of multiple-component mixture, including composites, and are applicable to the final end-use state of the material, meaning that the data are reflective and predictive of real-world applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffery L White"
