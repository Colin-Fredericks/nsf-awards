 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, lead institution), the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Boston University (BU) are jointly proposing to establish an Engineering Research Center for Smart Lighting under the direction of Fred Schubert, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe integrated research, education, and technology transfer of the Smart Lighting ERC will demonstrate revolutionary lighting systems for rapid diagnostic bio-imaging, high-efficiency displays, safer transportation, and novel modes of communication. The critical enabler for advanced lighting systems will be a new generation of smart light sources whose spectral composition, color temperature, polarization, spatial, and temporal modulation properties are fully controllable and tunable. Smart light sources\r\nand advanced lighting systems will result in tremendous benefits to society and humankind, including:\r\n \r\nFundamental advances in biotechnology for rapid and highly specific identification of cells.\r\n \r\nBrilliant displays with high efficiency and large color gamut enabled by polarized emitters.\r\n\r\nIncreased safety in transportation systems through the implementation of ambient intelligence.\r\n\r\n Novel modes of communication, networking, and sensing.\r\n\r\nReduced pollution and global warming through energy-conserving, mercury-free lighting.\r\n\r\nReduced dependency on sleep-inducing pharmaceuticals, reduced risk of cancer, and support of the natural circadian rhythm, thereby enabling higher productivity and a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThese benefits will be realized through the systematic exploration and development of smart-lighting principles in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (1) novel materials, (2) device technology, and\r\n(3) system applications and impacts. As envisioned, the center will create a unique and focused program in which faculty and students from a wide range of disciplines come together with industry, government, and non-government agencies to work toward the following objectives:\r\n \r\nConduct fundamental research to develop Smart Lighting. A strategic analysis has identified the critical attributes of future controllable light sources, and their underlying materials technology necessary to enable new and revolutionary functionalities that go far beyond present capabilities. At the device level,these attributes include polarization control, novel low- and high-index nanostructured materials, nanoepitaxial methods, photonic crystals, and novel types of phosphor distributions. These core innovations will be integrated into working devices and systems that are adaptable, controllable, and manufacturable. Testbed systems that use the devices will demonstrate advances in biomedical, display, transportation, and network communication technologies.\r\n \r\nEstablish a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary education and training program in Smart Lighting for students and professionals. The hands-on special education program Science You Can See, to be integrated with ERC educational materials, will increase the interest of a broad and minority-rich pre-college and undergraduate audience in science and engineering.\r\n \r\nRapidly transfer knowledge to the commercial sector and commercialize validated products. This will be achieved by working side-by-side with established firms and small startup companies in the concept,development, and validation stages of smart-lighting products. Providing industry with rapid access to key results while aggressively pursuing knowledge transfer and securing intellectual property.\r\n \r\nIncrease diversity through a focused effort to attract, educate, and advance women and underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities within the ERC pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate programs, and, ultimately, enable successful careers in Smart Lighting and related industries.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The ERC will establish a world-class program in Smart Lighting that will dominate scientific discovery and technological innovation in a new area of photonics. Research and education programs will lead to revolutionary advances in fields as diverse as biotechnology, display, transportation, and networked communications technologies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The ERC, through rapid commercialization, interactive education programs, and diversity outreach programs, will increase the competitiveness of US industry and make Smart Lighting products\r\nand benefits available worldwide. Additional key participation will come from strategic, corporate, and foreign academic partners. Training programs on entrepreneurship, intellectual property, marketing, and unintended consequences will create a culture of innovation and broaden the scope of research.",

(SSL).  The Center for Lighting Enabled Systems and Applications (LESA), originally named the Smart Lighting Engineering Research Center (ERC), is developing broad new lighting system capabilities enabled by LEDs. By integrating digitized, color tunable LED lighting with novel reflected light sensors and advanced control and data management systems, LESA has demonstrated how color and digitized illumination can create energy efficient, privacy-preserving ?lighting systems that think? with applications in healthcare and horticulture, energy efficient building systems, and human wellness and productivity.\n\nLESA?s research is divided into three main areas: (1) Advanced LED devices and optical materials for efficient illumination systems, (2) Light sensors that precisely measure how lighting is distributed throughout any illuminated space, and (3) Advanced control systems that interpret the light sensor data for a wide range of transformative value added services.

Further, 23 patents have been awarded to faculty members of the LESA ERC.\n\nLESA has developed several advanced testbeds that integrate research findings to demonstrate real world applications.\n\nLESA?s Smart Conference Room Testbed is an autonomously operated meeting space.  Special sensors detect the person count and location and whether they are sitting, standing or on the ground, and then estimates the amount and type of lighting needed for the sensed activity. Since no cameras are used, individuals cannot be identified.  U.S. Patent 9,766,123 has been issued to LESA for its plenoptic light field sensors that can simultaneously resolve spectrum, angle of arrival, light intensity and data streams for fully automatic control.\nLESA?s Hospital Room Testbed includes the ability to change light spectrum and intensity, along with sensors that will let researchers estimate the amount and color of light entering the human eye.  These testbeds are already located at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and the University of New Mexico Health Science Center.  The testbeds can be used to study patient response to lighting ? for example to study recovery time, or how a patient with traumatic brain injury might respond to different lighting scenarios.\nLESA?s Lighting for Communications testbed is located at Boston University and focuses on visible light communications (VLC), also call LiFi.  VLC provides high speed wireless data access with low power use and does not interfere with current radio frequency (RF) systems.  A U.S patent (9,621,268) issued to LESA researchers helps to overcome the bandwidth limitations of LEDs, providing a 3x to 5x improvement in data rates over current methods. Light based communications is becoming an important part of 5G and future wireless communications platforms.\nLESA?s Control Environment Agriculture testbed is developing low-cost biosensors to monitor plant stress so that the color and intensity of lighting can be automatically adjusted to maximize plant growth rates and nutritional value. \n\n\nThe Center graduated 59 students with doctoral degrees.  Of these, 33 had jobs working for industry upon graduation (9 were hired by LESA industry member companies), and 15 went on to academic institutions.
