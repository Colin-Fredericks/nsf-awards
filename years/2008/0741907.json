 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will promote studies of the genome of an economically important red alga, Porphyra (\"nori\", \"laver\"), which is a current sequencing project at the Joint Genome Institute (DOE).   Analysis of the Porphrya genome will include comparative studies with genomes of closely related and derived groups (e.g., other red algae, green algae, dinoflagellates).  The overall goal of this project is to establish a network of investigators whose members will provide the highest quality public dissemination of the Porphyra genome for use by researchers worldwide, while fostering new collaborations that will lead to experimental application of the genomic data.  It is anticipated that RCN-aided use of the Porphyra genome will lead to new understanding of nuclear-organelle co-evolution, studies of nitrogen and carbon metabolism in photosynthetic organisms, comparative investigations of how multicellular complexity arose independently in different eukaryotic groups, and the generation of a wealth of new markers for studies in molecular evolution and systematics.  The RCN will meet annually, with continued work among participants throughout the year.  Each annual meeting will include formal bioinformatics training, evaluation of the overall quality of genome annotation, and research reports and discussions on cross-genomic and experimental applications of the genomic data. The RCN will include many students and postdoctoral fellows who will form a group of genomics-competent young researchers organized around central questions that will impact key societal needs including multitrophic aquaculture (e. g., bioremediation) and an integrated analysis of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments as they affect carbon metabolism on our warming planet.  The website will include genome-related lessons for K-12 and college instructors, and the RCN will sponsor public convocations and professional symposia that will present the many contributions of the genome project while highlighting the diversity of scientists engaged in this work.",
