 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of project is to develop a method for estimating structural parameters (e.g., stiffness and damping), which will facilitate monitoring of structural health and detection of damage.  This research will utilize the substructure identification method for accurate damage localization.  The error analysis will be conducted to indicate sources of estimation inaccuracies, thereby suggesting approaches to modify structural behavior via the utilization of structural control techniques optimally to reduce the estimation errors.  The approach will accommodate lack of excitation information and large measurement noise.  The research will provide easy, quick and accurate structural parameter estimation methods that can be used for significantly improved characterization of the health of structures and the detection and localization of damage, whether from acute events such as natural disasters or long-term degradation due to environment and human use and abuse.\r\n\r\nThe methods developed will have applicability to mechanical and aerospace structures as well.  The results will be disseminated to research community and industry through publications and conference presentations.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to, and will explore, topics in structural health monitoring and structural control, preparing them to be leaders in their future careers.  The results of the experiments will be used to develop a course materials for courses in structural dynamics.",
