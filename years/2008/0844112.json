 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction: This proposal is prepared in response to the devastating floods in Eastern Iowa and nearly\r\nthe entire Upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin during May-July 2008. In UMR Pool 16, above Lock and\r\nDam 16 at Muscatine, Iowa, waters abruptly rose from a highly managed stage of approximately 10 feet\r\nto 20 feet and then to nearly 24 feet from May-June 2008. This historic flood event coincided with\r\nintense spring cultivation and nutrient application activities in the heavily farmed landscape of the\r\nUpper Midwest resulting in a significant pulse of agricultural contaminants to the UMR system. This has\r\nled scientists to predict an almost unprecedented delivery of sediment and nutrients to Pool 16, the\r\nbroader Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThis event presents a unique, and short-lived, opportunity to test scientific hypotheses related to a\r\nhighly perturbed, large river ecosystem. This ecosystem of braided channels and natural backwaters is\r\nalready known to inadequately process nutrients such as nitrate to the degree required to protect the\r\nGulf from hypoxic episodes. Extreme, flood-related sediment deposition almost certainly impacts the\r\nnutrient processing cycle in the short and long term. It is also known that mussels and bacteria play a\r\nmajor role in nutrient cycling in the broad food web containing phytoplankton, zooplankton, microzooplankton,\r\ndissolved & particulate organic matter, and benthos. Given this confluence of events, and\r\nthe importance of understanding nutrient cycling, we wish to test the following hypothesis:\r\nIntense deposition of particulate organic matter from extreme flooding alters the freshwater mussel and\r\nmicrobial food webs through physical and chemical means.\r\nImmediate Need: The principal investigators feel this hypothesis can only be tested via the quickresponse\r\nSmall Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) funding mechanism since the highly perturbed\r\necosystem in question is actively returning to more steady-state conditions. The research team must be\r\ndeployed very soon to study the perturbed nitrogen cycling rates such that comparisons with baseline\r\nnitrogen processing rates can be made in the future.\r\nBroader Impacts: Floods occur around the world on a regular basis, but the frequency and extremity of\r\nthese events will increase given the influence of global climate change. This research will contribute to\r\nthe development of a ?theory of floods? that is proposed by colleagues at the University of Iowa. This\r\ntheory will seek to unify research related to hydrology, ecology, socio-economic, environmental and\r\nhuman consequences and influences on flooding. The impact of such research can be expressed in\r\nbillions of dollars, millions of acres of habitat, thousands of species, and centuries of human enjoyment.\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research will expand our knowledge of large river nutrient processing dynamics\r\nresulting from extreme flooding events and during baseline moments. Abrupt changes in nutrient\r\nloading and extreme shifts in algal compositions can influence food quality which may adversely affect\r\ndesirable and invasive freshwater mussels. This work will further characterize the relation between\r\nnutrient conditions and food quality for mussels and other biota in an important reach of the Upper\r\nMississippi River. Water quality, nutrients, and their effects of biological processes are key management\r\nconcerns in the Upper Mississippi River.",
