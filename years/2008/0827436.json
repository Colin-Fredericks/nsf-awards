 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting challenges in contemporary science is uncovering the genetic basis for the origin of uniquely human traits. Humans and other great apes are genetically very similar, yet diverse aspects of human anatomy, physiology, and behavior are markedly distinct. Recent technological developments provide the ability to begin identifying the specific genes that underlie these important trait differences. This project will focus on the evolution of human diet. Dietary traits are particularly interesting because the diet of early human ancestors and modern humans differ so markedly from those of the other great apes and because diet affects so many aspects of human health and disease. An interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and human geneticists will integrate genetic, organismal, and ecological information to better understand the genetic basis for the evolution of dietary traits in humans. \r\n\r\nThe primary intellectual goals of this project are to: (1) screen the human genome for relevant genes using two approaches, measuring gene expression across the entire genome from humans and chimpanzees in several tissues of dietary significance using ultra high-throughput sequencing and testing for adaptation in DNA sequences across the entire genome based on patterns of mutation; (2) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes implicated in trait changes during human origins through extensive DNA sequence comparisons among great ape species, detailed characterization of gene expression, experimental tests of functional differences, and associations between gene expression and specific dietary traits; and (3) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes among modern African human populations that are diverse with respect to diet and local climate, through detailed analyses of genetic variation, tests for natural selection, and genetic associations with specific dietary traits. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include: collaborations and resource building with African scientists, recruitment and training of women and minority trainees, education outreach to grade school students, building two novel and informative databases that will be easily accessible through the web, and developing software for comparative analysis of primate genome sequences and gene expression.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project was to study how modern humans have adapted to diverse diets by studying variation at genes that play a role in adaptation in African populations practicing different subsistence methods (hunting/gathering, pastoralism, agriculture, and agro-pastoralism).  Specifically, we proposed to identify regions of the genome that are targets of  natural selection in these populations and to carry out association tests between mutations implicated as targets of natural selection and variable anthropometric and metabolic traits in order to investigate the functional consequences of these mutations. These population analyses provide a valuable window into human origins by examining natural selection as an ongoing process and provide valuable insight about the genetic basis of variable traits which play a role in both health and disease in under-represented African populations.  Another aim was to train undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows, particularly those from groups that are under-represented in the sciences.\n\nIn order to address the disparity of human genetic studies in Africa, over the period of this award, we and our African collaborators conducted field work in Eastern and Southern Africa and collected DNA and other bio-specimens from &gt;2400 individuals, an important scientific resource.  These individuals originate from ethnically diverse populations who have distinct diets and live in diverse environments.  Therefore, these populations likely have experienced local adaptation and have population or region-specific genetic variants, some of which may play a role in adaptation to diet.  For all of these samples we have also collected detailed data on anthropometric, metabolic, and cardiovascular traits. \n\nBecause knowledge of demographic history is important for interpreting studies of adaptation to diet, we completed several studies of genetic diversity and demographic history in geographically and ethnically diverse Africans using mtDNA (inherited maternally), Y chromosome (inherited paternally), and nuclear genome (inherited from both parents) variation.  We identified millions of novel genetic variants and results of these studies have shed light on human evolutionary history.  Additionally, we used genome-wide scans of genetic variation to identify regions of the genome that are targets of natural selection in populations with diverse diets.  We identified genes that play a role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and taste perception.  Additionally, we studied levels of a protein that plays an important role in digestion of carbohydrates (amylase) and demonstrated a correlation with diet.\n\nWe also completed a number of targeted studies at genes that are likely to play a role in adaptation to diet.  For example, we studied the genetic basis and evolutionary history of bitter taste perception across hundreds of Africans with diverse diets.  We also characterized genetic diversity at regions of the genome that regulate lactose tolerance in 1,000 individuals from across the world.  We looked for associations between genetic variation and lactose tolerance in diverse Africans and identified several variants associated with this trait which arose independently in different regions of the world due to strong natural selection.  Additionally, we have characterized variation at genes associated with metabolism in global human populations in order to identify potential functional variants and to understand the role that natural selection has played in shaping variation at these loci. All data generated from this project have been made publically available in order to benefit the scientific community.\n\nAs we addressed the primary aims of the project, an added benefit was that we were also able to learn about the genetic basis of other genes that play a role in adaptation including those involved with adaptation to high altitude, infectious disease, drug response, and shor..."
