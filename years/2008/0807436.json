 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Daniel Savin and Dr. Holger Kreckel at Columbia University will examine destruction rates for the hydrogen molecule H3+ in the laboratory with applications for studying molecular clouds and emission line objects such as Galactic and extragalactic gaseous nebulae. The laboratory measurements will focus on measurements of H3+ dissociative recombination, which plays an important role in the formation of complex molecules observed in molecular clouds. The team will also make similar measurements for oxygen (O2+), sulfur (S2+), and neon (Ne2+) molecules to determine the effective temperature of ionizing stars in HII regions.\r\n\r\nThis work will impact the astronomical community by generating atomic and molecular data that can be used to interpret astronomical observations. This will be a trans-disciplinary effort, bringing together astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics. The research will also help foster international collaborations in astrophysics as it will be carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, as no facilities currently exist in the U.S. for the proposed studies.",

As we\nstrive to improve our understanding of these objects, it is necessary\nto be able to model and interpret their chemical composition, charge\nbalance, emission and/or absorption spectra, and thermal structure.\nThis, in turn, requires reliable knowledge of the underlying molecular\ncollisions which control these properties.\n\nWe have carried out a series of experimental and modeling studies of\nvarious molecular reactions important for the cosmic objects listed\nabove.  Our experimental work includes studies of the chemistry\nleading to the formation of the first stars, electron driven\nchemistry, and molecular spectroscopy.  Our modeling work includes\nstudies of molecular-driven cooling in primordial clouds leading to\nthe formation of the first stars and studies of the chemistry in dense\nmolecular clouds.\n\nThe broader impacts of our work have been many.  We have trained three\npostdoctoral research scientists, one undergraduate, and a high school\nscience teacher.  The project has brought together researchers from\nmany different institutions and countries.  It has lead to several\ntalks for the general public and inspired an art piece which was shown\nin New York City.
