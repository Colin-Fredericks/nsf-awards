 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNon-native plant species are an ever-present part of forests today and often negatively influences their adopted natural habitat by reducing survival of native plant and animal species. The present study will investigate the impact of Amur honeysuckle, an invasive non-native shrub, on the forests of Southwestern Ohio. The research will focus on nutrient cycling within this ecosystem by examining the relationship between organic inputs (e.g., fallen leaves), soil nutrients, and soil microbial diversity and composition (bacteria and fungi).  These parameters strongly influence how fast nutrients are cycled through an ecosystem and may be an important predictor of what species will be most successful in an area.  The study will elucidate differences between forested sites with and without honeysuckle and examine the potential for and time-scale of recovery of below-ground resources through honeysuckle removal experiments.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will provide new insights that may enhance forest restoration efforts. By integrating research and education the project will enhance undergraduate education through hands on research experiences and encourage broader participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. To achieve these goals the project will, create summer research positions for college students from underrepresented groups, develop an exciting inquiry based laboratory that will introduce students to forest ecology through engaging them in actual field research, and  conduct short-term summer classes for K-12 students from local public schools.\r\n",
