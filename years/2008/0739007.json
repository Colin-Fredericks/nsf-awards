 "awd_abstract_narration": "The logic group at Notre Dame is well established.  Our graduate\r\ntraining program produces doctorates who have experienced the many\r\ndimensions of research, teaching, and mathematical communication.  At\r\nNotre Dame, the students develop a solid independent research record.\r\nThey make themselves known to the international mathematical community\r\nby participating in conferences and workshops and giving talks, in\r\naddition to writing papers.  They have the opportunity to discuss\r\nresearch with specialists from around the world, and to participate in\r\ncollaborative research.  By the time they graduate, they are full\r\nmembers of the international community of mathematicians.  Notre Dame\r\noffers graduate students opportunities to teach and training to help\r\nthem be successful.  Our students have experienced a greater variety\r\nof teaching experiences.\r\n\r\nOur logic postdoctoral associates have been allowed significant time\r\nto develop a research program of their own.  They have taught students\r\nof all levels, from first-year liberal arts undergraduates to advanced\r\ngraduate students.  They have been involved in mentoring graduate\r\nstudents, in leading small group learning activities, and other more\r\nadvanced aspects of faculty life.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides partial support for all of the US nationals\r\nstudying Mathematical Logic at Notre Dame, and support for the first\r\nof a two year postdoctoral associate in logic.  In addition, it will\r\nprovide some travel money for the students and postdoctoral associate,\r\nand some money for books for the students.  Finally, the grant will\r\nprovide some travel money for outside visitors to come to Notre Dame\r\nto interact with the faculty, students, and postdoctoral associate.\r\n",
