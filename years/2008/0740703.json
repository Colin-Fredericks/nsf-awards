 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to develop super hydrophobic coatings for endotracheal tubes that can deliver antimicrobial drugs as well.    The coatings and the process to coat the surfaces are proprietary, but the technology, if successful, may provide a method for minimizing infections that are associated with long term placement of the tubes.  \r\n\r\nVentilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant problem in mechnically ventilated patients.  Development of antimicrobial surfaces for the ventilation tube is likely to have a significant beneficial effect in this area by reducing the incidence of VAP and the morbidity and mortality associated with such infections.  Moreover, the technology is likely to have applications in other circumstances and once developed, such surfaces could be used to give other material such as venous cannulae that are placed into hospitalized patients for extended periods antibacterial properties.",
