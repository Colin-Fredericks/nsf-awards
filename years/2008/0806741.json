 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through its Benjamin Banneker Scholars program, Central State University (CSU) is strengthening its STEM programs and broadening the STEM workforce by offering scholarships, in conjunction with academic and other student support, to high-achieving high school seniors and current CSU freshmen or transfer students.  CSU, one of the nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the only public one in Ohio, promotes matriculation and retention of its students through their participation in learning communities and a common first year seminar, support through a Center for Student Opportunities, and opportunities to excel in an Honors Program.  In addition to their scholarships, each Banneker Scholar -   \r\n   (a) participates in a STEM Learning Community in which he/she lives in close proximity to other Scholars in the same residence hall while taking the same core set of rigorous courses;\r\n   (b) receives advising and mentoring by a faculty member whose expertise is in the scholar's interest area;\r\n   (c) is tutored when assistance is needed with an academic area; \r\n   (d) has access to other support services, as needed, including professional development, study skills, and counseling;\r\n   (e) is encouraged into STEM-related internships in industries, governmental agencies and research institutions; and  \r\n   (f) is provided assistance in placement into careers and/or graduate or professional school.\r\n\r\nThe CSU Banneker Scholar program promotes academic excellence and the cross-fertilization of ideas among STEM fields.  A cycle of year-round mentoring by experienced faculty mentors, interaction with peer and professional role models, and research training provides the inspiration for Banneker Scholars to compete in graduate school and professional careers in STEM fields.",
