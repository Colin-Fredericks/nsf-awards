The approach is to utilize advanced electromagnetic band engineering with electromagnetic crystals to modify the normal broad peak of the blackbody radiation in the infrared (IR) or higher frequency ranges to achieve a sharp radiation peak in the desired THz region. By incorporating semiconducting or liquid-crystal layers into the EBG structure, real-time tunable THz sources will also be considered. Novel modeling and simulation techniques that incorporate both the electromagnetic and thermal dynamics will be combined with state-of-the-art fabrication facilities and testing equipment to realize the optimized designs and experimentally demonstrate the basic ideas.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits: This research will explore several novel ideas of combining electromagnetic bandgap engineering with thermal sources to dramatically enhance their THz emission.  The accurate modeling approaches, the advanced band engineering techniques, and tunable electromagnetic crystals to be studied will contribute significantly to the understanding and engineering of materials, blackbody radiation, and their applications in THz systems.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research may lead to a completely new type of THz source and enable numerous interdisciplinary THz application concepts, including non-destructive medical imaging, remote sensing for transportation, bio-chemical agents and explosives detection for homeland security, all-weather high resolution radar, and high bandwidth communications.  A concurrent and integrated research education component will include active participation of both graduate and undergraduate student and industrial researchers. It will emphasize outreach to underrepresented groups such as women and minorities and to local K-12 organizations.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
