 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diffusion (or inference) geometries , provide tools for organization of\r\nmassive digital data sets. Like differential calculus, they are used to\r\nbuild global inference relations between objects by combining \r\n``infinitesimal\" (linear) models. Harmonic analysis on such structures\r\nleads to multiscale folder building paradigms leading to powerful tools\r\nfor functional regression and analysis of massive complex data.\r\nThese geometric methods provide new insights in classical differential\r\ngeometry enabling explicit embedding theorems and coordinate systems for\r\nRiemannian manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe multiscale analytic methods lead to a systematic analysis tool for\r\nseemingly unstructured data bases, and enables the automatic generation\r\nof Ontologies and data induced languages. These methods are broadly\r\napplicable in medical diagnostics, in the organization and analysis of\r\npsychological questionnaires, as well as in all aspects of machine\r\nlearning from data mining to machine vision.",
