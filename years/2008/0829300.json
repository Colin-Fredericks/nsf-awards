 "awd_abstract_narration": "URM Alaska: In from the Cold is a three year pilot project at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) that is designed to prepare under-represented minority undergraduate students for post graduate studies and research careers in the biological sciences. The strategy for meeting this goal is to engage students in exciting, publishable research projects under the the guidance of established faculty and to provide them with a strong mentoring component to keep them retained in science. The program will target junior Alaska Native students and provide them with annual stipends, travel to professional meetings, and research supplies. Faculty mentors will help students develop their laboratory and communication skills. The student research experience will be supplemented with a science career seminar series and group networking activities.  Four students will be recruited the first year. An additional four students are expected to participate in the second year. At the end of 3 years, it is expected that eight Native Alaska students would have completed the program, with each cohort spending 2 years in the program. About half of the students will be enrolled in the Biochemistry/Molecular Biology program and the other half will be in the Biology and Wildlife Program. More information is available from the PI, Dr. Thomas Clausen, at FFTPC@UAF.EDU, or by visiting www.uaf.edu/chem.",
