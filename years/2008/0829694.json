 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers, if built, will have great impact on defense and\r\ncommerce in the area of secure communication.  They will also allow\r\nsimulation of complex quantum systems, providing an important tool\r\nfor nanotechnology. The principal challenge in actually building\r\nquantum computers is finding a way to tolerate imperfections. In\r\nfault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), the faulty operations that\r\ncause computational errors must be used to detect and correct those\r\nerrors. A radical approach to FTQC is to base the computational\r\nscheme on topology.  Computation is performed by braiding\r\ntopological structures; fault-tolerance arises naturally due to the\r\ninvariance of large-scale topology to small, local distortions\r\ncaused by random errors. Until recently, implementation of this\r\nrather abstract idea has demanded exotic, unobserved physical\r\nparticles or unrealistically high-dimensional structures. However,\r\nit was recently shown that topological FTQC may be achieved in a\r\ntwo-dimensional lattice of quantum bits in a scheme relying on a\r\nnovel form of quantum entanglement called a cluster state.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the conversion of topological\r\ncluster-state-based FTQC into a realistic, scalable, solid-state\r\nhardware architecture. The particular hardware studied relies\r\ncritically on computation via communication, enabling reasonably\r\nsized quantum processors to be connected to form quantum\r\ncommunication networks or large quantum multicomputers. The\r\ninvestigators experimentally develop semiconductor-based quantum\r\nmemories in optical microcavities, optimized for quantum logic\r\nmediated by light in integrated optical waveguides.  The research\r\nincludes the development of experimental methods to fabricate and\r\ncharacterize large arrays of these qubits, while detecting and\r\ncompensating for fabrication defects.  These experimental efforts\r\nare supported by theoretical development of scalable, topologically\r\nfault-tolerant architectures designed around the observed hardware\r\nlimitations.\r\n",
