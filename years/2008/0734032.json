 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator plans to analyze the role of viscous stresses and viscous energy dissipation in the magnetized plasma of the solar corona, since viscosity can strongly influence the dynamics and energetics of the magnetic field in the corona.  His team will study the contribution of viscous dissipation to coronal heating and flare energy release by employing a combination of analytical arguments and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.  The team will incorporate the effects of viscosity, compressibility, and flux pile-up into a steady Sweet-Parker reconnection model; compare the predicted scalings with the observed flare power output and the speeds of reconnection jets; obtain new transient solutions describing the viscous decay of field disturbances in the vicinity of magnetic nulls in the solar corona; and evaluate the contribution of these processes to coronal heating.  The principal investigator intends to compare his visco-resistive solutions with numerical results of modeling collisionless magnetic reconnection, based on Hall MHD equations, in order to determine when this analysis is valid and when a more rigorous (but more complicated kinetic) treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe expected results will help in interpreting the available data from spacecraft such as SOHO, Yohkoh, TRACE, and Hinode.  More generally, the research will contribute to the development of physics-based models for space weather, with concomitant benefits to society.  The activities will contribute to the integration of research and education, as well as promote teaching, training, and learning.  The project involves the participation of a postdoctoral research scientist as collaborator, and the proposer himself (as a research assistant professor) will interact with University of New Hampshire (UNH) undergraduate and graduate students, serve on thesis committees, and enrich the classroom education and research experience of UNH students.\r\n",
