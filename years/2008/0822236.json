 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique feature of the nervous system is the vast number of cell-cell connections called synapses.  At synapses, nerve cells communicate with each other and with other target cells.  At chemical synapses, and upon activation, nerve cells release transmitter from small synaptic vesicles (SVs) and then recycle these vesicles for reuse.  Hence, SV recycling plays a major role in neuronal function.  Clathrin and its associated molecules are critical players in vesicle recycling.  However, the molecular mechanisms by which SVs are recycled are not fully understood.  This project is directed towards understanding how SV proteins are recruited and recycled into newly formed vesicles.  Genetic and biochemical studies from Dr. Zhang's laboratory and others suggest that the clathrin-accessory protein AP180 regulates both the rate and the fidelity of clathrin-mediated recycling of SVs.  This project will test the hypothesis that AP180 also plays a role in helping retrieve vesicle proteins during vesicle recycling.  They will be examining whether and how the composition of SVs is altered in mutant fruit flies (Drosophila) deficient of AP180 and also will investigate the mode by which AP180 might interact with vesicular proteins.  These studies are expected to advance the understanding of SV recycling and nerve cell function.  This project also closely integrates research with education, training, and outreach to local communities.  He has trained and mentored undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows, including women and students from underrepresented groups.  Eleven undergraduates were co-authors with him on a prior NSF-sponsored project, including one as first author.  During this funding period, he will continue his educational efforts in student mentoring and course development.  In addition, he will be reach out to local schools and train elementary science teachers through a summer program organized by the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History at OU.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merits:  The power of the brain relies on the health and function of the connections (called synapses) formed between the brain cells or neurons.  One outstanding question is how the synapse continues to relay information from one neuron to the next neuron.  This process depends on the basic functional unit of the synapses, the synaptic vesicle, which contains neurochemicals essential for neuronal signaling. Synaptic vesicles are recycled and reused for neuronal signaling even after they are fused into the plasma membrane.  The puzzle is how synaptic vesicles retain their original proteins.  This proposal used a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry, electrophysiology and cell biology to address this major question in the field of neuroscience.  Specifically, this project examined the role of a protein (called AP180) in sorting and retrieving critical proteins on the basic unit of the neuronal connections (i.e., synaptic vesicles). The main findings from this project provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synapses efficiently recycle functional synaptic vesicles. \n\nBroader Impacts:  There were several significant broader impacts of this project on student training, career development, engagement of members of underrepresented groups and women in research, and outreach to local communities.  The PI trained two postdoctoral fellows, one research assistant, involved undergraduate researchers, and collaborated with colleagues.  Significantly, five women, and one of whom was Hispanic, contributed significantly to the completion of the project.  Finally, the PI has maintained an excellent record of engaging the general public about scientific research.  Such outreach activities included scientific demonstrations in local museums, presentation of a public seminar in Saturday Morning Science series, involvement of middle school students in science projects and of undergraduate students in lab research, and participation in NSF organized outreach activities such as 2013\u00c6s event, \"Change the World: Science &amp; Engineering Careers Fair\".  Through these and other outreach activities the PI and his students have and will continue to positively impact society through science.\n\nMajor Findings:  This project enabled the PI and his associates to test the major hypothesis that a specific neuronal protein called AP180 plays a critical role in sorting and retrieving synaptic vesicle proteins into newly formed vesicles.  First, acute inactivation of AP180 does not affect exocytosis but rather specifically impairs synaptic vesicle endocytosis.  Second, synaptic vesicle proteins are no longer colocalized in the synapse following the acute inactivation of AP180, suggesting that AP180 is required to cluster vesicular proteins during endocytosis. Third, in support of the above observations AP180 is shown to interact with a subset of vesicle proteins, providing a potential mechanistic means for AP180 to sort and retrieve vesicle proteins.  Finally, vesicle protein distribution and composition are found to be altered in the mutant flies lacking AP180.  These data collectively support a model in which AP180 helps retrieve vesicle proteins through interaction with select vesicle proteins.  The significance of these findings is basic in that they advance the understanding of how synapses work to retain vesicle identity and functionality.  They also have important insights into health as AP180 is one risk factor for late onset Alzheimer\u00c6s disease.  In Alzheimer\u00c6s patient brain AP180 is selectively reduced in levels, implying that loss of the ability to sort and retrieve synaptic vesicle proteins may contribute to the dysfunction of the brain in these patients.  Hence, studying basic neuroscience in a genetic model organism like fruit flies can have unexpected impact on understanding human health. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bing Zhang"
