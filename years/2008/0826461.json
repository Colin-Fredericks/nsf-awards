 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed investigation uses experimental and analytical methods to evaluate the effects of temperature and sustained loading on reinforced concrete structures strengthened with externally bonded fiber reinforced polymers. It includes the individual components of the strengthening system and the concrete/epoxy interface, and uses this information to model the long-term structural performance of strengthened systems. The robustness of the proposed numerical analysis procedures stems from the innovative use of fracture and damage mechanics approaches to characterize the individual materials and interfacial properties of strengthened systems. Therefore, the analysis will be capable of predicting the behavior of strengthened structures of any scale.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion of the project, the research and engineering communities will have a better understanding of the dual mechanisms of time dependent deformation and degradation of adhesion in the strengthened system and how these mechanisms affect the remaining structural strength and safety.  The investigators have detailed plans for integrating their activities and findings into the profession, in their university teaching, and in outreach programs targeting underrepresented groups. Thus, the research will contribute: (i) new experimental data on the effects of time and temperature on strengthened system performance; (ii) a new modeling approach for overall structural performance based on material and interfacial properties; and (iii) knowledge dissemination and human resource development for the benefit of the research community, practicing engineers, and students.\r\n",
