The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.  The project will link into the Sloan Fellowship program for Minority Ph.D. candidates at Penn State, which is co-led by PI Dr. Cannon.  There will also be participation in Penn State's CURO program, which facilitates minority undergraduate research.",
