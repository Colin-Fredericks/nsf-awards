Each scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program.  Students are engaged in team-based projects -- motivated, for example, by the power grid, avionics systems, and enterprise computing -- in which they build example applications using the latest computer security techniques.  Upon graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in an IA position.  This scholarship program is helping to address the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.  The project involves outreach to minorities and to two-year college transfer students.\r\n",
