 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years witnessed a steady progress in the field of high precision quantum\r\nelectrodynamics of hydrogenlike bound states. Both the experimental errors and the\r\naccuracy of theory were signifcantly improved. As often happens this rapid progress\r\nleads to new problems. In the field of high precision quantum electrodynamic theory of\r\nbound states the long term problems are as follows;\r\n1. The theoretical error of the 1S Lamb shift in hydrogen should be reduced signifcantly\r\nbelow the level of 1 kHz (and respectively of the 2S Lamb shift significantly below tenth\r\nof kHz)\r\n2. The theoretical error of the hyperfine splitting in muonium should be reduced to about\r\n10 Hz\r\n3. The theoretical error of the 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen should be reduced\r\nbelow .001meV.\r\nAll main theoretical problems of the theory of light hydrogenlike atomes will be\r\naddressed in the proposed research. Its main objectives include;\r\n1. Complete calculation of all three loop nonrecoil corrections of order \\alpha^3(Z\r\n\\alpha)^5m to the Lamb shift in hydrogen. These are the largest still unknown\r\ncontributions to the Lamb shift. Respective three loop\r\nnonrecoil corrections to hyperfine splitting in hydrogen and muonium also will be\r\ncalculated.\r\n2. Complete calculation of all three loop radiative recoil corrections of order\r\n\\alpha^3(m/M) E_F to hyperfine splitting in muonium.\r\n3. Calculation of nonlogarithmic corrections of order \\alpha^2(Z \\alpha)^4 m to the Lamb\r\nshift in muonic.\r\nCalculation of light by light electron loop contribution of order \\alpha^2(Z \\alpha)^3 m to\r\nthe Lamb shift in\r\nmuonic hydrogen.\r\n4.Resolution of the discrepancy in the theory of bound state g factors in systems\r\nincluding particles with spins j \\neq 1/2/",
