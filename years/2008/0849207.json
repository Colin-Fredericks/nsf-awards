 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advancing knowledge in the biological sciences involves\r\nexperimentally testing hypothesesand interpreting the \r\nresults based on prior scientific work. Researchers face \r\nthe challenge of collecting, evaluating and integrating \r\nlarge amounts of different kinds of information about \r\norganisms, cells, genes and proteins to generate a valid\r\nhypothesis. And once a hypothesis is generated, the challenge \r\nis to evaluate the hypothesis with respect to what \r\nis already known. \r\n\r\nOur proposed research will:\r\n\r\n1.\tTest the scalability and extensibility of a novel \r\n\tcomputer system that allows biologists to construct \r\n\tand evaluate alternative hypotheses against a knowledge \r\n\tbase on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. \r\n\r\n2.\tTest a knowledge archive that supports the archiving \r\n\tand search of validated hypotheses.\r\n        \r\nIn our work, we define a hypothesis as a statement about \r\nrelationships between components of a biological system \r\nthat are intended to explain experimental observations. \r\nA set of validated hypotheses can be used as building blocks \r\nto construct larger, more complex models such as \r\npathways. We plan to develop and test a new paradigm: \r\nthat of hypothesis-driven querying of model organism knowledgebases. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work, called HyQue (for Hypothesis-based Querying \r\nof pathway models), will take as input working hypotheses about\r\npathway models expressed in a knowledge-based formalism, \r\nevaluate their consistency using existing data in a knowledgebase, \r\nand provide as output contradictory evidence and suggestions for\r\nimproving hypotheses.  HyQue will incorporate formal knowledge \r\nrepresentations based upon Semantic Web standards and \r\nan ontology to represent biological objects and relationships.\r\nHyQue will also contain a library of rules that determine \r\ncounts of support and contradiction for a given hypothesis. \r\n\r\nWe will prototype an archive of hypotheses that allows users \r\nto compare their hypothesis with other hypotheses submitted by \r\ntheir peers.  We will explore the capability to:\r\n\r\n\t(1) express working hypotheses about the yeast cell cycle; \r\n\t(2) provide integration of data in the Saccharomyces Genome \r\n\t    Database to evaluate/test pathway-specific hypotheses; \r\n\t    and\r\n\t(3) archive these results. \r\n\r\nAs analytical tools and database resources proliferate, \r\nbiologists require facilities to integrate existing data \r\ninto knowledge that can create a shared understanding of\r\nbiological models. Our work will explore the expressivity \r\nand scalability of unique and novel querying and contradiction based \r\nreasoning methods that use rich formal knowledge specifications of\r\nbiological events in order to accomplish information integration. \r\nOur proposed work will lead to a novel paradigm of querying \r\nbiological knowledge that can dynamically retrieve, integrate and\r\ninterpret information in terms of biologically relevant \r\nrelationships asserted as pathway models. Our work will \r\nexamine the value of Semantic Web technologies in building \r\na knowledgebase for such querying and reasoning and will \r\naid in standardizing models of biological knowledge and \r\nadd momentum to a range of ongoing ontology building efforts. \r\n\r\nFurther information on the project can be found at the \r\nproject web page: http://nigam.web.stanford.edu/hyque \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
