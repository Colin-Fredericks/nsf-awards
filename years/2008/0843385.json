 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the Internet evolves into a global communication infrastructure, \r\nit is becoming complex and ubiquitous. It is bringing together \r\nheterogeneous collections of hosts and network devices such as \r\nwireless mesh networks. A consequence of this ever-increasing \r\nscale, complexity and agility is that problems of managing this \r\ninfrastructure keep getting worse. Research concentrating on \r\nstreamlining fundamental issues has shown that absence of a single \r\nend-to-end lightweight hybrid network management solution with the \r\nnecessary levels of context awareness and adaptability, while much \r\ndesirable, has not yet been realized.  Consequently, the community \r\nis still detained from fully gaining from many of the emerging \r\napplications of the cyber-infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nThis research involves an exploratory investigation towards a \r\n?drive through? network management platform for ?on-the-fly? \r\nInternet-enabled mobile networks. Objectives include new conceptual \r\napproaches that couple application, and middleware designs with design \r\nof network management services; novel theoretical models that tap into \r\nin-network management characteristics of pervasive computing so that \r\nmissing or conflicting information gathered from multiple participating \r\nnodes can be tolerated; augmentation of security management algorithms \r\nwith trustworthiness functionalities; theoretical schemes that examine \r\nepistemic uncertainty by fusing imprecision, uncertainty and event \r\nsynchronization with belief theory; and extensions to archetype \r\nplatforms for supporting autonomic network management and configuration.  \r\nThe intellectual merit of the research lies in presenting a first step \r\ntowards synthesis of integrated network management theoretical and design \r\nsolutions that support traditional network management protocols and \r\nfunctionalities in addition to the dynamic aspects of infrastructures-less \r\nnetworks. Although some risk exists, focused research can overcome the \r\ncurrent barriers. The broader impact of the research is that this work \r\nwill pave the way to transformative next generation network management \r\nparadigms and tools.",
