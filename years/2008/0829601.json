 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe approach to improving computing education is to connect computer science teachers at different levels in order to develop a community focused on common goals and activities that will revitalize both undergraduate and high school computing education.  The disciplinary commons of computing educators (DCCE) takes the path of transforming computing education by transforming computing educators.  This project will focus on introductory computer science teacher in Georgia.  Any change or reform in education must involve the teachers; this project starts with the teachers.  The strategy is to gather introductory computer science teachers from different universities along with high school computer science teachers, especially advanced placement teachers.  These teachers naturally have common interests in approaches and common topics to discuss.  High school teachers are interested in what happens at the post-secondary level and how best to prepare their students.  University teachers want to enhance the transition of students from high school and to encourage more students to learn computing.  The discussions are encouraged by developing engaged researchers and community leaders.  Different approaches will be supported, with ideas seeded into the community.  The ongoing research will enhance the teaching done, which has been shown to contribute to student learning.  The project will create a model for teachers in other areas of computing and the rest of the country.  \r\n",
