In\r\nparticular, this project extends the state of the art in schema and\r\nontology matching, and therefore in data integration, by testing and\r\nevaluating methods and strategies that establish relationships among\r\nsemantically related concepts in heterogeneous data sources.\r\n\r\nThe following research issues are addressed: (1) Design of methods and\r\nalgorithms for schema and ontology matching that operate at different\r\nlevels of granularity (e.g., concept, structure); (2) Development of a\r\nprototype of an integrated system that supports the visualization and\r\nmanipulation of large schemas and ontologies in addition to the\r\ndeveloped matching methods and algorithms; (3) Test and evaluation of\r\nthe above methods and system prototype in terms of their\r\neffectiveness, including accuracy (precision, recall) and efficiency\r\n(execution time). From an educational viewpoint, this project impacts\r\nthe design of courses and the research training of graduate and\r\nundergraduate students, and of a postdoc.\r\n\r\nFurther information about this project can be found at:\r\nhttp://www.cs.uic.edu/~ifc/grants/SchemaOntologyMatching/\r\n\r\n",
