 "awd_abstract_narration": "For problems exhibiting strong anisotropic features the finite element method \r\n(FEM) based on anisotropic meshes can be much more efficient than the one \r\nbased on isotropic meshes, provided the meshes are properly aligned and the \r\nright aspect ratios are maintained. However, there has been little rigorous \r\nanalysis about it, and most computational work has been restricted to linear \r\nelements, based on heuristic justification and ad-hoc treatments.\r\nThe aim of this project is to provide the numerical analysis for the FEM \r\non anisotropic meshes and develop effective controls for the adaptive\r\nmesh refinement. The main objectives of this project include:\r\n(i) Analyze various recovery type error estimators for the FEM \r\non anisotropic meshes; (ii) Develop reliable mesh metrics and mesh \r\nquality measures to control the anisotropic mesh refinement process; \r\n(iii) Develop a software tool box for the post-processing of the\r\nfinite element solutions, including error estimation, mesh metrics \r\nconstruction, and mesh quality evaluation. (iv) Provide research training \r\nto graduate students on adaptive finite element computation in science \r\nand engineering.\r\n\r\nError estimation and adaptive mesh refinement are two major components \r\nin practical finite element simulations. The former assesses the accuracy \r\nof the solution and provides the quality assurance when it is delivered. \r\nThe latter is an indispensable tool for improving the solution when the \r\ndesired accuracy has not been reached. For anisotropic FEM, the elements \r\nare allowed to be long and narrow to fit the underlining problems more\r\neffectively. They may vary in sizes, orientations, and aspect ratios. \r\nThis project is aimed at providing better understanding of the behavior \r\nof anisotropic FEM and developing more efficient techniques for the FE \r\nsimulations. Since the recovery type error estimation techniques \r\nare simple, extraordinary robust, and most commonly used in engineering, \r\nit will be the main focus of this research. Successful completion of \r\nthis project will provide rigorous mathematical theory and more efficient \r\nalgorithms for practical FE modeling and simulations in aerospace \r\nengineering, material processing, and biomedical researches.",
