 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a partnership of 12 public community colleges, two universities, comprehensive and technical high schools, a pre-engineering program, local industry, and NASA. It is strengthening the 2 + 2 + 2 pathway in STEM disciplines by providing the opportunity for a diverse population of students to collaboratively work on real-world science, technology, and engineering applications. The partners are establishing interdisciplinary teams of high school, community college, and university students and mentors from two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and industry.  These teams are conducting research on real-world problems in life support and sustainable living projects for NASA, the U.S. Coast Guard, medical facilities, and other industry partners. The project is also developing industry-mandated professional skills and competencies such as teaming, leadership, and oral and written communications. The results of these real-world, problem-based-case-based projects are being used to write multi-media classroom and laboratory curricula that is piloted and disseminated regionally and nationally. The project is increasing the pool of technicians, scientists, and engineers who possess the requisite skill sets necessary for the 21st century workforce. The 2 + 2 + 2 seamless pathway provides a model for addressing a diverse population of students who may enter the workforce at various exit and entry points while continuing their education. \r\n\r\n",
