 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois Institute of Technology as the lead institution is collaborating with Michigan Technological University, Purdue University and Lehigh University to: 1)  develop a database of reliable and valid measures for assessing attainment of teamwork skills and ethical awareness in undergraduate students enrolled in multidisciplinary design projects and 2) identify and describe best practices from across these institutions that improve the achievement of team Learning Objectives and thereby increase program quality.  The goals are consistent with the objectives of: 1) assessing student achievement, 2) creating new learning materials and teaching strategies, 3) developing innovative approaches and 4) inclusion of a large diverse student population. Included in the project outcomes are: 1) a Guide for Assessing Multidisciplinary Teamwork and Ethical Awareness. This Guide contains self-assessments, peer assessments, and direct evaluations of work products and learning artifacts including descriptions of each measure, data on reliability and validity, and observations about the strengths and limitations of each measurable outcome; 2) a set of online learning materials and examples of best practices for developing competencies in interdisciplinary teamwork and ethical awareness within multidisciplinary undergraduate design project teams. \r\n",
