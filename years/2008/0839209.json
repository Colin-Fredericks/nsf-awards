NCES will create a contract with a survey organization to collect survey data from students in about 800 schools starting at the 9th grade and following them to age 26.  The student, teacher, and parent survey data will be merged with state administrative data.  Thus the final data set for these states will include detailed longitudinal data on student education histories, test scores, courses, demographics, and other survey information about parents and teachers.  In some of the states the student data will be linked with detailed teacher data.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this augmentation is to provide support for additional schools to create state samples.  NSF will also be involved in planning for future surveys of these students as they reach college age.",
