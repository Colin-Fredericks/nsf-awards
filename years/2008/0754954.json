 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site renewal application is a very well structured program with both the elements of individual research projects and those that develop a collaborative research environment for students.\r\nThis has been a successful REU at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln for the summers of 2004 and 2007. They have brought students together from the Midwest for research training around the common theme of psychology and the law.\r\nThis students take a full year in residence at the university.\r\nThe goal is to increase preparation for graduate study of members of underrepresented groups who already know they want to go to graduate school (a requirement of admission) rather than just stimulating students' potential interest in graduate school. Monitoring, evaluation, and long-term tracking procedures are excellent, with quantification of learning included. Plans to disseminate the effectiveness of the first three years of the REU is another valuable broader impact.",
