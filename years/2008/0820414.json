 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the Ohio State University (OSU), titled Center for Emergent Materials (CEM), performs integrated research on emergent materials and phenomena in magnetoelectronics. The aim of the Center research activities is to advance understanding of the emergent materials and phenomena and to develop highly sophisticated experimental and theoretical tools required to study them, which will lay down the scientific foundation for building future oxide-based electronic devices that can perform multiple functions, and energy-efficient, fast computers that have integrated memory and logic. The Center has two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG 1, Towards Spin-Preserving, Heterogeneous Spin Networks, will develop a new understanding of electron-spin injection and transport in low-dimensional, spin-preserving materials such as silicon and carbon. This understanding provides a new materials basis for creating novel high-density spin networks for next-generation computing. IRG 2, Double Perovskite Interfaces and Heterostructures, designs and controls multifunctional properties of innovative double perovskite heterostructures through the understanding of structure, defects, and magnetotransport properties at interfaces. This new knowledge of magnetism in metallic oxides enables important advances in the emerging field of oxide-based electronics. The IRGs are complemented by a Seed Funding program, which provides the necessary flexibility and vitality to CEM in responding swiftly and effectively to the rapidly-changing materials research landscape. Integrated with the research activities, CEM enhances classroom education, creates research internship opportunities, widens the Science-Technology-Engineering-Math (STEM) \"pipeline,\" and enhances diversity in STEM. Activities include an innovative education research program aimed at cognition of materials science concepts, K-12 outreach and visitation programs, undergraduate research programs, and graduate-education enhancement programs. The multidisciplinary OSU materials community is already home to major world-class shared experimental facilities, which are brought to bear on CEM research and education. The Center collaborates with the electronics, storage, and instrumentation industries; national laboratories and institutes; other U.S. universities; and international universities and laboratories in China, India, Germany, and United Kingdom.",
