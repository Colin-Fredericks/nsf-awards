 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the research and teaching of the\r\nmathematics of stochastic analysis, motivated by a number of timely\r\napplication areas. These applications, among them financial\r\nmathematics, telecommunications, risk measure analysis, dynamical\r\nqueuing systems, and green-house gas emissions, are key to attracting\r\nyoung talent towards stochastic analysis, which is an area that has\r\nbeen rewarded with a number of major mathematical prizes in the past\r\ntwo years. Some of the technical issues arising from the problems\r\nstudied here are: analysis of very heavy tailed distributions;\r\nstochastic partial differential equations; multiscale asymptotic\r\napproximations for jump processes; convex analysis for set-valued\r\nfunctions; limit theorems for time-changed Poisson process models of\r\nMarkovian service networks.  Tools of stochastic analysis are becoming\r\ncrucial for a core applied mathematics training, and this RTG aims to\r\ntrain a number of the future trainers, as well as practitioners of the\r\nskills, with rigorous foundations in this area.\r\n\r\nExpertise in probability, the mathematics of uncertainty, is in great\r\ndemand in the US: university mathematics departments and applied\r\nmathematics programs, operation and risk management, financial\r\nregulatory and public policy offices, bio-engineering, and the\r\ntelecommunications industry. The initiatives of this project are\r\ndesigned to attract talented US students to graduate degrees, as well\r\nas postdoc positions and beyond. The RTG's educational emphasis on\r\nmathematical methodology means that we will train people with broadly\r\napplicable technical skills that may later be applied in vastly\r\ndifferent contexts as demands and trends in the workplace evolve. In\r\nfinancial markets, for example, poor regulation and a lack of\r\nunderstanding of the risks involved, have contributed to wide-ranging\r\ncrises, such as that triggered by the subprime mortgage debacle in\r\nSummer 2007, threatening more and more retirement and endowment funds\r\nand public savings every day. We need to stop this run-away train. An\r\nultimate goal of this project is to contribute to this effort by\r\ndeveloping new tools and strategies to educate the future scientists,\r\npolicy makers and regulators, and potential investors about the risks\r\nand the mathematical language for their description and control. By\r\nfocusing on forms of risk which have traditionally remained off the\r\nradar screen of educators and practitioners, e.g. operational risk, we\r\nwill raise the level of awareness and make sound controls possible.\r\n",

These initiatives have benefited undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainings in the mathematica of stochastic analysis and applications.\n\nHistorically, there had been few U.S. national graduate students in the subject matter of the group, and the RTG award was crucial in rectifying this.
