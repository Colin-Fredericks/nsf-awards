 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is based on collaboration among North Carolina State University (NCSU), the University of Vienna, Austria (UV), and IFW-Dresden, Germany (IFW-D).  The scientific objectives of the research are to exploit a range of processing and characterization techniques and expertise to investigate the mechanical behavior of metals and alloys as a function of their grain size and stacking fault energy.  In particular, Cu and Cu-Zn alloys are prepared by processing techniques at the various institutions that, when combined, produce artifact-free bulk samples with a grain size range from ultra-fine (< 1000 nm) down to the finest achievable at the nanoscale (~ 10 nm). \r\n\r\nThe combined effort and facilities at NCSU, UV, and IFW-D are needed to achieve the processing objectives. The critical mechanical properties are determined by tensile, shear and nanoindentation tests at NCSU, compression, tensile and torsion tests at IFW-D, and fatigue and fracture toughness at UV.  The deformation mechanisms that are operative at the various grain sizes and stacking fault energies are probed by in situ x-ray diffraction line broadening studies under stress at UV and NCSU with collaborators.  In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) straining studies are done by IFW-D and NCSU, and in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is done at IFW-D.  An extensive set of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are also done at NCSU, while mechanism-based and related modeling is done at NCSU, UV, and IFW-D.  The exchange of graduate students and the faculty interactions among NCSU, UV and IFW-D constitute a major part of the project.\r\n",

The processing methods included the ball-milling of powders, their consolidation into bulk form by high pressure torsion, casting of a master alloy composition that all institutes used for study.  A variety of methods were used to characterize the microstructure of the samples including x-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy.\n\nCopper and copper-base alloys, such as copper-zinc and copper-zinc-aluminum, were studied and the processing-structure-property relations were determined.  The results of this research have provided information on the mechanical behavior of these materials with very fine or nanocrystalline grain sizes.  One important result is that with proper processing methods very high strength (more than 10 times stronger than conventional grain size copper) can be achieved in the small grain (nanocrystalline) size copper along with very good ductility &ndash; that is the ability to deform to large amounts before failure.  These technical advances should be useful for applications requiring high strength in small devices such as micro-mechanical-electrical systems.\n\nThe interactions among the graduate student at NCSU and graduate students at the University of Vienna and IFW  Dresden were important from both the technical success of this program and the mutual cultural enhancements of the groups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl C Koch"
