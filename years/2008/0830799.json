 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Biomedical Innovations Using Implementation-Aware \r\n          Agile Sensing and Signal Processing\r\nAbstract:\r\nMedical condition diagnosis is heavily based on sensor measurements \r\nand their processing. These measurements correspond to waveforms \r\nthat propagate over the complex body environment and are transformed \r\nlinearly or nonlinearly according to the characteristic environment properties.  \r\nHowever, the medical community does not fully exploit the potentials of \r\nadvanced processing matched to nonlinear structures or modern sensor \r\ntechnologies such as waveform agility that leads to significant estimation\r\nperformance improvements. This research exploits advanced \r\nimplementation-aware sensing and processing techniques to improve \r\nmedical diagnosis by: (a)  efficient processing using compressed sensing \r\nand nonlinear time-varying spectral methods; (b) estimation of environment \r\ndescriptors and disease state parameters combined with waveform-agile\r\nsensing; and (c) mapping estimation and waveform-agile sensing algorithms \r\nonto field-programmable gate arrays. This framework brings revolutionary \r\nadvances in diagnosing, treating, and tracking disease states that are \r\notherwise difficult to obtain as advanced processing techniques are either \r\nnot available or too costly.  The investigators also design on-line software \r\ntoolboxes with sensing experiments for use in outreach programs to recruit \r\nand retain freshmen and underrepresented student populations.\r\n\r\nThe research  integrates advanced signal processing, stochastic Bayesian \r\nestimation, and waveform-agile sensing with implementation-aware \r\nalgorithms to improve estimation of disease states.  The investigators study\r\ntime-frequency techniques matched to nonlinear structures to process biomedical \r\ndata. Compressive sensing methodologies are developed that reduce the\r\nnumber of required measurements and  allow for alternative computational \r\nalgorithms.  Mathematical descriptors are designed to model disease states using\r\ntime-varying transfer functions. Sequential Bayesian techniques and waveform \r\nadaptation are used to estimate information. Algorithm reconstruction procedures \r\nare developed that trade high performance for reduced implementation cost. \r\nFinally, the investigators design  algorithms cognizant of complexity and memory requirements.\r\n",
