Projects include\r\n-\tByzantine fault tolerance for long-running, nondeterministic systems,\r\n-\tPerformability in wireless mobile networks, and\r\n-\tHybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks.\r\nNovel methods are sought for providing Byzantine fault tolerance to long-running, nondeterministic distributed systems. Performance in highly stressed mobile wireless network is investigated in terms of high node mobility and strong interference, as is understanding of nodes? boundary behavior under extreme conditions seeking novel methods to survive the stress via cooperation. Lastly, a novel framework for hybrid emulation of wireless sensor networks is proposed to enable affordable experimentation at scale. The instrumentation consists of a cluster of servers connected by a managed high-speed switch forming a dynamically-configurable distributed computing testbed, servers to join the PlanetLab Consortium, and networking equipment to connect the testbed with an existing wireless network testbed. \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis project should have broad impact on security and dependability education. The tools and methodologies produced will be used by collaborators both in academia and industry (e.g., factory automation and highway work-zone safety).  The infrastructure and outcomes will be integrated with the education curriculum; courses on fault tolerant computing and performance analysis will be developed. Moreover, the team collaborates with high schools providing research experience for teachers.\r\n\r\n",
