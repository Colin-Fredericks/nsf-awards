The purpose of this supplement is to request funding to help defer the expenses of graduate students, minorities, women, and recent doctoral recipients in an effort to give them the opportunity to participate in the conference. The SEAM conference was first held at Virginia Tech. in 1985. Since then its location has rotated among the institutions in the southeast. The annual Shanks Lectures at the Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University date back to 1985.  The SEAM affords established and new researchers, and advanced graduate students, the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and discuss the wide variety of mathematics encompassed within modern and classical analysis. In particular, the conference has traditionally provided an opportunity for young researchers to present their work and to discuss their research with more experienced mathematicians. The diverse topics presented during the conference provide a unique opportunity to see the wide variety of problems in analysis.   The Shanks Lectures have played a prominent role in the Mathematics Department at Vanderbilt University for the past 23 years. The lecturer for this conference will be Charles Fefferman, Princeton University.  NSF's funding will be used completely for participants' support. Priority will be given to members of underrepresented groups, graduate students, postdocs, and younger faculty.\r\n",
