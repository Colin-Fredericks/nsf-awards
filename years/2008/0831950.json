 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year partnership between the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) and two discipline-based organizations, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC/PTEC, an effort of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers) and the American Chemical Society.  The project vision is the creation of a large and enduring national network of colleges and universities that have successfully negotiated difficult institutional constraints to establish strong, effective, and well-sustained high school teacher preparation programs in science and mathematics - programs that respond successfully to the need for accomplished science and mathematics teachers in their states and throughout the country.  Core objectives of the work are to: \r\n\r\n     a.  Create and support a national leadership network from up to 50 institutions of presidents, chancellors, provosts and their designees who are active at their institutions in improving mathematics and science education - and especially teacher education;\r\n\r\n     b.  Increase the number of disciplinary faculty who are contributing toward teacher preparation and who, through inter-departmental, inter-college and school-university partnerships, assume increased responsibility for the mentoring and induction of beginning teachers and the professional development of career teachers;\r\n\r\n     c.  Address and make demonstrable progress toward overcoming the challenges that impede the ability of universities to strengthen their science teacher preparation programs; \r\n\r\n     d.  Widely disseminate the results and lessons learned from this and other related projects, especially the lessons learned about: (1) changes in institutional policies and practices that enhance science teacher preparation programs and increase the participation of disciplinary faculty; (2) the programmatic features of exemplary science teacher preparation programs, (3) the features of successful Noyce Scholarship Programs; (4) securing the ongoing and active commitment of top institutional leadership to making teacher preparation - particularly in science and mathematics - a central university enterprise; (5) the role of the disciplinary societies in strengthening science teacher preparation and in the support of practicing teachers; and (6) state policy efforts that can facilitate improvement of science teacher preparation and that remove the disincentive for pursuing a career in teaching; and\r\n\r\n     e.  Provide support to the national networks of MSP and Noyce Scholarship programs, facilitating communication across these and other networks of science and mathematics education programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPromoting Institutional Change to Strengthen Science Teacher Preparation\n\n \n\nContext for the Grant \n\n \n\nIn 2007, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) developed the Science and Mathematics Teacher Imperative (SMTI), a commitment to increase the quantity, diversity and quality of the science and mathematics teachers member universities produce.  This commitment assumed an important role for the leaders of major public universities to embrace science and mathematics teacher preparation as a core component of their institutions\u00c6 missions.  The size and breadth of these institutions provide a unique opportunity to place a large number of students into classrooms having the highest quality preparation in their disciplines. \n\n \n\nThis RETA grant entitled \"Promoting Institutional Change to Strengthen Science Teacher Preparation,\" tested a theory of action that institutional change could be enhanced both by top leadership commitment and faculty ownership of the actions. We posited that APLU could affect the first, since it is a membership organization of presidents and provosts.  Collaboration with the American Physical Society and the American Chemical Society was intended to promote faculty participation.\n\n \n\nDesign of the Project \n\n \n\nTwenty seven institutions committed to SMTI were selected to participate in \u00e6The Leadership Collaborative\u00c6 (TLC).  Each institution designated a Team Leader with a team consisting of faculty from science and mathematics as well as education, university administrators and K-12 representatives.  APLU implemented a set of activities designed to galvanize institution leaders, encourage cross-college and cross-institution collaboration, and promote strategic thinking with regard to institutions\u00c6 science and mathematics teacher preparation programs.  Additional activities included: convening three learning communities; identifying promising/exemplary practices in teacher preparation; and seeking consensus on the characteristics of quality teacher preparation programs that included interviews with national experts and focus groups with disciplinary faculty in the sciences and mathematics.\n\n \n\nA grant supplement was awarded to support the completion of the Analytic Framework &ndash; a taxonomy of design and innovation for STEM teacher preparation and development.  This tool was used throughout the project to frame participants\u00c6 plans, to guide the promising/exemplary practices pilot, and to provide implementation strategies for Ten Key Questions that emanated from the program-quality initiative. \n\n\n\n\nOutcomes\n\n\n\n\nTLC participants reported that their most successful outcomes were strengthened cross-college collaborations (20/23) and engaged university leadership (16/23).  \nHalf the participating institutions increased science &amp; mathematics teacher production or enrollment.  The average production growth for TLC participants outpaced other APLU/SMTI institutions that were not part of the TLC project.\nNine (9) institutions accomplished campus-wide change, five of which were the only institutions to identify APLU\u00c6s efforts to galvanize institutional leadership as the most important thing the association did.  \nAll but two institutions with campus-wide change and program-restructuring (6) indicated that their university leadership was involved or supportive of their change efforts.  For those institutions that implemented program improvements only, the majority did not make reference to their university leadership being involved.\nInstitutions that were less advanced in their reform efforts at the beginning of the project found the participation of disciplinary societies to be more helpful.\nTwo other aspects of the project were highly valued by The Leadership Collaborative.  Almost all participating institutions (22/23) referenced creating opportunities for institutions to learn from one another as being valuable.  Raising the status of teacher preparation locally and/or nationally was al..."
