 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on investigating the lifetimes and chemical degradation pathways of specific compounds in organic aerosols.  There are two major objectives of the proposed research.  The first is to conduct well-controlled experiments using complex, atmospherically relevant mixtures to help bridge the gap between existing laboratory data on simple systems and atmospheric observations.  To better simulate actual atmospheric aging, the decay rate will be measured for approximately 30 organic compounds in aerosol particles generated from two complex mixtures:  motor oil and meat cooking grease.  These mixtures contain thousands of individual organics and are surrogates for important classes of primary organic aerosol.  The new data will be compared to existing data for simple systems to assess the significance of heterogeneous aging on atmospheric aerosol composition.  The second major objective is to investigate heterogeneous oxidation by hydroxyl (OH) radicals.  OH may be the most important oxidant given that the vast majority of the identified organic aerosol mass is comprised of saturated compounds.  This will be investigated by conducting smog chamber experiments with aerosolized motor oil and simple engineered mixtures.\r\n\r\nAirborne particles influence climate, degrade visibility, and impact human health.  The results will help improve atmospheric models used to understand the origin of organic aerosols.  These models are widely used to assess the potential effects of aerosols on global climate, regional visibility, and air quality, which are all important societal problems.  The project will also support the education of a number of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAirborne particles influence climate, degrade visibility, and impact human health.  Organic aerosol is a major component of fine-particle mass throughout the atmosphere.  The composition and properties of organic aerosols evolve in the atmosphere via heterogeneous uptake of oxidants, but these changes are poorly understood.\n\nThis project conducted experiments to measure the oxidation rate of a suite of organic compounds in particles of varying complexity, including single component particles, simple mixtures, lubricating oil particles, diesel exhaust particles, wood smoke particles, and woodsmoke extract particles. The experiments investigated the effects of gas-particle partitioning, relative humidity, and particle coating on oxidation rates.  The new data reveal that the oxidation rates of the target compounds (hopanes, steranes, levoglucosan, etc.) are slower in complex particle than in simple particles, but still fast enough to be an important loss mechanism in the atmosphere.\n\nUnderstanding the effects of air pollution on human health and climate and designing effective policy response to reduce those effects requires knowledge of the sources of pollutants.  Receptor models are an important tool to identify sources of air pollution.  Individual organic molecules are often used as tracers in these models to apportion ambient fine particulate matter to sources.  At present these models assume that these organic compounds are chemical stable in the atmosphere.  This project studied many compounds used as source tracers in receptor models.  To assess the potential bias caused by the assumption that the chemical tracers are atmospherically stable, we implemented the new kientic data in a chemical transport model. The results show that the oxidation of molecular markers such as hopanes alters important policy relevant conclusions such as the contribution of gasoline powered vehicles to ambient particle levels.\n\nThis project provided research and stipend support for one doctoral project and one postdoctoral project.  It also provided research support for projects performed by three other PhD students. Results from the project are described in seven peer-reviewed papers in the archival scientific literature.  Results from the project are being implemented in models by researchers at EPA and other institutions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allen L Robinson"
