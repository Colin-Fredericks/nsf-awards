 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II research project addresses the challenges of networks with extreme bandwidth delay products. Bulk data transfer over such networks used by national research laboratories and aerospace companies need to be provided with the endpoint resources required to ensure high performance in a cost effective manner. The outcomes of this project attempts to provide compatibility with present and future versions of GridFTP. The project addresses these challenges through the use of a novel offload engine. During the Phase I project, the feasibility of deriving and simulating the offload engine architecture, firmware, and creation of intellectual property (IP) for low-cost, high-performance field programmable gate array (FPGA) subsystems was completed. \r\n\r\nSuccessful results from this research will significantly advance the state of the art for off-load engines used in grid computing. Immediate applications include accommodating the e-Science community's need for scalable 10-100 Gbps off-load engines, while supporting present and future versions of GridFTP. Other applications include the use of our ultra high-speed offload engines for grid and cluster computing, utilizing our open source firmware. The FPGA code resulting from this project has the potential to be used as intellectual property that could then be marketed to off-load engine manufacturers. These IP cores would accrue cost-effective savings for existing engine firms and would accelerate products to the market.",

Our consultant from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) reviewed and advised us on our draft specification for the next interface between their cutting edge Grid computing file transfer protocol and our new network acceleration protocol.  ANL worked with SeaFire on installation, setup, and running their file transfer mechanism with our new prototype system.  ANL then guided and advised SeaFire on all such experiments.  The architecture, user environment, data transfer rates, and software processes were demonstrated to our commercial partner NASA through internet-based video conferences, presentations,  and videos.  \n\n     SeaFire Alpha-stage prototype performance improved to 20%-40% of network line speed per channel, which is a breakthrough for our new network acceleration protocol.  Single host system and system-on-chips passed data at 100% of the network line speed but only for tests internal to the computer with our chips.  Two hosts had initially passed data through standard Grid computing file transfer protocol through 50% and during our 6-month project extension we were able to improve this up to 80% channel bandwidth.  Bottlenecks were identified, a resolution plan was formulated, and a technical specification was created for the interface between our new protocol and the Grid computing file transfer protocol in order to approach network line rate.\n\n       Products:  SeaFire Alpha-stage prototype for future use by commercial partner tests in environments with multiples of 10 Gigabit Ethernet through 100 Gigabit Ethernet.
