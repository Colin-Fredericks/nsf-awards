 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within a few years, every laptop/desktop/server processor will be a\r\nmulti-core machine. For an application to perform well, it must be\r\nefficiently parallelized to execute on all the cores on the machine.\r\nChip manufacturers must therefore provide architectures that\r\nmake it convenient for programmers to partition an application into\r\nmultiple parallel threads. The Transactional Memory (TM) programming\r\nmodel is widely acknowledged to be the best known model for\r\nconcurrency: it eliminates deadlocks, provides high performance in\r\nthe common case, and greatly simplifies programming. It is receiving\r\ngreat attention in research conferences and is also being incorporated\r\nin commercial processors. One of the biggest overheads for such a\r\nsystem is the communication required between cores to implement\r\ntransactional semantics. This overhead significantly impacts\r\nperformance and power consumption of future processors. \r\n\r\nThe project explores algorithms to not only reduce the required amount of\r\ncommunication, but also explores mechanisms to reduce the overheads\r\nof communication. The key insight behind the proposed work is that an\r\noptimal on-chip network and transactional memory implementation will\r\nemerge by closely studying the interaction between the two. The\r\ninsight developed during this work will lead to better methodologies\r\nto compute an optimal on-chip network. The simulators and tools\r\ndeveloped during the research efforts will also support projects in\r\ngraduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Utah.\r\n",
