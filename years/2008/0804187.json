 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a joint research and education project between investigators at Johns Hopkins University in the US and Naomi Chayen at Imperial College in the United Kingdom, with a goal to study the heterogeneous nucleation of crystals of macromolecular species with diameters in the 1-10 nm range.  Typical species with this mesoscale include proteins and macromolecules, and are distinguished from colloidal spheres (at larger scales) and molecules (at smaller scales) by a large degree of internal configurational entropy; for this reason, they are difficult to crystallize.  The work here builds on an experimental observation made by Chayen that the nucleation rate of macromolecules on nanoporous substrates is greatly enhanced.  The working hypothesis is that the nucleation rate enhancement is specifically linked to the idea that the entropy of crystallization of macromolecules is minimized on porous substrates when a highly random porosity with void size of order the macromolecule width is used.  This idea competes with a published notion that the substrate curvature enhances crystallization, which we don?t think is relevant for macromolecules on porous substrates.  A detailed study of the nucleation rate of macromolecules over porous substrates as it varies with supersaturation, temperature, surface chemistry, and pore size, is being performed using a new substrate material ? nanoporous gold made by dealloying of silver/gold alloys.  Nanoporous gold is a random, uniform, mesoporous material whose mean pore size can be varied from 3-50 nm using only simple chemistry.  Its surface is also easily chemically modified, and all these features together make it uniquely perfect for this kind of study.  Nanoporous gold is also useful here because gold nanoparticles with equivalent curvatures can be made, and we can compare and contrast crystallization in solutions containing gold colloid to crystallization on porous substrates. \r\n\r\nThe research effort supports an international collaboration between the Chayen group at Imperial College, London, specializing in protein crystallization and the Erlebacher group at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, which specializes in the synthesis and surface modification of nanoporous metals.  By marrying these specializations, a fundamental study of heterogeneous crystal nucleation on nanoporous substrates will be efficiently pursued.  The collaboration is structured with significant exchange of students and junior personnel.  The results of this research will yield new understanding of the fundamentals of heterogeneous nucleation, with general applicability to protein and colloidal crystallization.  Furthermore, the international collaboration will help to build networks in nucleation theory and experiment, bridging the disciplines of thin film metallurgy and solution phase crystallization, and involving undergraduates and graduate students all stages.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProtein crystallization is a central element to the development of new drugs, the elucidation of biochemical processes, and our understanding of molecular biology.  In this study, a new approach was taken to study how proteins can be induced to crystallize via the help of nanoporous \"nucleants\" -- special, high area surfaces which allow crystallization to occur under milder supersaturation conditions than usually necessary (leading to better crystals).  To accomplish our goal of understanding the fundamental physics and chemistry controlling protein crystal nucleation on nanoporous substrates, this Materials World Network program was a collaborative effort between a protein crystallographer (Chayen; Imperial College London) and a metallurgist/electrochemist specializing in the fabrication of nanoporous metals (Erlebacher; Johns Hopkins University).  In the course of this research, the research groups learned different scientific areas of study to pursue this highly interdisciplinary research topic, and presented their results to the international crystal growth community.\n\nFundamentally, two competing physical principles control crystallization -- an \"enthalpic\" driving force that pushes molecules to stick to surfaces and each other, and an \"entropic\" driving force that resists this tendency.  In comparison to small molecules and atoms, entropy plays a much larger role in the properties of protein macromolecules.  This is not just because proteins are comparatively larger, but also because protein molecules carry a larger number of water molecules with them.  We hypothesized that the entropy of the water is particularly important in the nucleation of protein crystals on porous surfaces, especially when the size of the pores is approximately that of the protein.  In short, we hypothesized that porosity creates a water reservoir under the protein that alleviates the entropic penalty when proteins crystallize.  We believed this might be the reason underlying observations of facile protein crystal growh on certain nanoporous surfaes.\n\nThis hypothesis was testable using carefully designed first-of-its kind measurements of the rate of crystal formation versus temperature and other experimental parameters (e.g., protein concentration).  These measurements showed that any change in the entropic contribution to the nucleation of protein crystals when using porous substrates is actually quite small.  Rather, nucleation is enhanced simply because the surface area of the substrates are large.  While this observation refuted our hypothesis, it also directs new avenues of investigation in this area to concentrate on the chemical interactions between proteins and surfaces.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonah D Erlebacher"
