 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oona Stern (0739319)\r\nIce Fractures: A study of ice shelves and ice sheets\r\n\r\n\"Ice Fractures: A Study of Ice Shelves and Ice Sheets\" is a conceptual project designed by artist, Oona Stern which involves studying the visual characteristics of ice shelves and sheets around Palmer Station, specifically observing changes in these characteristics as the ice responds to climatic alterations. Ms. Stern's work involves the exploration of structure, form and function. The artist's aim is to understand the physical properties of the ice structures, through independent research and interviews with researchers. The project will result in several public and private artistic installations, which will communicate the conditions and structure of Antarctic ice. The research will be translated into larger drawings and sculptural pieces that will comprise gallery installations. A large scale, semi-permanent public installation is also planned for a public outdoor space. The installations will address and communicate issues of climate change that are occurring not only because of high level environmental decisions, but on a daily basis by the choices made by individuals --- all adding up to current environmental conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting work will be seen and discussed widely in public venues in NYC and abroad. Based on the artists past successes this project will serve to inspire further learning about Antarctic research and more broadly, the continent, and effects of climate change in the Antarctic Peninsula region.\r\n",
