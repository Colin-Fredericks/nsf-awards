 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daniel Neuhauser of UCLA is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work to develop a theoretical methodology to understand molecular nanopolaritonics.  The project is intended to unify the treatment of radiation and matter in such a way as to efficiently and accurately describe systems of arbitrary physical geometry and electronic structure. Prior to this reseach, combined plasmon-matter studies typically utilized multipole mode expansions on the plasmon-carrying structure, which although simple, are unable to accurately capture arbitrary geometries or field singularities. Using TDDFT for the whole system, on the other hand, is prohibitively expensive computationally.  The PI is, thus, extending previous simulations, both in terms of method used and applications chosen for testing those methods.  The research starts with FDTD-type algorithms (to be modified for near-field applications), and continues on to discrete-dipole studies, and finally implements embedding formalisms using Hydrodynamic Tensor DFT. The molecular part is being described by a real-time TDDFT algorithm, and treated non-linearly as to capture the multiharmonic and frequency mixing characteristics of the system.\r\n\r\nThe drive towards ever smaller scales for radiation features has led to the new field of plasmonics in which light transport along metal nanoparticle arrays and waveguides is studied at distances as small as a few nanometers (nm). At the same time, electronic structure calculations have also reached the nm size scale, so that the distinction between radiation and matter scale is being blurred out. This has led to a variety of studies where dipolar emission coupling of a few plasmons and excitons are considered, with interesting resonance, field- and spatial-dependence and more. Matter-radiation on the nanoscale (nanopolaritonics in short) is now ripe for a realistic description of both near-field radiation and molecules. The PI and his group are merging Maxwell's near-field description with modern studies of electronic dynamics, to simulate combined matter-radiation (plasmon-exciton, i.e., polariton) systems on the nanoscale. Some applications being considered are: gating of radiation transfer, specifically in large scale plasmonic systems with birefringence effects, including questions about whether molecules can control these systems, an application with possible use in imaging; nonlinear selective microscopy on the nanoscale -- a field with potentially huge impact for sensing applications from engineering to medicine; conversion of electromagnetic near-field energy to physical motion on the nanoscale, which will have practical importance in any field requiring motion control; photovoltaics where plasmons are hoped to reduce absorber sizes; matching of near and far fields, which could conceivably be affected by molecular motion; and the development of plasmon logic circuits .",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMolecular Nanopolaritonics\n\nTraditionally, scientists studied molecular scale phoenmena on scales of the size of atoms, molecules and clusters, at sizes of up to about 1nm, while electromagnetic phenomena were studied, for visible light at sizes of a few hundred nanometers, the associated wavelength.  However, there have been a steady developments in both theory and experiments which blur the size distinction.  Computational improvements increased the scale of electronic structure theory to ever larger systems so systems with up to thousands of molecules are now studied; at the same time, there is a trend towards a top down miniaturization of optical devices, which are now as small as ten nanometers and shrinking, reaching subnanometer lengths for tips.  An important type of nano-scale radiation involves tips, where radiation is focused and then interacts with molecules.  As Maxwell\u00c6s equations predict singularities near sharp features, the field strengths achieved are extremely large, leading to the well-researched phenomena of SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering) and to NSOM (near-field scanning optical microscopy).  The traditional division,therefore, between the sub-nano meters where molecules exist and the micron-size features of radiation is being blurred out.\n\nThe NSF grant proposed a new type of interactions motivated by the scale blurring: the influence of very few molecules on the propagation of light in the nanoscale.  The proposal concentrated on several questions:\n\nHow can molecules be used to influence radiation features on the nanoscale?\n\nCan molecules be used to gate radiation transfer along metal nanoparticle arrays? \nCan a multistage system be envisioned, where far field light is absorbed, transferred to molecular excitation and transferred back to near-field radiation?\nCan radiation be channeled efficiently from a molecule to a plasmon-carrying object such as fiber or metal\nnanoparticles?\nFinally, what molecular methodology can be envisioned which can handle both the sub-angstrom scale for the changes of the molecular density, and at the same time will handle light efficiently.\n\n\nA series of papers funded by these grant has led to breakthroughs in the understanding of these questions. \n\nFirst, several of our papers have shown that even single molecules can influence the transport of light between metal structures.  This unexpected result emerges because the coupling between different metal structures is a weak process which can be influenced by the fairly weak interaction between molecules and light.  This result opens the way to controlling the motion of light on the nanoscale by gating molecules. \n\nThe first hints that this is possible were achieved by model systems so a large portion of the grant was devoted to developing methods for simulating molecules realistically in large regions.  Methods were developed to implement a molecule within a Maxwell equation solver.   For larger systems, two new methods for describing molecules and light were developed.  One was to describe the full molecular density in terms of a fluid-like density, while keeping all the non-local response features which are expected from an electronic system.  The resulting algorithm is the first that can treat the dynamical response of very large systems, since the set of molecular orbitals is replaced by a single orbital. \n\n Additionally, we were able to overcome the issue of mismatch of time scales. \nMolecular processes take place over about 1fsec time scale, while light\nmoves much faster on the angstrom scale.  This creates a mismatch in time\ndescriptions.  We overcame this by reformulating a new approximation to the Maxwell equations, called NF (near-field) which is accurate for systems below 50nm.  This description puts light and molecules on the same footing, opening the way to embedding (i.e., describing a small region in detail with the rest of the system in cruder approximation), as pursued in our next grant.\n\nFinally, th..."
