 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) was established in 1990 as a non-governmental international membership organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation in Arctic research. Today IASC has 18 member countries, including the United States.  This award provides support for the Principal Investigator to represent the U.S. Arctic science community in IASC.  The Polar Research Board, under the U.S. National Academies, functions as the oversight committee for U.S. representation in IASC.  The U.S. National Academies appointed Dr. Grebmeier as the U.S. Delegate to IASC in March 2006.  As a Delegate, Dr. Grebmeier will convey the goals of the U.S. science community in international science planning efforts. It is vital to have representation in IASC at this critical time. The organization is responding to an external review that called for heightened transparency, greater visibility, inclusion of early career scientists, and enhanced interaction with international governmental bodies such as the Arctic Council.",

IASC is an international scientific organization composed of 19 member countries and was established to encourage, facilitate and promote leading-edge multi-disciplinary research to foster a greater scientific understanding of the arctic region and its role in the Earth system. The NSF award supported PI Grebmeier&rsquo;s efforts as the US delegate to IASC and covered her travel costs and participation in IASC Council meetings held annually during Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) to provide a forum for many international planning groups. She was also appointed to the IASC Executive Committee (Ex Com) and attended meetings held three times per year during her service. The IASC Ex Com is considered a &ldquo;board of directors&rdquo; of IASC and makes decisions on behalf of the IASC Council between annual meetings. IASC Ex Com meetings are normally held in the IASC Secretariat office that is supported by Germany, although periodic meeting were also hosted in other IASC countries, such as Korea, Denmark, USA and Canada over the last three years.
