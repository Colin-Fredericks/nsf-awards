 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experts predict that 50% of personnel training in the coming decade will be delivered via multimedia-based instructional systems. Multimedia case studies have been hypothesized to help develop critical skills that employers expect graduates to have in order to become good applied problem solvers, effective decision makers, proficient technical analysts and collaborative team players in real-world situations. The LITEE group, an NSF-sponsored project, has pioneered efforts in designing quality multimedia case studies for use in engineering classes. Success with these efforts was further enhanced through an NSF grant the PI received in Summer 2003 to adapt and implement LITEE multimedia case studies in information technology (IT) classrooms. In the past seven years, this collaborative effort has concentrated on adopting multimedia technology for use in IT classrooms and diffusing the technology among partnering universities and across various disciplines, a trend that is evidenced by the growing use of multimedia case studies in the classrooms. Notwithstanding this growth, assessment research on the impact of multimedia case studies is rare and knowledge on best practices for implementing the technology and students? learning outcomes are still lacking. The proposed three-year research and education plan aims to identify and validate a battery of measures to analyze how the teaching and learning of real-world technical issues through the use of multimedia case studies can enhance learning outcomes. The planned research will be an integral part of a doctoral dissertation that will be co-chaired by the PIs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Combining the multidisciplinary team of two PIs who are extensively published in STEM multimedia technologies, as well as a Senior Investigator who is a cognitive and behavioral scientist/expert, a key intellectual merit of this project is to standardize a battery of assessment instruments to evaluate the impact of instructors? teaching and students? higher order cognitive skills with use of multimedia case studies. More specifically, these assessment tools will examine whether students acquire an adequate portfolio of skills that include an improved ability to identify, integrate, evaluate, and inter-relate concepts within the multimedia case study and execute the appropriate decision(s) in a given problem-solving context. The assessment matrices will also be used to measure the benefits to instructors and designers using it as a form of training in academic institutions, industries, and government organizations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: In addition to the lead institution, Southern University (SUBR), three other partnering universities will serve as the primary test-beds on this project. A total of 2300 undergraduate engineering and IT students will be impacted by the project. The PIs plan to implement faculty development programs to train over 100 multidisciplinary faculty members from the partnering university and conference workshops. In collaboration with the LITEE group, the matrices will be further disseminated at engineering classrooms in 20 different institutions where LITEE materials will be implemented. Furthermore, the PIs? strong affiliation with Multimedia Educational Resources for Learning and Online Teaching, (MERLOT) an NSF funded project, will provide a platform for even more dissemination opportunities across multiple discipline communities of the organization. Also, the MERLOT online repository hosts a multitude of high quality peer-reviewed cases studies in the Science Mathematics Engineering and Technology (SMET) disciplines, it is expected that the results from this research will promote the integration of these resources in support of SMET education. Finally, the project?s findings and best practices will be disseminated through a Ph.D. dissertation in the department of science/mathematics education at SUBR and a master thesis in the SUBR College of Education.\r\n",
