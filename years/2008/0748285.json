In this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to develop microenvironment pH controllers.  pH controllers are composed of a biomineral core-polymer shell, resulting from biomineralization within a nano/submicron polymeric sphere. In light of the fact that biomineral dissolution is sensitive to and can regulate its local environmental change (i.e. pH), biominerals are ideal candidates for pH controllers. Both biomineral core and polymer shell can be precisely tuned to possess differential responses to pH. Nano/submicron dimensions allow the controllers to transport across cellular and tissue barriers. The tunable surface chemistry of polymer shell can direct controllers to cells or tissues of interest. Initially, the PI will design controllers to regulate the endocytosis pathway, which is a vital process for maintaining both cellular and organismal functions. The immediate application of these controllers is to guide toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immunity through regulating the endocytosis pathway.\r\n\r\nThe PI's educational goals are to enhance students' flexibility and communication skills required in an interdisciplinary environment, and to attract and retain students in the chemical engineering program. These goals will be achieved through developing Biology for Engineers as a required course and Biomolecular Engineering and Design as an elective to substitute for the ABET design requirements, integrating biological problems into traditional chemical engineering classes, as well as promoting diversity through summer outreach research programs.",
