 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (NCLSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program at North Carolina State University is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation and the alliance research and educational institutions to facilitate increased cross-disciplinary exchange for 12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)post-baccalaurate students from underrepresented minority populations.   \r\n\r\nIntegrating research and education, students will engage in cutting edge research experiences over a two-year period. The program provides financial and cost of education support for two years of study leading to the STEM doctoral degree.\r\n\r\nProgram activities provide student graduate opportunities and linkages to the North Carolina OPT-ED Alliance for Graduate Education in the Professoriate and other graduate associations as well as the commitment of support for graduate education through the STEM doctoral degree.\r\n\r\nA total of 12 students from underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will participate in the program at North Carolina State University during the 2008-2010 academic years.  Results from this support will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and abroad.  Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of literature in the recruitment, retention and graduation rates of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields. \r\n",
