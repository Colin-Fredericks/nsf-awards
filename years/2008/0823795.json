 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: We propose an innovative approach to develop high-power single-mode yellow-orange laser. Our objective is to develop a compact low-cost sodium guidestar laser at 589.159 nm (Sodium D2 line) with over 10 W power and narrow linewidth (10-100 MHz) using intra-cavity frequency-doubling of high power vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL). By intra-cavity wavelength tuning, we will demonstrate multi-Watt single-frequency lasers in the 570-590 nm, desirable for numerous applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This is the first attempt to tens of Watts of frequency-doubled single-longitudinal-mode visible VECSEL. To achieve our goal we propose to; (1) combine the area power scaling in multi-chip 1170-1180 nm VECSEL configuration; (2) with efficient intra-cavity frequency doubling for yellow generation, and (3) longitudinal mode selection and stabilization, by an intracavity Lyot filter, cavity length control and self-injection locking. The VECSEL design optimization, power scaling, and nonlinear effects of self-injection locking will be investigated. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impact of this proposal is significant. First, it will greatly impact the field of high-power single-mode semiconductor lasers. It will provide a novel approach for the development of high-power lasers in hard-reaching wavelength bands. The laser will provide a key tool for a range of applications in various fields. Second, this research covers multiple disciplines in science and engineering including materials, nonlinear optics, semiconductor physics and photonics, providing a unique training opportunity for our graduate and undergraduate students. Finally, the results of the proposed research will be shared with researcher, engineers and educators through technical publications and presentations.\r\n",
