 "awd_abstract_narration": "Programming languages play a critical role in computer science by providing a flexible and robust interface through which human beings control computer systems. In the past ten years, programming language design and implementation has advanced significantly in response to the pervasiveness of computer science and technology. This award will fund a new workshop that will bring together programming language experts from research, educational, and industrial institutions to discuss the role of programming language design, implementation, and application in modern, undergraduate computer science education.  The participants will critically evaluate the state of programming language education and identify the transformational changes needed to best prepare undergraduates in the US educational system to compete in, to contribute to, and to advance the rapidly changing field of computer science and technology. The workshop will produce a report to disseminate the resulting ideas to the broader community to spark continued efforts to have  programming language curriculum keep pace with  higher-education curricula Cutting-edge curricula are essential to prepare a U.S. workforce that is globally competitive, able to generate and to apply new knowledge, and to take the lead in advancing computer science and technology.",
