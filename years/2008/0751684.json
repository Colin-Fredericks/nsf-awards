 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU site at the University of South Alabama is an interdisciplinary undergraduate research program designed for students who wish to explore in depth specific areas of protein biochemistry. Every summer, eight students are invited to participate in a ten-week long research intensive experience under the direction of experienced faculty members.  All participants are housed on campus and receive a weekly stipend as well as limited funds to travel to the institution.  Although students are recruited nationally, undergraduates from the Southeastern states and particularly from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) are especially encouraged to apply. Participants work on a project of their choice with their chosen mentor from the departments of Biochemistry, Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology. Participants take a brief course in which they discuss basic aspects of protein biochemistry as well as techniques they will apply during their research experience. Every week, students participate in discussions and presentations by invited speakers on \"Ethical aspects of Research and Research Integrity\" and attend presentations by all mentors in the REU program. At the end of the program, participants give an oral presentation of their results and write a scientific report summarizing their work which is published in a book and posted on-line.  More information is available at http://www.southalabama.edu/alliedhealth/biomedical/ucur/index.htm, or by contacting Dr. Julio Turrens (jturrens@usouthal.edu).\r\n\r\n",
