 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graph-Based Learning for Speech Processing\r\n\r\nOver the past decades much research has been invested in automatic speech\r\nprocessing, and current speech processing systems often achieve remarkably \r\nlow error rates. However, systems are still dependent on matched training and \r\ntest corpora, and their performance deteriorates rapidly when faced with\r\ntest conditions that differ from the training data. In the machine learning \r\ncommunity, many novel algorithms have recently been proposed to better \r\nincorporate information from unlabeled test data into the learning and \r\nclassification process. Most of these techniques scale poorly to large tasks \r\nand thus seem unsuitable for speech processing. This project investigates\r\nthe applicability of one recently developed paradigm, graph-based\r\nlearning (GBL), for automatic speech recognition. In particular, it \r\nuses GBL as an adaptation framework where acoustic classifiers are \r\nconstrained to yield outputs that vary smoothly along underlying data\r\nmanifolds characterizing the test data. The project addresses the \r\ncore problems of poor scalability and computational complexity of GBL \r\nby using data clustering and subselection techniques as well as \r\nsparse matrix computation. Various ways of incorporating domain \r\ninformation (e.g. temporal or higher-level prosodic information)  \r\ninto graph construction are evaluated, including the use of multiple, \r\ncombined similarity measures for graph construction. Finally, online,\r\nincremental GBL techniques are being investigated in order to \r\nfacilitate real-time processing. The outcome of this project is \r\nexpected to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of \r\nspeech processing systems. Furthermore, it will contribute to improving \r\nthe scalability of semi-supervised learning algorithms in general and\r\nthus facilitate their application to related pattern recognition fields.\r\n",
