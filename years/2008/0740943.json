 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to develop a system for the freezing of cells that obviates the need for post-thaw culture and expansion of the cells.  If successful, the technology would be of significant value to scientists involved in any aspect of biological inquiry that relies on tissue culture, including high-throughput assays.  \r\n\r\nCurrent methods for the use of frozen cells require that the cells be expanded after removal from the freezer.  This is not only time-consuming, but cell viability can vary and thus influence the amount of time that it takes to grow the needed number of cells for the experiment.  The proposed methodology, based on the use of paramagnetic loaded biocompatible beads, would allow cells to grow on the beads and enables freezer-to-lab bench capability.  As such the technology would have a profound impact on high-throughput assays and other areas where cell culture is needed for experimentation.  \r\n",
