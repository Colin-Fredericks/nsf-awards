 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosco\r\nDMS-0807840\r\n\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues study mathematical\r\nproblems with large surfaces and small volumes that arise in\r\nphysics (e.g., highly fragmented electrical conductors, high\r\nvoltage electric discharges, electrolytic deposition,\r\ndiffusion-limited aggregation), chemistry (catalytic converters,\r\nsurface chemistry), biology (cell membranes, vascular systems),\r\nengineering (hydraulic fracturing in oil wells, thin ramified\r\nfibers, elastic thin bodies, towers and bridges in open space). \r\nIn all these problems a lower-dimensional physical body -- the\r\n\"surface\" -- intrudes and interacts with a full dimensional\r\nsurrounding body -- the \"volume.\"  The volume is small, the\r\nsurface is large, possibly fractal and with infinite area.  In\r\nthis project, the mathematics of fractal structures in space is\r\nfocused on two fundamental issues: 1) second order transmission\r\nconditions for second order operators; 2) singular homogenization\r\nwith fractal terms.  New tools of analysis are developed, like\r\nHoelder metrics and measure-valued Lagrangeans.  Finite element\r\nnumerical approximations provide the quantitative and flexible\r\nsetting required by prospective applications such as those\r\nmentioned above.  The principal investigator and his colleagues\r\ndevelop new mathematics aimed at meeting the challenges and\r\ntaking advantage of the new technologies of the time. \r\n\r\n     The mathematics developed in this project is motivated by,\r\nand oriented to, the study of applied problems of unusual type,\r\noccurring in the materials sciences and manufacturing,\r\nnanotechnology, biotechnology, and the environmental sciences. \r\nThe unusual feature of these problems consists in the presence\r\nand interaction, within the same system, of two physical\r\nphenomena, one confined in a \"small volume,\" the second unfolding\r\nitself on a \"large surface.\"  Nanotechnology can produce very\r\nfine fractal surfaces that can be assembled to form composite\r\nmaterials with enhanced internal surface effects (catalytic\r\ndevices, absorbers, surface chemistry, radiators and similar). \r\nEnvironment-driven fractal networks can support irrigation of\r\nlarge surfaces with scarce fluid volume (as in vascular and\r\nbiological systems).  Interlaced thin fibers and fractal thin\r\nstructures can tune wave propagation in space.  Despite their\r\ncomplexity, these applications hinge on an unusual volume vs.\r\nsurface relation of the kind mentioned before. The project\r\ninvolves young researchers and students -- with attention to\r\nunderrepresented minorities -- who receive a broad, flexible\r\ntraining that provides access to science and technology as well\r\nto professional activities outside academic institutions.",
