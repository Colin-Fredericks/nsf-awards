Wolfson\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is the enhancement of the research\r\ntraining environment in geometry and topology at Michigan State\r\nUniversity, building on our past success. The Geometry/Topology\r\nGroup at MSU has a long-standing commitment to excellence in\r\ngraduate and postdoctoral training: we have produced some\r\noutstanding graduate students, and we have been fortunate to have\r\nrecruited and mentored exceptional postdoctoral fellows.  Our\r\ngoal is to use increased resources to improve: (1) Recruitment at\r\nall levels --- undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral.  (2)\r\nGraduate training, especially in terms of the diversity of\r\nseminars, course offerings, and reducing the time to obtain a\r\nPh.D.  (3) The experience of postdoctoral fellows and their\r\npreparation for a tenure-track position.  (4) Undergraduate\r\nparticipation with the Geometry/Topology research group.  (5)\r\nInteraction among students and faculty at all levels.  (6) The\r\nresearch environment at all levels with a regular program of\r\nseminars and visitors.\r\n\r\nThe graduate students and postdoctoral assistants who will be\r\nmentored under this proposal will contribute to research in\r\ngeometry and topology, using a wide variety of techniques\r\nincluding gauge theory, geometric analysis, pseudoholomorphic\r\nmaps, knot invariants, surgery techniques, 3-manifold topology,\r\nand mapping class groups.  Faculty at Michigan State University\r\nas well as former students and postdoctoral assistants have taken\r\npart in important advances in these rapidly progressing areas,\r\nand it is expected that future students and postdoctoral fellows\r\nwill continue in this direction. To further stimulate research,\r\nthe MSU Geometry/Topology Group will initiate new programs and\r\nenhance existing programs for undergraduate and graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral fellows. The key to these programs is the\r\natmosphere of collaborative learning that has been fostered by\r\nthe Geometry/Topology Group.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will address the production of research\r\nmathematicians and teachers of mathematics who are interested in\r\ngeometry and topology. This proposal will support 5 new graduate\r\nstudents and 2 new postdoctoral associates as well as one postdoc\r\nand one graduate student who are being supported by our current\r\nRTG grant.  Our aim is to create an environment which encourages\r\nall involved to become better teachers, better expositors, and\r\nbetter researchers, and encourages those entering mathematics to\r\nstay in the field.\r\n",
