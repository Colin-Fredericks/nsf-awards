The mission of the EMBS of the IEEE is to advance the application of engineering sciences and technology to medicine and biology, promote the profession, and provide global leadership for the benefit of its members and humanity by disseminating knowledge, setting standards, fostering professional development, and recognizing excellence.  To support its mission, EMBS of the IEEE has been organizing annual conferences of the engineering in medicine and biology society for past 30 years.  The general theme of the IEEE EMBS 2008 Conference is \"Personalized Healthcare through Technology\" covering the broad spectrum of biomedical and clinical engineering and physics, to medical and clinical applications.  Specific themes of the Conference will include Biomedical Signal Processing, Neural Engineering; Neuromuscular Systems; Rehabilitation Engineering, and Healthcare Information Systems; Telemedicine.  Aspects of transfer from research to industry will also be a focus of the conference. It is expected that more than 2200 scientists, engineers and students will be attending this conference from all over the world.  About 100-150 papers are expected to be submitted to the Student Paper Competition.  This Competition promotes not only education within bioengineering disciplines but fosters the next generation of bioengineers by providing a unique opportunity to students to meet and network with the leading biomedical professionals and scientists in the world.  The Competition plays a crucial role in recognizing the talents of women and minorities in the field of bioengineering.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering Program and Office of International Science and Engineering.",
