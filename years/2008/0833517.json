It is implementing and testing an instructional model for 2,000 6-8th grade students in ten Washington, DC public, charter schools to increase student interest in and pursuit of careers in engineering and other STEM areas, with a focus on energy and renewable resources. Students may also apply for out-of-school learning activities, including engineering clubs, summer institutes, and career exploration. Thirty teachers and ten counselors are receiving professional development to implement the project in their schools. Research is focusing on the \"dosage\" and \"duration\" of the interventions by controlling these two variables. Students in the 6th grade at the start of the project are experiencing 3 years of participation, while the 8th graders have only one year. The activities completed by different cohorts of students also are being varied.",
