 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this career development plan is to investigate new\r\nprobabilistic methods for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)\r\nthat will improve the precision and scale of robotic mapping in ocean\r\nscience.  The proposed methodology will scale to multiple\r\nheterogeneous vehicles, allow for extended exploration over long time\r\ndurations and over multiple spatial scales, and be robust to the\r\nchallenging limitations of the underwater environment. Many land/air\r\nSLAM methods are largely inapplicable underwater because of (a) a lack\r\nof point features of unstructured seafloor, and (b) the rapid\r\nattenuation of electromagnetic, optical, and acoustic radiation in\r\ncomparison to land, air, and space.  The proposed multi-vehicle\r\nmulti-scalar SLAM navigation framework overcomes these challenges by\r\nfusing information from three disparate technologies: 1) real-time\r\nvision-based seafloor navigation, 2) inertial navigation systems, and\r\n3) acoustic modem-based communication, to create a flexible navigation\r\nframework that allows for inter-nodal ranging and data sharing among\r\nheterogeneous nodes.  By leveraging the perception and localization\r\ncapability of neighboring vehicles via a (low-bandwidth) distributed\r\nestimation framework, the proposed methodology will provide a\r\ncooperative navigation framework that will yield improved precision\r\nand scale in underwater robotic mapping for ocean science.\r\n",
