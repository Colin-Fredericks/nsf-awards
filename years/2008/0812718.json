 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide financial assistance for undergraduate and graduate students to participate and present technical papers at the 2008 American Control Conference (ACC 2008) in Seattle. The American Control Conference, sponsored by the American Automatic Control Council, is one of the most prestigious control conferences in the world with an expected level of participation of over 2000 scientists, students, and practicing engineers. The conference will focus on theoretical issues, engineering methodologies, and industrial applications in all areas of control research and development. The project funding will enable US students to participate in a high quality, peer-reviewed technical conference that is attended by many of the research leaders in the systems and control area. With over 1000 research presentations, numerous technical workshops, plenary lectures, group panel discussions by leaders on numerous special issues of importance, and industry exhibits, ACC 2008 will expose the students to the state-of-the-art and emerging areas of research and technology in systems and control area. The conference provides a unique opportunity for students to present their work to their peers and renowned researches. The conference provides special activities for students seeking to expand educational opportunities and for those nearing graduation to seek employment in industry, academia, and government labs. Since the control systems field is interdisciplinary, student participants will have a unique opportunity to interact with their peers from other fields of engineering and from pure sciences. The rich experience from such interactions will benefit their career and development. The conference is sponsored by American Automatic Control Council which in turn is composed of eight member societies, AIAA, AIChE, AISE, ASCE, ASME, IEEE, ISA, and SCS. Students from engineering, mathematics and other pure sciences are eligible for funding from this project.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts resulting from the Proposed Activity: \r\nThe conference will help train the next generation of control researchers and practitioners. Control systems are ubiquitous; they can be found in such diverse areas as automated manufacturing systems, automobiles, airplanes, refineries, power plants, electrical power grid, Internet, communication, and chemical processes. Modern engineering systems are becoming increasingly complex in this information rich world. Advances in sensing and control technology are making it possible to manage and control modern complex engineering systems. Control technology is a critical area for the US industry, the future technological edge and security of the United States depends on keeping a pool of trained scientists and engineers. The students funded under this project will be future leaders of control technology. Travel support for student participants, in the form of ACC 2008 Student Travel\r\nGrants, will be advertised nationally. Women, minorities, and disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply.",
