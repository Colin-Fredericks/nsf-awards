It will cover emerging research themes relavant to the micro and nano systems interests of the ECCS division, including self-assembly from nano- to milli-scales, integrated biosystems, and nanofiber technology.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nThe scope of coverage includes tutorial and discussion sessions, and will involve a range of participants from industrial representatives to academic researchers and students.  It is expected to provide a rich educational environment.\r\n\r\n",
