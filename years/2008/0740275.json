 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the problem of singularity (jamming) by a developing a new design of the dexterous machining head. The result will be an innovative, dexterous machining head for milling and drilling applications. Presently, almost all machining heads have singularities, or jamming points, in their work envelopes causing considerable down time in every cycle of operation. This results in lost productivity in every shift. Unique kinematics and structural design of the mechanism as well as novel control algorithms will be developed. An innovative architecture makes possible a full hemispherical,singularity-free motion. A through-hole allows for a flexible shaft for transmitting torque to the cutter or drill. Based on the classic high-precision V-ways found in many machine tools, a new type of conical journal bearing has been created that has zero-backlash. This journal bearing will be used throughout the head to provide precision.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from the technology will be high flexibility, singularity-free motion in machining heads.  The results from the proposed activity include application of the new dexterous machining head to other fields of cutting or material treatment, such as plasma and water jet cutting. In addition, laser cutting and non-destructive testing using robotically directed water jets for conduction of ultrasonic beams will be greatly improved by this technology. Traditional industrial robotics such as spray finishing, sealant application, and welding, bevel cutting, and spot welding robots would benefit. \r\n",
