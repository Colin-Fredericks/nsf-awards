 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II aims to further develop and optimize an advanced oxidation technology called Ultraviolet Activated Chelation (UVAC), which utilizes low-energy ultraviolet (UV) light for the removal of mercury (Hg) from industrial wastewaters. The Phase I project achieved Hg concentrations as low as 11 ppt (which is lower than the Hg levels commonly found in rainwater) via this process. The technology has been proven in the bench- and pilot-scales, but further work is required to consistently achieve Hg concentrations below 12 ppt and to obtain the most economical commercial design. The Phase II objectives will include the optimization of design parameters such as filtration, pH, residence time, and UV light characteristics. The effect of various water chemical characteristics on Hg removal will also be studied. It is anticipated that Phase II efforts will result in a robust and economical commercial system employing the UVAC technology for industries to comply with current and pending environmental regulations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from this technology will be a process for Hg removal from water to trace levels, this technology is contributing to the protection of human health, wildlife, and the environment. Exposure to Hg, which can occur by consumption of contaminated fish, can affect cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills. Additionally some researchers have proposed a link between Hg and autism. A commercially viable solution for Hg removal from water to levels below 12 ppt is lacking. Development of the UVAC technology for the chlor-alkali industry may lead to the commercialization of the technology for other industries, such as coal-fired power plants and dental offices, among others. Further understanding of the UVAC process will enhance the scientific community's knowledge about Hg in the environment, particularly in relation to UV light.",
