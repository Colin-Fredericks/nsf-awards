 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators and their colleagues propose to organize an\r\nInternational Conference on Modeling and Simulation, which will be\r\nheld from July 9-12, 2008 in Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi\r\nProvince, China. In the last two decades, the rapid development of\r\ncomputer power and sophisticated computational methodology has\r\npermitted the application of high performance computing to simulation\r\nand modeling of unprecedented accuracy and scope applied to a wide\r\nrange of important problems.  These applications have had profound\r\nimplications and applications in mathematics, science, engineering and\r\nindustry. Scientific computing is in fact the only feasible tool for\r\nanalyzing many different types of critical important phenomena such as\r\nflow and transport, weather prediction, wave propagation, novel\r\nmaterial design, computational chemistry, genome sequencing and\r\nanalysis.  The proposed conference will bring prominent researchers\r\nfrom U.S. and Europe working in these active areas to Asia, as to\r\nenhance and facilitate contacts and dialogs between specialists of\r\ndifferent fields dealing with modeling and simulation so that new\r\nconcepts can be discovered and new methodologies can express their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn the past quarter of a century, along with rapid economical\r\ndevelopments and advancements in the Far East Asian countries,\r\nparticularly the phenomenal growth in China, there has been ever\r\nincreasing collaborations between U.S.- and Asia-based (also between\r\nEurope- and Asia-based) researchers in all fields of scientific\r\nresearch. Such a phenomenon and trend is clearly exemplified by what\r\nhas taken place in mathematical sciences latterly (thanks to the\r\neffort and initiatives of the NSF). These cross-continental research\r\ncollaborations have already made a large impact on many fields of\r\nscientific research, most noticeably, on the human genome sequencing\r\nproject in biological sciences and on the proof of the Poincare\r\nConjecture in mathematical sciences.  The proposed conference will be\r\na contribution to promoting, enhancing, and stimulating such\r\ncross-continental research interactions and collaborations in\r\nmathematical sciences, more specifically, in applied and computational\r\nmathematics,",
