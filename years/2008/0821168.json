 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed atom probe instrument will address and solve a wide range of fundamental and applied problems in ongoing and future research at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  The atom probe instrument is capable of revealing the location and identifying most of the atoms in a material.  The atom probe will be used to solve key problems in atomic scale structure and chemistry for ~15-25 research groups in Materials, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Geology.  It will be used to analyze the three-dimensional structure and composition of materials for light emission and electronic devices, materials systems for advanced propulsion, energy generation, including gas turbines and nuclear reactors, and hypersonic flight.  Dedicated space will be provided for the atom probe in UCSB?s Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility.  The atom probe is an ideal tool for introducing future scientists to the wonders of the atomic scale structure of nature.  We will offer a new course in our characterization course sequence.  We will host a teachers and undergraduate students to work with atom probe techniques.  We will take advantage of the new visualization capabilities of the UCSB Allosphere, which is a sphere, spanning three stories, which provides a fully immersive visual and audio environment. and is an integral component of UCSB?s California Nano Systems Institute.\r\n\r\nThe proposed atom probe instrument will address and solve a wide range of fundamental and applied materials problems in ongoing and future research at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).  It will allow researchers at UCSB to perform three-dimensional, atomic resolution, compositional imaging and analysis with a local electron atom probe (LEAP).  The LEAP will have laser pulsing capabilities for the analysis of low electrical conductivity materials including semiconductors, ceramics and geological materials.  The atom probe will be used to solve key problems in atomic scale structure and chemistry for ~15-25 research groups in Materials, ECE, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Geology and other departments at UCSB.  In the area of electronic materials, the atom probe instrument will be used to solve key problems in interfacial chemistry and abruptness, alloy composition and homogeneity, and dopant and impurity distributions in wide bandgap semiconductors for light emission and electron devices, epitaxial materials for spintronics and materials for novel CMOS devices.  In the area of nuclear materials, atom probe tomography will be used extensively to the study of nanoscale precipitates in nuclear steels.  The structural materials group will benefit from a LEAP system for their work on high temperature materials systems for advanced propulsion, energy generation, including gas turbines and nuclear reactors, and hypersonic flight.  Dedicated space will be provided for the atom probe in UCSB?s Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility.  The atom probe is an ideal tool for introducing future scientists to the wonders of the atomic scale structure of nature.  We will offer a new course in our characterization course sequence.  We will host a secondary school teacher and an undergraduate student to work on atom probe techniques.  We will take advantage of the new visualization capabilities of the UCSB Allosphere, which is an integral component of UCSB?s California Nano Systems Institute.",
