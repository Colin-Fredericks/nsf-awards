 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Edward A. Martinez from New Mexico Highlands University will acquire an FS 3100 Automated Chemistry Analyzer (FS3100) with accessories, and a field Hydrolab Water Quality Sonde, (WQS) to conduct water quality research and training activities at New Mexico Highlands University, Luna Community College and Dine College. The FS 3100 will be used to analyze various nutrients such as ammonia, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphorous in surface waters, waste water, plant extracts, organic matter and soil lechate. The WQS will be used to monitor real time concentrations of dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and temperature in a field setting.  Five faculty members from the Forestry, Geology, Engineering, and Environmental Science disciplines, from three different institutions, will utilize the instrumentation in current and future research projects. \r\n\r\nThese two instruments allow analysis of water in rivers, streams, lakes, home and industrial wells as well as in municipal water treatment plants that provide drinking water. This type of analysis is important for large populations to maintain good health and for monitoring the environment, and also for teaching and student training.",
