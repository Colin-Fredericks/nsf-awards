The agenda of the workshop includes plenary speakers from academia and industry to discuss stat-of-the-art in research areas on the fringe of micro/nanosystems.  There will be 27 contributed papers and approximately 60 contributed posters.  The whole workshop is in a single session format.  The Hilton Head workshop is very selective, and with travel student presenters, advisors of the students are much more likely to send their students.  It is especially useful for the young faculty to get financial support for travel to this conference.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The knowledge gained and experiences shared from the workshop are planned to be captured electronically and broadly disseminated via website.  It will benefit the students and the young faculty to make the presentation and /or present posters.  They will get feedback from the attendees which will be very fruitful for their continuing research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
