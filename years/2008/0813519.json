 "awd_abstract_narration": "SciGirls, produced by Twin Cities Public Television, is a new PBS 13-part half-hour television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to girls ages 8 - 13-year olds.  The intended impacts are to 1) to foster a greater interest in STEM among girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, with girls from diverse communities the highest priority; 2) connect girls to existing, quality STEM education opportunities in their communities; and 3) contribute to the growing body of research to deepen understanding of the most effective ways to engage girls in STEM activities and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.  The project?s two strategic partners are the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) in Seattle, and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.  The NGCP will link SciGirls TV with its network of 500 community-based science programs for girls, and The Franklin Institute will help form an affiliate network of science museums to implement SciGirls TV outreach activities.  In addition to the broadcasts on PBS Plus, the videos will be distributed via online streaming and DVD?s, as well as via versions that can be downloaded to portable video players.  The most significant web component will be a social networking feature that will allow girls interested in science to connect with others across the nation.  Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the first rough cuts, and a subsequent summative evaluation of the completed programs and of the social networking web site.",
