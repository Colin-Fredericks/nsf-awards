In these studies, the\r\nlength scale of the heterogeneity is generally much smaller than\r\nthe size of the material.  The particular problems considered\r\nhere are the transport of solute and heat in porous media and the\r\nunderstanding of the flow within poroelastic materials due to\r\ntime dependent applied loads.  The particular mathematical\r\ntechniques to be used include asymptotic and homogenization\r\nmethods, numerical simulations and modeling. \r\n\r\n     The problems studied here are motivated by applications of\r\nscientific and technological interest.  Examples where solute\r\ntransport in porous media plays an important role, and thus the\r\nresults of this project have an impact, include: the transport of\r\ncontaminants in soils, the transport of nutrients in bones, the\r\nintrusion of salt in fresh water in soils near ocean coasts,\r\nmovement of minerals (e.g. fertilizers) in soils, recovery\r\ntechniques in oil reservoirs, etc.  Heat transport in porous\r\nmedia plays an important role in the transport of reactive\r\nsolutes in rocks and soils (the reactions produce heat and the\r\ntransport of that heat is coupled with the fate of the solutes,\r\nnuclear waste is included here), solar receivers, building\r\nthermal insulation materials, fuel cells and drying technology. \r\nAdditionally, while flow within poroelastic materials occurs in\r\nmany systems such as soils and rocks, a main motivation of the\r\nproject is the transport of nutrients in bones and the stresses\r\ngenerated by the flow within bone, which are believed to play a\r\nrole in the remodeling of the bone (i.e. change of bone shape and\r\nsize due to gain and loss of bone mass in different regions of\r\nthe bone). \r\n",
