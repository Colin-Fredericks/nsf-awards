Internal gravity waves affect acoustic transmission, sediment transport and off-shore platforms. These waves are also a major driving mechanism for the general circulation of the ocean. The goal of this research is to use laboratory experiments and numerical simulations is to better understand the fundamental fluid dynamics underlying the generation, interaction and breaking of internal gravity waves. The experiments will be conducted in a stratified and rotating fluid using Particle Image Velocimetry, a conductivity probe, and fluorescent dye visualization. Pseudo-spectral numerical experiments will complement the laboratory experiments. Specifically, the PIs will study harmonic wave generation by internal gravity wave-wave interactions, internal wave generation and mixing over a sloping boundary, and latitudinal dependence of the parametric subharmonic instability. Detailed spatiotemporal data will be obtained in regimes where appropriate theoretical models do not exist and field observations provide sparse data. Systematic variation of parameters in the experiments and simulations will help reveal the underlying physics. Experiments on nonresonant wave-wave interactions will improve the current picture of energy exchange between waves. Experiments on internal wave generation will quantify a new mechanism that can produce strong boundary flow and turbulent mixing in lakes and continental margins. Experiments on the parametric subharmonic instability will help to understand the global internal gravity wave dissipation in oceans. Understanding of the fundamental physics revealed by this research will enhance the ability to quantify the role of internal gravity waves in lake, oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. Besides the environmental applications, experiments on nonresonant wave-wave interactions may also have impact on the understanding of waves in strongly magnetized plasmas, where there exist waves (e.g., in tokamaks) with the same dispersion relation as internal gravity waves. Further, this type of wave plays an important role in the dynamics of White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars.",

Further, a simple hand-waving argument (not mathematically rigorous) provided a prediction in accord with the observations.  It is still not understood why the results obtained in the present laboratory observations and computer calculations differed so much from the predictions of theory.  More research is needed to address this problem.\n\n  Another part of this research project examined tidal flow over a laboratory model of a mountain peak: a mountain that had the same smooth bell (\"Gaussian\") shape in any direction when viewed from the mountaintop.  Both laboratory experiments and computer calculations for Newton\u00c6s laws applied to a fluid yielded internal ocean waves that were produced by the tidal flow.

Ocean data obtained in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, conducted for a decade (1990s) by thirty nations, were analyzed to determine how rapidly the density changes with depth at more than 18000 locations in the deep oceans.  It was discovered that at many locations in the deep oceans the variation of the density of the ocean water on depth becomes so weak that the internal type waves cannot travel, they just ..."
