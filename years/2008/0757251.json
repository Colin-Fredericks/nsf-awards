 "awd_abstract_narration": "1. Intellectual merit\r\nVarious issues in quantum information theory will be addressed using a consistent formulation of probabilities in the quantum domain, one not limited to macroscopic events or measurements. One class of problems involves various features of how information can be transferred between spatially separated quantum systems using the resources of entangled states, local quantum operations, and various types of communication channel. These include things like dense coding, unitary operations, and distinguishing different quantum states. A second class of problems involves the construction of quantum error correcting codes for the reliable transmission and storage of quantum information, and a better understanding of the fundamental principles underlying such codes. A third class, not unrelated to the preceding two, involves the fundamental nature of quantum information: in what respects it is different from and in what respects it uses the same principles as ordinary\r\n(Shannon)information theory, and whether such understanding can be useful for\r\nquantitative estimates of the location of quantum information. In addition to the standard methods of probability theory and quantum mechanics, computer simulations will be used to study model systems.\r\n2. Broader impacts\r\nThe research effort will contribute to the education program at Carnegie-Mellon\r\nUniversity at both the undergraduate and graduate levels through providing research projects for students, including those working towards a PhD. Postdoctoral research associates will have an opportunity to sharpen their skills while participating in this research group, making them more valuable members of the scientific community. Students and postdocs will take part in an ongoing seminar series in quantum information, and occasional courses which address these subjects, both of which attract other scientists and science students living in Pittsburgh. Improvements in teaching quantum mechanics and quantum information will eventually prove beneficial to university students outside Pittsburgh as well as those in this city.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      Physicists regard quantum mechanics as the\nfundamental theory of all processes in the physical world.\nFor most situations encountered in everyday life classical\nmechanics, the laws of Newton, provides a very good\napproximation to the more fundamental (and much more\ncomplicated) quantum laws.  In particular, classical\nmechanics works well when a quantum process known as\nDECOHERENCE is very rapid and effective.  But in situations\nwhere decoherence is nearly absent a different set of\nspecifically quantum effects can be observed. Quantum\ninformation studies how these effects, which often seem\nquite counterintuitive, can be used to transmit or to\nprocess information in new ways.\n\n    Quantum computation is one application.  Quantum\ncomputers using novel features of quantum information\nshould be able to carry out certain computational problems,\nsuch as factoring very long integers, much more rapidly\nthan conventional computers, whose capabilities are limited\nby the presence of decoherence.  The quantum computers\nwhich are currently under development have to be carefully\ndesigned so as to suppress the effects of residual\ndecoherence, and correct errors that arise from this or\npossibly some other source.  This can be done using quantum\ncodes that share information among several physical\nobjects, so that if one of the objects decoheres the\ninformation can be recovered from the others.  Our project\ninvolved studying such codes: understanding where the\nquantum information is located, how it is protected against\ndecoherence, and how to make codes more efficient. As well\nas considering specific codes we studied what general\nquantum principles limit the capabilities of all codes.\n\n    One of the ways quantum effects manifest themselves\nis in a special sort of quantum correlation between\nphysical systems at different locations known as\nENTANGLEMENT.  Entanglement can be produced in the\nlaboratory and then used to carry out certain\ninformation-processing tasks which cannot be accomplished\nusing conventional computation or communication devices,\nwhich are always strongly influenced by decoherence.\nHowever, producing entanglement is not easy, and it tends\nto disappear rapidly if even a small amount of decoherence\nis present; in this sense it is an expensive resource.  One\nof our projects was to find efficient ways to utilize\nentanglement, together with relatively cheap and robust\nclassical devices, to carry out quantum information\nprocessing tasks simultaneously at two separate locations.\nWe focused on a particular task, what specialists call a\nnonlocal unitary, but the algorithms we developed and the\ninsights we gained can be extended to a larger set of\nproblems.  In some cases we showed that our methods are\noptimal: they use the minimum amount of entanglement needed\nto get the job done.  In other cases we were able to put a\nlower bound on how much entanglement is required.\n\n    There is a widespread, and we believe quite\nmistaken, belief that quantum entanglement can give rise to\nmysterious influences which, contrary to Einstein's theory\nof relativity, travel faster than the speed of light.\nTheir existence would bring relativity theory and quantum\nmechanics, two of the best established parts of physics,\ninto conflict.  Those who believe in such influences\nacknowledge that they cannot be used to transmit (quantum\nor classical) information, and are therefore inaccessible\nto experimental test.  Our research showed that the reason\nthese influences cannot transmit information is that they\ndo not exist.  They result from an unsatisfactory\nunderstanding of quantum mechanics that arises from the\ninconsistent way in which introductory textbooks assign a\nspecial role to measurements.  When the principles of\nquantum theory have been properly formulated in a\nconsistent way, so that measurements can be seen to follow\nthe same rules governing all other physical processes, the\nmysterious influences disappear, along with the supposed\nconflict between ..."
