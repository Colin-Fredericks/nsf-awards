Such repetition is error-prone and increases the\r\ncost and time-to-market of software systems.  This research studies\r\nsyntactic abstraction, a technique to eliminate much of the repetition\r\nin such systems.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop the theory of syntactic abstractions\r\n(also called \"macros\") to put it on a par with procedural or data\r\nabstraction.  Its goal is to develop theories and tools that will make\r\nsyntactic abstraction easy.  Its results are intended to make it\r\neasier to write complex syntactic abstractions and that will allow a\r\nlanguage designer to make rational choices when designing a syntactic\r\nabstraction facility.  The main technical innovation is the inclusion\r\nof binding patterns as part of the public interface of a macro.\r\n",
