 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ordinary PCs are widely employed for large scale scientific computing today. Released\r\nin 2004, BOINC middleware is managing over 500,000 volunteered PC nodes and\r\nproviding computation power to around 30 scientific research projects including\r\nRosetta@home, Climateprediction.net, and IBM World Community Grid. The main\r\nattraction of such \"virtual clusters\" is that computing is \"free\" as minimal additional\r\nhardware and personnel resources are needed. The potential for exploiting such idle\r\ncycles is immense since well under 1% of the world's 1 billion PCs are currently\r\nparticipating.\r\nCurrently idle PCs are exploited for sequential and independent parallel tasks, but not\r\ncommunicating parallel tasks, a common HPC paradigm. The central goal of this project\r\nis to achieve robust execution of communicating parallel applications on networked\r\nordinary PCs. The challenge is that ordinary desktops are \"volatile\", i.e., their\r\navailability changes suddenly and frequently based on desktop owner's actions.\r\nCheckpointing of parallel applications, the state of the art in fault tolerant scientific\r\ncomputing, is not sufficient for high failure rate environments.\r\nThis project is developing the VolPEx framework (Parallel Execution on Volatile nodes)\r\nthat employs managed redundancy as the core mechanism to achieve seamless\r\nforward application progress in the presence of routine failures. The canonical execution\r\nmodel consists of two or more concurrent replicas of each process with failed process\r\nreplicas regenerated on-demand from healthy ones. The following communication APIs\r\nare provided for application development.\r\n1. Virtual Dataspace: An abstract API for asynchronous anonymous Put/Get\r\ncommunication among tasks. The BOINC programming model of independent tasks is\r\nbeing extended with the dataspace API to allow inter-task communication\r\n2. Volpex MPI: A subset implementation of MPI with a communication layer customized\r\nfor execution on volatile nodes.\r\nThe validation of this research will include execution of selected parallel applications on\r\n100s of nodes across campus LANs and 1000s of nodes across the globe under\r\nVolpex/BOINC.\r\nThe ability to transform ordinary PCs into a virtual cluster to run parallel codes will have\r\nwide ranging impact. Virtually all scientists will get access to HPC while the need for\r\nclusters and the cost of purchasing, operating, and maintaining clusters will diminish.",
