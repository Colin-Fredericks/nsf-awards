 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) was established in 1990 as a non-governmental international membership organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation in Arctic research. Today IASC has 18 member countries, including the United States.  This award provides support for the Principal Investigator to represent the U.S. Arctic science community in IASC.  The Polar Research Board, under the U.S. National Academies, functions as the oversight committee for U.S. representation in IASC.  The U.S. National Academies appointed Dr. Grebmeier as the U.S. Delegate to IASC in March 2006.  As a Delegate, Dr. Grebmeier will convey the goals of the U.S. science community in international science planning efforts. It is vital to have representation in IASC at this critical time. The organization is responding to an external review that called for heightened transparency, greater visibility, inclusion of early career scientists, and enhanced interaction with international governmental bodies such as the Arctic Council.",
