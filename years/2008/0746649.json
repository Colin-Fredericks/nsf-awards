 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless Internet streaming is hindered by a number of obstacles that are rooted from limited available resources on wireless devices. Existing solutions commonly demand additional infrastructure support or seek a trade-off between user perceived streaming quality and resource consumption on wireless devices.  In contrast, there are fast growing Internet resources that are not fully and well utilized.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this CAREER project is to layout scientific foundations on resource management in Internet and wireless networks. Specifically, algorithms will be designed and systems will be implemented to effectively utilize the existing abundant under-utilized or idle Internet resources to improve the streaming performance on wireless devices for both server-based and P2P-based on-demand and live streaming. For this purpose, the under-utilized Internet resources (e.g., bandwidth) and application communication patterns are being leveraged to minimize data transmission power without degrading the application's performance. Furthermore, idle peer computing resources are being utilized and novel distributed online content adaptation schemes are being designed to address multi-dimensional heterogeneity of wireless devices. In addition, the unused covert communication channel and application characteristics are being exploited to design a set of new security protection schemes to satisfy the demand of future wireless Internet streaming services.\r\n\r\nThe efficient Internet resource management techniques to be developed through this CAREER project are expected to address these critical issues in wireless Internet streaming and to enable pervasive and high-quality wireless Internet streaming accesses a reality.\r\n",
