 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kerry L. Shaw, IOS-0818862:  The genetics of female acoustic preference behavior.\t\r\n\r\nNew species may be formed by changes in the signals that precede mating.  In several well known clusters of species, divergent mating signals appear to be a primary reason why closely related species remain distinct.  This sort of evolutionary change is poorly understood.  One hypothesis is that the genes for male mating signals are the same as those for female response (or preference).  This study focuses on Laupala, a group of closely related cricket species that has diverged very rapidly.  Like most crickets, Laupala communicate acoustically, and acoustic differences contribute to mating incompatibility between species.  However, some species can be hybridized in the laboratory, enabling a genetic study of these differences.  Two closely related species that differ markedly in male song and female preference will be hybridized.  Hybrid offspring will be mated with one of these species for several generations to move preference and song genes from one species into the other.  Molecular markers will be used to produce a genome map of the location of genes underlying song and preference.  With this map, it will be possible to ascertain whether song and preference genes map to the same location and how much each gene contributes to differences between species.  The number of molecular markers on this map will subsequently be increased to facilitate the eventual cloning of genes underlying song and preference.\r\n\r\nResearch and education are integrated by training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. Kamehameha Schools students will be involved by establishing a web-based science lab analyzing the genetics of song and preference inheritance.  The P. I. will visit the school to provide context through lecture and informal interaction with students. \r\n",
