 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  \r\nAs part of an effort to integrate new technology and methods into the curriculum, the chemistry department is implementing green chemistry/environmental problem-based laboratories. The goal is to enliven instruction for students by adding to the general chemistry course environmental chemistry laboratories that teach a basic understanding of green chemistry, and by following that course with a coordinated progression of green chemistry experiences throughout the curriculum. Graduates that have completed this progression of problem-based learning laboratories are expected to be better prepared to face the difficult challenges of designing greener processes and thus creating and maintaining a cleaner environment in industry as well as in graduate school settings. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The revised curriculum begins in the freshman year with an introduction to green and environmental chemistry. Environmental chemistry applications allow students to make connections between general chemistry techniques and the real world. In the upper-level courses, experiments become more sophisticated and use the problem-based approach.  Students are responsible for developing course specific laboratories by using the newly-acquired spectrophotometers, ion chromatograph, and microwave accelerated reaction system to implement synthesis applications from the current literature. A major application of the ion chromatograph is realized in environmental chemistry where students are able to develop research projects involving the institution's watershed trail. Focusing on green chemistry is providing a springboard for the addition of an environmental chemistry concentration, which is currently under development. \r\nBroader Impacts: Impacts of the grant include incorporating innovative materials and technology across the curriculum; increasing the excitement of younger scientists (especially women) for science through use of technology; educating students well-trained in green chemistry problem-solving methods and prepared for success in advanced degrees/industry; and graduating an increased number of chemistry majors through the recruitment potential of new technology. The institution currently has 57 chemistry majors of which 60 % are women.  Beyond science and engineering, the project affects the nonscience majors through the green chemistry emphasis in the ACS Chemistry in Context class. The department also is very active in K-12 outreach, reaching 1800 students with 70 events conducted annually. Local high school students interested in environmental chemistry are using the instrumentation at the annual science day, and the equipment is used for high-level Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science high school projects. \r\n",
