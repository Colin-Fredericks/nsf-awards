 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the continued development of a new paradigm for the activation and functionalization of aromatic molecules.  The cornerstone of this project is to selectively bind an arene or polyaromatic hydrocarbon through dihapto-complexation to a transition metal, and to use this adduct as a scaffold for the assembly of new highly-functionalized polycyclic compounds.  Coordination serves to enhance the reactivity of the arene toward electrophiles, and to stabilize reactive intermediates (e.g. arenium or allyl cations).  In addition, coordination influences the stereochemistry of these chemical transformations, and protects the site of coordination so that it may be used for subsequent chemistry. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor W. Dean Harman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia.  Professor Harman's research efforts revolve around the development of new methods for the activation and functionalization of arenes.  The development of such methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.",
