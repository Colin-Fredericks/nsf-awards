 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop on Recursion\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that language is an window into the human mind, not\r\njust because our words reveal our thoughts, but because the way we put\r\nwords together reflects principles of organization that allow\r\ncreativity to flourish. Recent mathematically based research in\r\nlinguistic theory has identified computational principles that promise\r\nto provide the software behind our neurological hardware.  This\r\nworkshop will bring together linguists, biologists, psychologists,\r\nphilosophers and computer scientists who are discovering how these\r\nlinguistic principles provide the abstract basis for language learning\r\nand learning in general.  Central to this enterprise is a simple\r\nconcept, recursion, the idea of building complex structures through\r\nrepeated application of simple rules, which may provide a metaphor for\r\nthe organization of all human action.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is timely because research on complex structures in\r\nlanguage and cognition is now reaching a point where the various types\r\nof complexity can begin to be defined with sufficient precision to\r\nconsolidate results and discover the sources and limits of complex\r\nhuman cognition.  By identifying the ways in with complex structures\r\nand complex can arise from the application of simple rules, this\r\nresearch lays the foundation for new ways of designing curriculum for\r\noptimal learning, new perspectives on artificial intelligence and new\r\ninsight into the evolutionary changes that distinguish animal\r\ncognition from human cognitive abilities.\r\n",
