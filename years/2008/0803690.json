 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are entering an Industrial Revolution in the production of information.   While in the past data was \"handmade\" by typing on keyboards, today data are increasingly manufactured by machines: sensors, cameras, software logs, etc.  When harnessed in a timely manner, these data can have significant positive impact in many contexts, including early warning and rapid response in natural disasters, air quality monitoring, and improved Internet security. To provide useful information in these contexts, computers in multiple locations must coordinate over networks, because the data are both widely distributed and massive, and cannot be \"warehoused\" at a single location in a timely manner.  Worse, sensor data is typical \"noisy\" or erroneous in various ways, so statistical methods must be employed to convert the raw \"evidence\" data into probabilistically reliable information.\r\n\r\nIn this project we develop new techniques to integrate statistical inference methods from AI with overlay network algorithms developed for peer-to-peer and wireless settings. We design new overlay network algorithms customized for distributed inference.  We also develop network-aware inference algorithms that can trade off inference approximation quality for communication efficiency and robustness to network failure.  Finally, we explore the use of a high-level declarative language for programming both the networking and inference logic.  The high-level language enables us to investigate compilation techniques to co-optimize the inference and overlay network tasks for maximal utility.  We prototype and evaluate our ideas via open-source implementations deployed on testbeds like Emulab and Planetlab. Software and research papers are disseminated at http://declarativity.net.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of this project is on developing methods for analyzing data\nefficiently using multicore and large-scale computer clusters.  These\ntypes of computers have become the dominant computer architectures,\nbut programming these systems is challenging both in terms of\ndesigning distributed algorithms and dealing with parallel systems\nchallenges, such as data races, robustness, scheduling and\noptimization of communication.  Our declarative approach has the\npotential of both simplifying the design of distributed algorithms and\nof the software system that supports these algorithms, alleviating the\nneed for algorithm designers to focus on these lower level challenges.\nAs part of this effort, we started the GraphLab project for\nlarge-scale machine learning.  This effort has lead to a major\nopen-source software effort with tens of thousands of downloads.  We\nhave held two GraphLab workshops in the last couple of years.  The\nfirst one in 2012 had 318 people in attendance.  The second one in\n2013 had 570 people.\n\nWe have also developed Bloom, a programming language we have designed for cloud computing and other distributed systems.  Bloom removes traditional mismatches between distributed software and platforms, enabling powerful coding and code analysis without resorting to exotic syntax.  Bloom was recognized by MIT Technology Review magazine as one of the TR10 award winners in 2010: the 10 technologies most likely  to \"change our world\". \n\nWe also had a very successful education plan.  For example, PI Guestrin's Machine Learning Class was the most popular graduate class at CMU, with about 120 registered students.  The class has greatly benefited from class projects derived from data collected by the PI and other researchers, and by data given to the PI through industry\ncollaborators.  Guestrin's class slides have been requested by a\nnumber of other instructors worldwide, and have been incorporated into\ntheir classes.   We used Bloom as the core vehicle to teach a new\nhands-on undergraduate distributed systems course at UC Berkeley \nin 2012 and 2013 (http://programthecloud.github.io).  Class time blended traditional lectures with live authoring and analysis of Bloom code for a wide variety of tricky distributed systems protocols that would have been too complex and unwieldy to present in traditional languages.\n\nOne important aspect of this project is to support under-represented\nminority students in science.  We had undergraduates working on this\nand related projects, supported through CMU's IFYRE program, which\nhelps expose undergraduates from under-represented minorities to\nresearch.  We have also hosted a undergraduate from Caltech through a program for introducing female students to undergraduate research.\nIn this project, the PIs co-advised two PhD students, one based at\neach institution.  Both completed PhDs in the last year -- one is now\nan assistant professor at UMass Amherst, the other a member of staff\nat Facebook.  In addition, one of Guestrin's PhD students is now at\nBerkeley as a postdoc with Hellerstein and others.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph M Hellerstein"
