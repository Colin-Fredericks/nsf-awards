The central theme of this GK-12 project is ?Global Change in a Local Context,? with the Columbia River Watershed as the unifying environmental feature around which students connect science concepts from their classrooms to their own ?backyard.? Clark County is located on the southwest border of Washington State, along a 100-mile stretch of the lower Columbia River. The Columbia River Watershed, extending from the high Cascade glaciers to the estuary and river mouth, encompasses the entire county and is the defining feature of this region ? environmentally, economically and culturally. Clark County, with nearly 400,000 residents, is the fastest-growing county in Washington, and is experiencing dramatic changes in population, housing construction, land use, etc., that are directly impacting the watershed. Thus the watershed and the Global/Local theme provide a compelling and relevant context within which to explore science disciplinary content (Earth, Life and Physical Sciences) through inquiry, and in particular how change in nature is manifested in a local system and how those changes affect students as individuals and communities. \r\n\r\nThe Partners in Discovery GK-12 project is structured around year-long one-on-one partnerships between WSUV graduate student Fellows and grades 6th ? 9th   science Teachers in four Clark County school districts. Fellows and Teachers will engage students in authentic scientific inquiry focused on the nature and impacts of change in the Columbia River Watershed. The Fellow-Teacher partnerships will utilize each district?s existing curriculum and revise or augment their science ?kits? by identifying questions and inquiry activities that link instructional modules to state and national science standards, and to the complementary expertise of WSUV research faculty and graduate students working in the Watershed. The program will support 6 to 10 Fellows-teacher partnerships per year for a total of five years. \r\n",

This collaboration between the Fellow and teacher primarily occurred in the teacher\u00c6s classroom as the partners jointly developed and led these activities, and worked together to engage students in the teacher\u00c6s curriculum.  The Partners in Discovery project also provided participants with meaningful and relevant professional development led by WSUV science and education faculty, through a bi-weekly pedagogy seminar series for Fellows, two full-day and four late afternoon professional development workshops for all participants during the academic year.\n\nOur overall project goals were to:\n\nImprove graduate student Fellows\u00c6 abilities to teach science through inquiry, to use and apply research in the classroom, and to communicate science to non-scientists; also to improve Fellows\u00c6 appreciation for and commitment to K-12 outreach.\nImprove Teachers\u00c6 abilities to teach science through inquiry and to use and apply research in the classroom; also to improve Teachers\u00c6 science content knowledge.\nEnrich Clark County 6th &ndash; 9th grade students\u00c6 science education and build their enthusiasm for science.\nStrengthen scientist-teacher partnerships between WSUV and Clark County schools.\nIntegrate the GK-12 partnership model into all WSUV Science graduate programs.\n\n\nAt the end of our 5-year GK-12 project, our teacher participants reported that the Fellows\u00c6 ability to teach to middle school students improved and that the Fellows had a better understanding of how middle school students learn.
