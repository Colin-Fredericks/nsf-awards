 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry (Experimental Physical Chemistry Program) and the Office of International Science and Engineering support Prof. Mohamed El-Shall of Virginia Commonwealth University and his post-doctoral fellows in this collaborative project with colleagues at the National Research Centre in Egypt in an investigation of the chemical and physical properties of  a series of potential hydrogen storage materials.  The materials to be studied include novel zeolites, Mg-based alloys, and metal-doped carbon nanotubes.  This project is being supported by the U.S. - Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology, which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of El-Shall and his colleagues is aimed at developing better materials for safe, high-density storage of hydrogen for use in fuel-cell devices.  Besides the potential for broad societal and technological impact of research in hydrogen storage materials, this international collaboration will help to build strong ties between Egyptian and American scientists and will help to train the next generation of globally-engaged scientists.",
