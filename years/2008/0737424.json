 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is enhancing, adapting, and implementing the materials, \"Learning from NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress): Professional Development for Teachers\" (LFN) in undergraduate mathematics content and methods (MC&M) courses for preservice elementary and middle school teachers taught in universities and community colleges. The project is helping preservice teachers: 1) improve their mathematical content knowledge; 2) learn how to use effective methods to teach mathematics; 3) become aware of the purposes for, and uses of, NAEP; and 4) learn how to use NAEP to improve their teaching to support all students' achievement. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its identification of an exemplary set of resources, the repurposing of those resources for use with preservice teachers, and the resulting opportunity the project provides for novice teachers to learn first hand how to incorporate the findings of NAEP to improve their own teaching. The broader impacts of the project are found in its assemblage of a diverse set of institutions that represent the pipeline through which many preservice students in the PI's state progress on their way to certification. Moreover, these institutions serve the needs of both an urban and a largely rural population. In turn this collaboration itself holds excellent potential to serve as a model for how other institutions similarly charged with responsibility for preservice teacher education may accomplish their goals.",
