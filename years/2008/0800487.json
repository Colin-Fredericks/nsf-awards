 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the capability and application of hyperspectral imaging technology to provide accurate and quick identification and quantification of building damage. Compared to optical and multispectral sensors, hyperspectral sensors can acquire simultaneous earth images in more than 200 narrow and often contiguous spectral bands through the ultraviolet, visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. To achieve this objective, the suitability of hyperspectral images to differentiate object classes and to assess the damage severity based on observed spectral changes will be determined. Furthermore, hyperspectral bands? sensing capability will be evaluated in the presence of various forms and degrees of cloud cover.  The outcomes are expected to 1) expand the body of knowledge in using remotely sensed data for damage detection and quantification; 2) improve our understanding of the progression of wind hazards and their multi-faceted effects on built environment; 3) provide abundant high quality data much needed to calibrate and validate risk models for insurers and public agencies.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are achieved by integrating research in curricular development, enhancement of research infrastructure, increased diversity, and broad dissemination of findings and discoveries. These activities collectively will provide valuable training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and will nurture the next generation of experts in wind engineering and remote sensing. They will also contribute to the formulation of efficient and effective strategies for windstorm response, recovery and mitigation that minimize human suffering and economic losses.  \r\n",
