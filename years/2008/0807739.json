 "awd_abstract_narration": "While there has been considerable progress toward the development of a standard model for the process of star formation in the case of low mass stars, we are much further from understanding how massive stars form. Massive stars produce most of the metals in the universe, dominate the energy balance of both the interstellar and intergalactic media via their ionizing radiation, winds, and supernovae, and shape the formation of planets through their interactions with nearby protoplanetary disks. No understanding of these processes is possible without a reliable model of massive star formation. In this project, Dr. Mark Krumholz (University of California - Santa Cruz) will develop such a model, using the complementary tools of analytic investigation and high resolution simulation including gravity, radiation, and magnetohydrodynamics.\r\n\r\nAs part of this research a number of questions and problems must be addressed. At the earliest stages of massive star formation, we must understand the fragmentation process. What physical mechanisms control whether gas fragments down to sizes less than one solar mass or collapses monolithically to a massive star?  Once collapse begins, any model must describe how to overcome the two dominant barriers to accretion, angular momentum and radiation pressure.  Disks are a likely solution, since they redistribute angular momentum while at the same time their high opacity shields gas from radiation. A second important part of this project is to develop an understanding of massive protostellar disks.  At the end of the massive star formation process, what eventually halts accretion and clears away any remaining gas?  In addition to working on these questions, and using material related to this research, Dr. Krumholtz will also offer math and science courses to prison inmates in prisons near Santa Cruz, California, building on Dr. Krumholz's decade of experience in prison education.  Dr. Krumholtz will involve faculty, staff, and students at UC Santa Cruz in this activity, thereby facilitating interactions between the scientific community and a radically under-served, largely minority population.",
