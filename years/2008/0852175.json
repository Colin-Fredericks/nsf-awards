 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research over the past 20 years has shown that trait differences acting after copulation\r\nbut before the fusion of sperm and egg nuclei, often termed postmating, prezygotic trait\r\ndifferences, play a primary role in reducing gene exchange between populations within\r\na species and between closely related species. The genetic basis of these trait\r\ndifferences is poorly understood and thus, constitutes the primary goal of Marshall and\r\nHoward's research plan. Specifically, the proposed research focuses on identifying the\r\nseminal fluid and sperm proteins that differ, whether in abundance or structure, between\r\nclosely related ground cricket species that are isolated by postmating, prezygotic trait\r\ndifferences. Once identified, gene silencing technology will be used to evaluate the\r\nfunction of each protein and its influence on preventing or reducing fertilization between\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nBarriers to fertilization have been intensively studied in the Allonemobius socius\r\ncomplex of crickets, providing an excellent model for evaluating the genes and proteins\r\nthat underlie successful fertilization. Understanding the genetic basis of fertilization\r\nincompatibilities between populations and species can provide insight into a wide-range\r\nof topics, including the development of infertility within species (including humans) and\r\nthe role of sexual selection and sexual conflict in driving the divergence of fertilization\r\nproteins. The project provides training for undergraduate and graduate students and\r\noutreach to K-12 schools.\r\n",
