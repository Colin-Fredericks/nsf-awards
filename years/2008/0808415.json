 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cliniodes is a diverse genus of snout moths with caterpillars that specialize on shrubs with toxic chemicals.  Males have a unique sound-producing mechanism consisting of giant scales or modified hairs, apparently for courtship.  The two goals of this project are a taxonomic revision of Cliniodes species and detailed study of their morphological structures.  The researcher will assess variation in specimens across broad geographic areas, describe 10-20 species new to science, and re-describe the 20 known species from the Western Hemisphere.  Anatomy and morphology will be used in testing hypotheses of the origin of and variation in the courtship structures.\r\n\r\nMuseum collections in Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mexico and elsewhere will be visited to maximize geographic coverage.  An illustrated study that accurately defines species and their relationships and enables identification will facilitate ecological and population-level studies.  Analysis of morphology will elicit discoveries in other fields such as developmental and behavioral biology.  Products will include an on-line database of specimen data and images, which will aid conservation planning for the rare native North American species.  Two undergraduate students will receive training in identification, dissection, and imaging of moths.  Papers coauthored with the students will introduce them to scientific publication.",
