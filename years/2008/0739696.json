 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the microbial processes that alter volcanic glass, which is critical to understanding the earliest life on earth. To understand the environmental controls on these processes, this project uses the extreme environments of the McMurdo region of Antarctica as a natural laboratory. Volcanic glass substrates are placed in hydrothermal systems, lakes, and other areas for two to four years to identify colonizing microbial consortia and the chemical processes of microbe-glass interaction. Recovered experiments are analyzed to explore the role of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, and the relevance of autotrophs during colonization and biofilm formation using microscopic, molecular and culture techniques. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts include graduate and undergraduate student participation in research and K-12 outreach and teacher training. \r\n",
