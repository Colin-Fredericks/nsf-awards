 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to provide undergraduate students with interdisciplinary skills that will help them remain abreast of and understand the content and organization of rapidly growing scientific knowledge. This goal is being addressed by developing a laboratory course for sophomores majoring in any of the natural science disciplines. The course consists of four student-centered, inquiry-based modules - each of which cuts across multiple disciplines, namely, (1) protein folding, (2) biological motion, (3) physical phenomena at multiple scales, and (4) entropy.  The impact of this approach on student learning is being assessed and will be published in science education journals. An online laboratory manual is being prepared. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The effectiveness of future STEM professionals depends in part on their skill in integrating knowledge across disciplines, often in teams. This project is designing activities that provide students with broad experiences in solving complex problems in interdisciplinary settings. The laboratory course is designed as a complement to the typical series of discipline-based courses offered by traditional departments in the natural sciences and mathematics. It is also a core requirement for a new major in Integrated Science.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This course is building on integrated science courses at Princeton University and Harvey Mudd College. It is closely modeled on the Harvey Mudd design. Future collaborative work is planned to design and assess integrated science laboratory courses for students from different backgrounds and levels of scientific preparation at other colleges and universities.",
