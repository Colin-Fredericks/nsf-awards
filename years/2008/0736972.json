 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\n\r\nThis project is utilizing an historic truss bridge to improve two courses in undergraduate civil engineering education, Structural Analysis and Construction Methods. The adaptive use of the truss bridge provides a vehicle for improving student's ability to create high quality computer models of structures and to develop high quality construction plans. Through this project, students are gaining a deep understanding of the differences that occur between real and theoretical structures in both analysis and construction. The project comprises four parts: (1) development of a protocol for adaptive use of historic truss bridges for pedestrian use, (2) development of a series of construction planning, sequencing, and estimating assignments that are based on the adaptive use of an historic truss bridge, (3) development of an instrumentation plan for the bridge, and (4) development of assignments for a structural analysis course that uses the measured deflections and forces in truss members and compares them to theoretical values. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine the impact on student learning and the materials developed are being widely disseminated for adoption at other institutions.",
