 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the MagIC project have been to develop an open community digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with web portals that allow users free access to archive, search and download data in a broad range of formats.  Part of the project has involved the transition of existing databases developed under the auspices of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) to the new archive.  This award provides funds for the continued development and maintenance of the MagIC facility and for continued integration of the PI?s efforts to operate with other online databases.  Now that the MagIC database is functional and contains a critical mass of data, there is a strong desire in the rock and paleomagnetic community to expand and enhance the existing data analysis and visualization tools. \r\n\r\nThe further development of the MagIC database and website will create a Cyberinfrastructure where researchers, teachers and students can find and visualize rock and paleomagnetic data.  It will provide a tool to answer daily research questions or to find new pathways in addressing today?s grand challenges in geomagnetism, climate research, plate tectonics and geodynamics.\r\n",
