 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Satellites, Weather and Climate (SWAC) project at the University of Vermont (UVM) is an innovative, 2-year professional development program aimed at enhancing the competency of in-service Science and Mathematics teachers at K-12 levels in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines. Teachers will participate in a summer institute to develop knowledge and skills in climatology, meteorology, electrical engineering, statistical analyses, geostatistics and the geospatial technologies of remote sensing and GIS (Geographic information systems). Geospatial content will also be enhanced via distance-learning activities with NASA. Summer learning experiences will be followed by content and technology \"refresher\" sessions during the school year to facilitate long-term change in the classroom. One unique aspect of SWAC is the use of geospatial technologies to address both atmospheric and land processes, in a problem- and project-based environment that is accessible to students at all levels from K-16. SWAC team members highlight career paths in academia and the public service (weather forecasting and outreach) as a way of showcasing traditional career opportunities in the field of atmospheric sciences and climate. SWAC modules were created in response to K-12 teacher input on student learning and needs. The resulting curricula and resources will be used to increase climate education and literacy. Results of the SWAC project (including lesson plans) will be disseminated via the SWAC-KIDS website, the Vermont Geographic Alliance website and by SWAC-CDs, as well as through the online journal, PUMAS (Practical Uses of Math and Science), and regional science education meetings.",
