 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to realize the fabrication of multiscale electric devices based on conducting nanowires and their characterization by using nanomanufacturing principles such as self-assembly, dielectrophoresis, and focused ion beam nanolithography. The objectives include the following tasks:\r\n(a)\thierarchical integration of nanowires into multiscale electric devices, and\r\n(b)\tcharacterization of individual nanowires in terms of Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity.\r\nThe self-assembly technique and dielectrophoresis will be combined to control individual nanowires and attract them into desired pairs of microelectrodes. Fountain pen-based metal nanoink soldering or electron-beam metal deposition techniques will be adapted to enhance the conductivity between metal electrodes and nanowires. Focused ion beam will be used to define a nanostructure such as nanoheater/nanothermometer for aiding the characterization of individual nanowires. \r\n\r\nThe importance of the of the proposed work lies in the fact that the investigation of thermal and electric properties of nanowires will provide a fundamental database for thermoelectric devices, which in turn contributes to developing alternative energy sources. The proposed integration method will provide a practical means for nanomanufacturing massive and multiscale nanowire-based thermoelectric devices. The proposed work yields significant information on the Seebeck and Peltier coefficients of one-dimensional nanostructures. The research outcomes of nanomanufacturing and properties of nanomaterials investigated in the project will contribute to establishing a new research and education program in the recently established Mechanical and Energy Engineering Department at the University of North Texas. A systematic effort will be made to recruit minorities to this research project through the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science program. Talented undergraduate students with a high degree of financial need in this program are ensured of success as they are engaged in the various research experiences proposed herein. \r\n",
