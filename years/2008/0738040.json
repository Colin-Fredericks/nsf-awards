The AkMO enzyme catalyzes the first step in aerobic biodegradation of VC, which is a toxic intermediate in the biodegradation of chlorinated solvent trichloroethene, a widely distributed contaminant is soils and ground water. The ability to detect AkMO (via the subunit EtnC) in complex soil systems would be useful as a biomarker to signal the presence of VC-assimilating bacteria in soils. This proposal fits the criteria for an SGER in that it is an innovative idea and satisfies the high risk-high reward criterion. PI is a young tenure-track assistant professor, who is well qualified to conduct the proposed work and has ?state-of-the-art? analytical instrumentation at his disposal (liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry[lc-ms-ms]) for measuring protein macromolecules. Soil and ground-water contamination by chlorinated solvents is a significant societal problem. This work has the potential of opening a new area of research using proteomics techniques for the development of biomarkers. \r\n\r\n",
