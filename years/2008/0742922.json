 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living in groups is inherently costly, yet social cooperation is seen from slime molds to insects to primates.  One important benefit of cooperation may be group protection from particularly harsh environments.  A seed-harvesting ant of the desert southwest presents an exceptional opportunity to study the biological bases of group formation, cooperation and conflict.   This wide-ranging species, spanning both the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, shows unparalleled behavioral variation across its range:  in one region queens are intolerant of others, in a second they form groups but later fight to the death, while in a third they remain cooperative throughout the life of the colony.  Field surveys and laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine whether increasing harshness of their desert environment promotes greater social cooperation, and how queens develop behaviors appropriate for local conditions.\r\n\r\nCooperation and conflict largely shape our world, and this study will explore the role that ecology plays in the development of these important interactions.  The research will also provide training opportunities for graduate as well as undergraduate biology students, including those from traditionally underrepresented groups.  In addition, the results of the study will be presented to the general public through outreach activities at Death Valley National Park.\r\n\r\n",
