This new instrument consists of a collection of new underwater glider robots, a computer cluster, and monitors for Human-CURI interaction (along with novel hardware and software), capable of exhibiting biologically inspired autonomous cooperative behaviors such as swarming, maneuvering efficiently, sensing, and making decisions. Among others goals, the work aims to be able to track and map a water mass over time and to assess how a water column mixing in ocean water drives local primary productivity over time. CURI, developed as a collaborative effort between the institution and Webb Research (manufacturers of current robotics gliders), will exhibit and allow\r\n-\tBiologically inspired behaviors such as swarming,\r\n-\tDecision making (in uncertain conditions) based on the integration of multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and multi-sensory data,\r\n-\tHuman-CURI interaction to help guide the mission goals of the large number of underwater robotic vehicles, and\r\n-\tUnderwater communication among the robots of the CURI based on the implementation of ideas from distributed and adaptive non-fixed topology networks which include middleware, metadata, and low power protocols for underwater communications.\r\nLeveraging significant NSF, ONR, NOAA, USGS, DHS, and other agency investments, CURI will be tested in the linked ecosystems of the densely populated NY-NJ metropolitan area, the Hudson River watershed and estuary, and the adjacent coastal ocean of the Mid-Atlantic, as well as Polar and Tropical environments. The diverse data gathered will provide foundation for computational analysis and modeling. \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis development has strong multidisciplinary components that involve control, algorithms, marine science, statistical learning, dynamic systems, human-computer interaction (HCI), and distributed systems. The work is applicable in many areas that involve large-scale, distributed modeling of coordinated behaviors of individual units and their interaction with the environment. Thus, current and future oceanographic applications are expected, including improved modeling of the Coastal Hydrologic Cycle and understanding how a human initiated act such as pollution, global warming, and over-fishing affects the coast, the atmosphere, and ultimately, the quality and security of human life in urbanized environment. CURI will influence the educational program. Courses will be developed and collaboration across disciplines will ensue.\r\n",
