 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the deployment of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivation (CAMM) processes in the context of hypermedia learning is key to understanding the linear, iterative, and dynamic unfolding of these processes during self-regulated learning (SRL) among successful and unsuccessful learners. However, this is a very difficult problem. The goal of this exploratory project is to use cutting-edge sensors (i.e., physiological devices (e.g., EMG sensors), video capturing and recording devices, eye-tracking equipment, and voice recording to attempt to systematically capture, identify, and analyze the deployment of these processes during complex learning. This project will extend current theoretical,methodological, and analytical methods and tools by: (1) studying how students accomplish learning goals during SRL with hypermedia by experimentally inducing specific SRL processes through the deliberate design of a hypermedia environment; (2) examining the fluctuations in the CAMM processes and how they are related to learning outcomes; and (3) establishing research protocols that  maximize researchers? ability to converge and concurrently collect the temporal deployment of CAMM states during SRL with hypermedia via the use of several physiological sensors. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research includes the design and development of learning interventions for adaptive computer-based learning environments designed to detect, model, trace, and foster students? self-regulated learning. More specifically, instructional prescriptions will be derived focusing on key learning issues such as adaptivity, the role of metacognitive monitoring and control, and the regulation of motivation and affect during hypermedia learning.\r\n",
