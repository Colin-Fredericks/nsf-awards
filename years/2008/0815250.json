 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intelligent Merit: This study will examine and clarify for policymakers and researchers the impact of statewide policy changes that increased the availability of advanced STEM courses for a greater number of schools and students.  The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas.  This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college.  \r\n\r\nThe project will address two key research questions: \r\n1.\tWho enrolls in accelerated academic programs?  What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? \r\n2.\tDo accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)?  Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others?  Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?\r\n\r\nThe proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools.  Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools.  The FLDOE dataset includes a rich array of high school and postsecondary data (e.g. transcripts; dual enrollment and achievement data in these courses; regular 1-12 grades school test scores; demographic data; poverty index information).  Two sets of school site visits will be conducted in the state?s major urban centers as well as small suburban high schools to provide insights not captured through quantitative analysis.  During the initial visits, data will be collected via course catalogs and interviews with school personnel.  For follow-up visits, data will be collected through student focus groups about all aspects of course offerings and course taking.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Contribution to the field of knowledge about student enrollment in advanced STEM coursework will likely advance discovery in this area.  The extensiveness of the work (examination of student and school factors from high school to college in mathematics and science) increases the importance of results to local and national policymakers and researchers. The wide range of expertise (individuals and institutions) adds significantly to the strength of the proposal and increases the credibility of expected outcomes.  Lessons-learned from prior work will serve as the foundation for the development of some of the study?s data collection instruments. The dissemination plan is strong and the Urban Institute appears well positioned to carry out this component of the scope of work.\r\n\r\n",

Many faculty and administrators interviewed at two high schools believed students benefit from just the experience of being in AP classes and exposure to college-level material&mdash;even if they fail to pass the AP exams associated with their coursework.\n\n \n\nAP expansion is falling short. Our case study schools have successfully increased AP participation from students from underrepresented groups; however, AP exam scores remain low because students are not academically prepared for such rigorous coursework.  By emphasizing AP as a cure for the lack of academic rigor afforded many students from historically underrepresented groups, AP for All shifts the attention away from why students are unprepared in AP in the first place.\n\n \n\nInternational Baccalaureate \n\nThe supportive atmosphere created by the IB \"school within a school\" is an important part of the success of this program and would benefit students at all levels within today\u00c6s high schools. The stress that is often associated with IB programs, and the resulting negative behavior of cheating by top-performing high school students, however, signal that this program may be in need of review.\n\n \n\nMany students consider the IB program to be more difficult than college meaning this program may be overly rigorous. Competition to get into four-year universities drives students to work towards having the highest possible grade point average and rank in class, and IB is the perfect program to facilitate that goal. In addition, high schools in Florida are rewarded for student participation and achievement on IB and AP exams. These policies that support the potentially excessive rigor and undue competition in IB should be reviewed.\n\n \n\nDual Enrollment\n\nDespite public policy that is designed to put dual enrollment on par with Advanced Placement in Florida, DE has been supplanted by a bias towards AP and 4-year university enrollment.  This seems to us to be an unfortunate trend for low-income and at-risk students. The pass rates for the AP exam continue to be much lower than the success rates of high school students earning college credit through DE.  DE credits can also be used toward AA and AS degrees, pathways used by lower income students.  Often schools discourage students from taking DE courses. \n\n \n\nHigh schools often lack teachers with credentials to teach DE courses.  Community colleges courses are promising, but transportation is a challenge for most high school students. \n\n \n\nHonors and Remedial Algebra I Placement and Math Attainment\n\nBeyond standardized test scores (FCAT), student- and school-level demographic factors help explain variance in Honors and remedial course placement. Girls have higher rates of honors placement and lower rates of remedial placement than boys with at the same achievement level. \n\n \n\nDisparities in Algebra I Honors and Algebra I-A placement primarily impact students who earned a 3 on the mathematics FCAT.  These students are the most vulnerable because their individual achievement does not afford them a clear pathway into any specific Algebra I course. Level 3 Black students at predominantly Black schools and Level 3 Hispanic students in predominantly Hispanic schools are disadvantaged compared to their White peers in these schools and same-race peers in predominantly White schools.  It is unclear why Black and Hispanic students with median achievement are behind in schools that likely serve them in their own neighborhoods.\n\n \n\nGender Gaps in Calculus Coursetaking\n\nThis study finds no student or peer factors that account for the entire gender gap in Calculus coursetaking.  Boys and girls did have different predictors of Calculus coursetaking.  For boys, AP coursetaking and peer AP coursetaking were each independent positive predictors of Calculus coursetaking.  Girls in AP benefitted the most when they took Pre-calculus with  peers in AP. ..."
