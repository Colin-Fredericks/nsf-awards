 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe 14th Latin American Mathematical Logic Symposium (SLAM) is to be held in Paraty, Brazil, May 11-17, 2008.  The SLALM was established in 1970 to strengthen working relations between researchers in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives in Latin America. The region has become a significant source of graduate students and postdocs to logic programs in the United States and elsewhere.  While the amount of research activity and the number of specialized conferences that are held in the region continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest Pan-American logic conference. \r\n\r\nThe first SLALM was held in Santiago, Chile, under the leadership of Abraham Robinson, who at the time was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic. The meeting included two-week minicourses followed by a week-long conference. The minicourses were taught by A. Levi (The Hebrew University), R. Sikorski (Warsaw), and J. R. Schoenfield (Duke). Subsequent SLALM's were held in Brasilia, Brazil (1972), Campinas, Brazil (1974), Santiago, Chile (1978), Bogota, Colombia (1981), Caracas, Venezuela (1983), Campinas, Brazil (1985), Paraiba, Brazil (1989), Bahia Blanca, Argentina (1992), Bogota, Colombia (1995), Caracas, Venezuela (1998), San Jose, Costa Rica (2004), and Oaxaca, Mexico (2006). \r\n\r\nThe meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic.  It is expected that the proceedings of the 14th SLALM will be published by a major scientific publisher. Proceedings of past symposia have been published by North-Holland (in the series Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics) and Kluwer Academic Publishers. \r\n",
