 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the University of  Nebraska - Lincoln will enable fifty of an anticipated 300 scientists and science journalists to participate in an interdisciplinary conference designed to address mechanisms for improving the communication of scientific, mathematical, and engineering issues outside the scientific community.  In an intense two-day conference/workshop setting, participants will take part in proven practice communication training designed to improve the ability of  researchers to communicate their science broadly to non-expert audiences, and to enhance the skills of science writers whose messages are directed largely to the public.  Plenary, breakout and mini-workshop sessions are designed to achieve these goals and to enrich mutual understanding at the scientist/writer interface.  Conference participants will also investigate ways in which public STEM communication can be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curricula to better prepare future researchers and writers.  A web-based resource that captures the essence of the conference and that can be used as a tool for researchers and journalists to improve their science communication skills will be developed following the conference.\r\n\r\n",
