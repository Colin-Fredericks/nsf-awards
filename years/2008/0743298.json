 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve the analysis of transcript elongation by human RNA polymerase II (pol II) through precisely positioned single nucleosomes.  This approach has already led to the identification of DNA sequences which impose exceptionally strong barriers to transcript elongation when assembled into nucleosomes.  Use of this approach has also shown that contrary to initial expectations, removal of a single H2A/H2B dimer is not sufficient to allow pol II traversal for all nucleosomes.  The current research project will continue to exploit the single-nucleosome system to achieve a greater understanding of the mechanism of nucleosome traversal by pol II.  The experiments will address several important questions in this area.  What is the relationship between the strength of the nucleosomal blockade to transcription and the affinity of DNA sequence elements within the nucleosome for the underlying histone proteins?  What are the critical features of intermediates in the process of nucleosome traversal by pol II?  To what extent does the core structure of the histone octamer affect the nucleosomal barrier?  The N-terminal histone tails do not participate in the core structure of the nucleosome.  What role do the tails play in controlling pol II traversal of the nucleosome?  Transcript elongation factors for pol II which have been identified using pure DNA templates are at best partially effective in stimulating transcript elongation on nucleosomal templates.  Will efficient pol II traversal of nucleosomes depend not only on factors which stimulate pol II but also on histone chaperones, which can transiently disrupt nucleosome structure during transcript elongation?\r\n\r\nThis research project also provides an excellent training opportunity for advanced undergraduate students.  In addition to extending the classroom experience with cutting-edge technology, a summer spent in a research laboratory introduces students to the scientific method via practical examples.  Undergraduates from local universities will participate in this research project during each summer of the support period.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe genetic information in our bodies does not exist as free DNA.  The DNA in each cell is packaged in tight association with proteins to form chromosomes.  For the information in a particular gene to be utilized, it must be made available to the molecular machinery that transcribes the gene\u00c6s DNA into messenger RNA and thereby allows the expression of that gene.  The basic unit of chromosome organization is a protein-DNA complex called the nucleosome, each of which packages about 150 base pairs of DNA.  Chromosomes in turn consist of long arrays of nucleosomes.  \n\nOur laboratory studies the process through which the RNA synthesis machinery is able to transcribe DNA in spite of the packaging of the DNA template into nucleosomes.  In the work supported by NSF award 0743298, we performed test tube experiments in which we constructed DNA template molecules consisting of the start signal for RNA synthesis and a downstream DNA segment assembled into a single nucleosome.  With no additional manipulations in this system, the transcriptional machinery stalls and fails to transcribe the DNA packaged in the nucleosome.  Earlier work from our group and other laboratories had suggested two possible approaches to improving this result: (i) certain alterations in the nucleosomal proteins have been described which should facilitate DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome and thus allow better access to the nucleosomal DNA, and (ii) two transcription stimulatory factors have been described which facilitate RNA synthesis on pure (non-chromosomal) DNA templates.  When we tested two different alterations to the nucleosomal proteins, each provided some relief of the nucleosomal barrier and allowed a low level of transcription of the nucleosomal DNA.  Similarly, when we tested the two stimulatory factors, they also facilitated limited transcription of the nucleosomal template.  However, when we combined one of the nucleosomal protein alterations with both of the stimulatory factors, the results were dramatic: for the first time, it was possible to show that the nucleosomal barrier can be fully overcome in a test tube system.  In particular, in this most effective arrangement, we could demonstrate complete traversal of a nucleosomal template by the RNA synthesis machinery at a rate close to that seen with a free (non-nucleosomal) template.  These results represent a breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular biology of gene expression within the native, chromosomal context.  In future experiments we expect to extend these approaches to demonstrate effective transcription through long arrays of nucleosomes in our test tube system.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donal Luse"
