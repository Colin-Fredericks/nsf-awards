 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the dynamical behavior of the Internet and other large networks is a daunting problem. Traditional approaches try to capture the Internet?s detailed behavior at a granular level, but then struggle with the system?s overwhelming complexity. At the other extreme, models that emphasize the large scale while ignoring fine details are more tractable, but frequently neglect features needed for practical engineering issues, especially when dynamical rather than static behaviors are an important concern. This research develops a happy medium through a novel fusion of analytical and computational techniques.  Three important problems are explored.  The first concerns the overall efficiency and stability of the Internet; the second develops methods for improving the functioning of sensor networks (large arrays of small sensors that can be used to monitor environmental changes); and the third focuses on improving the quality of large cooperative computing systems by providing incentives for users to behave in ways that benefit the whole.\r\n\r\nThe potentially transformative aspect of this research lies in its ?computational-analytic? approach to creating effective models for a wide range of complex networks. In this strategy, computational techniques are interlaced with analytical ones, using such methods as ?equation-free modeling?? from chemical engineering and numerical renormalization from statistical physics. The approach is radically interdisciplinary, with the power to unify and extend multi-scale analytical methods adapted from such diverse fields as dynamical systems theory, mathematical physics and theoretical biology.  Spin-offs of the techniques created here are expected and will be investigated for other important problems involving complex networks, including routing on the Internet, synchronization in neural networks, and stability in global financial networks.",
