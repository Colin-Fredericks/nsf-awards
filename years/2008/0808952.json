IPSN convenes the leading researchers in the field of sensor networks. This includes the topics of novel network architectures, software systems, coding, data processing, data storage and management, information and communication theory, distributed algorithms and reasoning, programming models and languages, and other topics. Also, IPSN 2008 introduces a new format with two focus areas to be included in this single-track conference. This includes the information processing (IP) and the Sensor Platforms, Tools, and Design Methods (SPOTS) areas. IPSN has traditionally included the vanguard of research in this community including the highlights in the Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) program. Another important feature for the 2008 conference is that this will be co-located with the new Cyber-Physical Systems Week conference series including the IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) and the International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC'08). This NSF program is directed to sponsorship of student travel to IPSN.   This will promote the broad impact of including students who will receive guidance and mentorship at IPSN and would not otherwise be able to attend. Students will be selected by an application processing that includes both student application and faculty recommendations.\r\n",
