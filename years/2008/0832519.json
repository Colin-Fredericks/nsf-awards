 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Mexico is proposing to join the Arizona State University (lead institution), University of Arizona, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Ohio State University and the University of Hawaii existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Communications Circuits and Systems Center (Connection One). The proposed research site would increase the research capabilities and activities of the Center by focusing on fiber-optics and wireless (ultra-wideband) communications and systems.  Some key objectives of the proposed research site include defining an initial set of well-defined research projects in collaboration with the industry partners, to market a forward-looking research and development vision to potential industry partners, and to build a team of core industry members committed to establishing the proposed site. \r\n \r\nThe proposed center will pursue research projects of importance to a broad range of companies including Air Force Research Lab, Sandia National Lab, Encore, Gridline and others.  The activities at the proposed site will involve faculty researchers, graduate and undergraduate students working together with industrial representatives.   The proposed research site will also have increased participation of under-represented groups and minority students in industrially-relevant research activities.\r\n",
