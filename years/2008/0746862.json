 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasites and infectious diseases can have profound effects on their hosts, yet relatively little is known about how parasites influence animal behavior.  The work will address three fundamental questions: (1) Does individual infection risk vary with mating status and behavior?  (2) Do parasites drive variation in mating tactics by influencing individual mating decisions, behavior, and mating success?  (3) What are the mechanisms underlying associations between mating behavior and parasite infection?  To answer these questions, associations between behavior, physiology and gastrointestinal nematode parasitism in the African antelope, Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti), will be studied.  Taking advantage of natural variation in the behavior of male gazelles, the study will examine whether higher parasite infection levels are associated with differences in male mating behavior.  In addition, experimental manipulation of male parasite loads will test the effect of parasites on individual mating decisions and mating success.  Finally the work will use field and physiological studies to investigate whether reproductive behavior modifies male exposure and susceptibility to parasites.  The study results will reveal the extent to which parasites shape behavioral strategies observed in host populations, shedding light on the evolutionary significance of complex animal behaviors.  The results of this study will also make a timely contribution to knowledge of how animal behavior may change in response to increasing parasite pressure.  The project will provide numerous educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.  Biology students from both the U.S.A. and Kenya will gain hands-on training in the fields of disease ecology and behavioral ecology.  American students will obtain international research experience working at the study site in Kenya; and students from both countries will have unique opportunities for academic and cultural exchange.  This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",
