 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Bbusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to continue the validation of a set of markers for predicting recurrence and guiding the selection of treatment in stage I-III breast cancer patients.   Upon removal of their primary stage I-III operable tumors, breast cancer patients must decide whether or not to receive adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.  Currently, the physician and patient can arrive at the decision by relying on several published guidelines whose accuracy is limited by the fact that they are based on general clinicopathologic data such as tumor size and grade.  Thus the majority of patients are recommended to receive adjuvant therapy, although only a small fraction of them benefit from it. \r\n\r\nAvailability of a set of reliable markers that can predict recurrence of tumors would allow tailoring of adjuvant therapy for each patient and is thus likely to reduce the chances of under-treatment and over-treatment.  As such, it would be of great benefit to cancer patients, as well as to oncologists.  \r\n",

While the need for adjuvant hormone therapy is mainly determined by hormone receptor positivity, there is a great need for medical tools to accurately indicate whether or not adjuvant chemotherapy is needed.  Currently chemotherapy is over prescribed, has severe short and long term side effects, and only benefits a small percentage of patients.\n\nPrediction Sciences developed the InsightDX Breast Cancer Profile as a result of our Phase I, Phase II, and Phase IIB NSF SBIR grant.  InsightDX Breast Cancer Profile is a multiple marker breast cancer prognostic test, based on 7 molecular markers and 3 clinical-pathologic variables.

The InsightDx Breast Cancer Profile is commercially ready to benefit breast cancer patients at a lower cost than current premium priced tests on the market.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Albert K Man"
