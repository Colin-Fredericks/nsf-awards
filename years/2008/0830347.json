 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nA mathematical model for a natural (e.g., the heart beat of a\r\nhuman) or man-made process (e.g., the radio wave of a wireless\r\nsignal) is a mathematical expression or an algorithm that on\r\nevaluation of system parameters (such as a point in time) yields\r\na model value (e.g., the amplitude of a wave).  Models are\r\ncreated by understanding the process, which suggests the form\r\nof the expression, and by observing and measuring an actual\r\nprocess.  From those data points the best model is fitted by\r\na computation.  Erich Kaltofen studies both how to fit to data\r\ncertain models, such as fractions of sparse polynomials, and\r\nthen how to certify that the computation has produced the best\r\npossible model.  The algorithms for creation of best fits and\r\nsubsequent certification of optimality can be compute-intensive\r\nand require multi-processor computing environments.\r\n\r\nErich Kaltofen and his students and collaborators will design\r\nalgorithms for symbolic models such as sparse multivariate\r\nrational functions and formulas with very large and even\r\nparametric exponents.  Our algorithms can work with both exact\r\nand approximate data, the latter by hybrid symbolic/numeric\r\ntechniques.  Computation with floating point scalars requires\r\na new kind of probabilistic analysis when randomization is\r\napplied, and we will make use of recent results on estimating\r\nthe spectra and condition numbers of random matrices.  One\r\napplication of such randomization is the efficient solution\r\nof highly under- and overdetermined dense linear systems.\r\nA new alternative to error analysis is the exact validation via\r\nsymbolic computation of the global optimality of our approximate\r\nsolutions.  Semidefinite programming and Newton refinement\r\nare used to compute a numerical sum-of-squares representation,\r\nwhich is converted to an exact rational identity for a nearby\r\nrational lower bound.  Since the exact certificates leave no\r\ndoubt, the numeric heuristics need not be fully analyzed.\r\nWe will search for rationalizations that can validate very\r\nlarge sums-of-squares and hence apply to large inputs.  We will\r\ndevelop parallel and distribute computing tools for the arising\r\nsymbolic and hybrid symbolic-numeric computation tasks.\r\n\r\n",
