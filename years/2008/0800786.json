The project will continue a strong existing interaction between the PIs, aiding in the continued development of a core activity on laser-material interactions at the Materials Science and Engineering department.

Nanoporous films of metallic and oxide systems have been grown successfully on room temperature substrates from non-volatile precursors under low vacuum conditions.  Results from atomic scale characterization of stoichiometric crystalline oxides and ordered phase nanoparticles demonstrate the ability to synthesize complex particles with relevant applications in areas of chemical sensing and next generation magnetic materials.  Based on observations, it is hypothesized that acetates photothermally decompose within the frozen matrix, releasing metal ions. A strong dependence on precursor decomposition temperature was observed for nanoparticle formation and attributed in part to the limitation placed on the achievable temperature of the water matrix by the onset of the explosive boiling at ~550 K. Subsequent irradiation following decomposition leads to the formation of nanoparticles within the target along with enhanced decomposition of neighboring acetate systems with higher decomposition temperatures.  Results also suggest that nanoparticle ejection occurs upon achieving a critical number density.  Overall, the combined attributes of the matrix assisted process provide a strong platform for the controlled deposition of complex nanoparticle and nanoporous films onto a variety of substrate configurations.  Experiments were conducted in the following areas:\n\n1)      Growth of Nanoporous Films of Ag, Pd, Au, Sn, and Cu\n\n2)      Growth of Multicomponent Nanoporous Films of Y-Ba-Cu-O\n\n3)      Growth of Fe-Pd Nanoparticles\n\n4)      MAPLE Ablation Studies\n\n5)      Melting Target Experiments\n\n6)      Nanoparticle Formation\n\nA novel multi-scale computational model capable of describing the processes responsible for the nucleation, growth, and transport of metal nanoparticles in matrix-assisted laser ablation synthesis technique has been developed.

The conclusions from the continuum-level simulations are used in the design of a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model capable of reproducing the same physical regime of laser ablation as in experiment, albeit at a reduced length- and time-scales.
