It is now possible to manipulate single atoms and molecules to piece together new materials truly \"from the bottom up.\"  This project applied and developed the unique laboratory technology of atom and molecule manipulation to assemble novel quantum materials&mdash;materials whose structural and electronic properties are dominated by quantum mechanics and give rise to either novel behavior or promising technologies.  The laws of quantum mechanics dictate the behavior of matter at very small length scales, and these laws are become increasingly relevant in modern technology as the size of electronic devices continues to miniaturize. \n\nThe primary experimental apparatus used for these investigations were state-of-the-art custom-built scanning tunneling microscopes.  Model nanoscale materials were assembled to target three quantum degrees of freedom that are playing increasingly vital roles in modern science and technology: the vibronic degree of freedom (the \"shaking\" of single chemical bonds), the quantum mechanical phase of electrons (which can be understood in analogy to the to the phase of traveling waves like water waves), and spin/pseudospin (the built-in magnetism of materials).  Controlled atom and molecule manipulation and atom-by-atom assembly of complex nanostructures are capabilities existing now only at the frontiers of science and technology.  Students and high-school teachers were involved with conducting experiments and participating in hands-on workshops.
