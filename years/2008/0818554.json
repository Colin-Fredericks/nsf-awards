 "awd_abstract_narration": "An unresolved question in animal behavior is how complexity and variation in male signals is maintained within populations.  Past attempts to identify evolutionary forces that result in different male reproductive signals have ignored the possibility that particular trait combinations may gain effectiveness by the synergistic interaction of individual signal components.  In fact, these interactions may be a vital component of selection on complex male displays.  This study will focus on pheromones in a species of salamander. These reproductive pheromones are chemical signals, created by a combination of proteins, that a male delivers to a female during courtship.  The combination of individual pheromone components makes each male unique.  Behavioral experiments will measure the strength of female preferences for particular pheromone combinations.  Documenting these female preferences will reveal whether this mechanism of female mate choice can account for the immense variation of male pheromones.  Additionally, mathematical models of the process by which pheromone diversity is maintained will be constructed, and evaluated using the experimental results. \r\n\r\nThis study will promote outreach programs at Oregon State University and at the University of Louisville.  These programs will link faculty and students (graduate and undergraduate) with local teachers (K-12) and with students traditionally under-represented in scientific research.  The three primary goals of this activity are to train graduate and undergraduate students in experimental approaches and in new techniques, to put into practice new teaching methods shown to promote learning and retention in large science courses, and to let faculty and graduate students work with local school teachers to develop short programs amenable to different grade levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe studied a group of amphibians called plethodontid salamanders.  These salamanders are unusual in that they are completely terrestrial amphibians and do not enter the water, even for laying eggs.  These salamanders do have moist skin, so they do well in areas where rainfall permits their activity.  Communication in these animals occurs when individuals primarily by leaving odor trails on the ground. A second type of communication is used during courtship.  During the mating season, sexual contact between the male and female begins when the male approaches a female and rubs his specialized chin gland on the female's nose.  We have identified the substance produced by the male, and have shown that this substance is a pheromone that actually increases the female's receptivity to the male during courtship.  Very few vertebrate pheromones have this effect.  \n\nMost of the courtship behavior that is typically seein in these plethodontids is very ritualized, with little change amongs males. However, we also found that it is common for a female, over time, to change her preference and thus be more receptive to the pheromone of different male.  We propose that this process of the females switching behavior has occurred consistently over millions of years.  In fact, this change in female preference has caused the evolution of different male protein pheromones as males continually alter their pheromones to increase their chances of reproductive success. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynne D Houck"
