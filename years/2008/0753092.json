The conferences include the significant participation of\r\nundergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and\r\njunior faculty.  The FACM conference series has been organized\r\nover the past four years by the Department of Mathematical\r\nSciences and the Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at\r\nNJIT and is partially funded through an NJIT Strategic Initiative\r\nPlan.  The conference has become a leading forum for the\r\ndissemination of research in applied and computational\r\nmathematics and applied statistics.  The three year conference\r\nplan for 2008-2010 is as follows: FACM '08 is a large (250-300\r\nparticipants) general meeting in applied mathematics, involving\r\nin particular mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, wave\r\npropagation, and applied probability and statistics.  FACM '09\r\nand '10 are smaller (125-150 participants) focused meetings on\r\nmathematical biology and fluid dynamics, respectively, which are\r\nareas of focus in the Department. \r\n\r\n     This conference series brings together mathematicians,\r\nstatisticians, physicists, engineers, and biologists to share\r\nresults of their research in applied and computational\r\nmathematics and applied statistics.  The broader impacts are that\r\nsignificant cross-fertilization takes place during and after the\r\nconferences between researchers in different disciplines who\r\nutilize the methods of applied mathematics, statistics and\r\nnumerical computation.  For students and postdocs, this is a\r\nmajor learning experience that helps them with future\r\npresentations and research.  For many of these students, such a\r\nlocal research conference is their first exposure to high quality\r\nresearch being undertaken at other research institutions.  This\r\nexposure helps students strive to emulate the quality of these\r\nresearch activities.  Past FACM conferences have an excellent\r\nrecord of participation of women and underrepresented minorities,\r\nand special efforts are made to continue this trend. \r\n\r\n",
