 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project asks whether genes that are known to affect cognitive and social functions in humans exert similar effects in a simple organism, the fruit fly Drosophila, which is particularly well suited to experimentation.  The most striking and specific human genetic syndrome that affects social behavior and cognition is Williams Syndrome, a genetic condition produced by abnormalities in a small slate of genes on human chromosome 7.  Fruit flies have their own versions of the genes affected in Williams Syndrome.  The goal of this study is to re-construct the Williams Syndrome set of genes (and subsets of it) in strains of the fruit fly, and then test these strains in a variety of well characterized cognitive and social tasks worked out for this organism.  The value of testing the role of these genes in the fruit fly is that it offers unequalled potential for delving into the mechanisms through which genes affect brain functions relevant to social behavior.\r\n\r\nThis work would have repercussions throughout the world of Special Education in particular, and education in general.  Understanding the genetic and neurobiological bases for cognition, social behavior, and their interaction will have a profound influence on how we educate children with disabilities, as well as how we structure education in general, thus opening avenues that will ramify far outside of the narrow research field in which it is conducted.  In addition, it will also provide a training opportunity for a postdoctoral research fellow.",
