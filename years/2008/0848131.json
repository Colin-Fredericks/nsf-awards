Bryant\r\n\r\nBryant will apply techniques of exterior differential systems and\r\ndifferential invariants to problems of current interest in\r\ngeometry, economics, and physics.  In soliton flows, two problems\r\nwill be studied: Characterizing the complete Ricci solitons in\r\nterms of extra equations that they must satisfy, such as having\r\nhigher multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor or its\r\n(symmetrized) covariant derivatives and exploring a flow for\r\nCR-nondegenerate hypersurfaces in complex manifolds with\r\ntrivialized canonical bundle.  In minimal submanifolds, Bryant\r\nwill work on constructing and understanding calibrated\r\nsubmanifolds in Riemannian manifolds of special holonomy.  In\r\nalmost-complex geometry, Bryant will develop a theory of almost\r\ncomplex 6-manifolds by studying the functionals on the space of\r\nalmost complex structures on a given 6-manifold and the\r\n`quasi-integrable' class of almost complex structures, which has\r\nmany of the good bundle-theoretic properties of the integrable\r\ncase but is considerably more flexible.  It has a good theory of\r\nHermitian-Yang-Mills connections, at least locally, and one may\r\nhope to define, study, and apply the associated moduli spaces.\r\nBryant will also study the minimizing properties of\r\npseudo-holomorphic curves in almost complex manifolds.  In\r\nFinsler geometry, Bryant will develop the theory of Finsler\r\nmanifolds with constant flag curvature, constructing new\r\nexamples, understanding the properties of their geodesic flows,\r\nand pursuing relations with twistor theory and exotic holonomy.\r\nIn smaller projects, Bryant will continue to study the problem of\r\nHessian representability of metrics and its close relations with\r\nintegrable systems and will also begin developing and\r\ngeneralizing the convex Darboux theory introduced by Ekeland and\r\nNirenberg for applications to econometric models.  (The methods\r\nof exterior differential systems are particularly suited to this\r\nlatter problem and Bryant expects some interesting interaction\r\nwith econometricians along the way.)\r\n\r\nBryant will continue to develop geometric approaches to problems\r\narising in analysis, physics, economics, and biology.  Many of\r\nthe important advances in the use of mathematics in the sciences\r\nhave depended on developing a geometric understanding of those\r\nproblems, i.e., an understanding that focusses on intrinsic\r\naspects that are not tied to arbitrarily chosen coordinates.\r\n(The most famous example of this is Einstein's general theory of\r\nrelativity, which he found by re-interpreting gravitation as\r\n`curvature of space', rather than as a force whose complicated\r\nexpression in observer coordinates was largely irrelevant.  More\r\nrecently, the development of string theory and M-theory has also\r\nresulted in geometric formulations of physics.)  Geometric\r\nformulations often lead to degeneracies in the mathematics that\r\ncan be treated by differential systems and their invariants\r\n(nonstandard tools that Bryant and his coworkers are\r\nsystematically developing), and Bryant is exploring applications\r\nof these ideas to new areas.\r\n\r\n",
