A full suite of geochemical data from rocks in the northeastern Lau Basin in the western Pacific Ocean will be analyzed for major and trace elements as well as for the content of various volatile species such as H2O and CO2 and the radiogenic isotopes: Sr, Pb, and Nd.  Data will be used to test whether there are systematic variations in water content with distance from the trench and determine how back-arc volcanism is affected by the lack of a volcanic front.  Geochemical data will also be used to examine whether subduction of the Louisville Ridge volcanic chain is contributing to regional volcanism.  Data will be modeled to determine melting and magmatic source processes.  Results of the work will be compared and contrasted to those from the major NSF-funded RIDGE 2000 study site in the Lau Basin to the South.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   Broader impacts of the work include:  collaboration between two institutions, one of which is in an EPSCoR state (Oklahoma), education and training of students and a postdoc, international collaboration, and the use of an NSF-funded multi-user ion probe facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Additional outreach to K-8 school children will also be undertaken.\r\n",

Fonualei Rifts Spreading Centers (FRSC) and northeast Lau spreading centers (NELSC) are back arc spreading centers that were discovered recently in the northern part of the Tongan subduction system (Figure 1a).

The locations of spikes in subduction input and positive bathymetric anomalies along FRSC correspond to  projected locations of arc volcanoes (Fig. 1b), likely reflecting 3-D convective structure of the mantle wedge. Where there is a high subduction input, as revealed by high Ba, the extent of melting becomes very large due to the fluxing effects of H2O.  The extent of melting is even higher when the arc input is \"captured\" by the back arc spreading center (Fig. 2d).  FRSC is an end-member for global back-arc lavas in terms of large extents of mantle melting, revealed by low contents of Ti and Na.  As a result, a special type of magma: boninite is produced and may erupt (Fig. 2d).\n\nNon-mobile trace elements (e.g., Nb) and radiogenic isotopes in FRSC and Tofua arc lavas reveal an increasing proportion northward of a mantle source that was previously melted and then re-enriched by new melts (Fig. 2c).   The enrichment continues to increase northwards into  NELSC, where it reaches a peak 15.3S.  It is likely derived from the Samoan mantle plume, which is a few hundred km from  NELSC.  Enriched samples have relatively low SiO2, suggesting that enriched magmas like alkali basalts are supplied to NELSC.   This would show an important role for melt-melt mixing beneath the ridge. \n\nThe work at The University of Tulsa also focused on the fate of recycled volatiles (Cl, F, S, H2O) in the subduction system.   Our study of FRSC, and comparison with the ELSC-VFR, shows that significant amounts of H2O must be returned to the deep mantle, past the subduction zone.  Deeply subducted H2O that gets past the arc and back arc is expected to facilitate global plate tectonics by \"softening\" mantle olivine, thus allowing the mantle to flow plastically over geological time scales. \n\nA further goal was to sample and analyze rare seamounts located on the west side of ELSC, to determine  recycling pathways of subducted material to the surface: specifically whether m..."
