 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development of optimization techniques for\r\nthe automatic determination of the material properties of deformable\r\nsolids via modern imaging and scanning technologies (e.g. MRI, CT,\r\netc.) with particular focus on hyper-elastic materials under large\r\ndeformation, high strain rates and often plasticity.  Such materials\r\nare characteristic of biological soft tissues (e.g. muscle, fat, skin\r\netc.) and their determination is critical to creating accurate,\r\nsubject specific simulations of the function of these anatomical\r\nstructures.  Simulation using modern computational techniques is an\r\nincreasingly reliable tool for answering many questions in biomedical\r\nengineering ranging from basic functionality to post-surgical response\r\nof complex regions of the anatomy. However, reliable results are only\r\npossible when accurate constitutive descriptions of the simulated\r\nmaterials are available.  Although much work has been done to develop\r\nand determine constitutive models for biological soft tissues, most\r\nmaterial parameters have been estimated from cadaveric specimens or\r\nfrom a small group of individuals.  This is an unacceptable\r\nsimplification given the widely established variation in material\r\nbehavior across subjects and from the material changes inherent in\r\ncadaveric specimens.  This research will establish techniques for the\r\nnear-automatic determination of subject specific behavior necessary to\r\ncontinue the relevance and reliability of biomedical simulation of\r\nsoft tissues.  Though motivated by biomedical simulation, the\r\ntechniques developed in this research transcend the boundaries of\r\nbiomechanics and will provide a more general framework for determining\r\nmaterial properties for engineering applications.\r\n\r\nThe PI and collaborators will use their combined experience in\r\nconstitutive modeling, finite element simulation of soft tissues, mesh\r\ngeneration, optimization and medical imaging to formulate and develop\r\nmethods for the determination of constitutive parameters from imaged\r\nbehaviors. This task is formulated as an inverse problem of fitting a\r\nconstitutive model to observed material motion (involving imaging,\r\nsegmentation and denoising).  The PI and collaborators will draw upon\r\ntheir prior experience with similar techniques for estimating muscles\r\nactivation parameters and muscle material properties from material\r\ndeformation.  The capstone problems to be solved involve accurately\r\ntracking material particle trajectories with imaging technologies and\r\napproximating the Jacobian of elastic equilibrium configurations of\r\nsoft tissues with respect to unknown material parameters in a given\r\nconstitutive model.  With this functionality, the PI and collaborators\r\nwill determine the suitability of established optimization techniques\r\nand develop novel approaches (both engendered by the successful\r\nsolution of previously mentioned capstone problems).\r\n\r\n",
