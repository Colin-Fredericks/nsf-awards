The proposed work will address two challenge problems:\r\n1. To design, build, and control a planar robot to dynamically climb in a rigid vertical\r\nchute, and\r\n2. To design, build, and control a planar robot to reliably move from an initial state to\r\nany dynamically reachable goal state in a complex vertical environment of footholds at\r\nvarious orientations.\r\nThe true goal of this work is not to build speci&#64257;c-climbing robots, but rather to\r\naddress scienti&#64257;c issues fundamental to dynamic legged locomotion in\r\nnon-trivial terrains by confronting these two challenges.\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0803734 PI Name:Lynch, Kevin\r\nPrinted",
