 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site Program BIEN \"Biosystems Internships for ENgineers\" will \r\nprovide summer research opportunities in the Department of Electrical \r\nand Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Maryland, College \r\nPark (UMCP) for 10 undergraduate students per year in the applications \r\nof electrical engineering (EE) to biosystems.  Many breakthroughs in \r\nmodern medicine and science have been built on EE foundations, notably \r\nin the technical areas of medical devices, nanotechnology and information \r\ntechnology. The BIEN program builds upon a solid track record of research \r\ninnovation at the interface between electrical engineering and biology. \r\nExamples of research topics reflect the breadth and depth of biosystems \r\napplications in electrical engineering, ranging from nanotechnology and \r\nmicroelectronic devices to autonomous control, information security, \r\nsystem modeling, speech recognition, and neuromorphic signal processing. \r\nTargeted students will be talented undergraduates who have completed \r\ntheir sophomore year in electrical engineering and related programs. \r\nSignificant emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from under \r\nrepresented groups and students from schools lacking similar research \r\nopportunities.  BIEN students will spend ten weeks in the summer on \r\ncampus involved in research in small teams consisting of undergraduates, \r\ngraduate students and faculty advisors. A program of seminars, workshops, \r\nand field trips will complement and reinforce the learning experience.",
