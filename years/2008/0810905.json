 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the wake of new sequencing and genotyping technologies, \r\nwhole genome studies are now being undertaken to understand \r\nthe genetic basis of phenotypes. Many of the principles underlying \r\nthe measurement of genotype-phenotype relationships, \r\nas well as computing related population genetic parameters, \r\nare relatively well understood. However, the upcoming technologies \r\ndramatically change the scale and scope of these studies, \r\nwhich already encompass tens of thousands of individuals \r\nover a genome-wide region. The analysis of this data requires novel \r\nalgorithmic and statistical techniques. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses\r\non a subset of the problems that could arise in a typical \r\nwhole-genome based association study. These include:\r\n\r\n(a) Phasing of genotypes into haplotypes using overlapping sequence data, \r\nand the application of this algorithm to phasing individual human sequences; \r\nthe availability of high coverage long sequence data will make this approach \r\nthe method of choice for phasing in the near future. \r\n\r\n(b) Fast filtering for pairs of loci that interactively influence a \r\nphenotype and its application to multiple-locus testing of common \r\ndisease phenotypes. The proposed work reduces the computational \r\nbottleneck in multiple locus testing.\r\n\r\n(c) Detection of regions under balancing selection. Available tests \r\nare focused on detection of regions under positive selection. \r\nThe proposed research looks for evidence of balancing selection in \r\nthe genome, with specific attention on genes associated with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\n(d) Reconstruction of regulatory pathways using associations between genetic \r\nvariation and gene-expression.\r\n\r\nAll software from this research is freely available as source-code, \r\nor as web-tools for academic, research and non-commercial purposes \r\nin accordance with University policy. \r\n\r\nFurther information on the project may be found at the project web site:  \r\nhttp://bix.ucsd.edu/algen\r\n",
