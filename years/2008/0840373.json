 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical. An International Conference on Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) will be held during the week of August 3-8, 2008 at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. The scope of the conference is broad, covering the entire spectrum of MBE. The focus is on the material aspects of MBE growth, processing and characterization, but the conference also includes relevant physics and device properties of resulting films and structures. The conference organizers have scheduled three plenary talks, fourteen invited talks, and ~250 contributed papers on the latest results on MBE-related research to provide a stimulating and wide-ranging intellectual environment. \r\nNon-technical. The conference provides an excellent forum for interaction between university, government and industrial scientists working on these and related topics. The travel and conference fee support requested is targeted to improve the inclusion of members of under-represented groups in fields related to electronic materials. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry.\r\n",
