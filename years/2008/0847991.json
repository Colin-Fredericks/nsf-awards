 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the continued explosive growth in electronic information, both\r\nbusiness enterprises and high performance computing systems are being\r\nstructured as large ensembles of interconnected modular\r\ncomputing/storage modules or blades. These systems form the next\r\ngeneration data centers and supercomputers and a major impediment to\r\ntheir successful wide-spread deployment is the growing capital cost as\r\nwell as power and cooling costs. A dominant contributor to these costs\r\nis the memory subsystem that can exceed the costs of the processing\r\ncore and consume as much as 25%-40% of the energy in high end\r\nconfigurations. Currently, the architecture of data centers limits how\r\nphysical memory in data centers can be shared by different programs in\r\nthe system. Consequently, systems must be designed to accommodate the\r\nworst case peak memory demand and is therefore unduly expensive both\r\nin terms of capital cost as well as power. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research explores a novel solution for the reduction of memory system related costs by enabling memory to be shared across blades in a dynamic, demand-driven, fashion. The key idea is the tight integration of memory subsystem with the network subsystem. The result is a significant increase is memory efficiency and an attendant drop in the total memory requirements of a data center with little to no performance penalty. This approach is made feasible by exploiting recent advances in chip integration where the memory controllers and high performance communication interfaces are integrated on the same die. Thus cost and power can be more effectively managed than previously feasible by tracking actual memory demand rather than statically provisioning for worst case memory demand.\r\n\r\nTo maintain its leadership in computing, U.S. industry requires both\r\ntechnical advances such as those proposed here, new companies that\r\nleverage these advances, and new employees with the skill sets needed\r\nfor rapid technology and product development. The proposed work offers\r\nsuitable technical elements to offer ways to engage students in\r\nComputer Science and Engineering topics, to arrest the ongoing decline\r\nin the U.S. enrollment in CS and CmpE, to create new employment\r\nopportunities and to leverage the creativity and entrepreneurial\r\nnature of the U.S. student population. Existing relationships with\r\ntechnology companies such as IBM, HP, and Intel through an existing\r\nNSF I/UCRCat Georgia Tech will provide pathways to influence the system\r\ncommunity.",
