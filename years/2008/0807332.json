The\r\nstudy of critical points of the free energy functionals provides\r\ninformation about the equilibrium states of the corresponding\r\nsystems, whereas the gradient flows provide insights into the\r\nout-of-equilibrium phenomena.  In particular, the investigator\r\napplies the methods recently developed for the Onsager model of\r\nspatially homogeneous nematic liquid crystals to a more general\r\nsetting.  Employing a novel approach based on the combination of\r\nOseen-Frank, Landau-de Gennes, and Onsager's theories, the\r\ninvestigator obtains an analytically tractable theory explaining\r\nthe spatial variations of orientational ordering.  Further on,\r\nthe investigator exploits the fact that a particular case of\r\ntwo-dimensional nematics is closely related to complex\r\nGinzburg-Landau-type models and the problem of harmonic mapping\r\nof a domain into a unit circle.  This connection allows him to\r\nestablish rigorous asymptotics for various patterns (twisters,\r\nvortices, domain walls, etc.,) arising in this particular setting\r\nusing the tools from Ginzburg-Landau theory.  The dynamical part\r\nof this project concentrates on the extent to which the kinetic\r\nequations for evolution of orientation probability densities and\r\ncorrelation functions (described via gradient flows in\r\nWasserstein spaces of probability measures or more general\r\nmass-transportation dynamics) are reducible to the commonly used\r\nGinsburg-Landau-type dynamics of the order parameters.  A\r\nsystematic analysis of such reductions is requisite for a\r\ncomplete understanding of dynamics of liquid-crystalline systems. \r\n\r\n     Liquid crystals are substances that share characteristics\r\nwith conventional liquids and crystalline solids.  Such an exotic\r\ncombination of material properties allows for a high degree of\r\ndynamic control, which in turn allows for a wide range of useful\r\napplications.  Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology is,\r\nundoubtedly, the prime example.  Modern applications employ the\r\nfact that optical properties of liquid crystals change under\r\nexternal influences such as applied electric or magnetic fields,\r\nstresses, etc.  By manipulating the latter in an appropriate\r\nmanner one can achieve the desired effects.  The theory of liquid\r\ncrystals has been developing since the middle of twentieth\r\ncentury.  Its success has been recognized by a Nobel Prize\r\nawarded in 1991 to P.-G. de Gennes for fundamental contributions\r\nto our understanding of order phenomena in complex systems. \r\nStill, due to enormous growth in applicability of liquid crystals\r\nand rapid development of the associated technologies, it has\r\nbecome even more important to go beyond the general principles\r\nand to further expand our understanding.  Although computer\r\nsimulations provide valuable insights, for precise control over\r\nliquid-crystalline materials it is essential to support the\r\nexperimental findings and computer simulations with a rigorous\r\nmathematical theory.  Development of such a theory is the primary\r\ngoal of the investigator's work.  His particular interest is\r\nmathematical analysis of patterns, their formation and evolution,\r\nand dynamics of phase transitions in liquid crystals.",
