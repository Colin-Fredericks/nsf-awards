 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually every high-performance processor today has multiple processing\r\nunits (also known as cores) on a single chip. Such multicore hardware\r\ndesigns present opportunities for significant performance gains, by\r\nprocessing multiple tasks simultaneously, thus enabling novel\r\ncompute-intensive applications. Executing multiple tasks on a single chip\r\nrequires data to be transported in and out of the chip at a rate which\r\noften exceeds current hardware capability. Consequently, realizing the\r\nperformance potential of current multicore processors requires novel\r\nsolutions to the memory bottleneck problem. This project investigates\r\nsoftware solutions to alleviate the memory bottleneck. The main idea is to\r\nuse program transformation tools (also called compilers) to restructure\r\nprograms so that they can best utilize deep and complex memory\r\nhierarchies, and to account for such hardware optimizations as prefetching\r\nand shared caches.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates novel programming models and constructs for\r\nscalable multicore processors, and compiler techniques to support such\r\nmodels and constructs. It also aims to develop a runtime infrastructure\r\nfor message passing aggregates to support such models and constructs on\r\nclusters of multicore processors. Software developments are augmented by\r\nanalytical models that guide application development and compiler\r\noptimizations. Software techniques and theoretical models are validated\r\nfor performance and scalability on platforms ranging from multicore\r\ndesktop machines to clusters of multicore processors.\r\n",
