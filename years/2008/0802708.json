 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will construct an empirical model of the diffuse aurora using data from the DMSP satellites.  By utilizing the DMSP data it is possible to clearly differentiate the diffuse aurora and discrete aurora.  This can be done in an automated fashion, allowing the complete DMSP particle precipitation database to be used.  The DMSP data will also allow separate models of the southern and northern hemispheres to be constructed and to examine the nature of the diffuse aurora both under solar illumination and in darkness.  The coupling function developed under previous NSF support will be utilized as an optimal parameter for describing the coupling between the solar wind interplanetary magnetic field and the magnetosphere.  An additional coupling function will estimate the viscous coupling term that does not depend on the interplanetary magnetic field.  The resulting model is expected to account for better than 2/3 of the variance in the data.  Among the open scientific questions that this project will address is the role of UV insolation on diffuse auroral particle precipitation.  The resulting models will be distributed to the public through a web site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDiffuse aurora is the tamer counterpart to the spectacular curtains and rays created by discrete aurora.  The latter are associated with intense acceleration of electrons above the ionosphere, and have been the subject of intense study for decades.  By contrast, the faint green (or, less often, red) clouds associated with diffuse aurora looks more like a faintly glowing cloud that shifts in odd ways.  The diffuse aurora is caused by the random collisions of the ions and -- more importantly -- electrons which surround the Earth with the upper atmosphere.  Despite its less impressive appearance, this study demonstrated that the diffuse aurora actually constitutes the large majority, about 75%, of the energy flux deposited by auroral particles into the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.  This is a classic case of consistency outweighing flash, as the persistence and geographical extent of the diffuse aurora proves more important than its lower luminosity.\n\n   The diffuse aurora was also shown to be much more dynamic than classically considered.  It ramps up with increased solar wind driving, or on most occasions when the flashier discrete aurora flares up (e.g., auroral substorms).\n\n   The two attached figures show the energy flux and the number flux of the diffuse aurora, each for low solar wind driving conditions (top) and high solar wind driving (bottom).  The diffuse auroral energy flux is mostly on the nightside.  However the number flux can be as high or higher on the dayside, near noon.  This is because the Earth's magnetic dipole creates an open region allowing direct entry of shocked solar wind particles near noon.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick T Newell"
