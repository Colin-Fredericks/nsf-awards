The first part of the\r\nproject undertakes the development of a general theory that\r\nallows for efficient characterizations of the yield set of a\r\npolycrystal by means of suitable variational principles in\r\nL-infinity.  A new variational formalism leads naturally to\r\nseveral problems in the emerging area of calculus of variations\r\nin L-infinity for the case where the functionals to be optimized\r\nare the essential supremum of some expression involving\r\ndivergence-free fields.  Here the natural approach is to minimize\r\nthe maximum of certain relevant quantities instead of their\r\naverage.  The investigator studies selected issues in this\r\ndirection, with an emphasis on those that can have an impact on\r\nour understanding of plasticity.  Among these, the study of the\r\nsystems of partial differential equations that arise as Aronsson\r\nequations associated to the new variational principles in\r\nL-infinity is of particular interest.  The second part of the\r\nproject deals with the derivation of nonlinear membrane theories\r\nfrom three-dimensional elasticity, seeking to better understand\r\nthe formation of interfaces in thin films of martensitic\r\nmaterials.  The project sheds light on the structure of the\r\nminimizers for a new effective thin film energy, and indicates\r\nappropriate minimizing sequences. \r\n\r\n     The project aims to set on rigorous mathematical grounds\r\nsome of the traditional models used by engineers and material\r\nscientists and, on the other hand, to explore new variational\r\nprinciples in the case where one wants to know how big some\r\nquantity can be at its maximum value, not merely on average. \r\nThis question arises in many areas of science and engineering and\r\nis of fundamental importance in such applications as elasticity,\r\nimage processing, damage and fracture mechanics, and plasticity. \r\nThe investigator studies this question in the first part of the\r\nproject.  In the second part he deals with the derivation of\r\nnonlinear membrane theories from three-dimensional elasticity. \r\nThis is motivated in part by the need, originating from important\r\ntechnological applications, to better understand and predict the\r\nformation of interfaces in thin films of martensitic materials. \r\nThe project sheds light on the structure of the minimizers for a\r\nnew effective thin film energy recently proposed by the\r\ninvestigator, and indicates appropriate minimizing sequences that\r\nare expected to provide some insight into the design of\r\ntechnologically useful active material structures, more complex\r\nthan those suggested by existing thin film theories.",
