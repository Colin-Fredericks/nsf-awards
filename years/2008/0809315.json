 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue and expand the ongoing investigation on new and efficient higher order cycloaddition and cyclohydrocabonylation reactions.  These reactions allow for constructing multiple bonds all at once and for converting linear starting materials to polycyclic compounds in one step.  In addition, the fine-tunable phosphorus ligands developed successfully in the last funding period will be applied to the development of highly efficient catalytic asymmetric reactions that are useful for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  Professor Ojima's research efforts revolve around the discovery of highly efficient catalytic methodology for the rapid construction of polycyclic and enantiomerically pure compounds.  These compounds are of significant biological and medicinal importance.  In addition, the proposed chemistry is green in nature, as it has high selectivity and generates little waste materials.",
