The advantage of chemical aerosol-flow synthesis is in its simplicity in procedure and experimental setup, low cost and scalability. The method allows for the synthesis of high quality nanoparticles in continuous flow regimen.  Phase I results proved feasibility of the method for the synthesis of high quality silver nanoparticles with high yield. This Phase II project will focus on increasing manufacturing capabilities to decrease the cost of nanoparticles significantly.\r\n\r\nLow cost, printed electrical conductors are expected to be a rapidly growing market for flexible electronics and solar cells.  Reducing processing temperatures and material costs are key enablers to these growing applications.  The low cost production of nanometals will contribute to these trends.",
