 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from this grant will be used to support our group's efforts in the projects in nucleon structure and in tests of fundamental symmetries. In the first year, we will be completing data analysis from the G0 experiment in which parity-violating electron scattering is used to determine the contributions of strange quarks to the proton's charge and magnetism. Later in the grant period we will participate in an experiment that uses muon pair production to probe the distribution of antiquarks in the proton (FNAL experiment E906). This latter measurement addresses a number of unanswered questions about the nonperturbative QCD structure of the proton, such as the degree of charge symmetry in proton's internal structure and the role of antiquarks in ground state properties of free and bound nucleons. Our group is also participating in experiments that use precision measurements of neutron beta decay to test fundamental symmetries. The broader impact of this group's research is primarily through providing outstanding research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students. Students are exposed to nuclear physics concepts, get hands-on experience developing hardware, make significant contributions to the experiments, and have the opportunity to visit and participate in programs at major national laboratories.",
