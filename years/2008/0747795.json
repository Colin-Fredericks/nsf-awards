 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project poses the fundamental question of how can cyber-tools and cyber-environments better enable learning in the engineering disciplines.  The theoretical framework for this work is a synthesis of situated learning theory and theories of semantic web (a new and evolving area of study in computing that has major implications for future cyber-tools and cyber-environments).  While situated learning theory focuses on the student experience, theories of semantic web design focus on the process of characterizing and creating cyber-environments.  The specific goals of this project include: (1) understand educators' expectations of cyber-tools and cyber-environments as engineering teaching tools; (2) characterize how undergraduate learners interact with the current generation of simulation tools online; (3) investigate the influence of learning styles on undergraduate students' use of simulation tools; and (4) create and validate a learner-centric semantic schema- also called ontology - to form the foundation for the creation of future simulation cyber-tools.  Integration of research and education occur will through the development of an online \"Guide to using cyber-environments in the undergraduate engineering curriculum\".  This research will lead to the creation of highly adaptive and customizable learning experiences when using cyber-tools and cyber-environments as part of the engineering curricula.",
