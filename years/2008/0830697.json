 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research takes a multiuser information theoretic approach to investigate innate theoretical\r\nconnections that exist between multiuser source and channel coding, information theoretic\r\nnetwork security, and combinatorial tree packing algorithms in theoretical computer science. It is\r\nof compelling interest to the theory as well as the engineering practice of network source and\r\nchannel coding, and network security, in emerging wireless technologies.\r\nAddressing broad classes of network source and channel models with correlation and\r\ncooperation, the investigators study explicit and precise characterizations of basic structural\r\nconnections between multiuser data compression, channel coding, network security and\r\ncombinatorial tree packing, and the underlying role of common randomness (i.e., coordinated\r\nrandomization). The research develops information theoretic principles for associated signal\r\nprocessing algorithms. It applies source coding and channel coding techniques for providing\r\ninformation theoretic network secrecy in encrypted communication, and investigates points of\r\ncontact between combinatorial tree packing algorithms and network security.",
