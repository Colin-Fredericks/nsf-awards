Tasks include:  (1) a study of adaptive configurable multi-cell battery discharge behaviors under a time-varying load through modeling and simulation; (2) investigation and development of an adaptive control and optimization framework to dynamically select the optimal cell topology configuration for the current load based on each cell's state of health and state of capacity; and (3) establishment of an integrated power-aware embedded platform for testing and evaluating the proposed adaptive configurable multi-cell battery with a wide range of benchmark load applications.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project investigates a novel design concept for multi-cell batteries with the goal of increased utilization of battery capacity.  The research also investigates a power management system with simple direct current-to-direct current conversion circuitry that is intended to increase the efficiency of multi-cell battery discharge.  Finally, the project seeks to develop a fundamental understanding of multi-cell battery behavior, which is currently not well understood.  This project seeks to provide solutions for a variety of domain-specific applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  By improving the discharge efficiency and life span of multi-cell batteries, the broader impacts of this project are to increase a system's operating time with the same battery capacity and to reduce environmental impact of discarded batteries.  Results, outcomes, software tools, benchmarks, and educational materials will be disseminated through a project web site, as well as through journal and conference publications.  A new course on power-aware computing is being jointly developed and taught at the investigators' univer\r\n",
