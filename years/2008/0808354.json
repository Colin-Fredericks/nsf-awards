Hebets, Co-PI Kasey Fowler-Finn\t\r\nProposal # IOS 0808354\r\n\r\nDISSERTATION RESEARCH: Exploring the existence of two discrete male phenotypes in a mixed population of Schizocosa wolf spiders\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the processes governing the formation, maintenance and evolution of variation within natural populations. Specifically, this research focuses on understanding the existence and putative maintenance of two male forms found within a single wolf spider species. The two male forms (brush-legged and non-ornamented males) are found in an apparently freely interbreeding population in Mississippi, and are identical to two previously described species that have are reproductively isolated. The first objective of the proposed research is to use molecular approaches to confirm that the two male forms do not represent two distinct genetic groups in this mixed population. The second objective will use different sibling rearing regimes to understand factors that influence the development of the male forms - specifically addressing the importance of diet and/or genetics.  Finally, lifetime reproductive success of the two male forms will be determined in artificial field populations using molecular techniques for paternity analysis. Taken together, the proposed integrative research allows for the exceptional opportunity to understand the existence of two alternative male forms from molecular, developmental, behavioral, and natural field-based perspectives. Results of this research will likely contribute greatly to our understanding of both speciation and the maintenance of phenotypic variation. Broader impacts of the work: This research will provide numerous opportunities for research training of undergraduate students as well as opportunities for local youth in rural Mississippi to be involved in specimen collection for research. Furthermore, knowledge of spider biology generated by this research will be disseminated to elementary school students through the Lincoln Community Learning Center program in Lincoln, Nebraska.",
