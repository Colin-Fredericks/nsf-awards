 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an international conference entitled\r\n      \"New directions in Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization\". \r\nThe central theme of this conference will be combinatorics and its applications \r\nin theoretical computer science and operations research. The conference will take \r\nplace in May 2008 on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in midtown \r\nAtlanta, and will honor the 65th birthday of William T. Trotter.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for holding the conference in Atlanta, namely direct \r\nflights from most of the world's major airports, and the presence of the PhD program \r\nin Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO) at Georgia Tech, with its more \r\nthan 45 affiliated faculty and 40 students.\r\n\r\nThe conference program will consist of approximately 30 invited lectures, a poster \r\nsession and a problem session. The conference is expected to attract 200-300 \r\nattendees, including local, regional, national and international delegates. A \r\nconference proceedings will be published as a special issue of the journal \r\nCombinatorics, Probability and Computing.\r\n\r\nThe list of invited speakers includes only the leading experts and fine expositors. \r\nThe organizing committee consists of experienced senior researchers who will uphold \r\nvery high standards. Georgia Tech has excellent facilities to accommodate a \r\nconference of this type.\r\n\r\nUsing federal support the organizers will be able to offer financial assistance to \r\nattendees with no outside funding, including students, postdoctoral associates, junior \r\nfaculty, women, and underrepresented minorities, with priority given to young people \r\nand members of underrepresented groups. While the main lectures will be by invitation \r\nonly, junior scientists will be able to present in the poster session and participate \r\nin the scientific discussions throughout the conference.\r\n\r\nA further aspect of broader impact is the interplay of mathematics, computer science \r\nand operations research, that is already present in the ACO program at Georgia Tech. \r\nThis conference will further promote the fruitful interactions of these disciplines, \r\ndrawing upon the successful experience at Georgia Tech, and in doing so will further \r\nstrengthen the ACO program.\r\n\r\nThe conference proceedings will be stringently refereed subject to the standards of \r\npremier combinatorics journals. Thus the conference will have lasting impact not limited \r\nto its attendees.",
