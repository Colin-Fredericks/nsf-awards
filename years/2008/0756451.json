In addition, the knowledge generated from this project will make a significant contribution to the basic biology of ethanol tolerance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nThis project?s strategies can be applied to any desirable organism and bioprocessing application whereby a selectable complex phenotype is desirable, and especially processes for the utilization of renewable resources. The importance of efficient and economically viable technologies for production of chemicals & biofuels from renewable resources has become an urgent national and international priority over the last few months. This was driven by several important facts. First, the depletion of non-renewable energy sources, such as oil, coupled with increased energy demand driven by fast developing economies and world population has led to high oil and energy prices. And a second important fact is the realization that non-renewable fossil fuels lead to significant climatic changes that may lead to catastrophic weather-pattern changes. In contrast, biomass is a carbon-neutral renewable resource for production of biofuels and chemicals. Finally, this project provides unique opportunities for student education and training in experimental genomics, and associated high-throughput technologies.\r\n \r\n",
