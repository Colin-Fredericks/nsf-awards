 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. Kilauea, on the island of Hawaii, is one of the most active and best-monitored volcanoes in the world. Its high magma supply rate and well delineated magmatic plumbing system make Kilauea an ideal venue for addressing fundamental questions about basaltic magma genesis. Its lavas provide essential petrologic and geochemical clues for delineating the nature of compositional heterogeneity within the Hawaiian plume and for assessing magma generation processes that cannot be readily ascertained by other methods. The PIs previously documented systematic short- and moderate-term (decades to centuries) geochemical variations within Kilauea's recent lavas. Over several centuries, Kilauea summit lavas record cyclic geochemical trends that correlate with volcanic processes such as eruption rates (more depleted sources appear to have undergone lower degrees of melting and produced less magma). To continue this work, a three-pronged approach is proposed combining field work with petrography, mineral chemistry, whole-rock major element and trace element abundances, and O, Pb, Sr, and Nd isotope ratios to assess the mantle causes (source and process) for compositional variation in Kilauea lavas. Part 1 involves continued monitoring of the geochemical evolution of the Puu Oo eruption, which has shown remarkable compositional variation related to crustal and mantle processes. Changing lava compositions provide new insights into magmatic processes. Part 2 examines the AD 900 to 1400 Uwekahuna Bluff lava section on the northwestern wall of the Kilauea's caldera. This study will allow evaluation of apparently cyclic geochemical variations at Kilauea on a few century time scale, and elucidate distribution of small-scale heterogeneities and the dynamics of mantle melting within the Hawaiian plume. Part 3 utilizes electron microprobe, LA-ICPMS, O isotope laser mass spectrometry and SHRIMP ionprobe to study olivine-hosted melt inclusions in high forsterite olivines (>86%) from selected Kilauea historical summit lavas. Preliminary work on these inclusions shows tremendous compositional diversity within individual lavas that may be related to the relatively short residence of magma in the summit reservoir (30-100 years). Major- and trace-element abundances, and O and Pb isotope ratios will be determined in these inclusions to better constrain the mantle heterogeneities and melting processes within the Hawaiian plume.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Broader impacts of this research include (1) developing teaching modules for undergraduate and graduate petrology classes using the results from our Kilauea research to highlighting magmatic processes at an active volcano and emphasing cooperative learning and development of higher order thinking skills, (2) mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, (3) giving public lectures to school groups and the local community, (4) gaining a better understanding of volcanoes that can negatively influence the quality of life, and (5) increasing international and national scientific cooperation through collaboration and utilization of multiuser facilities.\r\n",
