 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) research project will develop novel high brightness solid-state Light Emitting Diodes (LED) using doped quantum dots. Solid state lighting is rapidly gaining momentum as a highly energy efficient replacement technology for incandescent and eventually fluorescent lighting. However, current high brightness solid state devices suffer from reduced luminous efficiencies due to scattering, re-absorption, and thermal quenching losses inherent in conventional phosphors and standard undoped quantum dots. The proposed doped quantum dots have broad and size-tunable absorption bands, size and impurity tuned emission bands, size-driven elimination of scattering effects, and a distinct separation between absorption and emission bands. In addition, they also display the ability to maintain efficient (even improved) emissions at high temperatures similar to those experienced in today's high brightness LEDs. \r\n\r\nThese new lamps will improve lighting and provide US industry with competitive technologies that will significantly reduce global energy use and environmental pollution. This technology has applicability to all LED light sources where a fluorescent color conversion layer is used. Thus, any current application, such as lighting in portable electronics, automobiles, traffic signaling, will immediately benefit from increased efficiency. The increased efficiency and use of LEDs will lead to significantly reduced energy requirements, lower levels of pollution, reduced toxic waste (e.g., Hg from fluorescent lamps) and a reduced dependence on foreign oil suppliers.",
