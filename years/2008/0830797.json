 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of algorithms has yielded numerous techniques that are both\r\ninteresting mathematically and broadly useful.  This ranges from\r\nlinear programming to cryptography to geometry to approaches for\r\napproximately solving optimization problems.  The addition of a\r\nstatistical view of the world to the study of algorithms has also been\r\na compelling area of study. This project will study better algorithms\r\nfor linear programming as well as, explore and expand on recent work\r\nin approximation algorithms, and will explore algorithms with a\r\nstatistical view of the world.  Recent breakthrough work on\r\nsolving linear systems as well as developments in online optimization,\r\nmake the development of better algorithms for linear programming a\r\ntantalizing possibility.  This project will pursue this goal. A second\r\nspecific area is the study of approximation algorithms which has, in\r\nrecent years, been a primary focus of algorithms research.  In\r\nparticular, problems such as finding sparse cuts, disjoint paths, and\r\nthe traveling salesman problem have been fertile ground for developing\r\nnew algorithmic techniques.  The researcher has done some of this\r\nwork, and proposes to study this area further.  Finally, this project\r\nwill go beyond the ``we know how to solve it'' case of linear\r\nprogramming, and the ``we will do as well as we can'' notion of\r\napproximation algorithms, to a ``how do we do on data generated by the\r\nworld'' view of algorithms.  This latter view is especially\r\nappropriate these days with the growing production of biological data;\r\nThis data is generated accordingly to scientifically validated\r\nstatistical models.  Quite interesting work has been done in this\r\narea, but the field is begging for more involvement from those trained\r\nin algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the further development\r\nof mathematical techniques for algorithms, and the blending of\r\ntraditional ideas with ideas in statistics.  The broader impacts lie\r\nin the many applications of algorithms for the problems addressed in\r\nthis project.  Application areas include network design, molecular biology, recommendation systems, and optimization.  The researcher will introduce ideas from this project into graduate and undergraduate classes in algorithms as well.",
