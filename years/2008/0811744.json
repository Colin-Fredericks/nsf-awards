 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT HRD 0811744\r\n\r\nThis project, based at North Carolina Central University (NCCU), is developing a Robotics concentration within an interdisciplinary program in Computational Sciences. Four courses are being developed in this concentration, one of which will serve as an introductory course designed to motivate students about computer science and engineering. Students enrolled in the Early College High School at NCCU are able to enroll in this course. In addition we are conducting summer workshops in Robotics for area high schools. In conjunction with faculty from the STEM disciplines, students have opportunities undertake research projects in areas of Computational Science. \r\n\r\nThe program at NCCU will accomplish three objectives: (i) it will establish a computational science program grounded in research to influence undergraduates, minorities in particular, to consider graduate education in mathematics, computer science and engineering; (ii) it will establish a pipeline of students into graduate education at outstanding research universities, located in the area and beyond; (iii) it will enable the training of students who appreciate the problems inherent in these disciplines and who can contribute to the future of these areas. The program is creating long-term interdisciplinary training in the Computational Sciences, as well as collaborative projects and curriculum development. \r\n\r\nThe STEM departments at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) are committed to increasing the opportunities for underrepresented minorities in the sciences. We seek to broaden participation in new degree programs and concentrations through revision of curricula and development of new courses.\r\n",
