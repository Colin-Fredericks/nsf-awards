 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Special Project award provides funding for the organization of the 2008 CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH) Program principle investigators? meeting. It includes funds for the meeting itself as well as for a planning meeting of the executive team overseeing the PI meeting.  The 2008 meeting is to be held in the fall of 2008 in Arlington, Virginia.  The workshop provides a forum for dissemination of research results, collaboration among project teams, and exchange of information to the broader community.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies with the expertise of the participating computing professionals to contribute to the knowledge and research on innovation in undergraduate computing education.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts revolve around the potential for the collected group to raise public awareness about transformation of undergraduate computing education and to collectively initiate projects that may broaden the pathways into and through undergraduate computing education thus opening doors for a more diverse student population.  \r\n",
