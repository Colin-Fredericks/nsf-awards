 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nRarely in the study of complex fluids such as biosystems does one technique suffice to illuminate their true complexities.  Ideally, both thermodynamic and structural information is needed under near identical conditions to describe such systems.  This proposal seeks to acquire two state-of-the-art instruments that complement each other in exactly this way.  These instruments will be used within a focused multidisciplinary center for experimental soft-condensed matter physics.\r\nThe Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter (MDSC) measures how small amounts of heat are absorbed as the temperature of milligrams of material is varied and determines important thermodynamic characteristics.  The Spectroscopic Ellipsometer (SE) measures the polarization and color of reflected light from a thin film, determining the film's detailed structure, composition, and uniformity.  Used together, MDSC and SE provide an extraordinary view of the structure and phase behavior of a wide variety of thin films and small systems.  Our initial research plans include using these two instruments to obtain both structural and thermodynamic information of thin films of large bio-macromolecules such as DNA, polysaccharides, and membrane proteins.  Other research directions will include various complex fluids (liquid crystals), water remediation studies, and wetting properties of polar liquids, which would additionally complement other experimental techniques.  This proposal will greatly impact and expand educational activities across many disciplines, from bioengineering, chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, as well as physics.  Through our comprehensive and unique undergraduate project-based curriculum, WPI is ideally poised to use these instruments and facilities to make first-rate research activities accessible to all students at every level.\r\nAdditionally, the diversity of the team brought together in this work will enhance the mentoring of students from all backgrounds.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nThis NSF-MRI proposal seeks the acquisition of a modulated-differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC - TA Instruments Q200) and a spectroscopic ellipsometer (SE - Woollam M-2000).  Together, these two instruments will provide an extraordinarily detailed view of the structural and phase behavior of thin films of a wide variety of complex and bio-fluids that is essential for the understanding of such important systems.  The MDSC provides specific heat, enthalpy, and phase transition temperature data from small samples, e.g. films, in a timely fashion, while the SE provides key data on film thickness, uniformity, and structure.  These data will complement other existing experimental facilities at WPI including atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray scattering, surface plasmon resonance, to name a few. Along with the current facilities, the proposed instruments will provide the foundation for a first-rate center for experimental soft-condensed matter within the department of physics.  This center will impact activities across many disciplines and is a major goal of the department.\r\nProjects that will immediately benefit from the acquisition of the proposed instrumentation are: wetting and de-wetting behavior of polar and non-polar liquids, such as water and liquid crystals; structural and thermodynamic studies of biological thin films, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and DNA; characterization of nano-heteroepitaxial growth of semiconductor thin films; studies of membrane protein unfolding to illuminate factors important to protein stability.  The broader impacts of this proposal are: to enhance a wide collaborative effort spanning physics, chemistry, biochemistry, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and biomedical engineering; to support educational experiences for undergraduate students through our project-based curriculum; to foster synergistic research and educational work in soft-condensed matter/complex fluids; to provide comprehensive educational and mentoring opportunities across a diverse spectrum of undergraduates, graduates, and post-doctoral associates allowing for a significant contribution to the advancement and dissemination of science.",
