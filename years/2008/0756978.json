The SwISTEM Initiative consists of four components: 1) development and implementation of an Early Undergraduate Research Program; 2) formation of the Pathways Leading to Undergraduate Success in the Sciences (PLUSS) Program which offers developmental courses in mathematics and the sciences; 3) an Outreach Program targeting high school students; and,  4) a Professional Development program for pre-college and college faculty. SwISTEM is increasing the number and quality of students selecting STEM majors; providing opportunities to engage students early in hands-on research opportunities; developing a more nurturing and team oriented approach to STEM education; providing enhanced academic and career advising for students majoring in the STEM areas; improving the retention and graduation rates for STEM students; improving the success rates in key introductory mathematics and science courses; providing professional development for regional faculty; and, developing community partnerships to generate additional interest in STEM careers. \r\n\r\n",
