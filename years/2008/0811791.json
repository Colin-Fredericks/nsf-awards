 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing problems of power, heat dissipation, and design\r\ncomplexity have caused a shift in processor technology to favor\r\nmulticore multiprocessors. Along with that shift, the sharing of\r\nmemory hierarchy becomes deeper, heterogeneous and more complex,\r\ncausing cache contention, increased conflicts, and also, synergy\r\nsharing.  Without understanding the implications of this change,\r\ncurrent multicore systems suffer from considerable performance\r\ndegradation, poor performance isolation and inferior fairness\r\nguarantees.  The urgency of these issues increases as the degree of\r\nprocessor-level parallelism increments rapidly.\r\n\r\nPrior studies, mostly in areas of architecture and operating systems,\r\nrely on simple heuristics to estimate cache requirement of corunning\r\nprograms; the inaccuracy and overhead limits their scalability and\r\neffectiveness.  This work tackles these challenges uniquely from the\r\ncompiler aspect by constructing predictive behavior models for\r\ncorunning processes, developing cache-sharing-aware program\r\ntransformations and loop scheduling, and combining the program-level\r\nknowledge of programming systems with the proactive resource\r\nmanagement by runtime systems. Specifically, this work proposes\r\ninclusive reuse signatures to characterize inclusive locality---the\r\nmemory behavior of corunning programs on shared caches, and\r\ninter-thread affinity models to capture data locality among parallel\r\nthreads. It tackles the challenges facing the measurement, prediction\r\nand exploitation of inclusive locality. The analysis opens new\r\nopportunities for shared-cache optimizations by both compilers and\r\nruntime systems.  The PI develops a series of program transformations,\r\nsuch as inter-thread memory reorganization and cache-sharing aware\r\nloop scheduling, to increase inter-thread spacial locality and\r\nameliorate conflicts, contention and false sharing. For runtime\r\nsystems, this work invents proactive cache management which partitions\r\ncaches or schedules processes according to predicted inclusive\r\nlocality proactively, overcoming the limitations of current reactive\r\nschemes on scalability, accuracy and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n",
