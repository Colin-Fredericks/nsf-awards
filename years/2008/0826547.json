 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop a computational design tool for multilevel optimization of hierarchical product-material systems under uncertainty. Through systematic decomposition of computational material models, microstructure-property relationships can be tailored to satisfy competing system-level design goals such as performance, reliability, and robustness. A consistent top-down cascading of requirements and bottom-up propagation of capabilities and uncertainties that span length scales ranging from nano-to-micro, micro-to-meso, and meso-to-macro is desired. Development of advanced metamodels for approximation of cause-effect relationships will enhance the efficiency of the design tool while addressing key optimization concerns related to highly nonlinear and noisy responses. Cyberinfrastructure will be used to integrate the components into a comprehensive tool, effectively forming a virtual organization for multidisciplinary research. The effectiveness of the design tool will be evaluated by investigating a number of benchmark problems.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will enhance modern engineering design methodology by expanding our knowledge of material microstructure design as an integral part of the product design process. This research will provide a platform for the exploration and understanding of interactions among the elements of material microstructure and their sensitivities to external influences (e.g., static or dynamic loading). Moreover, it will result in the development of a sophisticated cyberinfrastructure and associated technologies which will contribute toward the ability to design products with vastly different classes of materials such as advanced lightweight alloys, nanophased fiber-reinforced polymer composites, metal-matrix composites and powder metals. Involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in this research and the integration of related topics into courses in design optimization, aerospace structural design and inelasticity will broaden the impact of the proposed research. Middle and high school students representing different demographics including underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate in the research through summer internship opportunities. The results of the research will be disseminated through publication in archival journals and presentations at national conferences.\r\n",
