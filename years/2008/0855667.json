 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Workshop will be held in Hilton Head, South Carolina - March 2009.  Workshop:  A Workshop on Friction:  A Grand Challenge at the interface of Solid and Fluid Mechanics.  A grand challenge lies in the formulation of unified analysis techniques addressing friction through the momentum/energy transfer and thermal processes leading to the diversion of useful kinetic energy to parasitic processes on atomic to continuum scales, irrespective of the media on either side of the interface.\r\nImproved understanding and modeling of the multiple origins of friction form a vital component of technologies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of human development and transportation, ranging from reduced wear, noise and/or vibration, increased transmission efficiency, turbulent skin friction reduction for increased vehicle efficiency, improved models and control of pollutant dispersion by atmospheric winds in urban ?rough? environments to advanced understanding of environmental physics and climate phenomena such as ice-field development and glacier melting.",
