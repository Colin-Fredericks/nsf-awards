 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award establishes Brigham Young University (BYU) as a research site of the Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (IUCRC) for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing. Other sites of this collaborative research center include the University of Florida (2007) and George Washington University (2007). Reconfigurable computing (RC) technology can be divided into two areas of use: High Performance Computing (HPC) and High Performance Embedded Computing (HPEC). RC technology is used in the field of HPC to accelerate demanding computations that would otherwise be performed in software on a large-scale computing system. RC technology is used in HPEC to create high-performance embedded computing solutions in areas such as signal and image processing, real-time vision, cryptography, and network processing. The mission of this center is to investigate, develop, and evaluate new concepts, methods, infrastructure, and tools in reconfigurable HPC and HPEC, from building-block devices to infrastructure to applications, and advance these technologies through research and education for the benefit of center members, students, and the discipline at large. The research BYU will address; 1) Novel Core Architectures and Related Components for Aerospace & Defense Applications, 2) Application Mapping of HPC Codes to High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Systems, 3) Profiling, Analysis, & Performance Optimization for Reconfigurable Computing Applications, 4) Middleware, Interfaces, & other Infrastructure for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers. \r\n\r\nThe Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing should significantly enhance the U.S. effort to maintain a strong leadership position within their area of information technology. It may also serve to bring industry and users together to define common standards. Industry members, researchers and students will gain from the interactions throughout the life of the research center. This should be a rewarding experience for all as the university has a detailed plan to achieve diversity in working with several minority institutions. Advances in RC affect virtually all disciplines of science and engineering which require high-performance computing, be it mainframe-oriented or embedded. RC technology promises to produce computing systems combining the flexibility of software-programmable computations with the computational power of custom hardware. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFPGA devices applied to high performance computing fill an important and growing niche between custom integrated circuits (micro-chips) on the one hand and programmable processors (CPUs) on the other. Like CPUs, FPGAs are flexible and can be used to perform a variety of different functions.  Also like CPUs they can be rapidly reprogrammed to perform these new computations and functions even after they have been deployed into the field in larger electronics systems.  Like custom integrated circuits, FPGAs provide much higher performance than that achievable using a CPU, a significant advantage in demanding application areas.  However, FPGAs have two significant disadvantages compare to both CPUs and custom integrated circuits.\n\nThe first disadvantage is that creating a new design to run on an FPGA circuit is a very time consuming activity and requires skills very different from those required to do software programming.  These skills are in relatively short supply and require engineers trained in digital circuit design via a degree in either Electrical or Computer Engineering.  The B1 series of projects during Phase I of BYU\u00c6s involvement in CHREC were focused on reducing the design effort (and thus design time) associated with using FPGAs to implement digital systems.  This was done via a series of projects which focused on providing higher level abstractions to elevate the designer above the myriad of circuit details associated with hardware design and to enable the use of CAD tools for performing many of the time consuming tasks associated with hardware design.  The resulting design methods could achieve a 70x reduction in design time and, more importantly, potentially reduce the need for trained hardware engineers as designers.  The impact of this work, then, is that it promises to enable non-hardware engineers (and perhaps software programmers) to make use of FPGA technology in ways never before allowed.\n\nThe second disadvantage of FPGA technology relates to its use in radiation environments (such as might be encountered in space). The B2 and B5 series of projects developed a number of techniques, tools, and approaches to facilitate the reliable operation of reconfigurable systems in space and other harsh environments.
