 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: \r\nThis project aims to explore the application of colloidal compound quantum dots (QDs) for the development of high-efficiency white light emitting diodes (LEDs) for solid state lighting. The conventional, multistep, absorption-\u00acreemission color-conversion scheme in phosphor-based white LEDs will be replaced by non-resonant cavity-enhanced direct energy coupling between colloidal CdSe/(Cd,Zn)S QD-phosphors and electrically-pumped InGaN quantum wells/dots. The goal of this work will be to design and fabricate a new generation of white light sources featuring significantly improved radiation efficiency, high brightness and high color rendering index as well as low manufacturing costs. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThis project offers a synergistic approach to advance the science and technology of nonradiative energy transfer between epitaxially-grown quantum structures with chemically-synthesized colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots. In addition, it provides a platform whereupon emerging QD technologies, including QD-assembled microcavities, engineered core-shell QDs, and mist-patterning of multicolor QDs, will be integrated for the first time for the implementation of a functional photonic system.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe results from this project will find application in next-generation white light sources that will provide great energy savings. Participation by industrial investigators will facilitate the integration of results from this project into commercial products. The project will offer focused research and learning experiences to the graduate and undergraduate student participants, and findings will be integrated into classroom instruction, providing opportunities for students to connect fundamental nanoscience to real-world applications of nanotechnology. New activities will also be created for high school campers.\r\n",
