 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCoastal barrier islands are found along many continental shorelines worldwide, including the heavily populated eastern seaboard and Gulf Coast of the United States.  Coastal barrier islands are very popular areas for residential development but also provide critical protection for adjacent shorelines from high-energy oceanic waves.  They create a variety of shoreline and wetland habitats that support diverse plant and animal assemblages, including migratory birds and commercially important fish species.  Despite the large number of engineering, natural, and social science researchers who conduct research on these ecosystems, no organization currently exists for fostering communication among these researchers and evaluating the future sustainability of these important ecosystems.  The focus of the current project is to develop an interdisciplinary network that will address the effective management of U.S. barrier island ecosystems under the pressures of global climate change (e.g., sea level rise and increased hurricane activity) and continued urbanization.  Through the formation of the Coastal Barrier Island Network (CBIN), scientists and municipal planners will interact through workshops, summer courses for students, a newsletter, and an interactive web site that will emphasize public and educational outreach activities. \r\n\r\nClimate change may have potentially devastating impacts on barrier island ecosystems and the associated socioeconomic and cultural infrastructures of these heavily populated areas.  Predicted increases in sea level and the frequency of intense storms will particularly impact barrier island ecosystems due to their extreme vulnerability to both.  By facilitating communication among barrier island researchers from multiple disciplines, as well as with managers, this project will lead to better understanding and more effective management strategies for protecting barrier islands.  Educational and outreach activities will lead to improved public understanding of the value of barrier islands.\r\n",

This research project was designed most generally to build and coordinate a multidisciplinary network of scientists, management agencies, and stakeholders interested in the future preservation and management of coastal barrier islands of the USA.
