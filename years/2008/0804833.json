 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL: Computational thermodynamics using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) approach is one of the most important tools used in multicomponent alloy design and optimization. Its applications are, however, severely limited by the lack of accurate thermodynamic databases with wide elemental coverage. The rate-limiting step in the development of high-fidelity thermodynamic databases is to acquire substantial experimental data inputs including: (a) all the key ternary phase diagrams; (b) knowledge of crystal structures and zero-dimensional (0D) defects such as ordering, site occupancy, site preference, and compositional point defects (vacancies, interstitials, and anti-sites) in order to develop best thermodynamic models for intermetallic phases; (c) specific heat capacity (CP), heat of formation, and heat of transition of the phases and phase transformations; and (d) magnetic transition temperature and magnetic moments as a function of composition to take into account the magnetic contribution to the Gibbs free energy. This project aims to develop robust, high-throughput tools that will revolutionize the measurements of (c) and (d). The research will extend an emerging micro-scale CP measurement tool to both low and high temperatures to enable localized measurement of CP as a function of temperature. Integration of CP over a phase transition temperature range can be used to evaluate the heat of transition which is another important thermodynamic quantity. The research will also develop accurate, micro-scale measurement tools for magnetic moments using both the magneto-optical Kerr effect and magnetic resonance force microscopy. By using these tools to perform measurements on solid solutions and intermetallic phases formed in diffusion multiples, valuable data such as temperature- and composition-dependent CP and composition-dependent magnetic moment can be obtained with high efficiency and high accuracy without making individual alloys. These data together with phase diagrams and 0D defect information obtained from diffusion multiples can greatly improve the accuracy and accelerate thermodynamic assessments to extend the elemental coverage of thermodynamic databases. The development of the diffusion-multiple technique and micro-scale property mapping tools will fundamentally change the way essential experimental data are gathered for fast establishment of high-fidelity thermodynamic databases. The tremendous amounts of materials property data generated from such measurements would greatly enhance our ability to augment materials design, materials informatics, and understanding of complex materials behaviors. Moreover, the micro-scale tools with mapping capabilities constitute a new suite of materials property microscopy that may become as widely used as SEM, thus reshaping the way experimental materials research is performed in the future. The program will help to training students to use these tools and disseminate the data via web-based tools. NON-TECHNICAL: High-fidelity thermodynamic databases with wide elemental coverage will have a tremendous impact on alloy design by: 1) cutting down the trial-and-error experiments, 2) providing thermodynamic data for kinetic and property modeling, and 3) reducing the long-term exposure experiments that are usually required to test the propensity of alloys against detrimental phase formation. The timely design and insertion of high-performance materials are critical to the global competitiveness of the U.S. economy.",
