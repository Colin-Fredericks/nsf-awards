 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve our understanding of dynamical mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of zonal jets and their implications for atmospheric mixing and transport. The approach is underpinned by the observation that potential vorticity (PV) is a fundamental dynamical quantity that can unify questions of small-scale eddy mixing, wave propagation on jets, and mixing due to wave breaking in their vicinity. In particular, the project will address: (i) fundamental constraints on zonal jets arising from angular momentum conservation (natural, since zonal mean structures such as zonal jets contain most of the atmosphere's angular momentum) and flow stability; (ii) wave dynamics (and associated eddy momentum fluxes) and the role of critical levels; the role also of edge waves propagating on a PV jump in contrast to waves propagating on a smooth background PV gradient; (iii) PV mixing as a route to zonal jet formation, independently of the direction of energy cascade; (iv) tracer mixing and transport and the role of jets as transport barriers; (v) jet evolution and mechanisms of jet merger; (vi) secondary circulations and the development of steep tracer gradients through vertical motions; alignment of tracer and PV gradients. The dynamical processes involved govern zonal structures observed in the terrestrial atmosphere and oceans as well as in the atmospheres of the gas giants. \r\n\r\nThe work will impinge on several areas of climate science, including variability of the mid-latitude storm tracks, subtropical jet, and Arctic oscillation, the hydrological cycle, stratospheric ozone recovery, the dynamical coupling of the stratosphere and troposphere, and transport and mixing across the extratropical tropopause.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has focused on the large-scale circulation patterns of\nthe troposphere and stratosphere---the lowermost fifty kilometers of\nthe atmosphere---where the effects of increasing carbon dioxide\nconcentrations, depleted stratospheric ozone levels, and the complex\ndistribution of water vapor play leading roles in the determination of\nthe climate we live in.  Most of the research has involved an\ninvestigation of the key dynamical processes that control the\nformation and maintenance of the strong, predominantly eastward jets,\nsuch as the tropospheric jet-stream and the winter stratospheric polar\nvortex.  These jets rapidly transport air and trace gases in the\neast-west direction while inhibiting such transport in latitude.\nWhile strong jets inhibit latitudinal transport, they are\nsimultaneously associated with the nearly complete mixing of the air\nmasses that lie between jets; the jets thus separate regions of\nquasi-uniform chemical composition.\n\nThe project has developed our understanding of how the forcing of\natmospheric wave and eddy motions influence the development of these\njets, in particular identifying the conditions that favor the\ndevelopment of strong jets and robust transport barriers.  It was\nfound that strong jets are favored when wave and eddy forcing is in a\ncertain sense weak, a result that is at first sight paradoxical in\nview of the need for complete mixing between jets.  The resolution of\nthe paradox lies in the nature of the inter-jet regions, which are\ndynamically susceptible to mixing, however weak, and in the fact that\nonly weak eddy forcing allows the jet formation processes to proceed\nunhindered.  Two distinct mixing regimes active in the inter-jet\nregions were identified, which arise according to the dominant length\nscales of the forced wave and eddy motions, and which give rise to\ndifferent jet characteristics and distributions.\n\nFinally, the project has revealed important insights into how one jet\nconfiguration may transform into another without a significant change\nin the total energy or angular momentum of the atmosphere as a whole.\nThe possibility of such transitions has important implications for our\nunderstanding of the behavior of the winter stratospheric polar vortex\nand its dynamical signature in the troposphere; the latter is closely\nrelated to the Arctic oscillation and is a key controlling factor in\nmid-latitude weather regimes on seasonal timescales.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard K Scott"
