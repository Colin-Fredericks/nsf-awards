 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Peabody Fellows Earth Science Program is a professional development opportunity for middle school educators that is focused on the interpretation of landforms that result from constructive and destructive geologic forces. The project is producing curriculum resources for wide-spread dissemination, that includes lesson plans, content information, model student assessment instruments, hands-on specimens, and field trip activities. Resource development teachers are working with Museum staff and researchers to produce materials that are both aligned with national and state standards and based on current research and that encourage inquiry-oriented and place-based learning. Through summer institutes and year-round workshops, participating teachers will gain content knowledge in this area, learn how to use the curriculum materials, develop their use of inquiry-oriented and place-based instructional techniques, and increase their use of field sites. The project also has an informal community education component in the form of family event days for Museum visitors and the production of a 'mini-exhibit' for use in outreach programs. Program partners are the two urban public school districts of New Haven and West Haven, and the sixth-year certification program, the 'Institute of Science Instruction and Study' at Southern Connecticut State University. The program is also collaborating with the Connecticut Department of Education.",
