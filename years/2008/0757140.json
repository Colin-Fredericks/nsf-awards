 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interfacing and Integrating Life-Sciences and Solid-Mechanics \r\nDr. Kai-tak Wan, Mechanical Engineering, University of Missouri-Rolla\r\nSolid-mechanics is incorporated into life-sciences to complement the conventional biochemical approach and to open new grounds for engineering research. Investigations in micro-mechanics and micro-structure of artificial, porcine and human eyes and ocular lenses will enhance fundamental understanding and bio-technology development in ophthalmic accommodation mechanics, presbyopia, prosthetic lenses for cataract eyes, retina detachment due to diabetes etc. Mechanical characterization of single cells and thin biomembranes will improve understanding in how cells deform and adhere to form multi-cell aggregate and ultimately 3-dimensional tissues. The work delves into the mechanical aspects of stem cell chondrogenesis, morphogenesis and developmental biology. Theoretical modeling and experimentation will be carried out at various medical schools and hospitals. The trans-disciplinary and inter-institutional project forges collaboration between mechanics and biomedical communities. An education program promotes Life-Science based Solid-Mechanics in engineering and medical schools.  \r\n",
