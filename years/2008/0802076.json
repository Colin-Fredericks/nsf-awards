 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general theme of this project is to investigate methods to create, distribute, and store quantum mechanical states by exploring entanglement between light and matter with ensembles of ultracold atoms. Entanglement, one of the most striking features of quantum mechanics, leads to strong correlations between separate components of a physical system, regardless of the distance separating them.   The first specific goal of the project is to develop methods of creating robust entanglement between light and matter with ensembles of ultracold atoms.  This project builds upon previously realized entanglement of mixed species atomic \"quantum bits\" (called qubits) and frequency-encoded photonic qubits.  The approach avoids the use of two interferometrically separate paths for qubit entanglement distribution.  The second goal is to realize matter-light entanglement at telecommunications wavelengths as an enabling technology to distribute and store entanglement over long distances.  The final component of the program involves investigations of dynamics of the entangled systems subjected to continuous measurement.\r\n\r\nAchieving these goals should significantly develop atomic physics-based methods for the processing of quantum information. The program involves extensive undergraduate and graduate student training and participation in technologically important areas of physics.  The project will include outreach to the Atlanta community through laboratory tours and summer workshops for local high-school teachers.\r\n\r\n",
