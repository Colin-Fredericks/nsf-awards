 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical and economic feasibility of developing residential-scale, variable-speed wind turbines with aeroelastic, thermoplastic composite blades to achieve two key design objectives: improved energy capture in low to medium winds and rotor speed regulation in high winds.  In Phase I, a thermoplastic composite will be developed with biased glass or carbon fibers for optimum coupling coefficient, and cost analysis will determine if meeting both design objectives is feasible for Phase II prototype development.  \r\n\r\nWind energy is the fastest growing power source worldwide, and critical problems with fossil fuel depletion and carbon emissions will likely accelerate this trend.  Although utility-scale wind farms have the leading role, the American Wind Energy Association predicts that 3% of US power needs could be provided by small wind turbines (defined as 100 kW or less) by 2020. The proposed work provides opportunities for individuals with suitable land and wind resources to contribute to the nation's energy security, as well as economically meet power requirements for homes, farms, and small businesses.",
