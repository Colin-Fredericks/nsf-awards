Each topic reaches\r\ninto a broad range of areas in mathematical analysis, and\r\nprogress requires a synthesis of different ideas from both\r\nabstract analysis and applied harmonic analysis, including\r\npseudodifferential operator theory, noncommutative Banach\r\nalgebras, and new forms of multiresolution analysis suitable for\r\ntwo-dimensional and higher signal processing.\r\n\r\n     The problems addressed in this project concern fundamental\r\nquestions regarding the basic mathematical tools that underlie\r\nmodern signal processing, including such applications as wireless\r\ncommunications, radar, seismic sensing, and image processing. \r\nProgress on these topics yields applicable mathematics with\r\npotential impact for real-world scientific and engineering\r\nprograms.  All aspects of this work are intimately tied with\r\neducational endeavors, both at the graduate and undergraduate\r\nlevels.  Students of the investigator cooperate directly in this\r\nresearch, receiving a breadth and depth of knowledge and\r\nexperience that will foster a continued commitment to\r\ncross-disciplinary interactions among mathematics, physics, and\r\nengineering.  Topics related to this project and progress on the\r\nproblems of the project are incorporated into courses and\r\nseminars directed by the investigator.  The investigator\r\ncontinues his strong record of producing graduate students,\r\nworking with undergraduates, mentoring postdocs, producing Ph.D.\r\nstudents from underrepresented groups, and encouraging\r\nunderrepresented groups to pursue research.",
