Suckewer, Princeton University\r\n\r\nObjective: The objective of this proposal is to develop a compact (\"table top\") soft x-ray laser (SXL) at 3.4 nm in transition to ground state of hydrogen-like CVI ions in so called recombination scheme. Such a compact 3.4 nm laser would provide a very useful source for soft X-ray microscopy in application to biological cell studies in 2.3 - 4.4 nm spectral region, the so called \"water window\". \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: One of the main attractions of using the transition to ground state as the lasing transition is its favorable scaling to shorter wavelengths. It is possible to achieve lasing within the ?water window? by using lasers with relatively moderate power at quite high repetition rate as pumps. Recently, our very extensive calculations have shown the feasibility of achieving high gain with the transient recombination scheme in the CVI ions using ultrashort laser pulses with peak intensity in the order of  Ip ~ 1019 Watt/cm2 .\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: A compact 3.4 nm X-ray laser operating at 5 -10 Hz repetition rate will have a number of important applications in biological, physical and chemical studies. It will also open a ?path? to developing future compact X-ray lasers with much shorter wavelengths.\r\n\r\nEducational Benefits: The proposed research provides an excellent opportunity for teaching and training graduate students, and also for very advanced undergraduate students, in the areas of basic laser and plasma theory and experiments. The excitements arise from the potential of working with unusually high laser intensities and ultrashort pulses.\r\n\r\n",
