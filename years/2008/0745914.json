 "awd_abstract_narration": "To facilitate linguistic communications, natural language processing (NLP) technologies must be applicable to different languages across different domains.  A limitation of many NLP systems is that they do not perform as well on data types that diverge from their training examples. The objective of this CAREER project is to increase the robustness and coverage of a fundamental NLP component, the syntactic parser.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project explores adaptation methods to extend  a standard English parser for processing different domains (e.g., scientific literature, emails) and different languages (e.g., Chinese).  Three types of correspondences are considered. First, if coarse-level correspondences are explicit in the data (e.g., bilingual documents), finer-grained correspondences at the word- or phrasal-level may be inferred, and semi-supervised learning may be used to transfer domain knowledge across the inferred correspondence.\r\nSecond, if the correspondences are inexact (e.g., multiple translations of varying quality), the mis-matched portions may be identified and transformed to achieve a closer mapping.  Third, if the correspondences are indirect, methods for inducing correspondences from non-parallel corpora may be appropriate.\r\n\r\nParser adaptation stands to increase the range of NLP applications; examples include: data mining from medical documents and automatic tutoring for non-English speakers.  As the project aims to bring together several strands of research, it offers ample research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.  The algorithmic aspects encourage forming synthesis from areas of semi-supervised learning, relational data modeling, grammar induction, and machine translation; the empirical aspects afford students an arena to hone their skills in good scientific methodologies.\r\n",

While advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to high quality parsers for processing standard newspaper English, computer systems face substantial obstacles when processing sentences from more diverse sources, including the writings of English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) learners, informal blurbs made in social media, writings from specialized domains such as legal documents and scientific literatures, and computer-generated sentences such as the outputs of machine translation (MT) systems. The main problem is that these sentences diverge significantly from the example sentences used to develop the system. This project addresses the problem by framing it as a machine translation task: how should we model the relationship between a wider population of English expressions and \"newspaper\" sentences?&nbsp;The investigation of this project has especially focused on two domains: the writings of ESL learners, which often contain grammar mistakes and usage errors, and the outputs of MT systems, which often contain a wider variety of garbled phrases and disfluencies than ESL learners.
