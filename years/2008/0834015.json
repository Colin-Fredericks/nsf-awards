Among its recent studies is the widely publicized \"Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future\", which has since helped to focus renewed attention on science and technology as a driver for U.S. competitiveness in the global economy.  Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities.  This award will provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work as an independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology policy.",
