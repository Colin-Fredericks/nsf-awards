 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a 3 year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of Pittsburgh entitled, \"Connecting Research and Teaching Through Product Realization: The Pittsburgh Quality of Life RET Site,\" under the direction of Dr. Michael Lovell.\r\n\r\nThis program is a renewal of a successful RET Site, which retains the best elements of the existing RET, integrates new elements of best practicces observed in other RET programs, and embraces a new Quality of Life (QoL) engineering research theme. A total of 33 high school science teachers (11 per year for three years) will be recruited from high needs urban high schools in the Pittsburgh area.  They will spend 8 weeks in the summer working in engineering labs performing fundamental scientific research and then translate that research into innovative products, involving topics related to Quality of Life Technology.  The major research thrust in the QoL theme will focus on innovations in computation, robotics, machine learning, communication, and miniaturization technologies that transform the lives of people with reduced functional capabilities.  Other program activities will include redesigning design-based-learning (DBL) units that will be implemented in their classrooms, workshops and classroom visits by faculty mentors.\r\n\r\nThe site will directly impact 33 teachers and 4,500 students from high need urban high schools in the Pittsburgh region, with a particular focus on high schools comprised almost entirely of minority and low socio-economic status students.  By focusing on QoL, the RET Site will improve awareness and develop technology for a growing segment of the population that is often overlooked--people with reduced functional capabilities due to aging or disability.\r\n",
