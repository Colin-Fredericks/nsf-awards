 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Partnership Implementing Mathematics & Science Education (PIMSE) project is to promote the development of graduate students into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professionals whose knowledge and skills will support them in their professional and scientific careers. This project provides computer science graduate students -- GK-12 Fellows -- with teaching experience in science or math by being involved in developing and testing the ASSISTment System -- a web-based intelligent tutoring system (http://www.assistment.org/). As part of their Fellowship, GK-12 Fellows are paired with participating GK12 teachers the Worcester Public Schools (WPS) to develop new content for the ASSISTment System. This System innovatively uses the amount of tutoring a student needs to answer questions as an assessment of their understanding of mathematics and science. The students working with the Fellows will learn about implementing technology and how to conduct Learning Sciences experiments in classrooms. The cooperating teachers will increase their content knowledge, and this will contribute to their professional growth. Society will gain by having more scientists and academicians who have a deep understanding of the challenges and needs of public schools. Finally, the inquiry tutoring that the Fellows develop will be available to all middle schools students via the ASSISTment web-site. Special web-site based tools will be available for teachers on the best ways to use the data derived from the ASSISTment System and how to use it to improve their teaching.",

In addition to building an infrastructure to do scientific research, we have ourselves used that infrasture to contribute dozens of scientific publications to the literature.  These publications can broadly be categorized as one of two types.  First, there are the randomized controlled trials where we compare two instructional strategies, to see which is better.  For instance, are video hints better than text hints  (where the content of the tutoring messages are the exact same and differ only by their presentation in a YouTube video or HTML text).  We have reported about a dozen of these studies, and GK12 fellows helped in many of them.\nThe second type of studies can be called \"data mining\" studies or the reporting of novel ways of using educational data to predict things that matter.  For instance, can we better predict students\u00c6 knowledge if we use what we call the \"Prior Per Student\" model.  The answer was \"yes!, we can!).  Over 30 such papers were produce..."
