Partners include PBS (Southern Oregon Public Television - SOPTV), Interstellar Studios, Leading astronomers and science writers, and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP)and two of the United States' premier planetariums: Carnegie Science Center (Buhl Planetarium) and 'Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawai'i.  Deliverables include a two-hour, high-definition documentary, airing twice on PBS in 2009, as a kick-off to the International Year of Astronomy (IYA2009), a full-dome and traditional 30 minute planetarium program available in 12 foreign languages, with free national and international distribution to 750 planetariums; a Website, and Community Events providing personalized telescopic experiences via events on site at science centers nationwide.  The evaluator is the Institute for Learning Innovation.",

The project\u00c6s goal was to engage the public in astronomy using a menu of linked choices to participate in observational astronomy.  \n\nProject Partners\n\n Interstellar Studios,\n\nSouthern Oregon Public Television,\n\nI\u00c6miloa Planetarium in Hawai\u00c6i,\n\nTthe Buhl Planetarium in Pittsburgh,\n\n and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.\n\nThe Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI)  served as the project evaluator.\n\n \n\n Media-centered deliverables were linked with activity-centered choices to create awareness, attract interest and educate the public about achievements in astronomy and other sciences made possible through the use of a telescope. The project  included 5 components:\n\nMedia-Centered \n\n1.  A one-hour PBS documentary titled \"400 Years of the Telescope\"\n\n2.  A 22-minute planetarium program titled \"Two Small Pieces of         Glass\" (in full dome and  traditional dome formats) available in 22 languages.\n\n3.  A website www.400years.org  providing individual investigations in astronomy and telescope.\n\nActivity-Centered \n\n4. \"Star parties\" (night time astronomical viewing events)\n\n5. Promotional events hosted by PBS affiliate stations at key planetaria and science centers\n\nIntellectual Merit from Summative Evaluation\n\nAn evaluation was conducted for the project that showed a number of positive results for the 400 Years of the Telescope project. Almost one-third of those who participated engaged in more than one of the activities, and there was evidence that the different activities attracted somewhat different audiences, which allowed for a more diverse audience to participate in the project than if there had only been a single type of activity.\n\nThere were a series of outcomes examined in the evaluation, including whether participants learned about astronomy or science, were more interested or engaged in astronomy, and feeling awe or being inspired by the project components.

Furthermore, the more components someone engaged with the higher were many of the main outcomes, including being more interested in learning more about astronomy and being inspired to look up at the night sky. Overall, the evaluation showed that offering multiple components for people to engage in did in fact help the project be more successful in reaching its outcomes.\n\n \n\nBroad Impacts \n\nThe 400 Years of the Telescope Project partnership sought to increase knowledge of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), develop a new approach to engaging people in Informal Science Education (ISE), reach underserved populations, encourage people to use a telescope to explore the universe and support the overall goals of the International Year of Astronomy.\n\nWithin in grant period, the hour-long television documentary was available to 99% of U.S. TV households and was viewed by an estimated 6+ million households through 4 PBS primetime broadcasts.  A 5th national primetime broadcast is scheduled for November 2011.  These figures do not include viewership on public televis..."
