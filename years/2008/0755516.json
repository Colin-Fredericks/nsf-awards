Malki\r\n\r\nThis 10 week REU site will provide interdisciplinary research experiences for undergraduates focused in the areas of sensor networks and security infrastructure.  The REU students will be mentored and guided by highly qualified professors and supported by state-of-the-art laboratories.  The research projects will yield many contributions to the next generation security infrastructure based on integration of sensor networks and existing networked supercomputers, workstations, and cameras.  \r\n\r\nIn order to enhance the hands-on laboratory research experience, a variety of professional development activities have been incorporated.  These include: weekly seminars on research methods, intellectual property, research ethics, project management, and other relevant topics and field trips to high-tech companies and research institutions in the Houston area.\r\n\r\nNationwide recruitment efforts will be targeted to undergraduate students from other colleges and universities with high minority enrollments as well as those that offer limited research opportunities.  Special efforts will be devoted to recruit first-generation-in-college students from underrepresented groups. The involvement of these students in exciting research in sensor networks and security infrastructure enhances the likelihood that they will consider post-graduate study and broaden the base of the Nation's technical manpower.\r\n\r\n\"The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\"\r\n.\r\n",
