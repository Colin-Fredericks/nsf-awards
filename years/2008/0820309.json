 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC) will focus on research and action on social, psychological, and educational development among African American children and youth.  The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities. \r\n\r\nThe CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report for the General Public\n\nThis grant supported the development of the Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC), an interdisciplinary research center aimed at understanding normative development in Black youth across different social contexts.  The principle Investigators have backgrounds in Psychology, Sociology, and Education and the faculty affiliates of the center have appointments in many units across campus, including Public Health, Social Work, African American Studies, and Kinesiology.  CSBYC had three primary aims.  First, we developed a research project examining the school experiences of an economically diverse group of African American youth in 3 suburban school districts.  Second, we developed a training program to support the development of undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students, most of whom were students of color.  Third, we engaged in outreach to the school districts with whom we partnered in the research as well as other local schools.\n\nThe Three Districts research project was aimed at learning about African American students\u00c6 developing racial identity, academic motivation, and psychological well-being.  The investigators chose to focus on positive outcomes and normative development to counter the preponderance of research on African Americans focusing on low-income, inner-city youth and problem behavior.  Although African American youth experience more negative outcomes than youth of other backgrounds, the dearth of information on positive outcomes reinforces negative stereotypes and leaves the research community with few avenues for intervention.  A key objective was to describe the ways in which social contextual factors such as experiences of racial discrimination, school-level variables, and parenting influence development.  The youth in our sample started out in grades 7 through 9 and were followed for one to 3 years with an annual survey.  A subset of youth and their parents also completed a survey daily for 21 days so that we could examine how daily experiences with racial discrimination, race-related discussions, and school successes and failures related to their academic engagement and psychological well-being.  This strategy allows us to examine how a positive school-related experience (e.g., performing well on a test) relates to mood and engagement on the next day and for several days after.  To get a sense of the varied experiences of African American youth in schools with different racial and economic compositions, we also conducted one-on-one interviews and focus groups with students, teachers, parents and administrators.  These activities produced methodologically varied and rich data for understanding a plethora of factors in the healthy development of African American youth.\n\nOur training program sought to provide a foundation for students at all levels to receive high quality training in research methods (qualitative and quantitative), scientific writing, and other aspects of professional development (e.g., job search, professional networking).  This included a monthly seminar series where local, national, and international experts came to share their research results and expertise and many workshops where experts from within the university and outside taught students how do analyze data, collaborate effectively, and how to work in communities of color. While targeting CSBYC-affiliated students, these workshops were open to others in our departments.  In total, our training program reached 7 post-doctoral scholars, more than 30 doctoral students, and numerous undergraduate students.  Nearly all CSBYC post-doctoral scholars are currently in tenure track faculty positions.  All doctoral students have found employment in post-doctoral fellowships or faculty positions since graduation.   \n\nOne of the most important activities of CSBYC has been dissemination of results and outreach to our partners.  For example, CSBYC staff used results from the ..."
