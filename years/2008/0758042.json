 "awd_abstract_narration": "Further development and application of a cross-discipline theoretical framework for\r\ntwo-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems is proposed. The theory, the\r\nmultiscale quantum-defect theory, asserts that universal properties exist at different\r\nlength scales for such systems, and provides methods to uncover and study them.\r\nIt has been developed by the P.I. over the past few years, and has been demonstrated\r\nexplicitly for two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom quantum systems. The proposed\r\nresearch is expected to lead to the development of a new theoretical framework for\r\nstudying strongly-coupled many-atom quantum systems and highly excited clusters,\r\nincluding a first microscopic quantum theory of liquids that goes beyond the liquid\r\nhelium. It is also expected to lead to much improved understanding of fundamental\r\natomic and molecular processes that include, e.g., the interaction and scattering of polar\r\nmolecules and the Feshbach resonances in nonzero partial waves in\r\nultracold atomic interactions.",
