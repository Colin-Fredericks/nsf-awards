 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal extends current research in creating a query language\r\nfor provenance to a broad range of application domains by designing,\r\ndeveloping, and evaluating a general-purpose query language for\r\ngraph-oriented data.\r\n\r\nPQL, the path query language, was designed to address the challenges\r\nencountered in expressing queries on provenance or lineage data,\r\nbut it was conceived to be the foundation for a general purpose\r\ndata model and query language for manipulating any type of\r\ngraph-oriented data.  Graph-oriented data arises in many disciplines\r\nincluding computer networking, information retrieval, biology, web\r\nsearch, social networking, genealogy, etc.  A characteristic that\r\nunites all these domains is that need for expressing queries on\r\npaths through a graph.  Most existing solutions today have either\r\na weak or non-existent notion of paths as first-class entities that\r\ncan be named, compared, manipulated and constructed.  PQL addresses\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\nDerived from the semi-structured database language, Lorel, PQL\r\noperates on semi-structured data, which can be viewed as a collection\r\nof objects linked together.  In PQL, these links are unidirectional,\r\nalthough we support both forward and backward queries across these\r\nlinks.  Queries are expressed by selecting and filtering one or\r\nmore paths in the graph, where paths can be described by regular\r\nexpressions.  Thus, in the provenance domain, one can talk about,\r\n''all paths in the graph between invocations of a compiler and the\r\nresulting executables.'' In biology, one might pose a query about,\r\n''all paths from a particular combination of gene expressions to\r\nresulting insulin production.''\r\n\r\nThe work described in this proposal extends PQL to include update\r\nsyntax and semantics and the ability to produce query results that\r\nare graphs constructed from components of the original.  The result\r\nof this work will be captured in both a machine-checkable formal\r\nspecification of the language and an open source PQL implementation,\r\ncomplete with a (replaceable) back-end implementation.\r\n\r\nFurther information on the project can\tbe found at the project web page:\r\nhttp://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~syrah/pass/\r\n",
