 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project applies renewable solar thermal energy as a novel way to provide the necessary energy for biomass gasification and will develop the science required to engineer an efficient solar biomass-to-hydrogen conversion facility.  Central to this innovation is the use of a reduced oxide intermediate to chemically store solar energy in a solid, allowing continuous hydrogen generation when the sun is not shining.  The operating conditions necessary to achieve economically viable conversion of biomass resources to hydrogen will be determined through in-depth study \"on-sun\" and in the laboratory of heat transfer, reaction rates, and rate controls.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project provides a bridge between solar energy and biomass to surmount many of the challenges associated with conventional biomass processing technologies.  The high temperatures available from solar thermal systems allow for high conversion and selectivity, maximizing utility of the valuable biomass resource and extending its ability to replace conventional fossil fuels.  Use of a reduced metal oxide stretches the applicability of solar energy beyond the daylight hours.  Combined use of solar energy with biomass has a larger potential than either renewable resource alone to provide renewable fuels for the future.",
