Ozsvath\r\n\r\nLow-dimensional topology is undergoing a revolution thanks to an\r\ninfusion of new techniques from other areas, including\r\nmathematical physics, representation theory, holomorphic curve\r\ntheory, analysis, and algebraic geometry. This fusion of\r\ntechniques has led to an explosion of results and also new\r\navenues of research.  Examples of this include Perelman's recent\r\nproof of the Poincare conjecture using methods from geometric\r\nanalysis; Donaldson's gauge theory approach to construct\r\ninvariants for smooth four-manifolds, and the subsequent\r\ndiscovery of the Seiberg-Witten equations; invariants of three\r\nand four-manifolds defined via holomorphic curves; the quantum\r\npolynomial invariants for knots and, more recently, their\r\ncategorifications.  This project aims to train the next\r\ngeneration of researchers in these exciting and vibrant subjects,\r\nincluding graduate students and postdocs; and also to widely\r\ndisseminate the latest discoveries in these fields.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this proposal is to stimulate the research training\r\nenvironment at Columbia University in the new developments in\r\nlow-dimensional topology and geometry. Many of these developments\r\nhave been pioneered by faculty at Columbia. The objectives of\r\nthis program are: (i) to increase the number of undergraduates\r\nwho will pursue graduate studies in this exciting and active area\r\nof mathematics, and to ensure that their training equips them\r\nwell for graduate studies; (ii) to broaden and strengthen the\r\nresearch background of the graduate students at Columbia, so that\r\nthey are better equipped to fulfill their research potential, and\r\ncontribute meaningfully to this rapidly-changing subject; (iii)\r\nto prepare the postdoctoral associates for more independent\r\nresearch in this area; (iv) to foster communication among all\r\nstrata in the research group at Columbia, and in fact to train\r\nthe associated students and postdocs in expository skills,\r\nteaching, and research; and (v) to foster the dissemination of\r\nknowledge in this field from Columbia University to the wider\r\nmathematical community.\r\n\r\n",
