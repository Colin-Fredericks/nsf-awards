Minority Serving Institutions play an important role in teacher preparation and development.  Partnerships between these Institutions and school districts through the MSP program could substantially enhance the quality of education in the schools which serve proportionally high percentages of minority students.   These workshops will help the MSP program at NSF achieve its goal of diversifying its awardees and the children served by them.",
