 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n \"Analytic Geometry and Representation Theory\" by J.M. Landsberg & C.\r\n Robles.  This project  will make significant progress on problems  originating in geometry and theoretical  computer science. Each of the questions will be approached using  techniques that lie on the interface of 3 areas of mathematics:  differential  geometry (submanifolds, exterior differential systems),  algebraic geometry (projective varieties, geometric aspects of commutative\r\n algebra) and representation theory (orbit closures, Lie algebra cohomology,  invariant theory).  We emphasize that this synthesis yields a  cross-pollination that significantly increases the richness, value an  influence of the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Landsberg and Robles will continue work related to (1) the Hwang-Mok  program on Fano varieties in algebraic geometry, (2) the  P = NP? problem in  complexity theory, and (3) the geometric structure of orbits in  representation theory.  These seemingly disparate projects are unified by  the Principle Investigators' approach.  In each case there is an underlying  differential geometry of lines on (and osculating to) a projective variety.\r\n  A through understanding of this geometry will deepen our understanding of  (and in some cases solve) these problems.  This geometry is studied via  techniques drawn from differential geometry, algebraic geometry and  representation theory.  While the geometric and representation theoretic  tools used  are classical, the implementation and resulting applications are  innovative and originated with the principal investigators. Additional  projects include: (1) A study of varieties in spaces of tensors.  This work  draws on geometry and representation theory, and will have applications to  statistics, computer science and complexity theory. (2) Calibrated  geometries.  Not only an active area of research in mathematics, these  geometries are of interest to physicists as components of string theory  models.  (3) The construction of compact G2-manifolds.\r\n",
