Varadhan\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the conference will be important recent results\r\nand outstanding problems in the fields of representation theory\r\nof finite and infinite dimensional Lie and super-Lie groups, and\r\nits applications to quantum computing, geometry, physics, and\r\ndifferential equations, the different areas being unified under\r\nthe over-arching theme of symmetry manifested in geometric\r\nactions of groups and their representations. The speakers will be\r\ninternationally recognized researchers in these fields and the\r\naudience is expected to be a mixture of senior researchers in\r\nthese fields together with advanced graduate students, postdocs\r\nand junior faculty who aspire to make or already are making\r\nimportant contributions to these fields. There will be travel\r\nfunds made available to select participants of the latter group\r\nwith a special emphasis on women and underrepresented\r\nminorities. It should be pointed out that four of the twelve\r\nspeakers are women. The background to the conference consists of\r\nthe work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as\r\nZumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the\r\nwork of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought\r\nfocus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications\r\nto quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point\r\nof view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic\r\ndifferential equations and their moduli. Very recently important\r\nnew progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric\r\nMackey theory and its applications to super particle\r\nclassification, by work on differential Galois group theory of\r\ndifference equations, and by the work on the foundations of\r\nsuper-geometry.\r\n\r\nSymmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in\r\nboth mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains\r\nthe mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as\r\nwhy hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of\r\nsymmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with\r\nwire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes\r\nback onto itself although the molecules of the wire have\r\nmoved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it\r\nthe fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of\r\nthe wire come back to where they started. In mathematical\r\nlanguage this says that &#147;the cyclic group of order 4&#148; is\r\nthe symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion\r\nof symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain\r\ncomplicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve\r\nfundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as\r\ncryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference\r\nare part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is\r\nthe theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of\r\nsub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will\r\nspeak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical\r\nhypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits\r\nexperimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the\r\nEuropean Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its\r\nmulti-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008\r\nto experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

This award is funded jointly by the\r\nprograms in Geometric Analysis, Probability, and Algebra, Number\r\nTheory, and Combinatorics.",
