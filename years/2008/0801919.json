The center conducts research and develops integrated solutions for logistics and distribution problems.   Virginia Tech enhances CELDi expertise in logistic systems, supply chain design, and material flow analysis.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research projects are shared among all center members and eventually in the research literature.  The direction of the research is influenced by industry members and conducted by some of the most talented faculty and students in the country.  The research results from CELDi impact industry operations directly, provide improved approaches for practitioners who see the research results at conferences and in publications, and extend the general body of knowledge in logistics and distribution.\r\n",
