 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will fund the travel expenses of ten new scholars from the United States to attend one of two pre-conference workshops at the biennial meeting of the International Society for the Study of Behavioural Development (ISSBD), held in Wurzburg, Germany, July 12-17, 2008.  The workshops are intended for both learning and forming international research collaborations.  Funds for the workshops will also provide the scholars with the opportunity to attend the ISSBD meeting itself, a major international conference.  The scholars, chosen by a committee through an intense competition process, include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and new faculty.  The workshops are held for early career researchers from around the world and cover two important and growing fields of study: Child/youth victimization and developmental socio-cognitive neuroscience.  \r\n\r\nAttendance at the workshops and conference will have a substantial impact on the training of these early career researchers, as they will have the opportunity to learn theories, recent findings, and methodology from top scholars around the world.  Perhaps more importantly, international collaborations in the field of child development research will be facilitated by giving these scholars the opportunity to meet and have intellectual exchanges with others working in overlapping areas of developmental science.",
