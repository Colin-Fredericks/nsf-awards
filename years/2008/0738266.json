 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a continuous flow, fixed-bed heterogeneous catalytic system for production of cost-competitive biodiesel from fish oil. Alaska's fisheries are experiencing a high diesel fuel cost for fishing vessels and boats, while a significant amount of fish oil is discarded from fish processing plants. Converting the low-value fish oil to biodiesel is an environmental friendly solution. The commercially available homogeneous alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production technology is an energy and labor-intensive process, resulting in high processing costs. The proposed technology offers an environmentally friendly process at a reduction of the current costs.\r\n\r\nThe commercial potential of this project will create a value-added and profitable market for fish oil, reduce damage to the marine environment resulting from disposal of fish waste products, and provide Alaska with a renewable fuel that will in turn reduce diesel emissions and fuel costs for remote communities and fisheries.",
