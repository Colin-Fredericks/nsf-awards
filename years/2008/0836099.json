 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the focus on evidence-based explanations is prevalent in the science education research literature, few concrete examples exist of what this inquiry practice looks like when successfully implemented in the classroom.   The  co-PIs have developed the middle school comprehensive science curriculum,  Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology (IQWST), which emphasizes scientific explanation and argument through out.  Based on the workshops with the teachers testing IQWST and the research accompanying that development, a book linking current science education research to classroom practice is to be written and tested.  The book provides concrete written and video examples of student explanations and arguments, along with accompanying professional development facilitator materials.  The examples include a variety of different contexts in terms of content and diversity of students.  Teachers are supported in incorporating various instructional strategies in their own teaching.  The framework of claim, evidence, reasoning and rebuttal is made explicit for both teachers and students.  These materials take the theoretical ideas and illustrate what they look like in actual classroom practice to educate inservice and preservice teachers, teacher educators and professional development providers.  In addition, research is done with twenty-five teachers to determine the impact of the materials on teachers' beliefs and classroom practice around scientific explanation.  \r\n\r\n",
