 "awd_abstract_narration": "To function properly the cell must maintain a certain level of fidelity in all processes dealing with the transfer of genetic information. Translation is the process by which genetic information is transferred from a nucleic acid sequence into the amino acid sequence of a protein. The fidelity of translation is determined at two major points: the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNA selection by the ribosomes and synthesis of cognate amino acid/tRNA pairs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in the course of the aminoacylation reaction. The aaRSs define the genetic code by pairing tRNAs with the corresponding amino acids. Accurate aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis often requires an additional editing activity intrinsic to many aaRSs. Editing significantly decreases the frequency of mistakes during aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in vitro, although many details of the reaction mechanism and the impact of editing on the living cell remain unclear. The goals of this project are to use phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) as a model system to clarify the molecular mechanisms of editing, and to investigate the physiological role of editing in the cell. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be to provide integrated laboratory research and training programs for both undergraduate and graduate students including members of historically underrepresented minorities, and to provide laboratory training and education experiences for middle and high school teachers and their students.",
