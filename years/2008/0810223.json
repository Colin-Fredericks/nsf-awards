  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nPhase transitions in materials, involving dramatic changes in properties as temperature or applied fields change, are central to many areas of physics, and we evolved an active research program employing sophisticated, novel, computer algorithms to investigate such behavior.  Even today\u00c6s impressive computers are inadequate to simulate complex models that faithfully represent physical systems; hence, we emphasize simple models that retain essential features of phase transitions.  Our research, described (incompletely) below, was featured in 24 Invited Lectures at National and International Conferences and 26 Invited Seminars at universities and research institutes.  \nIn the simplest view of magnetism, magnetic moments reside on the sites of a rigid lattice.  While useful for theory, this view is unrealistic so we have performed Monte Carlo (stochastic) simulations of distortable nets.  By varying the nature of the \"springs\" connecting the moments, we determined that the growth of magnetic \"domains\" (regions with aligned moments) changes once the lattice restriction is removed.  This contrasts with the prevailing Lifshitz-Slyozov theory of domain growth and emphasizes the value of sophisticated computer simulations.\nThe study of wetting of surfaces by a fluid has a long, controversial history in which the interplay between theory and computer simulations played a valuable role.  Theory predicted non-universal critical wetting disagreeing with both Monte Carlo simulations and experiment.  New predictions of \"non-local correlations\" between the surface and interface change theoretical behavior.  We performed the first test of these predictions, measuring non-local correlations using Monte Carlo simulations and finding a new, non-local correlation length &xi;NL. \n\n\n Polymers are long-chain molecules with increasing technological and theoretical importance.  Many polymers are modeled by chains of beads connected by springs.  The collapse of several \"bead-spring homopolymer\" versions was observed by others using a powerful method known as Wang-Landau sampling (developed in our group); but to resolve conflicting results we performed careful Wang-Landau simulations of bead-spring homopolymers, including special trial moves to help undo knots.  The low energy behavior was extracted using state-of-the-art \"frontier sampling\" (developed in our group), revealing coil-globule and liquid-\"solid\" transitions.  Certain \"magic number\" lengths showed unique tetrahedral geometries, and low temperature behavior near the liquid-solid transition is rich in structural transformations.  Including chain \"stiffness\" produced a complete phase diagram.\nThe HP lattice protein model is a minimalistic description whose solution is nonetheless forbidding.  Wang-Landau sampling combined with suitable trial moves found both the ground state search and the density of states. Thermodynamic properties and \"snapshots\" of structures showed two stage folding:  first a \"coil-globule\" transition occurs and then the globule rearranges to form a hydrophobic core.  We found NO low temperature specific heat peak seen in a benchmark sequence by another group.  Our procedure overcomes the limitations inherent in more tailored and elaborate approaches making it broadly applicable, e.g. to complex biological phenomena.  \nSimple checkerboard-like models have enhanced our understanding of adsorbed gas atoms/molecules on crystalline substrates, but not with competing two-body and three-body terms.  We simulated such models using GPUs (graphics processing units).  Dramatic finite size effects obscured  almost convergent phase boundaries between different phases:  Small lattice specific heats showed minima whereas with increasing size eventually maxima appeared, signifying phase transitions.  Simulations on a nVidia GeForce GTX285 graphics card were 320 times faster than an IBM p655 processor!   \nUsing innovative Monte Carlo sampling with \"weathervane\" trial moves and high-pr..."
