 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fostering Mathematics Success of English Language Learners (ELLs), a 4-year DR-K12 project, is an efficacy study of the Fostering Geometrical Thinking Toolkit (FGTT) previously developed with NSF support.  FGTT is a 40-hour professional development intervention focusing on properties of geometric figures, geometric transformations, and measurement of length, area, and volume. The study addresses four research questions, three examining participating teachers and one examining the impact of teachers' professional development on ELL students.  It tests the hypothesis that geometric problem solving invites diagramming, drawing, use of colloquial language, and gesturing to complement mathematical communication and affords teachers opportunities to support ELL learning. The research design uses a randomized block design, with 25 pairs of professional development facilitators matched according to their district?s demographic information.",
