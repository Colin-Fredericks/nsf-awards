In addition, we plan to invite some of the younger members of the faculty, who will present posters highlighting their work.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThis conference is being sponsored by SRC-SIA, NSF, IMEC, JEITA-JSI, and several European and Asian companies It will feature invited speakers and poster presenters from industry, academia, and government who will describe how to ?foster communication and cooperation on nanotechnology subjects among the organizers, sponsors and the world scientific community to stimulate and support economic growth in the 21st century.\"\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nElectronics technology has been highly leveraged and has been the major enabler of the computer, communication and consumer industries in the last 60 years, and has propelled the growth of the global economy to multi-trillion dollars. Most of the building blocks of these industries will reach fundamental limits by the end of the next decade. It is of fundamental importance that these limits are overcome in the next 10 years, perhaps through the use of nanotechnology. Global senior researchers, industry leaders and policy makers from North America, Europe and Asia will hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanoscience, along with opportunities for collaboration \r\n\r\n\r\n",
