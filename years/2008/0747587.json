The control of quantum properties of nanoscale materials has led to the appearance of new emerging technologies, such as quantum information and computation processes. This CAREER project will advance knowledge of the quantum dynamics of solid-state molecular magnets. These systems have great potential for ultra-high density integration on devices and for quantum information processing. A strong effort will be focused on developing a substantial educational and outreach program synergistically with the research component of this project. For this, a new course to present recent fundamental advances in nanoscience with a large impact on emerging technologies will be developed and offered to undergraduate and graduate students at UCF. The research proposed in this CAREER project will involve several graduate and undergraduate students, who will benefit from the sophistication and interdisciplinary nature of the studies. In addition, a website designed to attract the attention of high school students and the general public to the advances in nanoscience related to the research carried out under this CAREER award will be created, with a special interest in addressing those research topics that will affect the day-to-day life of future generations.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThe research component of this Early Faculty CAREER project is to study the quantum dynamics of the spin of molecular nanomagnets in their solid-state form through the analysis of time-resolved magnetization and EPR spectroscopy in the presence of pulsed microwave radiation. Novel high-efficiency microstrip resonators integrated with micro-Hall-effect magnetometers in a chip will be developed for this purpose. The objectives of these studies are to improve the understanding of longitudinal and transverse relaxation processes of high-spin quantum superposition states of molecular magnets and to manipulate the spin of the molecules inducing Rabi oscillations of the magnetization to determine the decoherence time of these systems under a broad range of experimental conditions. A strong effort will be focused in developing a substantial educational and outreach program synergistically with the research component of this CAREER project. For this, a new course to present current research advances in quantum nanomagnetism to undergraduate and graduate students of the Physics Department at UCF will be developed. In addition, undergraduate students, primarily from the Florida's Hispanic population, will be involved in the studies as summer research assistants. Moreover, a website will be developed and designed to attract the attention of high school students and the general public to the advances in nanoscience related to the research carried out under this CAREER award.\r\n",
