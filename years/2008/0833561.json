 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"RDE-RAD: Collaborative Research: Ohio's STEM Ability Alliance (OSAA): STEM Degrees and Careers for Ohioans with Disabilities\" will increase the quantity and quality of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines and their entry into the STEM workforce. This collaborative project includes the following partners: Wright State University, the Ohio State University, Sinclair Community College, Columbus State Community College and numerous high schools in the Dayton and Columbus regions of Ohio. The overarching objective of the project is to increase the number of students with disabilities entering and completing receiving postsecondary and graduate degree programs in STEM and transitioning to the STEM workforce. The program will pursue the following three specific quantitative goals:\r\n\r\nGoal 1: Recruitment to STEM College Majors. Recruit 225 students with disabilities to OSAA programming in STEM majors at combined alliance university and community college partner institutions by the end of the project award period.\r\n\r\nGoal 2: Retention in STEM Majors and Graduation. Retain students participating in OSAA college level programming in STEM majors at a year-to-year persistence rate of 70%, or better; and award STEM degrees to a minimum of 70% of OSAA students who complete 4+ years of postsecondary study (2+ years for associates degree programs).\r\n\r\nGoal 3: Transition to the STEM Workforce or STEM Graduate Programs. Transition 50% or more OSAA STEM graduates to employment or graduate degree training in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nEvaluation for this collaborative project is provided by Dr. Thomas McKlin and associates of SageFox Consulting Group.  Dissemination of project deliverables and reports will focus on institutions in the Ohio region and on sharing the intervention model with a national post-secondary audience via a web-based diffusion portal, presentations at national conferences and publications in professional journals.",
