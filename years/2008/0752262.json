 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jeffrey W. Mantz (George Mason University) and Dr. James H. Smith (University of\r\nCalifornia, Davis) will collaborate in research on the economic, political, and social\r\nconsequences of columbite-tantalite mining in the Kivu provinces of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. From 1998 until 2003, this region was ground zero for what is\r\nwidely referred to as Africa's first \"world war,\" a conflict that pitted eight African nations\r\nagainst one another, and which has thus far cost the lives of over four million people. At\r\nthe center of this conflict was a unique ore,columbite-tantalite or, as it is known in Africa,\r\ncoltan. Coltan is an electrical current conductor used in the making of digital capacitors.\r\nTantalum, which is processed from coltan, is crucial to all digital technologies, including\r\ncell phones, pagers, video game players, and digital music players. Over the past ten\r\nyears, foreign armies and local militias have used the money they earned from the sale\r\nof coltan and other minerals, such as gold, to finance and extend their military\r\noperations throughout the region.\r\n\r\nMantz and Smith will conduct both extensive survey and intensive ethnographic\r\nresearch on coltan. They will survey a sample of mining towns and cities where coltan is\r\ntraded to elucidate how coltan mining and exchange operate in the Congo, and the\r\neffects that the mining of this commodity have had on local communities and their\r\nsurrounding environs. Using both extensive survey and intensive ethnographic\r\ninterviewing, the researchers will investigate the relationship between coltan, conflict,\r\nand nation building; how coltan mining has affected the transformation and\r\ndecentralization of political authority; and, more generally, the effects of coltan on local\r\nculture and social organization. In addition, they will map the structure of the process\r\nthrough which coltan is moved from rural mining enclaves, through urban Congolese\r\nsites of processing, and out into the world system.\r\n\r\nThe research is important because coltan is an example of a growing phenomenon:\r\nlocally grounded commodity chains that are central to the global digital age. The\r\nproduction and sale of these commodities have transformative effects upon not only\r\nlocal economies but also local politics and social organization. The research will\r\ncontribute to social science theory of the intricate relations between local and global, as\r\nwell as to better policies for economic development and conflict prevention and\r\nresolution.",

For a long time (dominantly up until the 1970s) anthropologists did this by looking at how discrete groups of people live and configure reality. But in recent decades, anthropologists have attempted to turn toward an understanding of the global interdependence of the world's people. This has proven challenging, as the study of human variation requires appropriate methodological attention to the specificity of different ethnographic contexts. One way in which anthropologists have attempted to methodologically resolve that paradox has been through a dogged social and historical analysis of single, globally-significant commodities (sugar, coffee, tea, and salt, to name a few examples). This project examined the interconnection of the world by focusing on the social and economic life of a commodity that is crucial to the global digital age and social-political transformations in the Congo, but whose final purpose (i.e., transformation of this ore into capacitors) is significant everywhere in the world, and essential to the digital age within which we now find ourselves. Coltan, a dense silicate necessary for the production of a range of digital products, and heralded by many scientists as the \"holy grail\" of the digital age, is mined in the eastern regions of the Democratic of the Congo. Understanding the supply chain of this commodity is essential to economic competitiveness of the United States, as viability of digital technology markets depend on an understanding of the efficacy and stability of the source materials that come from the Congo.</p>\n<p>Data collected during the course of this project provided us with a range of findings, particularly in light of legislative efforts designed to regulate the trade in minerals such as coltan. Section 1302 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the SEC ensure American companies demonstrate due diligence in establishing that such minerals are free from sources enmired in conflict. This regulatory framework has not yet been effectively put into place, because of the complexities of regulation on the ground in the Congo. In fact, the project data suggests that regulatory and development efforts aimed at the Congo have proven problematic in four principal respects. First, international planners and aid organizations, and at their behest the Congolese government following the implementation of the 2010 legislation, have had the tendency to demonize independent artisanal miners, who in practice are often essential for stabilizing these markets and establishing investor confidence in markets for minerals essential to digital products. Given the size of this labor market (hundreds of thousands), and the capacity for these miners to bring in much needed hard currency to stabilize these markets, their role is essential for establishing a peaceful market for those minerals that are essential to American digital industries. A second problem is the tendency for the international community to demonize Congolese mineral traders (<em>comptoirs</em>, mineral accountants; or their more entrepreneurial middlemen, known as <em>n&eacute;gociants</em>) for their role in the conflict. Perhaps one of the greatest hurdles to the stability of these mineral markets is the fact that the castigation of Congolese-branded coltan has historically had, and will continue to have, the effect of abetting the illicit trade; illicit traders (whose minerals end up being branded as originating from somehow else other than the Congo) benefit with each act that harms their well-regulated Congolese competitors.
