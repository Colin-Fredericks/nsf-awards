 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Centering the Teaching of Mathematics on Urban Youth integrates educational and research activities with the ultimate goal of improving the mathematics education of students in high poverty, urban high schools. The project is situated in an urban schools context with a specific focus on developing secondary mathematics teachers? capacity for implementing culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy (CuReMaP). CuReMaP consists of three elements: 1) teaching mathematics for understanding, 2) including aspects of the lived experiences of students and their communities as contexts for mathematization, and 3) utilizing mathematics to analyze or describe societal themes or inequities to develop students? awareness, mathematical literacy and sense of agency so that they can fully participate in our nation?s democracy. \r\nThe project is organized around two main objectives: 1) to better prepare and support high school teachers to teach mathematics effectively, using a framework of culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy and 2) to gain a research based understanding of the outcomes of culturally relevant mathematics pedagogy for students in high poverty, urban high schools. \r\n",
