 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal to acquire 14 items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use on R/V Marcus Langseth, operated by Columbia University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  The 14 items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are: \r\n \r\n1) Mammal Mitigation PAM System \t\t\t\r\n2) Knudsen 3260 Sub Bottom Profiler \t\t\t \r\n3) MCS Streamer Boot Repair System \t\t\t  \r\n4) Seismic Sound Source String Depth and Pressure Sensors  \r\n5) MCS Streamer Recovery Devices \t\t\t\t\r\n6) MCS Streamer Level Device Upgrade \t\t\t\r\n7) Near Field Seismic Sound Source Hydrophones\t\t  \r\n8) 2D MCS Acquisition Control and Processing \t\t  \r\n9) Dual Conversion UPSs \t\t\t\t\t  \r\n10) Visualization Screens \t\t\t\t\t    \r\n11) MCS Digital Air Management Manifolds \t\t\r\n12) 75kHz ADCP\t\t\t\t\t \t\r\n13) Test Equipment \t\t\t\t\t\t  \r\n14) Large Format Plotter \r\n\r\nBetween the time that the proposal was reviewed and the award was granted, LDEO has needed to procure various instrumentation that in discussions with program, were unanticipated and were clearly needed to complete the first year of operations. As this is a very complicated and demanding operation without operational precedent in the fleet, program has worked with LDEO to provide the necessary flexibility to begin operations and to establish a baseline of operational costs. Permission was granted to procure the following instrumentation:  \r\n1) Acoustic Floats\t\r\n2) Streamer Head Sections\t\t\t\r\n3) Two 1500LL Sound Sources\t\t\t\r\n4) Four Gun Control Modules\t\t\t\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n\tIn the present proposal, the items recommended for support provide an important shared-use infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-effective, and will significantly improve capabilities for users of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University, who are a diverse group of investigators from around the U.S.  The LDEO technical support group has the expertise to operate and support the recommended systems on the vessels.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
