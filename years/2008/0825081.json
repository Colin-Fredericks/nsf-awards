 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to provide financial support for selected US participants to the trimester program ?Interacting particles, statistical mechanics and probability theory? running from September to December 2008 in Institut Henri Poincar\u00b4e, Paris, France. This program will attract many leading researchers working in the interdisciplinary field between probability theory and statistical physics and host them for various durations. It will propose three workshops, five long courses, and a dozen of mini-courses. The main objective of this proposal is to ensure that US based junior researchers do not miss this opportunity to interact and learn from the best experts of this important field for lack of support. Strong preferences will be given to beginning researchers showing great promise, i.e., advanced graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty in need of financial support. Participation by talented junior researchers can be expected to have a major impact on their careers, and hence on the continued leadership role of the US in this area. Strong participation by this group will also be essential for the healthy development of this young and active field.",
