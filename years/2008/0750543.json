With advances in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and ontology technology, the tool has the potential to enable the discovery of future supply and demand imbalances for teams of business analysts. The objective is to produce at least one Investable Inconsistency per day by the end of the research period. \r\n\r\nThe Phase I project produced unanticipated innovations that may have broad utility in both the OLAP field and the ontology field, and with these innovations, the software platform shows promise for transforming the essential practice of analysis in the field of market research in support of investment decisions. The Phase II project, if successful will result in technology that extends this promise to a broad audience, educating users in best practices for investment analysis and enabling them to materially improve their allocation of resources.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis STTR project built on academic research in ontology engineering to produce a graph database-driven software application for structured note-taking.  The application uses logical inference to automate compilation of comparisons of interrelated assumptions in investment research.  These comparisons may enable investors to anticipate more imbalances in supply and demand and rectify them with investments, and this application is currently supporting professional investment management services.\n\n \n\nThis structured note-taking software also advanced the state of the art in ontology authoring by improving tabular manipulation of higher arity and cardinality in general graphs and ontologies.  It may prove useful for any comparison along multiple attributes of items in a graph.\n\n \n\nIn addition to this graph database-driven software application for structured note-taking, the STTR project also produced tools for mapping content from two-dimensional spreadsheet tables to ontologies expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). \n\n \n\nWe developed a mapping language based on the Manchester OWL Syntax,i whose main goal is to transform each tuple found in the semi-structured table to an instance of an OWL class whose properties are defined by the tuple\u00c6s attributes (i.e., its row and column header values).
