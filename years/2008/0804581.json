 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project strives for fundamental innovations including: (i) a growth approach to make 3D spiral PBG materials by a glancing-angle-deposition method; (ii) a new design architecture to realize a photonic equivalent of a semiconductor heterostructure using PBG materials; (iii) control of the flow of light at microscopic scales by a photonic heterostructure; (iv) a new scheme of conformal metallic coating to modify the optical properties of a PBG material. A potential outcome of the spiral PBG and photonic heterostructures is diffraction-less control of the flow of light on-chip. The approach is based on thin-film growth of slanted rods at a pre-designed sequence that produces desirable lattice symmetry. This approach is expected to lead to a spatially coherent 3D spiral PBG material without using extensive fabrication tools and it may be scaleable, e.g., up to 6-8 inches. The heterostructure desired has a 3D-2D-3D design that consists of a 2D PBG sandwiched on both sides by 3D PBGs. This combination provides the high photon confinement of a 3D PBG while offering the flexibility and ease of creating functional optical devices (waveguides, bends, filters, cavities) in a 2D PBG material. \r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materials science with high technological relevance, and the project represents a balanced research and educational effort. The investigators have an established track record of involving undergraduates and graduates in research, and this will be continued. Such exposure to cutting-edge research instills confidence, creativity and motivation in students. The PI and Co-PIs also have a strong partnership with high school outreach as well as interacting with RPI?s Center for Initiatives in Pre-College Education (CIPCE).\r\n",

This is analogous to<br />the periodic atomic arrangement in solids that interacts strongly with<br />electrons in solids. Electrons in solids, depending on the geometry of the<br />atomic arrangement, can possess different energy levels or bands that control their metallic, magnetic, semiconducting, or insulating properties. In a<br />similar way, by designing different periodic structures, PBG materials can be<br />used to manipulate light for many applications such as light-energy conversion in solar cells and solid-state lighting devices that were not available in the past. Since its origination two decades ago, the PBG material has inspired our imagination as the &ldquo;magic material&rdquo; for new scientific discoveries and innovation. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under this program, we have explored and created a large number of PBG structures by innovative material growth and fabrication:</p>\n<p><strong><em>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Modification of photonic band edge position by high temperature metal coating </em></strong></p>\n<p>One of the main challenges of achieving a stimulated thermal emission from a<br />three-dimension (3D) PBG material is in high temperature metallic material<br />coating with a nanometer precision. We have developed Iridium (Ir) metal<br />coating using atomic-layer-deposition method, a self-limiting chemisorption<br />process to precisely control the coating thickness. Our data and theoretical<br />calculations indicate a significant improvement in the optical performance of<br />the Ir-coated sample, particularly in moving the PBG band edge toward one<br />micrometer wavelength. This is a landmark wavelength as it would open up<br />exciting possibility of using a silicon solar cell for a highly efficient<br />energy conversion.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Growth of 3D spiral photonic band gap material based on Germanium (Ge)</em></strong></p>\n<p>The synthesis of a spiral 3D structure is one of the most efficient methods to<br />realize a sub-micrometer size 3D PBG material. However, the main challenge of the spiral growth is in achieving a large, slanted angle (&gt;55-degree) of the<br />arms of the spiral. We have now succeeded in growing a Ge 3D spiral structure with a significantly larger arm angles as compared to that of a silicon<br />spirals. We have also developed a holographic lithography method based on a 3-beam interference effect to make the 2D templates for growing 3D Ge spirals. Using the 2D template, we have successfully realized 3D Ge spiral structures with a slanted angle of 55-degree.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong><strong><em>Toward polarized emission: Quantum dots embedded in a 3D photonic band gap material</em></strong></p>\n<p>Under this program, we studied photon-electron interaction based on the quantum-dots/3D layer-by-layer PBG architecture. We have been successful in realizing the 3D PBG structure and the incorporating quantum-dots (QD) into a 3D PBG structure. We also show that the QD/3DPBG structure is promising in producing an intrinsically polarized light emission. The new 3D PBG architecture consists of a top PBG-layer, a QD-layer, and a bottom PBG-layer. The sample exhibits a polarized, narrow band transmittance of 90% at 1.2 micrometer wavelength. The intensity of the bottom emission is about half as compared to that o the top emission. This preliminary data is encouraging as it indicates that it is likely that the bottom emission contains only one polarization and, therefore, exhibits about half the emission intensity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Realization of plasmonic filters for multispectral and dual-polarization detection </em></strong></p>\n<p>One of the long term objectives of this program is to realize 3D photonic band gap (PBG) material at optical wavelength and to mold the flow of light that is not easily achievable by other means. We have succeeded in making a 3D gold PBG material and experimentally show that it supports unique optical modes that are both polarization-sensitive and wavelength-selective. We show that a 5-Layer PBG material can support a p-polarized mode (a singlet) and s-polarized mode (a doublet). One new-degree-of-freedom afforded by our 3D PBG material is that the doublet can be easily tailored by changing the width of the third layer rod.</p>\n<p><strong>Educational activities</strong></p>\n<p>Under this program, we have supported a full time Ph.D student to work on the proposed research project.

He spent about 40% of his time at Cornell's nanofabrication (CNF) laboratory, which was partially funded by NSF and by New York State. At CNF, He has many opportunities interacting with students from Cornell and also from other institutions, making it an exciting learning experience. Additionally, we have also hosted two minority undergraduate students at RPI. One of them has been working on the deposition of slanted rod which is related to the 3D spiral PBG material research supported under this program.
