 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies have enabled the\r\nsequencing of bacteria directly from the environment, providing a\r\nbroader outlook on the diversity of bacteria than ever before\r\npossible. Recent studies of environmental samples have revealed\r\ncomplex communities containing many previously unknown species, and\r\nuncovered a large amount of genetic variation and diversity even among\r\nclosely related strains. Characterizing this genomic variation is\r\ncritical in studies of microbial ecology and evolution, yet currently\r\navailable computational tools, originally developed for the study of\r\nsingle organisms, are ill-suited for this task.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to develop the theoretical and computational\r\ninfrastructure for the study of genomic variation within mixtures of\r\norganisms.  The proposed research relies on both theoretical and\r\nempirical analyses of the structure of genome assembly graphs in order\r\nto characterize graph signatures that are correlated with intra- and\r\ninter- species polymorphisms.  A particular focus is placed on\r\nunderstanding and using the information provided by next generation\r\nsequencing technologies as well as other high-throughput experimental\r\ntechniques.  The proposed work provides critical analysis tools\r\nto help biologists explore the genetic variation within the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about this project is available at\r\nhttp://www.cbcb.umd.edu/research/Genomic_Variation.shtml.\r\n",
