It falls on overworked system administrators or the home user to configure their systems, often resulting in seriously misconfigured systems.  Research is needed  to lead to tools that will drastically reduce the work required to configure systems so that they are not open to attack.  The research will involve policy languages that permit users to characterize their security and privacy needs, techniques to reify policies to enforceable rules, and new techniques that support changes to a policy that reflect down to the appropriate changes to rule sets. \r\n\r\nThe workshop involves the participation of industry so that the academic participants will become familiar with  policies and rule sets drawn from real enterprises and networks.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop will produce a detailed report to be posted on the NSF web site \r\n",
