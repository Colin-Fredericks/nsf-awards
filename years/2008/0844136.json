Keesling\r\n\r\nThe University of Florida Department of Mathematics will host a\r\njoint Ulam Centennial and 43rd Annual Spring Topology and\r\nDynamical Systems Conference (Ulam Centennial STDC-2009) from\r\nSaturday, March 7 through Thursday, March 12, 2009.  The Annual\r\nSpring STDC's are among the nation's most successful series of\r\ntopology/dynamics conferences.  Stanislaw Ulam would turn 100 in\r\nSpring, 2009. He was one of the preeminent mathematical\r\nscientists of the 20th century and a Graduate Research Professor\r\nat the University of Florida.  In light of Ulam's many\r\ncontributions to topology, dynamics, and related fields, it is\r\nvery fitting that the annual STDC be combined with an Ulam\r\nCentennial. The joint conference will maintain the basic\r\nstructure and sessions of the STDC, but will be extended by 3\r\ndays to allow additional special sessions and plenary lectures in\r\nthe areas of Ulam's many contributions to mathematics and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nTopology studies generalized notions of spatial structure;\r\nDynamical Systems studies the topological and analytic nature of\r\ntime evolution. Each is a fundamental part of modern mathematics\r\nand has applications as far ranging as robotics, fluid mixing,\r\ncomputer networks and cardiac rhythms.  Conferences are\r\nfundamental to the strength and development of mathematics, and\r\nas such are a fundamental part of the national scientific\r\ninfrastructure. This conference will combine the latest results\r\nin Topology and Dynamical Systems with many applied topics\r\nassociated with Stan Ulam. While Ulam is perhaps best remembered\r\nby the public for his participation in the Manhattan Project, his\r\nmathematical and scientific contributions were wide and\r\ndeep. They include significant work in numerical methods,\r\nclassical mechanics, dynamical systems, number theory, graph\r\ntheory, set theory, and ergodic theory. Inspired by Ulam's\r\nexample, the conference will advance top quality research in\r\nTopology and Dynamical Systems while facilitating broad and deep\r\ninteraction among adjacent mathematical research areas and\r\nbetween abstract and applied research.\r\n",
