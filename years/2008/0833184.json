 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina Central University (NCCU) proposes to establish a CREST Computational Center for Fundamental and Applied Science and Education (CCFASE) to provide the framework required for the conception and execution of interdisciplinary research and education in the College of Science and Technology (CST). The center will combine state-of-the-art research and development with an infrastructure essential to address some of the most important questions in modern physics and materials science through five projects: 1) Computer modeling, design, and formation of novel nanostructured materials and nanodevices; (2) Low-energy few-nucleon interactions: computer simulations for experimental development, data analysis, and rigorous calculations for three nucleon models; (3) Study of hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-nucleon interactions; (4) Intelligent systems and robotics; and (5) Integrative Geophysical Investigation of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The proposed Center will enhance the participation of minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas, where they are critically underrepresented. In addition to fundamental advances in science, the CREST will train a qualified technology work force of highly-skilled people from minority and socially underrepresented groups. The Center involves 17 senior investigators from five NCCU STEM departments and scientists from Duke University, Cornell University, and the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis, and Jefferson National Laboratory.  The investigators propose to create an HBCU computational science network will that will increase the opportunities for student participation in advanced research and will facilitate the collaboration among HBCU faculty and students with research institutions and industry. \r\n\r\n",
