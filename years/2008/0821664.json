 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at the University of Wyoming will purchase\r\ncomputer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in\r\nthe mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several\r\nresearch projects, including in particular: the numerical simulation of\r\nthree-phase porous-media flows, the investigation of the the scale-up\r\nproblem for such flows, the development of particle tracking schemes for\r\nnonlinear conservation laws and of parallel adaptive multi-scale finite\r\nelement methods that can be applied to them. The projects aim\r\nat advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation of fluid\r\nflow in porous media such as oil reservoirs and aquifers. They will\r\nexplore new computational algorithms, both for sequential and parallel\r\ncomputers, the incorporation of complex fluid physics, and eventually\r\nwill apply these methods to the study of enhanced oil recovery\r\ntechniques which are already used in the state of Wyoming as well as\r\nelsewhere in the United States. Thus, the projects will have a large\r\nsocial impact on the state of Wyoming, due to its concentration of\r\nnatural resources in gas, coal and oil reservoirs, and ultimately on the\r\nU.S. maintaining its leadership role in applied computational science in\r\na field of high importance to today's world economy. On a different\r\nscale, the projects span several disciplines and are tuned to the\r\nUniversity of Wyoming mission of interdisciplinary computational science\r\nin its academic plan. Existing research links between the Departments of\r\nMathematics, Statistics, Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Chemistry,\r\nComputer Science, as well as the Institute for Enhanced Oil Recovery and\r\nthe School for Energy Resources will be stimulated, and will result in\r\nattracting additional students in the existing programs. The project is\r\ncoupled tightly with an on-going education plan aimed at developing both\r\nan undergraduate and a graduate curriculum in Computational Science, to\r\nbe offered through some of the above departments above as a minor. This\r\nminor has already been approved at the College of Arts level for the\r\nMathematics Department where the emphasis will be on training students\r\nin high-performance computing and its use in the study of complex\r\nphysics, with first undergraduate students expected this Fall. Other\r\ndepartments and the graduate program are expected to follow gradually\r\nover the next couple of years.",
