 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarding 76 scholarships to 29 students enrolled in Electronic and Computer Engineering Technology at the technical college, and Computer Science at the university. The project objectives include creation of an intercollegiate student cohort, increased enrollment and retention of students in associate degree technology and baccalaureate programs, increased enrollment of women and first-generation college students, improved persistence, and greater involvement of business representatives. \r\n\r\nThe project supports students who enroll in and complete an associates degree, and continues support until scholars have earned their bachelors degree. Cohort activities have been thoughtfully designed to encourage development of interpersonal relationships and sharing. Support services include orientation, advising, intercollegiate relationships, study groups, mentoring, supplemental lectures, attendance at regional technology meetings, and assistance with admission fees and child care.",
