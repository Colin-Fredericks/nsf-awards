 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ward\r\nDMS-0807033\r\n\r\n     The main object of this project is to develop new methods\r\nand tools for the analysis and synthesis of scattered data by\r\nmeans of radial and related basis functions.  Very recently, the\r\ninvestigators Ward and Narcowich and a collaborator introduced a\r\nnew tool for fitting a divergence-free vector field tangent to a\r\n2D orientable surface contained in 3D to samples of such a field\r\ntaken at scattered sites on the surface.  The method, which\r\ninvolves a kernel constructed from radial basis functions (RBFs),\r\nhas applications to problems in geophysics -- for instance, the\r\nnonlinear flow of an incompressible fluid in a single hydrostatic\r\natmospheric layer.  Mathematically, incompressibility translates\r\nto the velocity having vanishing surface divergence.  Fitting\r\ndivergence-free tangent vector fields to data taken in these\r\ncases would help in modeling the incompressible velocity fields\r\ninvolved.  In addition to handling scattered data, it has the\r\nadvantage of avoiding special treatment for the poles.  The\r\ninvestigators study the approximation properties of this tool,\r\nwith a view towards estimates on its data-fitting errors as well\r\nhow robust it is.  For certain cases, numerical experiments\r\nsuggest both a good fit of data and robustness.  In addition,\r\nunstructured scattered data -- i.e., clumped, or clustered, or\r\nnonuniformly distributed data -- present problems for any method,\r\nincluding the traditional RBF-type algorithms based on translates\r\nof one conditionally positive definite function.  These clustered\r\ndata occur naturally in learning theory, neural nets, meshless\r\nmethods, and other situations.  To deal with clustered data, the\r\ninvestigators initiate the study of the construction of new\r\nbases, preconditioners, and in general a new RBF-type paradigm. \r\n\r\n     Problems that involve analyzing data taken from scattered\r\nsites -- that is, irregularly placed sites -- in space or on the\r\nsurface of the earth arise frequently in diverse fields:\r\ncomputer-aided design graphics, data mining, medical imaging,\r\nlearning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many other\r\nareas.  Such problems present difficulties for traditional\r\nmethods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed\r\nsites.  For example, weather prediction is based on a\r\nmathematical model where the earth's surface is assumed to be a\r\nsurface of a sphere.  The investigators develop new methods and\r\ntools to help in analyzing such phenomena via so-called radial\r\nbasis function methods. \r\n",
