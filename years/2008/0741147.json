 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops a new technology for prosthetic arm components, using a lightweight piezoelectric actuator. A piezoelectric actuator will be developed to drive a prosthetic hand. Available arm prostheses have up to three powered degrees-of-freedom, but are sometimes considered too heavy and noisy for their disabled wearers. Lightweight and quiet piezoelectric actuators offer power-to-weight ratios that are over twice that of electromagnetic actuators, and lower the noise of the device. Furthermore, the intrinsic back-lock of a piezoelectric actuator eliminates the need for a mechanical back-lock, which maintains pinch force when the drive is stopped. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are the application of these actuators to other prosthetic components for those experiencing the loss of upper limb (a population of over 100,000 Americans). At this time, an estimated 2,000 electric prostheses are fitted each year in the U.S. alone, with equivalent numbers in Western Europe. The improvements offered with this new motor technology could increase this market greatly, making contributions to the independence and functionality of this disabled population.",
