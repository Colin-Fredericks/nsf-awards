 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work supported by this award lies at the intersection of gravitational theory and elementary particle theory, where many of the frontier problems of physics and cosmology are found. Frontiers are intrinsically resistant to neat categorization, but several themes characterize this research program: The enigmas of cosmology, particularly the observed accelerated expansion of the universe; the nature of quantum gravity, the biggest single hurdle to a fuller understanding of this universe, and a set of more technical studies whose elucidation would help in resolving the above twin mysteries. \r\n\r\nThe broad impact of fundamental investigation such as those supported by this award is to open humanity's intellectual horizons. While the laws governing the universe have been steadily built up over the last few centuries, breakthroughs may be possible now as the universe is observed across its entire scale for the very first time.",
