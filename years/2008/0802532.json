 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is using an experienced team of curriculum developers from Concord Consortium, a community college with technical programs, and three ATE Centers to develop 16 field-tested, interactive, model- and computer-based learning units on electron properties and behavior.  These learning units are useful in a wide range of technical courses such as photonics, electronics, material science, biotechnology, design of advanced materials, and chemical and engineering technology as well as in the core science content courses.  The project is using a broad set of formative and summative assessments to improve the effectiveness of the learning units.  The intellectual merit rests in the project's (1) focus on developing materials for a broad set of difficult, electron-related concepts, (2) use of research findings in science education, cognitive science, and educational technology in that development, and (3) team of scientists, researchers, educators, innovators, and industry representatives who are leaders in atomic-scale modeling and activity development.  The broader impact emerges from the potential and adaptability of the curricular materials along with their accompanying professional development courses and workshop curricula.  This impact is also found in the dissemination of these materials though a public, online data base with broad national reach as well as through other online libraries.",
