 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamics of Capillary Force Actuators\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThe objective of this research is to investigate a fundamentally new and innovative technology for generating actuation forces in microelectromechanical systems. The approach is to exploit the change in capillary pressure of a liquid bridge when electrowetting occurs. Capillary force actuators are capable of delivering ten to one hundred times greater force than currently-favored technologies and have the potential to revolutionize the development of microsystems. In this research, instrumented capillary force actuators will be microfabricated, experimentally characterized, and compared to electrohydrodynamic models.        \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This research will advance capillary force actuation technology along several fronts essential to its adoption in microelectromechanical applications. The understanding gained will result in accurate models of capillary force actuators that relate dynamic behavior to design choices. The experimental results obtained will confirm the dynamic models and provide demonstration of the potential of this technology for microelectromechanical systems. Finally, the fabrication and testing of several prototype devices will provide knowledge critical to the development of practical, manufacturable actuators.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  The effort will provide both undergraduate and graduate students a highly interdisciplinary research opportunity, ideal for the development of broad fundamental knowledge and practical know-how. The undergraduate students will produce podcasts for outreach to underrepresented high school students that bring the research experience to life. Through the involvement of undergraduates from underrepresented groups, this effort will directly impact the training of a diverse engineering workforce. The effort will enable the development of new microdevices that were previously unachievable and result in products that benefit society. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The surfaces contain electrodes covered with a very thin insulating (dielectric) layer. Upon application of a voltage across the electrodes, the liquid\u00c6s contact angle upon the surface changes.
