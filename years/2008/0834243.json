 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will fund the development of components and their integration for Spiral 1 of an end-to-end prototype of a suite of network infrastructure that would enable researchers to carry out novel network science and engineering experiments, i.e., to do science that currently can not be done. Spiral 1 will attempt a first, trial integration and operation of components on multiple national backbones. Spiral 1 will be developed as quickly as possible to identify and reduce programmatic and technical risk and to help the research community achieve a shared vision by providing a working prototype. It will stimulate broad community participation and build a strong academic and industrial base. Twenty-nine projects, working in five teams will compete in the design and implementation of the network infrastructure control framework. System engineers will perform top-down integration planning and project guidance. While a well-integrated, orderly system may not be possible until Spiral 2 or 3, Spiral 1 will take the critical first step towards creating this radically new kind of experimental infrastructure with end-to-end, virtualizable, and sliceable capabilities, which are entirely novel. Once this first spiral exists, it will co-evolve with the community?s emerging research and education agenda. The larger impacts are potentially huge, allowing for transformative research in network science and engineering that has never been done before.\r\n\r\n",

The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI\u00c6s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite.

Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of slicability and deep programmability are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See Figure 6.)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs GENI is being created and improved, it is engaging an unusually wide range of participants from a cross-section of US institutions. This community is designing and developing GENI technology, deploying GENI on their campuses, and using GENI in their research. Many universities are applying GENI in their courses, with the potential to transform totally how experimental computer science is taught and learned. \n\nPerhaps most imp..."
