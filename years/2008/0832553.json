 "awd_abstract_narration": "Planning Grant for an I/UCRC in Sustainable Engineering Systems \r\n\r\n0832553 Santa Clara University; Jorge Gonzalez-Cruz \r\n     \r\nThis proposal integrates the activities from three institutions (Santa Clara University, San Jose State University, and California College of the Arts to plan the formation of a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on sustainable engineering systems with a focus on quantifiable sustainability. The proposed \"Center for Sustainable Engineering Systems\" (CSES) will focus on quantifiable sustainability and reducing market barriers by improving performance, by installation of systems driven by overall energy efficiencies, and by promoting incentives that rely on measured benefits obtained using advanced building information systems. The proposed research will revolve around sustainable materials, building integrated technologies, building information systems, sustainable built environments, and sustainable transportation, focusing on relationships between energy efficiency and weather/climate, construction material and location, and human behavior and living spaces. \r\n\r\nThe greatest benefits that would be derived from this work largely descend from wider public understanding about sustainability and the development of a more robust way to measure it. The several products discussed for development (building products and integrated solar panels) will provide for wider usage of more sustainable products. The ability of the center to harness interest of entities in California is promising. The proposed center plans to recruit students from under-represented groups, including minorities and women to broaden their participation in engineering.",
