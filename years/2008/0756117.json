Existing techniques to acquire these two types of data are quite different and frequently interfere with one another. Consequently, little is known of the interactions between electrical and mechanical function at the organ level, in particular during abnormal cardiac rhythms that do not repeat from beat-to-beat. The new method will be applied to isolated whole-heart preparations. The preparations will be stained with a fluorescent dye that that transduces the transmembrane potential and discrete material points will be marked on the epicardial surface. Electrical waves and the motion of the epicardial markers will be imaged by high-speed video cameras that surround the heart. Finite element analysis and other computational techniques will be used to integrate the electrical and mechanical data. The long term goal of this project is to improve human health through improved understanding of cardiac pathophysiology. The project will also impact education (1) at the graduate level by supporting a graduate student in Biomedical Engineering; (2) at the undergraduate level through incorporation of the research into coursework and by providing independent research projects; and (3) at the K-12 level through outreach activities.",
