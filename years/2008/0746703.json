 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to study the mesoscale (1) structure, (2) dynamics and (3) functionality of electrospun nanofibers by mimicking the protein-guided mineralization of extracellular matrix in skeletal tissue.  The research will develop nanofiber-architectural composite constructs for enhanced mechanical properties and functionality.  Highly aligned nanofibers derived from synthetic polymers will be spun to controlled diameters.  The morphology, mechanical and deformation characteristics of the nanofibers will be extensively evaluated. A cross disciplinary team of structural biologists, polymer physicists, and orthopedics will assess the functionality of the materials studied for use in biological applications.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will enable understanding of polymer processing of synthetic equivalents of natural materials using interlocking polymer-ceramics.  It will produce urgently needed empirical data in the mesoscale domain that cannot be otherwise obtained by modeling or modeling of natural species using either known properties of the bulk samples or purely theoretical values from atomistic or molecular simulations.  It will have impact on stretching, patterning, imprinting of micro-, nano, and meso-scale polymeric components and thus enable future processing of polymeric devices using electrospinning techniques.  The efforts will address the abrupt change in mechanical strength, modulus and toughness at a critical length scale of polymer fiber diameter. It will subsequently lead to evolution of a new paradigm for fabricating miniaturized organic-matrix composites.  By integrating life sciences with a traditional mechanical engineering curriculum, the project will be a new and unique way to provide motivation for learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: This project aimed to study bio-inspired materials properties of aligned electrospun polymer nanofibers.  The bio-inspired adhesion and \"size\" effect of nanofibers were critically examined and a Hall-Petch equivalent relation was proposed as the fiber diameter decreases below 500 nm, that is, mechanical properties increase as the fiber diameter decreases. The research focused on structural organization, tensile strength composites, polymer confinement effect, as afforded by electrospinning, mimicking bone mineralization strategies.  Two journal papers, viz. (1) \"Electrospinning of Polymer Nanofibers: Effects on Oriented Morphology, Structure and Tensile Properties\" and (2) \"Effect of Fiber Diameter on Tensile Properties of Electrospun Poly(e-caprolactone)\", derived from understanding the \"size\" and thus polymer confinement effects have been cited 212 and 135 times, respectively, worldwide.   The bio-inspired adhesion aspect of the electrospinning-enabled research subsequently led to an NSF I Corps project that trained the PI and his team of graduate students on the commercial potential and addressed the technology transfer of electrospun polymer adhesives from the PI's laboratory to the market.  The outcomes resulted in the PI's spinning out a start-up, Akron Ascent Innovations, LLC (AAI), from the University of Akron.  The Company, managed by an independent CEO and President, and AAI's continuing innovations, resulted in subsequent NSF SBIR and State of Ohio Phases 1 and 2 investments to drive ascending performance in delivering market-oriented research.\n\nBroader Impact: Six graduate (4 PhDs - with one defending her thesis proposal in December 2014, and 2 masters graduated) and four undergraduate students were trained including cost-sharing mechanisms, research experience for undergraduates, and undergraduate senior design projects.  The research produced 15 journal and many conference papers.  It introduced scalable electrospinning-enabled technology to adhesion science and adhesives industry, creating a new field known as \"the electrospun adhesive polymer blends\".  Summer workshops for regional high school science teachers and councilors were organized together with other CAREER awardees' in the Department of Biology and Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Akron.  The PI was an invited speaker in several industrial conferences and presented many talks in companies, generating considerable interest in the research work.   Two non-provisional full patent applications were filed with one (PCT/US13/53807) being co-invented with the PI's PhD graduates: Dr. Johnny F. Najem and Dr. Pei Chen.  Given the PI was the only speaker presenting an electrospinning paper in international adhesion conferences and the only one presenting adhesion science in an electrospinning conference, and the subsquent engagements gathered from the audience, the broader impact of this versatile platform research will be yet fully seen.  The project fosters academic collaborations between different institutions and insights from biomimicry, which is one of the thrust areas in the University of Akron, forging links among mechanical engineering, biology and polymer science.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shing-Chung Wong"
