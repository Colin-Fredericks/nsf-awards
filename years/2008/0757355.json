By definition, these are\r\nstructures composed of identical molecules having the property\r\nthat corresponding atoms in each molecule see precisely the same\r\nenvironment up to an orthogonal transformation.  Objective\r\nstructures generalize classical crystal structures, and include\r\nmany of the most intensely studied structures in science today,\r\nincluding carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, viral capsids and other\r\nparts (necks, tails, baseplates), many common proteins, bilayers,\r\nand many other nanostructures now being synthesized, especially\r\nvia the process of self-assembly.  The investigators  exploit the\r\nsymmetries of these structures to develop computational numerical\r\nmethods for molecular dynamics, a mathematical theory for the\r\nself-assembly of objective structures, a quasicontinuum numerical\r\nmethod for defective objective structures, and simpler\r\nfirst-principles calculations of the energy of these structures. \r\n\r\n     Nanostructures are becoming increasingly important in a\r\nvariety of scientific and technological applications.  Objective\r\nstructures are the building blocks of nanostructures, both\r\norganic and inorganic.  A comprehensive and unified mathematical\r\ntreatment of such structures has the potential to lead to the\r\ndiscovery of new structures with unusual forms of ferromagnetism\r\nand ferroelectricity and unexpected transport properties.  The\r\ndetailed investigation of the self-assembly of objective\r\nstructures can lead to new methods of synthesis of such\r\nstructures, especially methods that produce nanostructures of\r\ndesired dimensions and molecular arrangement.  These, in turn,\r\ncould lead to new strategies to combat viral infections, and new\r\nmethods for the templated growth of particular nanostructures\r\nsuch as carbon nanotubes.  The quasicontinuum mathematical\r\nmethods deliver a general strategy for the systematic\r\ninvestigation of the process of nucleation and growth of defects\r\nin nanostructures.  These methods are expected to give a\r\nsystematic new tool for the discovery of exceptionally strong\r\nmolecular structures. \r\n",
