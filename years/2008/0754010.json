 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina State University will host 11 students each summer to participate in the Research Experience for Undergraduates Program in Synthetic Biology and Plant Biotechnology. The program is open to all rising sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduate students with a demonstrated interest in molecular biology. Stipends, room and board, and travel expenses are provided. NCSU has a strong core of biologists working with two aspects of synthetic biology: using recombinant plants as \"factories\" to generate useful products, and developing synthetic model systems for studying fundamental biological mechanisms. The goal of the program is to inspire and empower undergraduate researchers to pursue productive scientific careers. Students in the program will participate in a 3-day \"Biotechnology Bootcamp\" during the first week of the program, in which they will learn critical molecular biology laboratory skills, and then will pursue independent research projects for the remainder of the summer under the guidance of a faculty mentor. Students will also have multiple public-speaking opportunities to present their research, including a poster presentation at the campus-wide undergraduate research symposium at the end of the program. Students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Students interested in the REU program should contact Dr. Sue Carson (sue_carson@ncsu.edu or 919-513-0330). Program information, including faculty research descriptions, is available online at http://www.ncsu.edu/biotechnology/?p=training_programs&sub=reu.",
