 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a novel alliance among the state school system, Jackson State University (JSU), Jackson Public Schools and other public schools in Mississippi. The project also partners with the Ironwood Observatory and Education Center in Hawaii, the James Cook Universtiy Center for Astronomy in Australia and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The focus of the partnership is on high school physics, chemistry and earth science. The project anticipates enabling 45 preservice teachers to obtain teaching licenses in high school science. Courses will be designed and taught by the College of Education and Human Development and the College of Science, Engineering and Technology. The project will provide 200 inservice teachers with 160 hours of professional development. The goal is to enable teachers to implement National Science Education Standards and the Mississippi Science Curriculum Frameworks for high school (9-12) education. The long term goal is to improve student achievement in science and to significantly reduce achievement gaps in the science performance within the diverse student population. \r\n\r\nThe inservice component consists of two compressed 3 credit hours graduate courses. Each course will be taught in 10 days (20 days total), two weeks in summer and 10 Saturdays during the academic year. The emphasis will be on conceptual development for each major topic and will include coursework, inquiry-based laboratory work, demonstrations, hands-on activities, and problem solving with special emphasis on using technology as tools of instruction. Project team members will complete at least three follow-up visits to the classrooms of the participants.",

The content taught in MAST is tied to the content objectives of the 2010 Mississippi Science Framework (MSF), and provides teachers with the knowledge and resources to better understand and teach these objectives. MAST involves participation in an intensive three-week summer workshop, supplemental courses on five Saturdays across the subsequent school year, and program staff classroom visits and other support throughout the academic year. The attached tables (1 &amp; 2) serve as a summary of findings obtained between 2009-2017, as well as evaluation activities. The summary includes both short-term impacts on teacher and student outcomes, as well as MAST&rsquo;s long-term impact on past participants; it also examines whether or not the short-term professional development (PD) gains have staying power (&gt; one year later), as indicated through self-reported data.</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">Our previous eight evaluations have shown short-term, small-to-moderate significant improvements in the following areas: a) confidence in knowledge (teachers and students), b) confidence in teachers&rsquo; use of MAST pedagogical techniques (e.g., inquiry), c) personal science teaching efficacy, and d) science content knowledge (See attachment 3 for Theory of Change). Our findings have also demonstrated that MAST has the ability to promote long-term changes in teaching practices.</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">The findings indicate that, with regard to MAST teachers&rsquo; ability to teach science and their confidence in physical science content knowledge, teachers exposed to MAST showed greater gains compared to teachers not exposed to MAST (control group). Additionally, MAST can achieve meaningful and sustained impacts on participants&rsquo; teaching and learning science, including: a) their approach to teaching and practice, b) their levels of confidence in teaching and learning, c) their levels of comfort in teaching the 2010 MSF, and d) their students&rsquo; knowledge, confidence and learning of science. Teachers showed greater gains in content knowledge, teaching efficacy, and confidence in teaching science as compared to the control group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">Our analysis of the data collected leads to several conclusions and lessons learned:</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">(1)&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Effective implementation of the MAST model involves learning over time, trust building, and comfort with the material</span>. Research on quality PD focuses on the approach that teachers must take when learning new teaching strategies and material &ndash; viewing PD as a process and complex system rather than an event that leads to rapid change. The alum findings showed that, with time, teachers had greater confidence in implementing what they had learned from MAST. Additionally, according to Miller et al. (2015), extended PD of several years allows participants to build trust with other educators, expand networking, and gain heightened comfort with new strategies and material. More time to learn, to engage in peer-to-peer reflection and observations, increased feedback, and more time to implement change may lead to stronger outcomes.</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">(2)&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Learning from experts is essential to teacher and student benefits</span>.<strong> </strong>Banilower et al. (2007) argue that students&rsquo; ability to learn science depends on teachers&rsquo; advanced content knowledge and their ability to convey information in developmentally appropriate ways. Without expert knowledge and insight, teachers might be constrained in developing scientific engagement and thinking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\">(3)&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Teachers must learn from one another to improve practice</span>.<strong> </strong>MAST teachers often discussed the importance of peer-to-peer learning and interaction, collaboration, and reflection. High school teachers may become accustomed to working independently when teaching and managing their classes. MAST incorporates and encourages reflection, small-group projects, and candid discussions about teacher practice and how best to approach student learning unique to the state of MS. Thus, teachers participated in professional learning communities with a shared understanding of their long-term teaching goals &ndash; to improve student outcomes and achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(4) Teachers can demonstrate competency, mastery, and growth in a variety of ways</span>. MAST has proven the long-standing argument that there is not a &ldquo;one-size-fit-all&rdquo; approach to PD, teacher learning, and effective practice. MAST gave teachers the freedom to customize their learning in a way that suited them and, importantly, their students. Teachers have demonstrated growth in a number of areas, including content knowledge, teaching efficacy, learning efficacy, and professional learning practices, with gains in some areas but not others.</p>\n<p class=\"REANormal\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(5) Post-program support and outreach could maximize teacher and student impact</span>. The MAST alums provided the strongest evidence of the program&rsquo;s long-term impact. Some of the most frequently cited requests from the program, years later, were the inclusion of post-program support, outreach, and networking. If MAST wants to further develop its long-term impact on educators in MS, especially as broadband access is improved in the most rural areas of the state, perhaps an online forum for teachers to share experiences and practices that work would yield greater confidence and support. Opportunities such as the MAST 'mini conference' (led by MAST alums for teachers) also offer such experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mehri&nbsp;Fadavi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0831921/0831921_10037476_1514411311970_MAST-5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0831921/0831921_10037476_1514411311970_MAST-5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MAST Participants 2013-2014\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0831921/0831921_10037476_1514411311970_MAST-5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MAST Participants 2013-2014\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image includes the fifth cohort of the project MAST,  2013-2014.
