 "awd_abstract_narration": "This \"Produced in Virginia\" implementation project is combining the efforts of Central Virginia Community College, Danville Community College, and the University of Virginia (with a third community college partner added during the second year of the project) to provide undergraduate connections in engineering education with the goal of increasing the number of students enrolling in and graduating from engineering associate and baccalaureate degree programs. The partnership is achieving this goal through the following strategies: \r\n(1) Adapting and replicating the proven Priming the Pipeline model that encourages students to consider STEM careers and prepares them for success in college STEM courses with a new addition of delivering the university's introductory Explorations in Engineering course by distance education. \r\n(2) Implementing new and upgraded curricula at all three community colleges, leading to an Associate of Science degree in engineering and guaranteeing students with a 3.4 average seamless transfer into the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science.\r\n(3) Offering courses at the transfer and graduation level at the community colleges for engineering students from the University of Virginia's Bachelor of Science in Engineering Degree program as well as offering transfer courses at the University's main campus. \r\n(4) Offering tuition assistance for students pursuing undergraduate engineering degrees and engaging those students in technical employment.\r\n(5) Implementing a distance degree program pilot enabling students graduating from the Central Virginia A.S. degree program to earn undergraduate engineering degrees from the University of Virginia. \r\n(6) Developing an academic mentoring program using Web 2.0 technology solutions. \r\nThe broader impact of this project is in serving as a viable and reproducible model for collaborations between community colleges and universities to facilitate student success in an era of rising costs.  It is also contributing to the country's capacity in science and engineering in an increasingly competitive and changing global labor market.",

Central Virginia Community College teamed up with the University of Virginia and gathered local support from area industries to put together a plan to meet this need with the help of the National Science Foundation.\nThe community colleges added or revised an Associate level curricula while the university developed methodologies to deliver the synchronous online courses to the students to enable them to study wherever they may be located.  The goal was to have all the students in the class, including the ones located at the university\u00c6s home campus, experience the courses in the same manner.  Nearly all of the students from the Produced program elected this format which enabled them to work at their jobs or internships and take courses without leaving the workplace.\nInitially, the attrition rate was very high as many of the students were recruited from existing technical employees.  Some were successful, but many found that the demands were too great for them to continue.  As more people became aware of the program and the potential for gainful employment, the number of students increased along with the success rate.  The number of participant community colleges also grew.\nProduced in Virginia has graduated several classes.  From the first class, a participant of the program attained highest honors.  The faculty at the university also noted that they could not tell whether students completed their first two years at one of the community colleges or the university.   \nThe major outcome of this project is the establishment of a pipeline of students through which a 4 year engineering program can be completed without leaving their home area.  Student options are greatly increased.  A traditional education path is open to take.  However, for some the idea of gaining work experience for a local company while completing their last two years of study is very attractive to them as well at the employer, as local students are more likely to stay in the area.  This helps to meet the needs that drove the creation of the program which is the most important measure of success.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey W Laub"
