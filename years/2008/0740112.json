 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop lithium-ion battery (LIB) applications for hybrid electric vehicles. The project will develop an advanced 5 volt cathode with enhanced capacity. The implementation of 5 volt cathodes will enhanced specific energy will contribute to the development of lithium-ion batteries with energies as high as 350 watt-hours per kilogram. Battery systems with such high specific energies will be highly desirable on the portable electronics market (notebooks, cellular phones, portable medical devices, etc.) and in other consumer and military applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of safe and inexpensive lithium-ion battery with high energy density that is critically needed for the commercial consumer market and for military applications.  Among commercial applications electric vehicles (EV) market and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications would benefit from the safe, reliable and high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",
