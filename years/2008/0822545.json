 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction: This project takes on a long-standing problem of interpreting probabilities in quantum mechanics by focusing on debates about whether probabilities are \"objective\" or \"subjective.\" In a recent collaborative work by CFS (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack) it is claimed that we can understand such probabilities as degrees of belief (i.e., subjectively), and that work has stimulated productive responses as well as criticisms. CFS use the PI's previous work in making their case. The PI intends to show that that CFS's application of his work is flawed and does thus not warrant their conclusions concerning the subjective nature of probabilities equal to one. The PI also plans to pursue to clarify broader issues concerning probability in quantum physics that arise from the discussion of CFS's approach.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  It will be of great interest to have CFS's case scrutinized by the PI whose work is at issue especially since the PI has an excellent track record as a researcher in philosophy and foundations of quantum mechanics. The CFC thesis has met with considerable criticism from the ranks of physicists who consider quantum probabilities as representing objective features of the physical world, and indicates that an unambiguous decision on the nature of quantum probabilities will be immensely important not only for a philosophical understanding of the nature of physical reality but also for physicists' understanding of the nature and significance of one of their most fundamental theories. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project's primary importance will be within a relatively narrow philosophical community, those with serious interest in the foundations of quantum physics. However, it will also be of interest and importance to all Bayesians interested in the viability of applications of the Bayesian framework in science. In addition, the PI is in a position to facilitate a broader impact of his research through public lectures due to his connections at the Smithsonian and elsewhere. The PI intends to use the results of his research to teach potential future teachers, which seems to be an appropriate method of dissemination of the insights to be gained from the work. It also has a potential for providing a very valuable contribution to society at large by enhancing a wider understanding and appreciation of the nature of probability and probabilistic reasoning.\r\n",
