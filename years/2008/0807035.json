 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fostering Careers in Engineering and IT Scholarships project provides opportunities for exemplary students to pursue a degree in one of 9 STEM associate programs: Engine Research and Development Technician, Mechanical Design Technology, Tool and Die Designer, Civil Engineering Technician, Engineering Technologist, IT Micro Programmer Specialist, IT Network Specialist, IT Technical Support Specialist and Water Quality Technician. Three types of scholarships, as well as student and academic services, are available for 68 to 140 academically talented, professionally motivated and financially needy students. Three types of scholarships are offered including: 1) Standard scholarships for 10-20 students: 2) Demonstration scholarships for up to 10 students not meeting one of the Standard scholarship criteria, such as returning adults with a GPA slightly below 3.0 but demonstrate credible professional motivation; and, 3) Transfer scholarships for up to 5 students pursuing bachelors degrees. \r\n\r\nThe recruitment plans include targeting high school students and returning adults, and new efforts such as faculty visiting high school classrooms to provide information about STEM programs and careers. Services include faculty mentoring, industry visits, job shadowing, tutoring and cohort building activities. Career placement services include counseling, TechConnect (online job notices only for program students) and skill workshops.",
