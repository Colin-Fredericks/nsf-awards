 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project aims at developing a fast response, broadband TeraHertz (THz) spectrometer with High-Tc SuperConductor (HTSC).  It is believed that the development of highly sensitive full THz spectrum coverage spectrometer will be an alternative, cost effective and much more efficient way towards real applications. Estimating from the data available from associating with a single X-ray photon detection in peer cited publications, the proposed innovative THz spectrometer concept expects to reach a high level of sensitivity. The sensitivity can be improved further by photonics modification and electronics design.  \r\n\r\nThe Terahertz (THz) spectrometer under development of this project is expected to target the market of identification of chemicals (monitoring atmospheric species) and explosives. The applications extend from surveillance using on the ground and airborne platforms. It will be more effective and safer for applications like airport screening of explosives, detection of chemical laboratories, medical diagnostics, monitoring of bio-contaminants in food processing plants and as a laboratory tool for the microscopic interrogation of biological characteristics and chemical function. \r\n",
