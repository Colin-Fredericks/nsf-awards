 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the inefficiency of conventional, low-dimensional pointing devices, such as the mouse, which typically control only two parameters. The shrinking size and expanding functionality of consumer devices raises further user interface challenges. The proposed research will investigate how a high density touch pad (HDTP) touchpad, can address these problems; for example, a fingertip potentially can control six independent parameters and convey several discernible postures in a small area of contact. The HDTP incorporates a pressure-measurement sensor array with real-time processing to derive information from pressure images. The project objectives are: 1) create usable increased dimensionality by calculation of parameters in real-time from hand contact pressure distributions; 2) study system requirements and performance tradeoffs; 3) study small format opportunities wherein several usable parameters may be extracted from touch of a key. The Phase I research result will be a catalog and assessment of how the technology can increase dimensionality, and determination of system requirements. It is expected that the technology will prove capable of controlling eight or more parameters, several using only a small area, with commercially viable system requirements.\r\n\r\nThe low-dimensionality of conventional pointing devices creates a bottleneck, forcing users to perform many operations solely for the reassignment of pointing device parameters to application parameters. Many applications, including 3D drawing, CAD, simulation, data visualization, machine control, process control, advanced data navigation, animation and performing arts technologies, intrinsically require simultaneous interactive manipulation of three, four, five, six, or more independent parameters. As a high-dimensional device operated in an intuitive way with a wide range of applications, and adaptable for use in small devices, the proposed touchpad could become an attractive way to improve ease-of-use and efficiency. In fact, depending on its hardware and software requirements, it has the potential to be adopted even more widely than the conventional touchpad, now found in many laptops. Further, because of its sensitivity to fine movements, it has potential as an assistive device for the disabled, thus promoting the goal of universal access. \r\n",
