 "awd_abstract_narration": "In nature, bacteria often exist as members of communities called biofilms. The development of biofilms involves cells sending signals to each other and changing their gene expression in response. Understanding how bacteria regulate genes in response to cell-cell interactions during biofilm development is a fundamental challenge of great practical significance. Myxococcus xanthus provides a very attractive experimental system to address this challenge. When starved, cells move to aggregation centers and construct a nascent fruiting body. Within the fruiting body, rod-shaped cells differentiate into spherical, dormant spores. Signaling between cells is essential for this developmental process. \r\n\r\nStudies of C-signaling during M. xanthus development are establishing a new paradigm for how bacterial cells interact and regulate genes. C-signaling involves CsgA, a protein whose level rises in developing cells. CsgA becomes associated with the cell surface and mediates short-range signaling between cells. C-signaling induces several responses in recipient cells. It regulates cell movements, gene expression, and sporulation. The different responses to Csignaling require different levels of CsgA. The rising level of CsgA and the increased contacts between cells as they enter aggregates may ensure that the high level of C-signaling required for gene expression leading to sporulation only occurs within the fruiting body. \r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to understand how differential gene expression in response to C-signaling regulates fruiting body development. Past support led to the discovery that C-signal-dependent genes are under combinatorial control of transcription factors. A recurring theme is the involvement of MrpC and FruA, but some genes require additional transcription factors. The aims of the project are 1) to determine the roles of MrpC and FruA at particular promoters, 2) to identify the direct targets of MrpC and FruA genome-wide, and 3) to discover additional transcription factors of C-signal-dependent genes. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the results of the project will provide paradigms for how bacteria might regulate genes and control cell behavior in response to signals in biofilms of practical importance, facilitating discovery of ways to manipulate biofilm growth. Also, the project will contribute to the development of human resources in science through the teaching and training of undergraduates, graduate, and postdoctoral students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\n In nature, bacteria exist as members of communities in which cells send signals to each other and change their behavior in response.  Environmental signals also control cell behavior within microbial communities.  Understanding how bacteria respond appropriately to the many signals they receive is a fundamental challenge of great practical significance.  Our ability to manipulate microbial communities for a wide variety of applications depends on knowledge of how bacteria interact with each other and their environment.\nMyxococcus xanthus provides a very attractive experimental system to advance knowledge about how bacteria respond to environmental and cell-to-cell signals.  When starved, cells change their gene expression and metabolism, send signals to each other, alter their movements to construct multicellular mounds (nascent fruiting bodies), and some of the rod-shaped cells differentiate into spherical, dormant spores.  Other cells remain outside of fruiting bodies as peripheral rods and the majority of cells undergo lysis during the developmental process. \n \nIntellectual Merit of Project Outcomes\n \nOur work focused on understanding how genes are regulated in response to C-signaling during fruiting body development.  C-signaling involves CsgA, a protein that becomes associated with the cell surface and mediates short-range signaling between cells.  C-signaling regulates not only gene expression, but cell movements, lysis, and sporulation.  We discovered that C-signal-dependent genes are under combinatorial control of two transcription factors, MrpC and FruA.  These transcription factors belong to families that had not been shown to interact previously.  This led to the question of why MrpC and FruA cooperatively regulate C-signal-dependent genes. \n \nIt was known that FruA is activated in response to short-range C-signaling, which is believed to increase as cells pack into nascent fruiting bodies, eventually triggering sporulation.  We hypothesized that MrpC communicates whether starvation conditions persist as development proceeds, providing a mechanism to halt commitment to sporulation if nutrients reappear.  In agreement, we found that MrpC is rapidly degraded upon nutrient addition to developing cells both before and during the period of commitment to sporulation.  Hence, C-signaling and FruA tell cells whether they are in a fruiting body, and MrpC tells cells whether they are still starving.  Both conditions must be met and this ensures that spores only form in fruiting bodies if starvation persists.  This provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which cells integrate information and make decisions as members of a community.  \n\n \n\nSpore formation involves changing shape from a rod to an oval, but genes directly involved in initiating shape change remain to be identified.  We think such genes or their protein products are regulated by products of the dev genes, because dev mutants build fruiting bodies but fail to form spores.  Eight dev genes are co-transcribed from one promoter, forming the dev operon.  We found that FruA and MrpC directly regulate expression of the dev operon by binding cooperatively to two sites upstream of the promoter.  This is a novel arrangement of binding sites compared with C-signal-dependent genes studied earlier.  We discovered that the first gene of the dev operon codes for a 40-residue product that inhibits sporulation if overexpressed, and the products of at least two downstream genes normally prevent overexpression.  In the absence of either gene, overexpression of the 40-residue product inhibits expression of genes that are necessary to maintain shape change during sporulation.  The outcome of this work is a better understanding of the regulatory network governing spore formation.  The work also raises important questions for the future.  How does the 40-residue product inhibit gene expression?  Does it inhibit expression of genes involved in initiating sha..."
