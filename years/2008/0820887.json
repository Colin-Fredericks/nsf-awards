 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET-0820887\r\nCunningham\r\n\r\nThe proposal was submitted by 5 Investigators and 4 Senior Personnel from the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Science and Engineering and Bioengineering. The PI, Brian Cunningham, PhD in Electrical Engineering, UIUC, 1990, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, joined the UIUC faculty after nearly 10 years in industry. His work is supported by SRU Biosystems, NSF, DOD, NIH and the Beckman Institute and he has 23 patents awarded for optical sensors and components and more than 20 patents pending. . Rashid Bashir, PhD from Purdue, 1992, just moved to UICU in the fall of 2007 as the Bliss Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering % Bioengineering and the Director of MNTL. Dr. Bashir has impressive credentials and support from NSF, NIH and NASA. Ken-Yung Cheng, PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford, 1975, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, is the Director of the DARPA University Photonics Research Center for Hyper-Uniform Nanophotonic Technology. Kent Choquette, PhD in Materials Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1990, joined the UIUC Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2000 after nearly 10 years of experience at AT&T and Sandia National Labs. His photonics research is supported by NSF and DARPA. James Coleman, PhD in EE from UIUC, 1975, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, has published extensively and holds 6 patents. The Senior Investigators, Nicholas Fang, Milton Feng, Placid Ferreira and William King (NSF CAREER and DOE PECASE awardee), are likewise well funded. In general, the team leading this effort is outstanding. Ten research projects, with all but one currently receiving support from NSF, NIH, NASA, ONR, or DARPA, were described in some detail including information about how access to the proposed lithography equipment, which would enable imprinting more quickly and of larger areas, would benefit research efforts.",
