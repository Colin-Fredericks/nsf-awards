While plant-associated bacterial chemical signals have been identified as activators of plant defences, plant metabolites that elicit rhizobacterial responses have yet to be characterized.

An outreach component will enrich the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) initiative in the Christina School District. A collaboration with science facilitators at Glasgow High School to strengthen the ecology components in the K-12 Delaware statewide recommended curricula, by creating an interactive environment between the classroom and the laboratory for K-12 students and science teachers.",
