The transition point at which high school students decide on a major in college. \r\nII. The transition point from basic freshman and sophomore courses to upper-level undergraduate theoretical and applied mathematics courses as well as REU-style seminars \r\nIII. The transition point after the junior year of deciding to go to graduate school in mathematics \r\nIV. The transition point of entering graduate students from smaller colleges and universities with mostly undergraduate focus to graduate school in mathematics. \r\nTo address these transition points, Texas A&M will act as the host institution for the following summer camps, bridge programs, and mentoring activities: \r\n\r\nA. A talent search during the academic year and a two week high school summer camp involving 20 participants designed to entice high schoolers to consider mathematics as a major. \r\nB. A five week summer pre-REU program for 20 freshman and sophomores. Participants will be exposed to enrichment topics in mathematics and work on projects under the guidance of faculty and graduate students mentors. \r\nC. A five week summer bridge program for 15 juniors and 15 entering graduate students in mathematics to address weaknesses in algebra and real analysis. The program will be run at two different levels so as to fill holes in each student's background. This program will encourage the juniors to continue on to graduate school in mathematics as well as increase the likelihood of success in first year graduate classes at whatever graduate school the beginning graduate students enroll in. The two programs will be run together so that advanced juniors may participate in the more advanced courses and less prepared beginning graduate students may fill in their holes in the beginning material. Although participants will be recruited from all over the country, priority will be given to participants from the following schools who have agreed to partner in this effort: the University of the District of Columbia, Fayetteville State University, N. Carolina State A&T, Texas A&M Corpus Christi, and San Jacinto Junior College, institutions which enroll a high percentage of under-represented groups. \r\n\r\n",
