 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small request from Landau, to fund students and young researchers to attend the Conference on Computational Physics and the associated satellite meeting in Ouro Preto, Brazil this August, is very worth of funding by NSF. This is the major meeting in computational physics, held every year here or abroad. It contains the right mix of people for scientists interested in this interdisciplinary field to become educated on what is happening in omputational physics. I recommend that the Division proceed with the funding of the proposal at the requested level of $17,000 and without external review. The PAM states that, Proposals for conferences, symposia, and workshops, subject to the following guidelines:proposals up to $50,000 do not require external merit review, but rather are subject to the judgment and recommendation of the Program Officer.  Note that all of the funds for this are coming from from CCF in CISE and DMS in MPS.  The funding profile is $7,000 from DMS, code 03040100-1271 and $10,000 from CCF code 05010000-2865.",
