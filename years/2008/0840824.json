 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio State University College of Education (OSU), the National Middle School Association (NMSA), and Education Development Center (EDC) are providing a stewardship role for middle level educators of mathematics and science by creating the Math and Science Middle School Pathways Portal, or MSP2. While continuing to create and offer contextualized, high-quality resources, MSP2 is also capitalizing on Web 2.0 tools to promote interactivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among its users. Additionally, MSP2 is expanding its scope of influence through a new section designed for middle school aged youth and new resources related to career development, 21st century skills, and STEM careers. The portal also provides a virtual professional learning community of middle level math and science teachers. Project partners are integrating resources, tools, and services across projects, and supporting multiple methods of resource discovery to meets the needs of this audience. Collaboration among these and other organizations is providing the longer-term sustainability and stewardship of MSP2. The project evaluation is determining the impact of the project on its target audiences and the educational uses of Web 2.0 tools and services.\r\nMSP2 enhances the infrastructure for research and education by continuing to develop a contextualized, high-quality resource collection, building and supporting networks of middle grades math and science teachers through a virtual professional learning community, and supporting the educational use of Web 2.0 tools and services. Dissemination of knowledge, experience, and research results is a significant aspect of the project. The project partners are reaching diverse audiences through conferences, meetings, online events, print publications, and Web communications.",
