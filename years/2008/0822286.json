 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on their experience of developing and testing four hands-on, inquiry-based modules for the study of engineering/technology education at the high school level, an established, multidisciplinary team extends their work with a professional development model that implements those modules. A module on medical technology is added that addresses the Standards for Technological Literacy.  The module uses real-world examples and practicing engineers and technicians to introduce students to engineering design, analysis and decision-making processes.  This project advances knowledge about effective instruction and curriculum design in engineering/technology education in order to achieve public literacy and better preparation for the next generation of engineering and technology professionals, including teachers.  A model is designed, developed and tested that delivers effective teacher professional development to both inservice and preservice teachers to enable the successful implementation of engineering curricula.  Hypothesis-driven research is performed to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of the curricular materials and the teacher professional development framework on classroom instructional practices and student learning, interests and attitudes and to evaluate which curriculum components are most effective in promoting student learning and interest as a function of gender and ethnicity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe full research and development project entitled R&amp;D: The INSPIRES Curriculum for Engineering and Technology Education targeted the Contextual Challenge \"How can the learning of significant STEM content be achieved to ensure public literacy and workforce readiness?\".  INSPIRES is an acronym that stands for INcreasing Student Participation, Interest and Recruitment in Engineering in Science.  In this project, we brought together a multidisciplinary team of engineering educators, science and math educators, and medical professionals to meet the immediate and pressing national challenge of providing innovative high school curricula for STEM education.  The project developed a modular curriculum unit that takes an integrated STEM approach, using authentic engineering applications and hands-on experiences to build problem-solving skills and the technological literacy of secondary students as outlined in the ITEA Standards for Technological Literacy and related benchmarks. \n\nSpecifically, the Intellectual Merit included the design, development, testing and implementation of a standards-based curriculum unit entitled Engineering in Healthcare: A Heart-Lung System Case Study that introduces students to engineering design and decision-making processes.  Inquiry-based learning coupled with hands-on experiences was used to maximize student interest and understanding.   In addition, the Heart-Lung curriculum unit together with previously developed INSPIRES units were rewritten into teacher lessons plans with an educative format that include suggested pedagogical approaches to each lesson.   The project also included the design, development, testing and delivery of teacher professional development program (PD) for in-service teachers to enable successful curriculum implementation.  This PD framework is now being expanded and tested at scale in a subsequent project.   The final aspect of the project included research to assess and evaluate the combined impacts of the curricular materials and PD framework on classroom instructional practices and student learning.  After testing the PD framework with 88 STEM teachers, our research has demonstrated changes in teacher pedagogical practice, with statistically significant increases in propositional knowledge (what the instructor knows and how well it is organized and presented in a learner-oriented setting), procedural knowledge (what students do in the classroom to enhance their learning) and classroom culture (number and type of interactions among students and how the instructor facilitates such interactions). Student learning was measured for over 2600 high school students as the study progressed and the curriculum was revised based on our results.  In the final year of testing, statistically significant increases in learning were demonstrated on pre/post unit assessments for both science and engineering concepts.  The level of increase in student learning was shown to be highly dependent on the teacher.  However, increases in student learning were independent of gender or race/ethnicity.  In short, no achievement gaps based on gender or race/ethnicity were present in our learning data.\n\nThe Broader Impact of this project lies in its potential to assist schools to meet contemporary curricular challenges in science and technology education.  With the advent of the Next Generation Science Standards, engineering is now considered part of science.  The INSPIRES Curriculum and teacher professional development framework together provide an example of integrated STEM learning and serve as a national model for how engineering can be incorporated into existing science and technology classrooms.  Our model of hands-on design-based instruction is learner-centered and may help school districts close the achievement gap by promoting equity in the classroom.  Information about the curriculum materials and teacher professional development framework are being disseminated nationally.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modifie..."
