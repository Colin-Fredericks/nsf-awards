 "awd_abstract_narration": "URM:?Integrative Biology For Future Researchers?\r\n\r\nNSF funding will establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring Program in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). The objectives of the URM program are to attract, mentor, and prepare undergraduate students historically underrepresented in scientific research for graduate studies in life sciences. FAU is a minority institution as well as a Hispanic serving university. The undergraduate scholars will participate in weekly meetings with the PIs (academic mentoring) to discuss their projects and receive feedback on their research experience and in activities aimed at strengthening their science related skills. Each student will also be paired with a faculty mentor (research mentoring) who will train and guide the student in the specific area of research of the mentor. The areas of research include; a) Conservation Biology, b) Marine Biology and Behavior, and c) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. These areas will be linked together by judicious choice of projects that will highlight the integrated nature of the program. The FAU-URM program will train students in a variety of research areas that will facilitate their movement into, graduate programs In addition; this URM will enhance the workforce development for SE Florida in anticipation of growing employment opportunities in life science institutions. For example, Scripps of Florida, the Torrey Pines Institute the USGS are adding facilities on or adjacent to FAU campuses as well as a variety of nearby state and federal laboratories. PIs: Rodney Murphey, Florida Atlantic University, Chair of the Department of Biological Sciences rmurphey@fau.edu ; Evelyn Frazier, Florida Atlantic University, Department of Biological Sciences, efrazier@fau.edu.
