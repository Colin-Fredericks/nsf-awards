 "awd_abstract_narration": "The EAST Alliance for Students with Disabilities in STEM ? Phase 2 project ??seeks to build upon prior accomplishments [EAST award, HRD-0333316] and, through a focused approach with regional partners, create a comprehensive ?Pipeline of supports,? which will serve as a model for institutes of higher education nationally? that are advancing high school, undergraduate, and graduate students with disabilities in STEM.  The primary institution is the University of Southern Maine, partnering with three associate degree granting institutions (Southern Maine Community College, Central Maine Community College, Landmark College), and four high schools (Portland?s Deering, Casco Bay and Portland high schools, and Bonny Eagle high school which serves the communities of Buxton, Hollis, Standish and Limington).  \r\n\r\nThe two primary goals of the project are :  Increasing the number of students with disabilities that enroll in STEM majors, specifically natural, biological, chemical, and physical sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, at the primary and partner institutions of post-secondary education, and Increasing the number of undergraduate and graduate students who successfully complete associate degrees, baccalaureate degrees and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines and enter the STEM workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe refined ?steps for success? include two primary foci: Targeted STEM learning experiences for high school students with disabilities, and providing STEM academic support and research experiences for undergraduate students with disabilities. High school interventions will include field-based science research institutes for high school juniors and seniors, college credit coursework in math for high school seniors, and professional educational development for high school math, science and special education teachers. \r\nCollege level interventions will include a learning community for freshman and transfer students, a freshman course in academic self-management, a research course for sophomores and juniors, undergraduate research fellowships in labs, the use of a ?student support team? integrating student support from project and university staff, and a series of faculty educational trainings on how to implement ?universal design for education? principles to facilitate student success.\r\n\r\nThe project will be evaluated by a team from the Education Development Center, led by Dr. Babette Moeller, using a mixed method approach to conduct both formative and summative evaluations.  Dissemination will focus on institutions in the Southern Maine region as well as sharing the model with a national post-secondary audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Research suggests that attrition of people with disabilities from STEM occurs throughout postsecondary education. To increase the number of students with disabilities who successfully complete degrees in STEM and increase the number of students with disabilities who enter the STEM workforce, the University of Southern Maine (USM), with funding from NSF, has established the Eastern Alliance 2 for Students with Disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (EAST-2). Recognizing that career development is influenced by multiple personal, experiential, and contextual factors, EAST-2 has provided a pipeline of multi-faceted evidence-based supports and services for high school and college students with disabilities to help them successfully negotiate critical transitions. The EAST-2 pipeline combines STEM institutes and transition workshops for high school students with learning community seminars, undergraduate STEM research experiences, internships, mentoring, and tutoring for college students.
