 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to produce a commercial prototype of a state-of-the-art high throughput scanning probe microscope (HT-SPM), which can be used for measuring topography and thermal parameters in nanotechnology, bio, and semiconductor applications. The scanning probe microscope has been a very successful tool, but emphasis has not been put on rapid data acquisition. The HT-SPM is an enabling technology that consists of a transformative and patented method for extracting topography which allows for higher throughput. The project leverages experience in atomic force microscope (AFM) probe micro-fabrication and industry. An immediate outcome of this SBIR project will be a fully functional and market ready HT-SPM. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of measurements in nanometer scale devices and structures have both scientific and industrial importance. Although the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is one of the most important tools for nanotechnology, there has not been any fundamental innovation in the way it operates for more than a decade. This project provides faster measurement as a result of a fundamentally different way of imaging. Faster characterization permits manufacturers to expedite problem isolation, leading to higher productivity and higher return-on-investment (ROI). The HT-SPM also benefits R&D, failure analysis and off-line engineering. The HT-SPM offers critical capabilities that will allow users too quickly and clearly measure topography/friction/temperature at the nanoscale and view critical characteristics. The HT-SPM fills a critical need in integrated circuits, nanotechnology, life sciences and other markets that rely on sub-micron microscopy, as it will provide users with a superior and inexpensive measurement system to aid in studying new properties.",
