 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II aims to develop a catalytically active filtration device for the continuous removal of particulate matter from diesel engine exhaust. Particulate emissions from diesel engines are viewed as a significant health hazard. New diesel fuel and exhaust emission regulations to be phased in through 2010 require that diesel engine exhaust be extensively cleaned; current purification products are considered too large, too expensive and impose too great a fuel economy penalty on the diesel engine. A particulate filtration system that continuously oxidizes particulate matter using oxygen contained in the engine exhaust and does not require regeneration will be prepared, characterized and refined. The technology that will be developed has the capability to remove ultra-fine particulates with dimensions as small as 20 nm. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential from the technology will enhance the scientific understanding of the synthesis and stability of novel ceramic nanostructures as well as the interaction of soot with dispersed catalytic species. The successful application of this technology will lower the cost of purifying diesel engine exhaust, enabling wider application of highly fuel efficient diesel engines, which will in turn reduce the overall fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.\r\n",
