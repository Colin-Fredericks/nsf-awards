 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research project is the development at different length scales a fundamental understanding of the strengthening (strain hardening) and micro-damage evolution (strain softening) mechanisms that control the strength and ductility of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) through integration of theory and computational simulation focusing on how the sizes and the interfaces of micro- and nano-level inclusions (particles) influence the overall macroscopic properties of AHSS. This objective will be achieved by developing robust multi-scale theoretical and computational techniques that can be used to effectively predict the effects of microstructural features on the overall macroscopic mechanical properties of multi-phase materials.\r\n\r\nResults from this project will impact the widespread development and design of new generations of AHSS that are expected to broadly impact the automobile, aerospace, infrastructure, energy, and defense technologies by manufacturing lightweight and stronger (i.e. longer life) systems. This research project is also expected to provide hands-on experience for undergraduate and graduate education in the field of new generation materials and state-of-the-art computational capabilities at the micron and submicron length scales. As a direct result of this work, it is expected that numerous journal articles will be published, as well as numerous workshops and presentations will be made.",
