A scaleable, agent-based model (ABM) at the facility project-level will be developed and tested under the hypothesis that it will be able to more accurately predict the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a green facility at the earliest stages of concept development.  The agent-based model will allow definition of both the social and engineering systems that characterize a facilities lifecycle.  The project includes several partner public agencies with significant facility portfolios that wish to use policy measures (including additional investment) to increase both project sustainability and overall sustainability of their capital project portfolios in ways that make economic sense.  The outcomes of this research are intended to further the goals of sustainability in public sector capital projects by providing a more comprehensive picture of the relationships between investment and outcomes.  The project will impact research and undergraduate education at both Virginia Tech and Lafayette College, an undergraduate institution.  In addition, the project will (a) target the recruitment of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in this project; (b) create a sustainability game and kit underpinned by ABM for use in secondary math and science courses as well as at the undergraduate level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the last decade, interest in building more sustainable, or \"green\", buildings has increased.  Historically in the public sector, cost estimates for green buildings have been developed in the same manner as those for traditional facilities, except with a premium added to account for \"sustainability costs\" due to uncertainty about innovative technologies and processes and lack of previous projects to serve as a baseline.  Initial cost estimation occurs during the earliest design phase, when funding allocation is sought but very little is known about the actual building design.  This premium creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that results in green buildings costing more, which reinforces the perception in the construction industry that green construction is not cost competitive.  This research explored whether an approach called \"agent-based modeling\" could improve the way such costs are estimated, which ultimately could lead to a more accurate estimate and eliminate the need for a \"green premium\".\n\nAgent-based modeling allows us to account for the high degree of systems integration and the interactions among stakeholders in green projects.
