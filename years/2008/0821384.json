With an efficient combination of all possible sources of information, the work focuses on the acquisition of high-level geometry information and intelligent integration of laser-based models to reconstruct detailed models of urban sites, i.e., digital cities. Laser scanner can produce highly-detailed geometry, whereas color digital cameras can produce photorealistic representations of urban scenes. The work allows\r\n-\tAcquiring large amounts of data with the latest generation of laser range scanning and 2D image capturing technology,\r\n-\tGenerating CAD-quality models by the integration of laser-based with image-based 3D acquisition technology, \r\n-\tBuilding models using the rapid prototyping system, and\r\n-\tAttracting students into visual and applied research.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project enables the completion of a comprehensive software system for automated photorealistic acquisition of urban environments that will benefit applications such as urban planning, archeology, Google Earth/Microscope Visual Earth visualizations, disaster recovery, architecture, film industry, and construction industry. The large female and undergraduate minority population at this minority-serving institution is likely to benefit from this work.",
