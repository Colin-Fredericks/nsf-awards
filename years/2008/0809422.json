 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program at NSF Division of Chemistry will support the research project of Prof. Sheryl Tucker of the University of Missouri-Columbia. The objective of the study is to investigate the properties of recently developed supramolecular capsules in order to gain better understanding of these unique, manmade nanocontainers, discover the extent of their versatility through modifications, and push the creative limits of their use. Prof. Tucker and her students will examine which species are most successfully ensnared and organized within supramolecular capsules. They will also create chiral nanopockets to facilitate selective host-guest interactions and design new nanocapsules with the ability to communicate with each other through extended space. An increased understanding of the principles governing the capsule self-assembly, host-guest properties and reaction chemistry in a nanoscale microenvironment will lead to an improvement of existing materials, the creation of new nanocapsules and provide insight into living systems. The study will impact a wide range of practical applications including drug delivery systems, microreactors, molecular recognition components, catalysts and separation resins. To further advance research and education infrastructures and partnerships, this research program includes trainees from traditionally underrepresented groups, who are involved in an interdisciplinary research program at the forefront and interface of materials and analytical sciences, and ignites children's interest in science through the nationally recognized \"Magic of Chemistry\" outreach program.",
