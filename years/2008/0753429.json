Utah Valley State College (UVSC) will partner with the cyber-infrastructure (CI) directors in the Navajo Nation to increase the number of computer diagnostic technicians, network maintenance, and cyber-skilled personnel utilizing the installed CI of the Navajo Nation. The physical cyber-infrastructure is already in place for this project, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Navajo Nation. Certiport, Inc., a commercial training company, has and will providing introductory IT skills training in hardware and software up through A+ skills level, creating a pool of students prepared to take advantage of the more advanced training provided by this project. Training of these Navajo technicians to work within the Navajo community will make cyber-technology more accessible to the Navajo people, particularly its youth and young adults, and in opening doors for them to contribute to society as scientists, engineers, educators, and community leaders.",
