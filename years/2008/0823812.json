 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the \"International Workshop in Fourier Analysis and Partial Differential Equations\" that will be held at Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China) from December 15-17, 2008. \r\n\r\nThis workshop is being conducted in conjunction with the joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Shanghai Mathematical Society that will be hosted by Fudan University (Shanghai, China) from December 17-21, 2008. Thus many of the workshop speakers will also speak in the special session on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations at the Shanghai meeting. The confluence of the two meetings ensures that an unusually rich and broad collection of speakers will participate in the workshop. The range of topics is also very impressive, covering such active areas as multi-parameter Fourier analysis, Hardy spaces, Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory, multi-linear singular integrals, subelliptic PDE, dispersive PDE, infinity Laplace equations, and Monge-Ampere equations. The format of the workshop provides ample opportunity for young mathematicians to speak.\r\n",
