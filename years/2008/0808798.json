This project seeks funds to encourage Universities to participate by reimbursing travel expenses and other costs associated with the competition. Student teams are judged on the design, manufacturing price, presentation, vehicle capabilities such as range, weight, handling acceleration, cold start and noise of their vehicles. The objectives of this competition are to train students in technology development, to develop transportation vehicles with reduced impact on the environment, and to educate students and the public about research in the Office of Polar Programs.",
