 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of genome evolution has only recently become possible, due in large part to the advance of comparative genomics. The goal of this project is to develop theory describing important components of genome evolution: genetic divergence and gene duplication. The evolutionary diversification of alleles - genetic divergence - may precede gene duplication and represents an important source of genetic innovation. This project will investigate sources of selection for genetic divergence at several levels of biological organization, including within-organism variability, between-individual variability, and spatial environmental variability. Features of the mechanistic basis of allelic and genetic interactions, such as gene regulation, dimerization, and alternative splicing, will be used to relate changes in alleles during genetic divergence to changes in genes following gene duplication. The functional effects of mutation will then be embedded in models of ecological dynamics. Exploring the common features of selection generated by within-organism and population level variability will also lay groundwork for a comprehensive theory relating evolution at the genome level to the population level phenomena of phenotypic plasticity, genetic robustness, and local adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a quantitative approach to all aspects of biology cannot be overstated. Creating mechanisms that allow mathematical theory in biology to be presented as part of everyday normal activities will help develop a culture of biologists who embrace theory as a normal part of biological research.  This project will contribute to this goal by holding workshops in theoretical biology that are specifically targeted at undergraduate students and women. Because having visible role models enhances participation of women in quantitative fields, women faculty will participate as presenters. This workshop will also serve as a training opportunity for a post-doctoral researcher who will be involved in designing and demonstrating computer exercises. The results of this research will be widely disseminated through publications, lectures, and participation in symposia.\r\n",
