 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation is funding Hobart and William Smith Colleges to study the invasive Fishhook waterflea (Cercopagis pengoi) causes ecological and economic damage to North American lakes.  It continues to spread, likely in its dormant egg stage, which is poorly understood.  An instrumentation network will be created to investigate the production and distribution of the dormant egg in Seneca Lake (New York) in concert with meteorological and lake conditions. The network will combine collection of dormant eggs using automated sediment traps with information about the physical environment from remotely recording instrumentation that will measure water quality, temperature, and current, as well as meteorological conditions. Linking diapausing egg production and distribution with the physical environment will provide a more complete understanding of Cercopagis, essential for predicting, managing, and preventing further invasions. \r\n\r\nThe network will improve the understanding of the ecology of Cercopagis and advance the monitoring  of the New York State Finger Lakes.  Approximately 300 undergraduates will make use of the network and, in a framework of integrated interdisciplinary research. Students will gain experience with field and laboratory techniques, as well as data management, analysis and interpretation.  In addition to student co-authored articles and presentations, the PIs and their student collaborators will develop an online database and website for managing and disseminating the gathered data to the public and scientific communities.\r\n",
