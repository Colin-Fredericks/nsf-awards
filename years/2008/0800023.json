 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research project is to establish the relationship between spatially varying wind loads and structural load paths in wood-framed buildings. Through a combination of analysis of existing wind tunnel data, applying database-assisted design methodology and experimental tests on a 1/3-scale model of a wood-framed residential structure, structural influence surfaces will be developed and used to predict the load time-history on roof truss-to-wall plate connections.  Further, load transfers through the structure are determined from spatially varied simulated wind loads generated using the Hurricane Simulator.  Deliverables include determination of influence surfaces used to predict the structural load distributions through a wood-framed roof and an evaluation of the database-assisted design methodology as applied to wood-framed structures. The research will provide input a preliminary basis for performance-based wind engineering of residential structures.\r\n\r\nThe research is expected to improve the design methods for the wood frame buildings through the use of the performance-based design approach.  The broader impacts will be achieved through educational and technology transfer efforts.  Research results will be disseminated through the ASCE/SEI committees in which the PI is involved.  Recruitment efforts focused on students from underrepresented groups and undergraduate research experiences will be coordinated with existing multicultural affairs programs. Graduate student education, mentorship and training will be done using formative and summative assessment methods and through collaboration among the students and the PI.  \r\n",
