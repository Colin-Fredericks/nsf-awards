 "awd_abstract_narration": "The West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS) is a 15-year tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United States. Its intellectual merits include: providing an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results; furnishing an opportunity for researchers to learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; fostering collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with one another.  Among the broader impacts of WCOAS are the encouragement and nurturing of graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; creation and maintenance of a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; fostering connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions.\r\n",
