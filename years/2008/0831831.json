 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProviding each node in a multihop wireless network with one or \r\nmore multi-channel radios offers a promising avenue for improving \r\nthe networking performance. Recently, the impact of multiple channels \r\nand radios on network throughput has been extensively studied. But \r\nlittle is known about their impact on communication latency, which \r\nis an important performance metric for a broad class of time-critical \r\napplications such as emergency response and disaster recovery. While \r\nit is of no doubt that multiple channels and radios hold potentials \r\nof reducing the communication latency, what really matters is how \r\nmuch benefit can be realized by specific algorithms. This research \r\nconducts comprehensive algorithmic studies of minimizing the \r\ncommunication latency by utilizing multiple channels and radios. \r\nThe algorithms developed in this research can be applied directly \r\nto support real-time applications in multihop wireless networks. \r\nThe theoretical analysis of the performance against the number of \r\nchannels and/or the number of radios can also provide guidance to \r\nindustries on cost-effective design of multihop wireless networks.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the communication schedules for four \r\nprimitive communication tasks which are involved in almost all\r\napplications: broadcasting, aggregation, gathering, and beaconing. \r\nThe problem of seeking a shortest communication schedule for each \r\nof these four tasks is NP-hard. The investigators develop \r\nconstant-approximation algorithms for them and analyze the impact \r\nof the number of channels and the number of radios on the latencies \r\nof the constructed communication schedules. This research is of \r\ninterest to a number of research communities, and may serve as a \r\nbasis for interesting future projects on multi-channel multi-radio \r\nmultihop wireless networks. Both student training and curriculum \r\ndevelopment are integrated into this research.\r\n\r\n",
