 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns about changes in the world's environment have led scientists from many different nations to collaborate on a broad range of research and training activities.  Many of these activities are coordinated by one or more of major international organizations, including the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), which is overseen by the World Meteorological Organization; the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which is overseen by the International Council of Science (ICSU); and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), which is overseen by the International Council of Science (ICSU) with cooperation from the International Social Science Council (ISSC).  The IHDP aims to provide international leadership in framing, developing, and integrating social science research on global environmental change and to promote the application of the key findings of this research.  IHDP's activities focus on development of themes for focused research and long-term collaborative efforts. It addresses critical gaps in international research on global change, including (1) the gap in contributions of the social, economic and cognitive sciences; (2) the gap in capacity for international and interdisciplinary collaboration in the area; and (3) the lack of coherent long-term research strategies for policy-relevant research topics and enhanced science-policy interaction.  This award will provide support for the IHDP Secretariat, which coordinates IHDP at the United National University in Bonn, Germany.  The IHDP Secretariat facilitates IHDP's Programme and implements the strategic priorities. Its core functions encompass coordination of research activities, capacity building, organization of major events and policy dialogues, and dissemination of outcomes and results of IHDP activities.  Core support for the IHDP and its Secretariat is provided by NSF on behalf of agencies participating in the multi-agency U.S. Climate Change Research Program.\r\n\r\nThrough support of the IHDP, a solid investment is made in the infrastructure that fosters broader and deeper international, interdisciplinary collaborative networks.  This further strengthens scientific inquiry across a range of topics and projects, thereby helping to enhance fundamental knowledge about very important topics and issues.  Through its capacity-building activities, especially support for activities that education and involve more scientists from developing nations, the IHDP also facilitates a strengthening and diversification of the international scientific workforce.",
