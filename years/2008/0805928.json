The PI is pursuing to solve or\r\nmake progress on some basic problems in the following two areas: collapsed\r\nRiemannian manifolds with curvature bounded from below and positively\r\ncurved manifolds with symmetry. In this research, mathematics from several\r\ndisciplines interact, such as metric comparison geometry including\r\nAlexandrov geometry, geometric analysis and topology. This project is buit\r\non the early success by PI in the study of the collapsed Riemannian\r\nmanifolds with curvature bounded from above and below.\r\n\r\nMathematics is the foundation of the natural sciences, and\r\ndifferential geometry and Riemannian geometry are among the most important\r\nbranches that interact with other natural sciences such as physics. The PI\r\nis pursuing to solve some basic problems in the above fields, which will have a broad intellectual impact. The PI will continue to actively pursue collaborations with other mathematicians in the United States and abroad, and speak at several national and international conferences in the next three years.\r\n",
