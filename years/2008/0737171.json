 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering (56) This project is developing and testing a set of laboratory modules and kits that is allowing  engineering and science undergraduate students to explore microscale fluid behaviors and microfluidic devices. These new learning materials, called Micro-Fluidics Laboratory (MFL) Modules and Kits, not only allow undergraduate students to see miniature science and engineering events through engaging laboratory classes, but also provide opportunities to apply science and engineering principles to microscale phenomena and compare them with macroscale observations. These MFL modules and kits also help faculty instructors acquire new knowledge and skills in the rapidly growing field of microfluidics. In total, 7 MFL modules and kits, 4 elementary and 3 advanced, are being developed and tested via 4 courses. At present, microfluidics technology is rapidly spreading and is being adapted widely to many areas of industry and research, from new means of drug delivery and clinical diagnosis to next-generation, propellant-free aerosols and fuel cells for consumer electronics. This project is addressing the lack of microfluidics education in the current engineering curricula by developing and providing a packaged suite of comprehensive laboratory modules and kits. The MFL modules and kits enable engineering programs to offer microfluidics education in their curricula, increasing the opportunities for engineering and science students to be exposed to the emerging field of microfluidics early in the formative years of their career.",
