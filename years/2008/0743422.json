 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely recognized that electrostatic energy is useful and necessary for correlating the structure of proteins with their function.  Electrostatics governs key energy transduction processes in biological systems, such as catalysis, H+ transport and e- transfer reactions, ion homeostasis, and the transduction of light into chemical or mechanical energy.  Electrostatic forces modulate the solubility of proteins and their interactions with self and with a range of molecules.  The long-term goal of this project is to further understanding of electrostatic effects in proteins in order to advance our understanding of the structural basis of their structure, stability and function. Proteins are dynamic; therefore, they exist as ensembles of molecules in many different conformations, separated by small energy distances, and in relatively fast inter-conversion. In the time scale of biochemical processes, ionizable residues sample many different environments. These studies will test the hypothesis that the flexibility and conformational fluctuations of proteins are important determinants of their electrostatic properties.  This is a problem that has not received much attention from the experimental perspective, and a problem that has to be solved before the accuracy of computational models for calculation of electrostatic free energy and pKa values can be improved.  Experiments with NMR spectroscopy are designed to examine backbone dynamics (with 15N-relaxation measurements) and the dynamics of local structural fluctuations (with NMR-detected backbone amide hydrogen exchange).  Variants of staphylococcal nuclease will be studied in which the pKa values of His, Asp or Glu residues are perturbed by substitutions designed specifically to increase backbone flexibility and local fluctuations.  The physical insight and the data emerging from these experiments will be used to benchmark and to guide further development of a novel ensemble-based continuum electrostatics method for structure-based calculation of pKa values. Other experiments were designed to examine electrostatic effects in unfolded proteins.  The goal is to determine the physical basis and the magnitude of these effects experimentally, to assess how electrostatics affect the physical properties of unstructured polypeptides, and to develop computational algorithms for structure-based quantitation of these effects.  These studies will impact structure-based calculations of electrostatic contributions to stability, which presently assume, incorrectly, that electrostatic effects in unfolded proteins are negligible. \r\n\r\nThe data and insight that will emerge from these studies will be useful to scientists focused on the development of computational tools to study protein structure, energy and function. These studies have a direct bearing on problems in protein design and in biotechnology.  The principal investigator is actively involved in teaching and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, in promoting the participation of minorities in science, and in the development of a modern science curriculum for undergraduates.  His research is dovetailed with his teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students.  He directs a computer lab for teaching molecular biophysics to undergraduates.  During the previous funding cycle the principal investigator developed a course in cell and molecular biology and biochemistry for physical scientists and engineers, and an advanced undergraduate seminar where students get to apply biophysical concepts to solve problems in biology.  The principal investigator will continue the practice of teaching through the use of computers to simulate and analyze the phenomena that are studied experimentally in his laboratory.  Undergraduate students will actively participate in the research.  The principal investigator is also going to host middle and high school students in his lab, to let them experience the world of research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sponsored experimental and computational studies of fundamental structural and physical properties of proteins.   Proteins are charged molecules.  The majority of charges are found on the surface of the protein, at the interface between protein and bulk water.  These surface charges determine many important biological and physical properties, including solubility, interactions, stability, dynamics, and function.   A battery of biophysical methods, including NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, equilibrium thermodynamic measurements, and structure-based energy calculations were used to examine the hypothesis that changes in the charge state of proteins involves concomitant changes in the flexibility and other dynamic properties of the backbone of the protein.  A series of NMR spectroscopy experiments demonstrated conclusively that that is indeed the case.   The flexibility of the protein changes in the region where ionizable groups are found when the charge state changes in response to modest changes in pH.  The effect is subtle but important: this coupling between charge state and flexibility has many consequences.  For example, an independent set of experiments demonstrated directly that the interactions between surface charges are inherently weak.  They interact as if they were embedded in water, and the presence of the protein, which has properties very different than those of water, appears to have no impact.    This reflects the disorganization of the backbone and how, as a consequences, this places surfaces groups in water more than is reflected in the static structure of the protein.  This does not necessarily imply that interactions between surface charges are always weak.  An interesting cluster of ionizable residues in the active site of an enzyme was studied with NMR spectroscopy and the data showed that in some situations, charge-charge interactions can be strong and give rise to unexpected behavior.   One reason these results are exciting is that they challenge many widely accepted paradigms of protein electrostatics.  Our experimental results will force a reexamination of computational algorithms for structure-based calculation of energy in proteins, which is important in a wide variety of contexts and practical applications.  A second hypothesis was examined that attempted to settle a 100 year old controversy concerning the reasons that proteins are unfolded upon exposure to high hydrostatic pressure.  Our hypothesis posited that the unfolding of proteins by pressure was driven by the presence of empty cavities in the folded forms of proteins that are absent when the proteins are denatured.  We engineered a set of proteins that have empty cavities in their interior.  We determined crystal structures of these proteins to demonstrate that there are, indeed, cavities in their interior.  The unfolding of the proteins with high hydrostatic pressure was monitored with steady state Trp fluorescence and with NMR spectroscopy.   The data are rich and complex, but they showed, beyond reasonable doubt, that proteins are sensitive to high hydrostatic pressure owing to the void volume, the empty cavities and defects, present in the folded state.  These results are very exciting and they have laid the groundwork for a considerable amount of future research on the general properties of cavities in proteins.  Cavities are essential for many functional purposes and they govern important aspects of correlated dynamics and long-range communication within proteins.  These are areas that will be studied in the future.\n\n \n\nThis research program has had a significant impact beyond that related to progress in fundamental scientific questions.   A large group of students from all levels, high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral, received training in experimental and computational biophysics.
