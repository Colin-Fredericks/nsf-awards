 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12).  This collaborative project is using the acquisition of a GC/MS instrument to develop project-based laboratory experiments that use guided-inquiry learning experiences to integrate research and education as well as to provide interdisciplinary applications. The experiments are focusing on: (1) the identification of odoriferous organosulfur compounds in Citrus paradisi (grapefruit); (2) the analysis of volatile components of wines, perfumes, and spices; (3) the quantitative determination of orotic acid in urine; and (4) an interdisciplinary experiment relating the odor constituents of Bignonia capreolata (Louisiana crossvine).  The laboratory experiences include participating in research projects such as: (a) the GC/MS determination of organic compounds in Sibley Lake (adjacent to NSU) as part of a broader project to monitor surface water quality in northern Louisiana lakes; (b) the investigation of Louisiana crossvine scent includes research into which constituents attract which pollinators and other interdisciplinary field studies; and (c) the quantitative determination of orotic acid in urine is part of a broader investigation of GC/MS applications in clinical chemistry.  The broader impact of the project includes the integration of research and education for science majors, non-science majors, and K-12 students.  The project also enhances the infrastructure for research and education by providing modern scientific instrumentation to stimulate research and educational collaborations among several institutions in northern Louisiana that have significant numbers of underrepresented students.  The evaluation and dissemination plan is providing a model for how guided inquiry, research experiences, and collaboration can be used to augment the STEM skills in a large and diverse group of current and future STEM educators, professionals, and students.",
