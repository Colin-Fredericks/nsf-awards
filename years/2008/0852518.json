These fishes are ideal models for comparative studies, since they share many features in common with higher vertebrates including humans that are involved in homeostasis of body fluids. Hormones involved in osmoregulatory adaptation in fish can be classified into two categories; fast-acting hormones and slow- but long-acting hormones. Interactions between the two categories of the hormones are not well understood. The goals of the proposal are to 1) integrate areas of scientific inquiry that are typically distinct and separate from one another, i.e., fast-acting hormones vs. long-lasting hormones, and eel vs. tilapia; 2) initiate collaborative research to identify key genes and proteins that regulate activities of relevant endocrine systems in both eel and tilapia in response to environmental changes in salinity; 3) develop new methods, concepts and approaches by exposing young scientists to a unique mixture of knowledge and training not available in a single laboratory, and 4) foster personal and professional relationships that will extend beyond the proposed work. Young scientists, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, and faculty on both sides will participate in minisymposia and workshops as well as have short-term training experiences in Dr. Takei?s lab. \r\n\r\n",
