 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator seeks to discover novel ways of harnessing quantum phenomena to advance the computational capabilities of information processing devices. This fundamental research leads to new efficient quantum algorithms for problems that cannot be solved efficiently by any known classical algorithm. These quantum algorithms make it possible to solve more efficiently larger instances of computationally hard real-life problems, such as those arising in optimization theory, machine learning, and signal processing. A second component of the research focuses on developing new quantum algorithms for algebraic problems which helps to design more secure cryptographic protocols that are immune to quantum attacks. This is important as today's encryption schemes have to withstand attacks employing more advanced computational devices in the future. More fundamentally, this research provides a deeper understanding of the computational capabilities of information processing devices operating in the quantum regime. As the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based devices approaches, it is essential to explore such novel paradigms of information technologies.\r\n\r\nThe investigator finds new quantum algorithms for computing with large matrices. This research leads to new applications in machine learning, signal processing, and data analysis by achieving speed-ups for principal component analysis and kernel methods. These quantum algorithms also find applications in optimization theory and topology by providing better approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization and counting problems and more accurate evaluations of topological invariants, respectively. A second component of the research focuses on quantum algorithms for identifying group-theoretic and non-linear structures. The research goal is to extend them to a broad collection of structures arising in number theory and algebraic geometry, especially those that are relevant to cryptographic applications.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary of Outcomes Covering the Entire Life of the Award\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe PI obtained results in quantum computing / quantum information theory and spectral graph theory.\n\nHamiltonian Quantum Simulation\n\nThe first major motivation for building quantum computers is that they could serve as universal quantum simulators.  The abilty to efficiently simulate large quantum systems would result in a huge advancement of the fields of quantum information, condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. \n\nFor instance, the PI proposed new efficient methods for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum systems by relying only on bounded-strength controls operations.  Previous methods required bang-bang control pulses, which are often unrealistic,  to effectively change the fixed system Hamiltonian to the desired target Hamiltonian. \n\nQuantum Algorithms \n\nThe second major motivation for building quantum computers is that they could solve some problems that are intractable for classical computers.  The PI conducted research finding new efficient quantum algorithms.\n\nFor instance, the PI obtained quantum algorithms for evaluating partition functions of classical and quantum systems.  He also obtained several new quantum algorithms for number-theoretic problems and algebraic problems.\n\nSpectral Graph Theory\n\nThe PI adopted ideas used in proving lower bounds on the complexity of converting one Hamiltonian into another to obtain new graph-theoretical results.  The most relevant result is a new lower bound on the chromatic number, which is an important property of graphs. \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe PI contriubted to the education of six Ph.D. students, four undergraduate students, and two postdoctoral scholars.  The PI also participated in the 10th Canadian Summer School on Quantum Information, where he lectured on quantum algorithms to undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nThe PI dissiminated his research findings by giving numerous presentations at conferences, workshops, and universities in the US and abroad and posting them on the preprint arxiv. \n\nThe research has impacts on fields outside quantum computing and quantum information theory.  For instance, the new results on quantum algorithms for number-theoretic and algebraic problem show that certain cryptographic schemes would be broken if we could a working quantum computer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pawel M Wocjan"
