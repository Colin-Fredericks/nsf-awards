 "awd_abstract_narration": "III-CXT:  Learning from graph-structured data: new algorithms for  \r\nmodeling physical interactions in cellular networks\r\n\r\nThe complex behavior of the cell derives from an intricate network of  \r\nmolecular interactions of thousands of genes and their products.   \r\nUnderstanding how this network operates and predicting its behavior  \r\nare primary goals of biology and have broad implications for life  \r\nscience, medicine and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe genomic information revolution of the last ten years has enabled  \r\nnew systems-level and data-driven approaches for studying cellular  \r\nnetworks.  In particular, using machine learning to model gene  \r\nregulatory networks---the switching on and off of genes by regulatory  \r\nproteins that bind to non-coding DNA---has emerged as a central  \r\nproblem in systems biology.  Now, an explosion of new high-throughput  \r\ntechnologies for measuring physical interactions between proteins and  \r\nbetween protein and DNA provides a new data integration challenge for  \r\ncomputational modeling of gene regulation.  These new data can all be  \r\nviewed as graph-structured data, or physical interaction networks.\r\n\r\nThe central computational goal of this project is to develop new  \r\nmachine learning learning algorithms for exploiting graph-structured  \r\ndata, including: (1) boosting with efficient graph mining; (2) graph  \r\nkernels based on subgraph histogramming; and (3) information-based  \r\ngraph partitioning.  These new algorithms will be used to integrate  \r\nphysical interaction network data into models of gene regulation in  \r\norder to better represent underlying biological mechanisms.  The  \r\nfocus will be two fundamental modeling problems: inferring signal  \r\ntransduction pathways and modeling cis regulatory modules at the  \r\nlevel of DNA sequence and interacting regulatory proteins.  The  \r\nalgorithms will be applied both to publicly available data and to  \r\nprimary gene expression data provided by one of the investigators to  \r\nstudy the hypoxia in yeast and the response to environmental toxins  \r\nin mammalian neural cells.\r\n\r\nThis project will learn systems-level models that lead to new insight  \r\ninto the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation and open the way to  \r\nbroader biological discoveries.  All data, results and source code  \r\nwill be publicly available via the Web (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/ \r\ncompbio/cellular-networks) and disseminated through courses and  \r\nbioinformatics software packages.  The project will also create  \r\nundergraduate research opportunities for joint dry and wet lab  \r\nprojects and outreach activities to introduce New York City public  \r\nhigh school students to new interdisciplinary areas of science.\r\n",
