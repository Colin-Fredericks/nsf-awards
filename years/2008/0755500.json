 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on computational science and cybersecurity at the University of Houston. Each year, ten students are to be recruited from institutions that offer limited research opportunities.   The program emphasized steering non-traditional students into research, reinforcing their interest in computer science, and providing professional development opportunities for the students. Research in these areas of national importance is overseen by an interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and is reinforced through site visits to cutting-edge research laboratories in the local area.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited research environments. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.",
