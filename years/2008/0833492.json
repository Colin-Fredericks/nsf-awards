 "awd_abstract_narration": "ARI-MA: Transformational Scintillation Materials for Neutron and Gamma Detectors and Educational Integration \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop transformative scintillation materials for use in neutron and gamma radiation detectors that will notably advance the technology for detecting nuclear threats.  The approach is to utilize a diverse team with expertise in scintillation materials, chemistry, physics, imaging, radiation metrology and transport, and nuclear engineering.  The senior investigators have unique access to neutron and reactor facilities at Oak Ridge and around the world to facilitate the development of next generation scintillation materials for advanced radiation detection.\r\nThe intellectual merit will include the development of polymeric nano-composites for neutron and photon detection with high efficiency and energy resolution. In addition, new materials and methods for the fabrication of crystalline based neutron and gamma ray detectors will be developed.  Neutron detectors with capabilities for rejection of photon counts will be developed through the use of suitable geometric, composition, and pulse shape characteristics. This type of research is essential for developing the basic science and novel materials required for next generation radiation detection.\r\nBroader impacts will include the development of technology to manufacture large volumes of inexpensive neutron scintillation materials using structural composite techniques. Trained students and personnel from this project will contribute to advancing future nuclear threat detection technology.  New course materials and laboratory exercise modules will be developed and incorporated into distance learning programs to impact large numbers of students from nuclear engineering and related programs throughout the United States.  \r\n",
