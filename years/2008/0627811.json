 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) recognizes outstanding mentoring efforts or programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering.\r\n\r\nRicardo B. Jacquez, professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University, has mentored and served as a role model for hundreds of students for more than two decades. As Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) director at New Mexico State, he has earned a reputation for providing new research activities for community college students, and for giving high school students from underrepresented groups reasons to aspire to STEM study in their postsecondary education. Jacquez has had a role in building professional learning community partnerships in K-12, community colleges and undergraduate and graduate programs. He involves students in research, develops their critical thinking and communications skills, and exposes them to activities and experiences that contribute to their workforce readiness or preparation for graduate studies. Since New Mexico LSAMP's inception in 1993, STEM degree awards have increased from 253 in l992-93 to 580 in 2003-04. Over the same period, the percentage of baccalaureate degrees awarded to underrepresented students has increased from 24 percent to 42 percent.\r\n\r\n",
