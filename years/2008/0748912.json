Professor Ragan and her students will utilize scanning probe microscopy integrated with fluorescence microscopy to characterize systems with molecular scale resolution.   It is expected that the fundamental knowledge gained from these studies will lead to devices with enhanced performance for drug discovery and environmental monitoring.  Professor Ragan will also provide advanced analytical training for high school students at a local high school that serves a predominantly Hispanic student body in order to increase and retain the number of students from under represented groups attending UC Irvine in science, engineering and mathematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\nAdvances in electron optics, scanning probe microscopies, and time-resolved spectroscopies allow us to probe matter at the atomic level on femtosecond time scales. Nevertheless many important technology platforms still require the ability to fabricate systems on molecular length scales using methods that are easily translated into large-area production for device realization.  Correlating physical properties with fabrication method and materials is also critical since properties are highly dependent on atomic arrangement on surfaces and local atomic composition.  Synergistic fabrication, atomic scale characterization and theoretical modeling were combined in this project for (1) metal nanoarchitecture fabrication for improved understanding of light-matter interactions for photovoltaics and sensor surfaces; and (2) understanding the role of interfacial chemistry to produce robust biomolecular/chemical sensors.  During project period, we have developed systematic methods to understand how the method of fabrication and material interfaces affect electronic response in nanowire sensors, optical response of nanoparticle based sensors, and mechanical properties/stability of membrane sensors.  This characterization led to understanding of how to optimize chemical assembly of inorganic nanoparticles to reproducibly achieve clusters of nanoparticles with molecular scale inter-particle spacing needed to reliably detect (bio)chemical agents.  We have devised systems to understand self-assembly of cell membrane mimics on patterned array surfaces for probing protein-cell membrane interactions in a high-throughput manner.   \n\nBroader Impact\nDeveloping scalable methods for fabricating metal nanoarchitectures on sub-lithographic length scales enable fabrication of optical sensors with low molecular detection limits.  Such sensors can be used for detection of low chemical concentrations in ambient for environmental monitoring or biomolecular detection in solution for molecular diagnostics.  In the case of molecular assembly of artificial cell membranes, these sensors can be used for high throughput studies of protein interactions within cell membranes.  This is an area that has tremendous potential in expanding drug discovery and improving human health.  For example, protein induced pore formation in bacterial cell membranes is one strategy that is being mimicked to create new antibiotics.\nDuring the funding period, activities have involved participation in science and engineering outreach activities by and to underrepresented groups in STEM. Presentations about nanoscience were given at a high school (Youth Empowerment School/YES) and elementary school (ASCEND) in Oakland and a high school (Don Bosco Technical high school) in Los Angeles that serve populations that includes underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  The role of nanomaterials in everyday materials such as sunscreen, paint, clothing and structural materials was discussed to elementary students.  State of the art research was presented to high school students.  In the case of high school presentations, career paths resulting from undergraduate and graduate training in nanomaterials was discussed.  The University of California System was introduced as a potential avenue for undergraduate training.  Due to close proximity to UCI, Don Bosco Tech students visited UC Irvine during the funding period to tour state of the art research facilities. Via these activities, we have had several Don Bosco Tech students enroll in our undergraduate program on campus.  Some of the initial students have received B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Regina Ragan"
