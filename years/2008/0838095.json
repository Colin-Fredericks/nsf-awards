 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipids are a fundamental requirement for all cellular life. Lipids form the basis for cellular compartmentation, provide for the organization of energy transduction machinery, serve as storage reserves to support normal growth and development, and act as signals in cellular communication networks. Plant-derived oils provide a major source of calories for humans and include essential dietary components required by all mammals. Furthermore, there are growing numbers of examples of plant-derived lipids that have important therapeutic applications. Despite their involvement in virtually all aspects of biology and importance to society, lipids are by far the least well understood of the major cellular components and tend to be an underrepresented topic at larger plant biology meetings. As such, plant lipids deserve to be at the focus of a detailed, coordinated research effort by a diverse group of scientists. In response, in 2007, the Gordon Research Conference Board of Directors approved a new conference for February 2009 entitled Plant Lipids: Structure, Metabolism and Function - a major step forward for the plant lipid community. This conference should accelerate research, facilitate wide dissemination of research breakthroughs, support recruitment of young scientists to the field of plant lipid biology and encourage broad participation of the plant lipid community in guiding future directions for research. The topics and participants in the program have been brought together from two groups and concepts that have been treated separately in national and international venues, one group with a focus on biochemistry and molecular biology and one group with a focus on signaling functions.  The conference will bring together senior- and junior-level scientists involved in plant lipid metabolism and function and thus facilitate the sharing of a broad range of insights.  Applications from underrepresented minority participants will be encouraged and a dedicated committee will help to identify and support diverse participation in the conference.",
