 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to The Cleveland Museum of Natural History to \r\nupdate an aging microscope facility that supports research and training \r\nacross multiple scientific disciplines. Currently, the Museum openly \r\noffers all Museum departments and colleagues (and their students) from \r\nother institutions microscopes with digital cameras and computer \r\nsoftware for scientific analysis of images of Museum specimens. This \r\ngrant will fund the purchase of two new microscopes with digital cameras \r\nand the computers and software needed for image analysis. A third camera \r\nwill be purchased to update the existing equipment. The Museum intends \r\nto continue allowing access to visiting researchers. The original \r\nresearch will allow for continued work in diverse areas of invertebrate \r\nzoology, including 1) descriptions of new species of wasps; 2) \r\nelucidation of the biology of the immature stages of various insect \r\ngroups; 3) the application of entomological data to crime scene \r\ninvestigation; and 4) the use of aquatic insects as indicators of \r\necosystem health in wetlands.\r\n\r\nThe Museum is committed to obtaining a better understanding of the \r\nnatural world and our place in it. Research in the broader areas of \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem health will provide descriptive data that \r\nwill generate hypotheses to be tested. Data obtained using modern \r\nmicroscopy equipment and image analysis will generate data for \r\napplication to practical questions, such as forensic entomology and \r\nconservation biology. One of the new systems will be mobile, allowing it \r\nto be used in Museum galleries for public interaction and incorporation \r\ninto the Museum's Distance Learning Studios for remote classroom \r\nexperiences. All equipment will be stored and used in a room visible to \r\nthe visiting public to ensure they understand the behind-the-scenes \r\nworld of Museum research and public service.\r\n",
