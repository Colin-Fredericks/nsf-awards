 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reduced genetic diversity has been shown to decrease immune function in several species. This study will test the hypothesis that reduced genetic diversity leads to decreased immune function and increased potential for disease transmission in the Asian tiger mosquito, a species that is a significant vector of human pathogens.  In order to test this prediction, a standard immune function test and experimental infections with pathogens will be conducted for non-inbred mosquitoes, and for mosquitoes that have been inbred in order to reduce genetic diversity.  The prediction is that immune function will be lower and pathogen susceptibility will be higher for inbred as compared to control mosquitoes. \r\n\r\nMosquito-vectored diseases, including malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever, represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing modern society. Although it is well established that local populations of mosquitoes can vary extensively in their ability to transmit such diseases, the underlying causes of this variation are not well understood.  By investigating the relationship between genetic diversity, immune response and pathogen susceptibility, this study will have important implications for understanding vector-pathogen interactions and factors affecting the transmission of vector-borne disease.\r\n\r\n",
