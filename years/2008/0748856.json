 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nA Bose-Einstein condensate is like a cold gas, but instead of liquefying into a high-density droplet at low temperatures, the gas particles remain dilute.  However, they behave collectively like a large single quantum particle.  To make electrons form a Bose-Einstein condensate, one must find a way to cause them to bind together in pairs before they can collapse into this curious low temperature phase.  It is the goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Northwestern University to study a new way of pairing electrons inside of thin layers of the semiconductor aluminum arsenide, in order to realize a Bose-Einstein condensate.  Discovering and studying new realizations of quantum condensates will deepen our understanding of this exotic phenomenon, and the technology developed along the way may illuminate new concepts for making quantum computers.  The educational component of this project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the techniques of solid-state research.  The outreach element will bring science into the public eye by coordinating the efforts of students and faculty in the theater, engineering, and science departments to present scientifically themed plays.  The plays will be performed in the lecture halls of the science and engineering building for an audience of university students, local high school students, and community members.\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nA Bose-Einstein condensate is a rare example of a quantum coherent state of matter.  Particles must first pair to form bosons, and then at low enough temperatures, these bosons condense into a single coherent wave-like ground state characterized collectively by a single order parameter.  In aluminum arsenide, electrons have an extra label called the valley index, and it is the goal of this Faculty Early Career Development project at Northwestern University to apply high magnetic fields and low temperatures to a single quantum well of aluminum arsenide to induce the electrons from different valleys to pair and Bose-condense.  Discovering and studying new realizations of quantum condensates will deepen our understanding of quantum coherence, and the technology developed along the way may illuminate new concepts for quantum information storage and manipulation.  The educational component of this project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the techniques of solid-state research. The outreach element will bring science into the public eye by coordinating the efforts of students and faculty in the theater, engineering, and science departments to present scientifically themed plays.
