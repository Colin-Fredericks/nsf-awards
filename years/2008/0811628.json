 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract 0811628\r\n\r\nCheyney University of Pennsylvania is implementing Inquiry-Discovery based instruction throughout the chemistry and biology curricula. Most importantly, the incorporation of research equipment ?- an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC), a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) and a microwave-assisted synthesis device (the Discover Lab Mate) -- completes our inventory of equipment needed to fulfill the requirements by the American Chemical Society (ACS) for an approved and accredited chemistry program. A strong Inquiry-Discovery based curricula in chemistry and biology, coupled with an ACS approved chemistry program, provides a good recruitment tool for the Science and Allied Health department, while helping to train current students in the use of modern instrumentation needed for a competitive edge in the workforce and in graduate school. Further, faculty research capabilities are enhanced, leading to more valuable contributions by the faculty with its collaborative partners, both local and regional industries, as well as other academic departments located throughout Pennsylvania.\r\n",
