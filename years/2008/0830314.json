 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies new methods for constructing\r\neconomical plans to deploy wireless sensor nodes of\r\nmultiple types and form a reliable wireless sensor\r\nnetwork to monitor, throughout a given time period,\r\na large set of targets spread across a geographical\r\nspace. It initiates and carries out a thorough\r\nanalytical investigation on deploying multiple types\r\nof sensors for constructing a wireless sensor network\r\nthat satisfies, simultaneously, the min-cost, the\r\nlifetime, the fault-tolerance, and the connectivity\r\nrequirements. It integrates concepts and methods in\r\nlinear programming, convex programming, reliability\r\ntheory, graph theory, and approximation algorithms\r\nto model these requirements and find efficient solutions.\r\nResults of this research provide a substantial impact on\r\nlarge-scale, terrestrial and underwater, wireless sensor\r\nnetwork applications and communication protocol designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this research seeks analytical models\r\nto provide, with minimum monetary cost on sensor nodes,\r\nreliable sensor placements and time scheduling to hinge\r\non spatial-temporal information and power consumption.\r\nDespite failures and limited power supply of sensor\r\nnodes, the network must guarantee that each spatial\r\ntarget be watched by at least one active sensor at any\r\ngiven moment during a pre-determined period of time\r\nrequired by the underlying application. This implies\r\nsensor placements must satisfy the spatial-temporal\r\ncoverage, the fault-tolerance, and the min-cost\r\nrequirements for single-hop networks; as well as the\r\nadditional connectivity requirement for multi-hop\r\nnetworks, which ensures that each sensor node is\r\nconnected to a base station through a communication path.\r\n\r\n",
