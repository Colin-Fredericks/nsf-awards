 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work aims to grow carbon nanotubes, using a novel technique known as Graphitic Structures by Design, on the surface of carbon fibers and fabrics toward forming hierarchical composite structures. These composites will benefit from the microscale reinforcement of carbon fibers and from the complementary nanoscale reinforcement by the nanotubes. The synthesis process is rapid, affordable, and offers controlled-growth of nanotubes and thus eliminates the problems of dispersing nanotubes in epoxies. The proposed synthesis method is the only technique that allows growth of carbon nanotubes on fiber surface at relatively low temperature (450 oC) and thus does not damage the fibers. \r\n\r\nThe produced composites will be investigated at the nano, micro and macro scales, paving the way for next generation structural composites with high strength, fracture toughness and deformability long sought for durable infrastructure. The new composites will significantly enhance the shear strength of fiber reinforced polymer pre-stressing strands used in structures (e.g. bridges). Problems associated with anchoring these strands will be eliminated. Four graduate students will participate in the research toward their degrees requirements. Four multi-disciplinary courses are planned as part of the proposed research activities to benefit students in Mechanical and Civil Engineering departments. The two departments have more than 40% minority population (Hispanic and Native American) and more than 20% of our students are females. The results of this work will be communicated to students at math/science charter high schools located in the state of New Mexico. \r\n",
