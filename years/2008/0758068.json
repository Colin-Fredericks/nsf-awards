 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research of Professors Armstrong and Finn at the College of William and Mary.  The group conducts nuclear physics experiments using the polarized electron beam available at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  These experiments utilize the tiny violation of \"mirror symmetry\" in electron scattering, which occurs due to the presence of the weak neutral-current interaction, an otherwise unnoticeable contribution to the scattering process.  This \"parity-violation\" technique is being used to probe the quark structure of protons and neutrons, to study the distribution of neutrons in a heavy nucleus (which has important implications for understanding neutron stars), and to search for possible new forces or new particles beyond those in the Standard Model of particle physics.\r\n\r\nThe grant supports a postdoctoral fellow and four graduate students.  Substantial involvement of undergraduate students is also anticipated through senior research projects and the REU site program at William and Mary.",
