 "awd_abstract_narration": "ExPert: dynamic analysis based fault location via Execution Perturbations\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis project is studying dynamic characteristics of runs of faulty programs and\r\ndesigning promising dynamic analysis techniques to identify executed program\r\nstatements where a fault lies, i.e. the fault candidate set. To narrow the set of\r\nstatements in the fault candidate set, an array of automated dynamic analyses are\r\nbeing used in conjunction with each other. These analyses consider not only the\r\nfailed run but also execution perturbations of this faulty run. The goal of this\r\nwork is to focus the users attention on a small subset of statements in the\r\nfault candidate state. Identification of fault candidate set is based upon\r\nuncovering of two types of evidence: negative evidence and positive evidence.  \r\nA negative evidence is considered as an indicator that leads to the conclusion \r\nthat a value encountered during a failed program run is related to the program's \r\nfailure. Positive evidence on the other hand indicates that some of the values \r\ncomputed during a failed run are in fact correct. Through a combination of negative\r\nand positive evidence we aim to produce a small fault candidate set. As part of \r\nthis work we are identifying new sources of evidence. We are also carrying out a \r\nsystematic integration of above dynamic analyses technology into a practical \r\ndebugging environment.",
