 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many vertebrate animals, the capacity to learn certain skills is greatly enhanced during a time in juvenile life referred to as a sensitive period. What happens to the juvenile brain as the young animal learns a new skill?  Conversely, what properties of the juvenile's brain favor learning?  This project seeks answers to these questions.   The goal of this project is to use a high resolution, laser-powered microscope to visualize individual nerve cells in the brain of a living songbird.  The nerve cells to be imaged play an important role in singing, a vocal behavior that resembles human speech in that both are products of imitative learning.  By re-imaging the same nerve cell over hours, days and even weeks, and precisely monitoring the vocal learning process, the investigator will examine whether vocal learning involves structural changes at the connections, or synapses, linking together these nerve cells.  The investigator predicts that synapses will be less stable at the onset of the sensitive period but that they will rapidly stabilize as the bird begins to imitate the song of another bird.  The significance of this project is three-fold.  First, it can assess whether enhanced structural plasticity characterizes sensitive periods for learning.  Second, it can identify the structural changes that occur during the learning of a complex vocal behavior.  Third, it will train young scientists in cutting edge experimental methods at the high school, doctoral and postdoctoral level.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA fundamental question is how we learn by imitation, for example when we learn to speak, play a musical instrument, or perfect an athletic skill.  At its most elemental level, the answer to this question must lie in our brain's ability to encode information gained by observing an appropriate model, such as a tutor, and to then use this information to guide behavioral (or motor) learning.  Presumably, this information is encoded at synapses, the connections through which nerve cells communicate with one another.  However, prior to the studies we conducted with NSF support, an explicit link between observational experience, synaptic plasticity and motor learning was not well established.  Funding from the NSF enabled us to conduct innovative work that enabled us to literally watch synapses in pupil's brain as he listened to and imitated the vocalizations of a tutor.  We found that early auditory experience rapidly alters synapses in a region of the brain that controls vocalization, and the magnitude of these changes correlates with subsequent song imitation.  \n\nThese results were tantalizing, because they suggested a new paradigm, one in which motor regions of the brain participate in the encoding of sensory memories.  This may represent an especially efficient means of encoding sensory information that is used for motor learning.  However, these imaging experiments only established a correlation between synaptic plasticity and motor learning.  To establish a causal link between these two features, we developed methods for manipulating synapses as the juvenile as he listened to his tutor.  Using these approaches, we found evidence that synapses in motor regions of the brain do indeed play a role in encoding sensory memories.Together with the imaging results, these findings link early auditory experience to synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning, which was the project\u00c6s major goal.\n\nThe intellectual merit of the project is that it provided the first evidence that motor regions participate in the encoding of sensory memories while also establishing a firm link between sensory experience, synaptic plasticity and motor learning.  In so doing, this research unified several major strands of brain research, spanning from the microscopic level of synapses to the cultural transmission of complex behaviors.\n\nThe broader impact of this work is three-fold.
