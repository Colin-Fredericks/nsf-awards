 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1988 the SMALL Undergraduate Research Project, with support from the NSF REU program, from Williams College, and from other sources, has involved over 350 students in research advised by 20 faculty, resulting in over 70 publications. The proposed conference, to take place at Williams on June 8, will further the research and its promulgation through talks, discussions, networking, and planning for future work. In addition to a few invited speakers and faculty, all participants are welcome to present short talks. The conference will also afford an opportunity to take stock of the fruits of the program and make better plans for the future.  There will be a session in which participants describe their accomplishments, help us evaluate the program, and suggest improvements in our program and activities.  A survey on the value of their SMALL experience, the value of the conference, and their suggestions for SMALL and related activities, will be distributed and collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
