 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: CT-ISG: Collaborative Research: Key Generation from Physical\r\nLayer Characteristics in Wireless Networks\r\nInstitution: University of Connecticut\r\nAbstract Date: 08/05/08\r\nThis project focuses on the development of a new class of secret key generation and\r\nrenewal algorithms for securing wireless networks by taking advantage of physical\r\nlayer characteristics. The basis of the approach is the identification of measurable\r\nquantities of the wireless channel between a pair of nodes that are highly correlated\r\nexclusively between them (albeit not identical). Capitalizing on this correlation, the\r\nproject develops algorithms for obtaining a shared key under various adversarial\r\nmodels.\r\nThis addresses a critical problem area as the broadcast nature of a wireless link\r\nprovides a natural eavesdropping and intervention capability to an adversary and thus it\r\nfollows that securing a wireless link is essential to the security of any wireless network.\r\nThis project undertakes the design, implementation, analysis and testing of several\r\nprotocols and clarifies the relationship between the channel characteristics and the\r\ncryptographic protocols that use them. It also investigates the trade-offs between\r\ncomputational and communication costs, and quantifies the level of security achieved\r\nby the key generation and renewal protocols assuming various adversarial models.\r\nThe broader impact of the project is in the potential of making wireless communications\r\nmore secure while avoiding costs (both computational and organizational) of\r\ncryptography. Given the increased wireless internetworking and the multitude of\r\nwireless enabled devices presently carried by an average user, the security of the\r\nwireless link becomes one of the most critical aspects of securing computer systems.\r\nThe reduction in the computation also will translate to a reduction in energy use,\r\nimportant to battery or alternative powered systems. Educationally, the project will\r\npresent an attractive combination of aspects of signal processing, computer security,\r\nalgorithms and cryptography and will offer a wealth of problems for student engagement",
