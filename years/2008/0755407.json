Students will work as part of faculty-undergraduate teams on new problems ranging from traditional image processing (e.g. liver segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis, breast density assessment for cancer\r\ndetection) to structured reporting and natural language processing of radiology reports, to workflow and process re-engineering to the application of data mining and ontology-based means for image annotation and markup (e.g. lung nodule detection and interpretation). Ultimately, each project has the long-term potential to increase the quality of healthcare available to people everywhere.\r\nFaculty mentors will conduct tutorials on imaging informatics, conduct biweekly meetings of students and mentors, and create an environment that will expose students to all phases of research and graduate school.  Students will participate in defining the direction of their research, give presentations to the group as well as other audiences, write up  and publish research results in the format of a conference or journal article, and participate in relevant conferences.\r\nThe MedIX REU site will run for three summers, with ten student participants doing research ten weeks each summer under the supervision of five mentors dedicated to undergraduate research. The site will be hosted by three interdisciplinary laboratories: the Medical Informatics Laboratory at DePaul University, the Imaging Informatics Laboratory at Northwestern University, and the Imaging Research Institute at the University of Chicago; the research environment will offer the students the opportunity to interact with computer scientists, medical physicists, and medical doctors.\r\nMore information on the MedIX program can be found at http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix\r\n",
