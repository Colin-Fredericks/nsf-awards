 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mutualisms, interactions between species in which both partners benefit, are found in all ecosystems. However, mutualisms vary in strength and persistence over space and time. This variation raises the question of why mutualisms persist or vanish under different conditions. This investigator focuses on plant-fungus interactions, or mycorrhizal associations, as a model of mutualism. The overall goal of her research is to address the question of where and why mutualisms occur, by investigating factors that influence the costs and benefits of plant-fungus partnerships. Through field, greenhouse, and laboratory projects this research aims to 1) describe patterns in the distribution and abundance of mycorrhizal associations; 2) quantify the physiological costs and benefits of supporting mycorrhizal fungi; 3) identify environmental factors that influence the costs and benefits of these partnerships; and 4) evaluate population- or community-level consequences of variation in mycorrhizal status. Plant-fungus interactions may have important consequences for plant communities through their effects on plant responses to environmental stress and processes such as invasions by exotic species. Consequently, this research will inform restoration and conservation efforts in native plant communities. Through her research, this graduate student will also facilitate undergraduate involvement in science by providing opportunities for minority students to participate in ecological projects.",
