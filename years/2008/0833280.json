 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Excellence in Science Education Learning (Project ExSEL) recruits, prepares and supports 43 outstanding undergraduate science students who want to become science teachers in high need secondary schools, primarily in the Guilford County Schools.  The project is preparing a sizeable, well-qualified, inspired cohort of applicants to receive Noyce Scholarships, supporting them through their Junior and Senior years, while obtaining licensure, and continuing to support them through their first two years of teaching. This cohort is formed by aggressive recruiting from three streams of students: undergraduates, especially those involved in teaching activities such as tutors, lab assistants, and supplemental instruction programs, SIP; Master's students; and Post baccalaureate students. The cohesion of this group of students is encouraged by a series of social and educational activities, awards and school experiences. The constant support and encouragement of well qualified mentors from the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education ensures the reinforcement and magnification of the students' love of teaching. The activities of these cohorts are coordinated by a part-time Science Teachers Coordinator, supported by departmental coordinators. Noyce Scholars are guaranteed a minimum of two years post-licensure teaching with educational support and continued participation in cohort activities.",
