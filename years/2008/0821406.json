 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe work outlined in this proposal aims to create a multiple user facility for non-destructive high-resolution compositional analysis using wavelength dispersive x-ray florescence (WDXRF) spectroscopy. The facility will enhance existing research and educational programs particularly those investigating materials that are electrically insulating or contain light elements as well as enhance the development of new interdisciplinary programs. WDXRF allows quantitative elemental analysis from Be to U with a spot size that can be varied between 500 &#956;m and 35 mm. The instrument can provide reliable results over a wide range of concentrations from 1 ppm to tens of percent and for materials with thicknesses from sub \u00c5 to 50&#956;m. Acquisition of the instrument will allow the advancement of several important research projects such as the use of combinatorial techniques to investigate the fundamental chemical/structural/property relationships in MAX phases, an interesting set of compounds with a unique combination of refractory and tribological properties.  It will also be used to investigate the mechanism of degradation of magnetorheological elastomers by cycling. The instrument will be essential in reconstructing life patterns and cultural adaptation in the semiarid regions of Chile through bioarchaeological investigations of bones found in that region. In addition, WDXRF will be used to study the role of stoichiometry on oxide-based materials for microwave and actuator applications. Adding the instrumentation also has the potential to enhance the economy of the local region as it can be used for non-destructive testing of new electronic devices fabricated at the newly constructed Innovation Center at the South Jersey Technology Park located on the Rowan University campus.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe work outlined in this proposal aims to create a multiple user facility for non-destructive mapping of chemical composition using wavelength dispersive x-ray florescence (WDXRF) spectroscopy. The facility will enhance existing research and educational programs particularly those which investigate materials that contain light elements like carbon and oxygen.  In particular, this instrument will be used to advance the development of new materials for protective coatings, examine the degradation process of ?magnetic rubber?, optimize novel materials for cellular communication, and further our understanding of the lifestyle of the ancient cultures of Chile.  This instrument will be used by many students in a variety of courses and will be an important part of the upcoming minor in Forensic Science.  The acquisition of this instrument will also enhance the local economy by improving our ability to attract high-tech companies to the region through the on-campus Innovation Center at the South Jersey Technology Park.\r\n",
