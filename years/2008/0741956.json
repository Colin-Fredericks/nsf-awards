 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in tropical forests worldwide are a real and urgent problem.  Many of these changes are attributed to obvious destructive interventions such as logging and burning.  The influences of global climate change on tropical forests have been documented also.  Trees grow more slowly in hot years and many tropical streams are more acidic in El Ni\u00f1o years.  Evidence suggests there are other factors that may play a significant role as well. Extinction of tropical frog species is probably due to a complex interaction of climate change and susceptibility to a fatal fungal disease.  The overarching goal of this project is the creation of an interdisciplinary network of scientists from tropical field sites with long-term data sets to test hypotheses about the causes of ongoing changes in tropical forests.  The network meetings and the resultant research will enable the project to evaluate the likely effects of changes in forest dynamics, project these impacts into future decades, and plan ways to lessen the destructive impact of the changes. \r\n\r\nThe broader importance of this project concerns how the health of the tropical environment is connected to the condition of the entire planet and to the health and economic well-being of its human inhabitants through mechanisms such as the spread of disease vectors like ticks and mosquitoes and disruption of crop pollination.  This compelling scientific importance is coupled with the integration of outreach to K-12 and adult learning groups in the network activities to facilitate greater understanding about how changes in tropical forests have world-wide implications. \r\n",

The Science and Research Sub-Network sponsored workshops and symposiums on major themes to provide impetus for working groups, solidify networks, and increase the possibility of publications and future collaborations. The main topics chosen were long-term environmental monitoring, tropical streams, DNA barcoding / species extinctions, and ecotoxicology. Two events for each of these topics were mounted, several of which were organized by young investigators. Two additional topics&mdash;tropical bird diversity and leaf litter dynamics&mdash;were represented by a single event. Most of these topics have associated publications already out, in press, under review, or soon-to-be submitted. The Education and Communications Sub-Network organized four workshops and helped teachers from under-represented groups in the sciences (or who taught at schools with high populations of students from under-represented groups in the sciences) to participate in an annual course entitled \"Inquiry in the Rainforest\" offered to U.S. science teachers in Costa Rica. The four communications workshops were entitled: Communicating complex topics in science, Communicating climate change, Communicating sciece: tools and solutions, and Critical thinking and rubric design. The two pathways combined have resulted in the production of several videos, a bibliographic web site, and several publications currently being written. The Bioinformatics Sub-Network met their goal to organize, update, and standardize the meteorological data from a series of field stations to the guidelines of LTER, NEON and DataOne protocols. The next step is publishing the results from this effort. The mechanism for advancing the goal of the bioinformatics group was by holding working sessions during annual OBFS (Organization of Biological Field Stations) meetings. This timing led to several fortuitous synergies: 1) representatives from NSF FSML, LTER, NEON, and DataONE were usually at the OBFS meetings and were able to have extensive interactions with the RCN group, 2) the participation of the RCN group (field station managers and informatics personnel from outside the continental U.S.&mdash;Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico, Peru, India) gave an enhanced international flavor to the OBFS meetings which led to support for international field station representation and a renewed commitment to fostering international connections. In terms of the broader impact, the young investigators in the Research and Science Sub-Network who organized workshops and symposia received valuable training in running conferences, and the participants of the PASI / RCN &ldquo;Climate Change in the Tropics&rdquo; course (divided into two segments in 2009 and 2010) learned to grapple with problems of conservation in a wide range of habitats in Costa Rica, interacted extensively with Dr. Andrew Revkin, noted New York Times science journalist specializing in global climate change, and created a network of young investigators.
