 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis proposal intends to design algorithms and protocols for a Semantic Routed Network for sensor data based cyber infrastructure. This project will design technologies (protocols and algorithms) that support high-level resource (data/service) discovery in sensor networks and data archives. The novel aspects of this proposal include mechanism for easy and automatic discovery of sensors for variety of tasks. This will enable easy manipulation of sensor data, services and data archives in an intelligent cyber infrastructure. Many useful and interesting sensor based applications and cyber physical systems would be possible if such an intelligent cyber infrastructure is available.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nA vision of this project is to increase the potential user community for atmospheric and earth science sensor data by removing the need of device level understanding about how to identify useful sensors and use them. When successful, the increased access to these sensors and data resources will enhance scientific productivity and improve decision making regarding public utilities and services. Observing any phenomena or collecting any information with sensors will be as easy as searching the internet, querying a database, or as economical as putting up a web application on the internet. Additionally, the technical material developed here will be integrated in Computer Science courses on Networking, and Hardware-Software Codesign. Undergraduate and minority students will benefit from exposure to these novel technologies",
