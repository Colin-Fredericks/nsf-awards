To accomplish these goals, surface-science studies will be carried out on systems of increased complexity, starting with single-crystal model systems under vacuum and evolving to incorporate the use of high gas fluxes and supported particles.  Synthetic methodology based on colloidal and self-assembly chemistry will be developed for the production of supported catalysts with well-defined metal particle sizes and shapes to optimize selectivity in specific olefin isomerization processes.  The studies will involve the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students.  Collaborations with Latin American research groups will be forged, and student participation from underrepresented groups in research will be strongly pursued.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTraditionally, mild catalytic reactions such as double-bond isomerizations in olefins have been assumed to not depend on the structure of the surface of the catalyst.  However, that conclusion has been based on studies using ill-defined catalysts consisting of metal particles with wide distributions of sizes and shapes; recent surface-science experiments indicate that these systems may in fact display some structure sensitivity.  Our hypothesis in this project has been that selectivity in mild catalytic reactions may be controlled by careful design of catalysts with well-defined structures.\n\nThis proposal was directed to test that hypothesis for the particular case of olefin isomerizations catalyzed by metals.  We aimed to develop a molecular-level understanding of the factors that make changes in the structure of the catalyst translate into changes in catalytic selectivity, and to advance new synthetic methodology for the preparation of well-defined catalysts to take advantage of this structure-performance correlation.  To achieve our goals, surface-science studies with single-crystal model systems under vacuum evolved to incorporate the use of supported particles and high gas fluxes in order to address issues associated with increasing catalytic structural complexities and the changes induced by high pressures that allow these reactions to run catalytically.  Synthetic methodology based on colloidal and self-assembly chemistry was also developed to produce novel supported catalysts with well-defined metal particle sizes and shapes to optimize selectivity in specific olefin isomerization processes.\n\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity\n\nUltimately, we were able to combine the use of novel synthetic methods with the understanding achieved from our studies with model systems to design selective catalytic processes for olefin conversions.  In one illustrative example, we first found from temperature programmed desorption experiments on single crystals that the isomerization of trans olefins to their cis counterparts is promoted by (111) facets of platinum, and that such selectivity is reversed on more open surfaces.  This is of practical importance, because a catalytic process for the selective formation of cis olefins would help minimize the production of unhealthy trans fats during the partial hydrogenation of edible oils.  Quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the extra stability of cis olefins seen on hydrogen-saturated Pt(111) surfaces may be due to a lesser degree of surface reconstruction, a factor found to be significant in the adsorption on close-packed platinum surfaces.  Kinetic data using catalysts made out of dispersed tetrahedral Pt nanoparticles corroborated the selective promotion of the trans-to-cis isomerization on the (111) facets of the metal.  Our work provides an example for how catalytic selectivity may be controlled by controlling the shape of the catalytic particles.\n\nThe general basic knowledge generated by our work is likely to apply to a broader set of catalytic issues involving the structure sensitivity of mild reactions and their behavior during the transition from low to high pressures.  The value of our approach is that it relies on studies using model systems but also realistic conditions and a combination of novel kinetic and spectroscopic experimental setups and synthetic methods.\n\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity\n\nIf our hypothesis is proven general, it may have great repercussions on the design of new industrial processes, to, for instance, improve fat production in the food industry (where trans olefins are to be avoided because of their adverse health effects), or advance new routes involving metathesis, insertion, epoxidation, and oxidation steps in pharmaceutical, polymerization, and fine chemical synthesis.  Our project will also contribute to the development of a better basic understanding of chemical kinetic processes on surfaces under non-vacuum con..."
