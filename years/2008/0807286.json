These teachers will work with and be mentored by Dr. Kapila and three senior personnel as they conduct inquiry-based, hands-on, engineering research in the exciting field of mechatronics during six-week long summer workshops.\r\n\r\nThe project will benefit the teachers by reinforcing their science and math skills; enriching their STEM experience through exposure to real world engineering research; developing and honing their research, communication and presentation skills; and providing them opportunities to network with STEM educators.",
