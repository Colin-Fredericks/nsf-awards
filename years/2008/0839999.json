 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a workshop that will bring together key education representatives from ocean sciences and related professional societies to: 1) share society practices and K-12 programs with education representatives of other professional societies, 2) increase opportunities for collaboration among professional societies, and 3) develop recommendations for professional society K-12 outreach. This workshop is designed as a community-building collaboration focused on K-12 education and ocean sciences. To keep the needs of diverse student populations (and teachers) front and center, participation of ?diversity focused? professional societies will be encouraged. The interactions, dissemination of model programs, and collaborations developed during the workshop will be used to guide the development of a set of recommendations for how professional societies should focus their K-12 education efforts in ocean sciences.",
