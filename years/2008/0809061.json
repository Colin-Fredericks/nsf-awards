 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Entomological Society of America to support participation by US entomologists in the XXIII International Congress of Entomology in Durban, South Africa, in July, 2008. The International Entomological Congress presents an exceptional opportunity for entomologists from around the world to exchange ideas and build collaborative relationships. The Entomological Society of America will use National Science Foundation support to assist 15-18 students and junior faculty from the United States in attending the Congress to present their research and communicate with entomologists from around the world. \r\n\r\nThis is the first International Congress on the African continent. As such it presents a unique opportunity to foster international collaboration with African scientists. In addition to international collaboration, the Entomological Society of America is particularly interested in supporting participants whose research is relevant to international entomological concerns such as invasive species and discovery and documentation of  biological diversity.  The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering recognizes the opportunities for international collaboration and is contributing to fund this award.\r\n",
