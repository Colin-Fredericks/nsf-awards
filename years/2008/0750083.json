SCOARA enables scientists to work together in coordinating and maintaining shared resources, communicating lessons learned and sharing new knowledge, and providing an effective channel to communicate and discuss the needs of science projects to NSF/OPP and its Antarctic support contractor; therefore, ensuring that the highest quality science is conducted at South Pole. NSF funding for SCOARA is used to maintain common-use scientific equipment shared between projects, and to operate the year-round model machine shop in the Dark Sector. No funds are requested for activities that are covered by individual investigator grants.",
