The purpose of this meeting is to continue the exchange of research findings among the US and Japanese thermofluids community in this area, with particular emphasis on nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the intellectual merit of the conference, there are limited opportunities for in-depth discussion of two-phase transport phenomena at existing meetings, especially with international participants.  The re-emergence of nuclear energy as a potential source of non-carbon-emitting electric power brings the field of two-phase transport phenomena into greater prominence.  This conference will enable a number of US and Japanese researchers to address fundamental issues in two-phase transport, which inhibit increased adoption of nuclear energy and other technologies.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include findings of potential benefit to the nuclear industry and to other technologies.  Some of the NSF support will go to female and under-represented minority researchers.  The results of the meeting will be disseminated in either book form, or in a special issue of a relevant international journal.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program, by the Particulates & Multiphase Processes (PMP) Program, and by the Fluid Dynamics (FD) Program, of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.",
