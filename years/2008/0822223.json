The project's Lesson Study model employs social semiotics to examine the intersection between language and learning in mathematics classrooms. The project is addressing two research questions: (1) How does social semiotics illuminate the complexities of mathematics instruction in high-poverty schools? (2) How does the Lesson Study group strengthen teachers' content knowledge, increase their pedagogical-content knowledge, and enhance their ability to orchestrate whole-class conversations? Additionally, on-site Lesson Study groups will also be launched in some participating schools.",
