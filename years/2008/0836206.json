 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer gaming and simulations enjoy great popularity and are used by the military and corporate world to enhance training. Their potential to support science learning, however, is relatively untapped. The Board on Science Education (BOSE) at the National Research Council (NRC) proposes to hold a two-day workshop to explore the connections between what is known about science learning and computer gaming and simulations, the role computer gaming and simulations could play in assessing learning, and the pathways by which they could be used on a large scale. The workshop will be the basis for the development of a research agenda to gain a better of understanding of how gaming and simulations can support learning and assessment in science.",
