Complementary macroscopic, micro--scopic and spectroscopic techniques will be combined to study the fouling of two nanophase catalysts, supported palladium (Pd) metal and titanium dioxide (TiO2), which are representative of two promising classes of water treatment catalysts.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the research plan are to \r\n\r\nA) identify interfacial reactions responsible for catalyst fouling and deactivation during water treatment and \r\nB) develop practical strategies for reducing catalyst fouling and for reactivating fouled catalysts.\r\n\r\nCatalyst fouling will be studied with both laboratory-generated solutions containing suspected model foulants and natural water samples.\r\n\r\nThe above research efforts will be coupled with an educational plan designed to\r\n\r\nA) reduce the minority achievement gap in local community schools,\r\nB) increase the diversity of students pursuing careers in environmental professions, and \r\nC) improve learning outcomes in environmental engineering courses. \r\n\r\nThese goals will be addressed by implementing an outreach program for at-risk minority elementary school students (EnviroTech), integrating students from underrepresented groups in research activities, and revitalizing a course in environmental engineering. A multi-faceted assessment of educational activities will be conducted to ensure that these programs achieved the desired outcomes.\r\n",
