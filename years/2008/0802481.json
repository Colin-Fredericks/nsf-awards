 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to three interrelated and priority regional needs, Montgomery County Community College is creating an \"Enhanced Science & Technology Educator Training Institute\". This project is supporting regional efforts to increase interest in, and breadth and quality of, science and technology education for students in high schools and community colleges, and complements other ongoing projects/programs. The Educator Training Institute (ETI) is increasing the number, diversity, and preparedness of students pursuing science and technology careers to meet regional workforce demands. The disciplinary focus of the Institute is biotechnology and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe Institute is providing science and technology educators hands-on laboratory experiences, fostering connections and sharing of resources between educators, industry professionals, and college-level education majors early in their career path, enhancing the impact of high school and college laboratory activities by providing laboratory supplies and equipment, and assisting in integrating laboratory technology into classrooms. By impacting educators, the project is increasing the number of students that are engaged in, and well versed in science and technology to fill the current and future technical workforce pipeline for the region, and is increasing diversity in both the workforce, and in teaching/faculty positions.",
