 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichoptera (Caddisflies) are insects whose adults look like moths, which are their closest relatives. Because Trichoptera larvae live in water, and because different species are differentially tolerant to pollution, quantitative sampling of these larvae is commonly used to monitor water quality. However, biomonitoring requires accurate taxonomy, which is currently unavailable for Trichoptera in the Tropics. With this research, a phylogeny representing 80% of the world's Trichoptera genera will be constructed from both molecular DNA sequence data and morphological data, and an accurate taxonomy for the group will be obtained. This new phylogenetic framework and classification will allow placement of newly discovered species and focused analysis on differential sensitivity of species to water pollution.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a large, independently funded effort to collect short pieces of DNA that can be used to quickly identify species by their unique DNA sequences (called 'barcodes'). Additional data will be collected in coordination with the Trichoptera barcode initiative in order to extend the utility of these sequences to phylogenetics. Training in all aspects of modern taxonomic and phylogenetic methods will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students during this research. This work will also have an impact on human health because Trichoptera are extensively used in biomonitoring for water-quality assessment.",
