Deng, University of South Carolina Research Fdn\r\n\r\nObjective: The objective of the proposal is to fundamentally understand plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials and field-effect transistors and to develop integrable and tunable deep-submicron/nanoscale III-nitride plasma wave terahertz detectors. Fundamental understanding and exploitation of plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials and transistors holds a great promise to revolutionize terahertz electronics and advance the knowledge of mesoscopic and nanoscopic physics in III-nitrides. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The objective will be accomplished through four primary tasks: (1) development of theories and models for plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials; (2) characterization of plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials and validation of corresponding theories and models by experimental data; (3) development of detection theory for deep-submicron/nanoscale III-nitride plasma wave terahertz detectors; and (4) design, fabrication, and test of deep-submicron/nanoscale III-nitride plasma wave terahertz detectors and validation of the detection theory. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research will provide new insights and advance the knowledge on III-nitride device physics and material properties. The proposed terahertz detectors have a wide range of potential applications, including wireless communication for above 60 GHz, medical imaging, cancer diagnosis, far-infrared spectrum analysis, chemical-compound and biological-agent identification, etc. The principle investigator will integrate the research project with educational activities by: (1) outreach to students from local high schools, K-8 and the community through a hands-on exhibit at the South Carolina State Museum annually; (2) involvement of undergraduates, graduates, women, and minorities in the research program; (3) improvement of two undergraduate courses and two graduate courses; and (4) development of a new graduate course.  \r\n",
