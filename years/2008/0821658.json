 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nIn this proposal, the acquisition of ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless sensor network and radar (Environmental) sensing integration equipment is proposed. The new lab equipment will form a UWB radar sensing system including an arbitrary waveform generator, real-time spectrum analyzer, and a digital phosphor oscilloscope. The new equipment will be integrated with the existing UWB sensor network at Tennessee Technological University (TTU). The equipment would provide a core facility for all academic departments and research centers at TTU. Primary users of the instruments, across different colleges, would be Center for Manufacturing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Manufacturing and Industrial Technology, and Department of Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nSome projects are funded by NSF, ONR, or DoE. At this time, the PIs and the participating faculties are either waiting for the acquisition of the proposed facility or using off-campus equipment. The purchase of the dedicated state-of-the-art facilities at TTU would greatly enhance the participating faculties, productivity and ability in conducting the ongoing research and broaden their capacity to attract new projects or make new discoveries.\r\n\r\nBroad Impacts: \r\nTTU is a comprehensive university with a vibrant undergraduate research emphasis while offering a PhD degree program in engineering. It is a regional university serving Tennessee and the Upper Cumberland region. The proposed state-of-the-art equipment will enhance the undergraduate program through new course contents, curriculum, and design projects. It will promote faculty research, strengthen the PhD program, and offer necessary training in modern technology to graduate students.",
