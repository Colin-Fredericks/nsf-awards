We intend to continue our work on asymptotic \r\nproperties of Golod-Shafarevich groups and the Lubotzky-Sarnak conjecture. \r\nThese groups naturally arise in 3-dimensional topology and number theory. This work is also related to the Wigderson's \r\nproblem of expanding subspaces in the theoretical computer science. \r\nWe will further develop the connections between the Specht Problem and linear representations of Golod-Shafarevich groups.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the results of the work on the proposal will lead to solutions of several long standing problems and will have\r\nimplications for Theoretical Computer Science (fast expanding systems).\r\n",
