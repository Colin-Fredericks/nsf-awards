 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington (UW-FHL) is the marine field laboratory of the University, located on San Juan Island, 74 miles NW of Seattle. It offers facilities for research to visiting and resident scientists, and has offered an annual program of courses and research training since 1904, with on-campus housing for >250 persons. Although its basic operations are supported by the University of Washington, FHL deliberately seeks a national and international pool of students and scientists who visit for periods of weeks or months on a year round basis. In 2004-2005 for example, 40 institutions in 15 countries were served with fewer than half of FHL people having an association with the University of Washington. On-campus housing is an important element in this national/international outreach, and FHL maintains a full range of accommodations for visitors, both faculty and students. This award will build additional student housing and provide increased capacity for research and outreach activities for the lab.",
