 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, new optical methods will be developed to analyze samples of single-walled carbon nanotubes. These nanotubes are novel molecular-scale structures with remarkable electrical, mechanical, and optical properties that will lead to important future applications. However, the nanotubes are formed in a variety of similar structural forms that are difficult to distinguish and separate. The results from this project will make it possible to use relatively simple laboratory measurements to quickly determine not only which structural forms are contained in a nanotube sample, but also how much of each form is present and how perfect or damaged the sample is.\r\n          The new analysis methods developed in this project will have a range of impacts. First, they will be very valuable to basic scientists who need well-characterized samples to perform their nanotube research. Second, reliable and standardized characterization will speed the commercial production and industrial use of carbon nanotubes. Finally, the project will advance the scientific training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students (including women and underrepresented minorities) by giving them hands-on research experience vital to their scientific education and professional development.",
