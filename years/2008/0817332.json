This project is transforming engineering mathematics education across the nation, with the goal of increased student retention, motivation, and success in engineering. A highly successful introductory engineering course was developed at Wright State University with previous NSF funding and it is now being adapted at partnering institutions on this project. The engineering mathematics course includes lecture, laboratory, and recitation components with content designed to satisfy prerequisites for a significant number of core entry-level engineering and science courses. Students still complete their required mathematics courses, but are now able to do so at a later time in the curriculum while still making progress towards their degree. The research team includes award-winning teachers and innovators in curriculum development at the collaborating institutions. A total of 15 diverse institutions are adopting and assessing aspects of the model course and are broadly reporting on their findings.",
