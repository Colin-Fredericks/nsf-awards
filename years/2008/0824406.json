 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to investigate the feasibility of using a novel collagen protein-based binder to reduce foundry emissions. A considerable fraction of foundry emissions occurs when conventional phenolic urethanes that bind mold cores release VOCs when pyrolyzed at high temperatures. Cores are made of silica sand grains that are held together by binders. The new collagen protein binder examined herein releases 1/4 to 1/3 as much VOC emissions as do conventional binders but they are not as tough. Thus poured molten metal will more readily erode the collagen-binded cores. In this study, UV light irradiation of the collagen protein will be used in an attempt to toughen the collagen skin and improve its ability feasibility for use in molten processes. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will provide fundamental understanding of UV radical reactions with collagen and its use as a binder of VOCs during molten metal processing. The impact of reduced emissions from foundries is enormously important. The proposal team anticipates that a successful implementation of this research can result in a 40-60% reduction in VOC pollution from foundries.",
