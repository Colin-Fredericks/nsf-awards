 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of the Bio-Bench project is to develop skilled bench technicians for the life sciences industry, including workers for companies growing out of business incubators, and training of unemployed or underemployed individuals for entry positions into the life sciences industry.  To accomplish this goal, the St. Louis Community College (SLCC) Center for Plant and Life Sciences, with a biotechnology technician training program in a post-incubator facility, allows SLCC to assist growing companies as they navigate the early years of existence. The SLCC provides local companies with a Contract Research Organization (CRO) with which they can contract work to the SLCC training programs, allowing them to get work completed locally, and utilizing equipment that the company doesn't have access to, while giving the technicians training in real-world experiences. The CRO provides a much needed service for growing companies, while providing on-site internships for students enrolled in the technician program.  Students in the program will gain cutting edge technical skills and scientific knowledge to advance their future careers in the life sciences.  The project also provides awareness programs for middle and high school students within the St. Louis region to educate them on the opportunities available within the plant and life science industry. Local teachers receive training on plant and life science-related concepts and procedures that can be incorporated into their existing science curriculums that raise the awareness and understanding of students as to the critical need for the industry and the many employment opportunities available.  The project is guided by an industry advisory committee from partner organizations to establish training needs, establish partnerships with growing companies, and assist with the identification of candidates for the program.  In addition, the project provides emerging companies with needed incentives to stay in the region and grow to fuel the growth of the entire life sciences industry within the city and state.",
