These methods all have their advantages and disadvantages, but are not well suited for efficiently finding optimal concentrations when a large number of variables are involved. This project aims at developing an experimental design that would provide a tool to scientists to study the influence of a large number of input variables on a set of given output variables. The design would not only provide information on the interactions between the variables but will provide a combinatorial characterization of where the influence of ingredients is maximum on the output variables. This design can be helpful to bioengineers in academia and industries alike and the design can be used for processes involving all types of organisms including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\n\r\nThe research activities proposed in this proposal will give the undergraduate students of Dowling College a chance to complement their learning with research experience. This will help develop graduates that are well grounded in both the theoretical and research aspect of the subject.  The nature of the research is interdisciplinary and integrates mathematical techniques of optimization and design of experiments into biotechnology applications.",
