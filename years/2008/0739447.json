Recent numerical modeling studies have\r\nsimulated the broad-scale features of algal biomass and species composition in the\r\nsouthern Ross Sea, by prescribing a higher iron requirement for the growth of diatoms\r\nrelative to P antarctica and by allowing higher growth rates by P. antarctica under low\r\nirradiance. However, there are large uncertainties associated with the parameterizations\r\nused in these models, particularly with regard to phytoplankton iron parameters, which\r\nare typically assigned static values. Results of recent laboratory experiments with\r\ncolonial P. antarctica suggest that the iron requirement of this species can be relatively\r\nhigh, and appears to vary strongly as a function of irradiance. In this project, the\r\ninvestigators will use laboratory experiments to quantify the iron requirements of diatom\r\nspecies that are representative of open-water, ice-edge and sea-ice environments of the\r\nsouthern Ross Sea, including Thalassiosira gracilis, Pseudo-nitzschia subcurvata,\r\nFragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula glaciei. The experimental data will be used to test\r\na number of hypotheses concerning the effects of iron availability, irradiance and UV-B\r\nexposure on growth rates, production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylsulfide,\r\ncellular pigment composition, and the relative uptake of macronutrients. In addition, the\r\ninvestigators will conduct preliminary \"algal competition experiments\", in which the\r\ngrowth of mixed assemblages containing both diatoms and colonial Phaeocystis\r\nantarctica will be examined, as a function of iron and irradiance, with and without UV-B\r\nexposure.\r\nBroader impacts: The research will provide quantitative information that is required to\r\nconstruct robust, mechanistically-accurate numerical models of Southern Ocean\r\necosystems and biogeochemistry. This project also will make educational contributions\r\nat several levels, through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents in laboratory research, and through planned outreach activities aimed at K-12\r\nstudents and the general public, including lecture presentations in Bermuda and South\r\nCarolina, and the development of web materials in consultation with a group of K-12\r\nscience teachers.\r\n",
