This project will compare insect and wind pollinated flowers, investigating genes that are responsible for floral features that affect pollination.

A better understanding of the genetic basis of plant pollinator interactions has an impact on agriculture, since its manipulation can improve seed production. Characterization of the genes involved in making flower more attractive to insect pollinators has the added bonus of producing desirable traits for the floriculture industry.",
