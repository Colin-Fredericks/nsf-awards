 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nBlock copolymers in selective solvents exhibit simultaneous change in the shape of self-assembled nanoscale domains along with a change in the symmetry of the ordered phases. While there are many studies of the equilibrium phase diagrams and thermodynamics of solvent mediated interactions in block copolymer systems, the dynamics and kinetics of transformations are less well understood. In particular, not much is known about the pressure dependence of transformation kinetics. The primary goal of the research proposed here is (i) to examine the pressure dependence of phase transition mechanisms and the kinetics of order-disorder and order-order phase transitions in block copolymers in selective solvents, using time-resolved synchrotron based small angle x-ray scattering, and (ii) the internal dynamics of the block copolymer chains in the nanoscale domains using X-ray Intensity Fluctuation  Spectroscopy.  \r\n\r\nThe x-ray scattering studies will be complemented by other experimental techniques, including small angle neutron scattering, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering and rheology. Pressure jump measurements are particularly suitable for examining the early stages of the transformation processes. To obtain detailed insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, Molecular Dynamics simulations and models for analyzing the scattering data will be developed.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nSolutions and gels made up of block copolymers that inseparably combine two or more chemically distinct polymers have broad range of applications from consumer products to novel materials for pharamaceutical and other applications. The research proposed here has potential applications in the use of block copolymer materials at high ambient pressure, such as those involved in oil drilling.  Pressure can also be used as a means to control fabrication processes in the manufacture of block copolymer based products.\r\n \r\nThe project will provide interdisciplinary, hands-on training to graduate and undergraduate students, and thus contribute to the development of future scientists. The students will also learn to use state-of-the art synchrotron based x-ray instrumentation at National Laboratories. Special emphasis will be made to incorporate best practices to recruit, train and mentor women students at all levels by interacting closely with Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) group at Boston University. The senior faculty will present the work to a broader audience, and participate in outreach programs designed to attract and mentor high school and college students to pursue science and engineering careers. An international collaboration with researchers in Czech Republic is an integral part of this program. This collaboration provides opportunities to US students and senior researchers to benefit from the expertise that is being developed in Europe, particularly in the area of synchrotron- based soft matter and polymer physics.\r\n\r\n",
