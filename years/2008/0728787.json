 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves designing approximation algorithms for\r\nfundamental problems arising in computer networks in which nodes need\r\nto communicate with each other under some constraints.\r\n\r\nBuilding a direct link between any two nodes has a cost associated\r\nwith it.  This cost is different for different pairs of nodes.  There\r\nare several constraints, for example, a typical requirement would be\r\nthat every node would be able to reach every other node by a sequence\r\nof links.  Examples of some other constraints are making the network\r\nrobust in case of node failures, communication paths between nodes\r\nbeing short on average, and buying enough bandwidth for links to\r\nsupport the expected traffic (more bandwidth costs more but allows\r\nlarger quantity of data to be delivered on the link per time unit).\r\n\r\nGiven the link costs, and the network constraints, the goal is to\r\ndesign a network satisfying the constraints, such that the network\r\ncost is not too large.\r\n\r\nThe proposed problems have applications in VLSI, manufacturing, buying\r\nlarge set of items at bulk and more.  Theoretical insight into these\r\nproblems is likely to lead to better understanding of the problems.\r\n",
