 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nObjective\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to address challenges in predictably implementing high performance RF and microwave integrated circuits through a low-cost integration process.  The approach is based on self-assembly of prefabricated active chips containing identical microwave transistors and a substrate that contains passive components and interconnect metallization.  The design benefits from rigorous EM simulations combined with non-linear circuit simulation of a complex system containing many RF transistors, 3D interconnect lines and passive components. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe research will investigate self-assembled wafer-level integration, high capacity computational electromagnetic methods for complicated on-chip electromagnetic analysis, and efficient co-simulation of linear electromagnetic structures and non-linear devices.  An integration process with better than 200nm accuracy with transistor contact pad area of 5?\u00cam?~5?\u00cam will be developed. Electromagnetic modeling and simulation aspects are addressed through an accelerated time-domain layered finite element reduction recovery algorithm.  Various high performance blocks of microwave transceivers with operating frequencies ranging from 3 to 40 GHz will be designed, fabricated and tested. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of this project is to enhance our capability in designing and manufacturing state of the art RF and microwave products using a simple and low-cost manufacturing process. Additionally two graduate level courses taught by the PIs will be enhanced by defining common projects that require students to work together to define a research problem and follow it through until the RF system is fabricated and tested.\r\n\r\n",
