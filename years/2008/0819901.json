 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genome research has recently revealed that chromosomes often evolve at astounding rates.  The evolutionary forces responsible for these changes are very poorly understood.  This research will study those forces using a combination of mathematical models and statistical analyses.  There are three specific research themes:  (1) models to explain rapid evolutionary changes in which a pair of chromosomes determines sex (seen for example in salmon and tilapia), (2) models to explain how chromosome number and gene arrangement change over evolutionary time, and (3) statistical analyses of data on a new gene arrangement in Drosophila that will test the models.\r\n\r\nThe project will have five kinds of impact beyond its contributions to basic science.  First, it will illuminate history of the human genome, which has experienced substantial chromosomal evolution.  Second, it will provide key insights regarding how disease vectors (notably the mosquitoes that transmit malaria) have adapted to humans and thus become more virulent.  Third, the project will develop and distribute computer software useful for a wide range of genetic analyses.  Fourth, the project will train young scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels and will give them opportunities to work with collaborators abroad.  Fifth, the research will develop international partnerships between laboratories in the US, the UK, Australia, Switzerland, and France.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe evolution of genome structure (the \"karyotype\") was at the center of genetic research from 1920 &ndash; 1980, but then fell from prominence with the rise of molecular biology.  In the last decade, however, the flood of genomic data has revealed that chromosome content and number are far more evolutionarily labile than was ever imagined, and there is now a renaissance of interest in this topic.  This project brought new computational and theoretical tools to bear on fundamental questions about how chromosomes evolve.\n\n \n\nChromosome inversions are a very common type of structural change to the genome.  Biologists have debated for 75 years how and why they evolve.  We developed a mathematical model that shows how local adaptation can establish inversions.  We tested this model by analyzing field data from a malaria mosquito.  Our results give the first estimates of selection acting on an inversion.  We showed selection is extremely strong (with selection coefficients greater than 0.5), and varies geographically in Africa (Figure 1).  In related work, we developed new statistical methods to test this and other hypotheses about inversions using DNA sequence data.\n\n \n\nChromosome fusions and fissions change the fundamental number of chromosomes in the genome.  We developed mathematical models showing how fusions and fission can evolve by local adaptation.  We published on line a comprehensive and publically-accessible database of chromosome number.  Our analyses of those data revealed that fusions involving sex chromosomes surprisingly common, that they are slightly deleterious, and that they became established by random genetic drift (Figure 2).\n\n \n\nSex chromosomes are the most rapidly evolving part of the genome in many animals and plants.  We used models to show how this puzzling pattern can be explained by sex antagonistic selection, in which some genes are favored in one sex but detrimental to the other.  We made the surprising discovery that sex chromosomes can have major effects on the relative numbers of males and females (Figure 3).  In species like humans that have X and Y sex chromosomes, females tend to outnumber males at the adult life stage.  Conversely, in species like birds that have Z and W sex chromosomes, the sex bias is reversed, with males typically outnumbering females.\n\n \n\nOver 35 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals resulted from this award.\n\n \n\nThe project resulted in diverse broader impacts.  Long-term collaborations were established with scientists in five other countries.  Several software products for analysis of genetic data were developed and disseminated to the community without charge.  Five undergraduates were involved in the research.  Three of them are co-authors on research publications, and two of them won prestigious University of Texas awards.  Twelve graduate students and five postdocs (about half of whom are women) received training in diverse fields that include molecular biology, bioinformatics, computer simulation, comparative methods, classical population genetic theory, and stochastic processes.  The PI participated in five international workshops in which he taught graduate students of diverse nationalities.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Kirkpatrick"
