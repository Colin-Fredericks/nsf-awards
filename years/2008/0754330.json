The conference will also explore connections with arithmetic \r\ngeometry and mathematical physics/non-commutative geometry. Progress in algebraic \r\ncycles, with related results in algebraic K-theory, has been dramatic in recent \r\nyears. The principal contributors to motivic cohomology which underlies this \r\nprogress, Bloch, Lichtenbaum, Levine, Nori and Friedlander have agreed to \r\nparticipate. Related investigations include the work of Totaro, Weibel and \r\nEsnault all of whom have agreed to participate. Developments in arithmetic \r\ngeometry closely related to algebraic cycles involve the work of Colliot-Thelene \r\nand Huber who will also participate in this conference. The connections between \r\nalgebraic cycles and mathematical physics/non-commutative geometry have begun \r\nto be explored in recent years. Some of the main players in this emerging field \r\nare Bloch, Esnault and Kreimer: in addition to Bloch and Esnault, Kreimer also \r\nwill participate in this conference. \r\n\r\nThe venue of this conference is The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, \r\nfrom Monday, March 24 through Saturday, March 29, 2008. The conference plans to \r\nsupport participation by a number of young people, at both the post-doctoral \r\nand advanced graduate student level, so that it will serve to stimulate \r\nincreased interest and participation in these exciting mathematical topics. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
