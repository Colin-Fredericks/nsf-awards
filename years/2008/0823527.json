 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to refine a Rayleigh-based geochemical thermometer (RBGT) for coral biomineralization based on high-precision analyses of multiple elemental ratios (e.g. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) and experimentally determined partition coefficients so that it can be broadly applied across coral species in a wide range of warm and cold-water environments. Three main objectives of this research include a description of element partitioning during aragonite precipitation as a function of temperature and crystal growth rate, determination of the accuracy of the RBGT by analyzing short sections of coral skeletons that have matching in-situ temperature records and application of the RBGT to construct a continuous, seasonally resolved record of Atlantic sea surface temperatures during the peak of the Little Ice Age ~1640-1670 AD. The Broader Impacts include research to improve interpretation of the geochemical archive in corals to better reconstruct past ocean temperatures for model input and future global change predictions. This project also includes a young PI who has recently started a new faculty position.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe compositions of calcium carbonate tests and skeletons of many marine organisms vary in response to ocean conditions, and much of our understanding of past climate variability is based on the quantitative interpretation of these changes in terms of physical and chemical parameters of the ocean.  Proxy-based reconstructions form the basis for much of our understanding of the behavior of the Earth\u00c6s climate system on decadal through orbital timescales, and provide crucial insights into the sensitivity of Earth\u00c6s climate system to changes in boundary conditions, such as concentrations of atmospheric CO2.  Despite their importance and wide application, however, the majority of geochemical proxies are empirically based and we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms that control the geochemical composition of biogenic (biologically precipitated) carbonates. In particular, the composition of coral skeleton has been difficult to interpret in terms of oceanic conditions because physiological processes &ndash; the so-called \"vital effects\" &ndash; contribute a significant proportion of the overall signal.  Research funded by this grant led to the development and application of a new approach to coral-based thermometry that combines high-precision analyses of multiple element ratios (i.e. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) and experimentally determined partition coefficients with a Rayleigh model for coral biomineralization.  This approach was used to extract accurate and precise temperatures from the skeletons of 3 tropical (Acropora sp.; Diploria labyrinthiformis; Porites sp.) and 2 cold-water (Lophelia pertusa; Madrepora sp.) species of scleractinian.  These results demonstrate that considering coral skeletogenesis as a biologically mediated, physico-chemical process provides a means to extract temperature information from the skeleton composition through a quantitative understanding of the mechanism that produces the \"vital effect\".\n\nResults from this study benefit to the paleoclimate community by providing a new, user-friendly, non-empirical technique with which to derive accurate estimates of past ocean temperatures from coral skeletons at seasonal resolution.
