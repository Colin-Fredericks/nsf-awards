Two varieties (i.e. irreducible sets of solutions) are birational if they have isomorphic open subsets.\r\nThe main focus of this project is on natural questions in\r\nthe birational geometry of complex projective varieties\r\nand in particular on problems related to the Minimal Model Program.\r\n\r\nThe birational classification of surfaces was understood by the\r\nItalian school at the beginning of the twentieth century.\r\nIf a surface is not covered by rational curves then there is a natural\r\nchoice of a birational surface (known as the minimal model)\r\nwhich has many useful properties. The Minimal Model Program aims to generalize these results to higher dimensions. This program is complete in dimension 3 (by work of Mori, Kawamata, Kollar, Reid, Shokurov and others) and is known to work for varieties of general type (by work of Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, McKernan, Siu and others). This project hopes to answer some of the remaining questions and conjectures that naturally arise in this context.",
