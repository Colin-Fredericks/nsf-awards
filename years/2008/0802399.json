 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Karin Menendez-Delmestre is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Dr. Menendez-Delmestre will conduct a multi-wavelength study of proto-clusters at high redshift that will use submillimeter galaxies as signposts of these large-scale structures. The aim of the program will be to investigate the relationship between galaxy properties and their proto-cluster environment.\r\n\r\nThe morphology-density relation, which particularly addresses the distribution of galaxy morphologies within clusters, has been established at z < 1. Dr. Menendez-Delmestre will extend current knowledge of galaxy evolution as a function of environment to incorporate other galaxy properties (morphologies, sizes, star-formation rates, stellar ages, stellar masses, metallicities, outflows and active galactic nuclei activity) and to extend the study out to the higher redshifts traced by submillimeter galaxies, z ~ 1-3. Major components to this research are detailed spectroscopic and photometric observations of individual proto-cluster members using Persson's Auxilliary Nasmyth Infrared Camera (PANIC) and the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) on the Magellan Telescope.\r\n\r\nDr. Menendez-Delmestre will also extend Carnegie's commitment to outreach and education towards a broader section of the Los Angeles community by strengthening the existing, yet informal ties with the Griffith Observatory, a well recognized leader in the Los Angeles community as a center of public education. With a Hispanic population greater than 50%, Los Angeles is an exceptionally well suited area to develop educational outreach programs that specifically target the Hispanic community. Dr. Menendez-Delmestre will serve as a Curatorial Advisor to the Griffith program team led by Dr. Laura Danly (Curator, Griffith Observatory) by: (1) helping in the implementation of a Griffith school astronomy program directed at elementary-school children; (2) training Observatory guides; (3) reviewing the accuracy of the Observatory's educational materials; and (4) helping to organize public, astronomy-related activities at Griffith.",

Our own Milky Way has many neighbors and together with more than a thousand other galaxies it forms the <em>Local Supercluster</em>.

Galaxy evolution thus appears to be intimately connected to the environment. The physical origin of this relation is still controversial: does this relation arise early in the formation of galaxies?
