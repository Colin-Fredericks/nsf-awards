 "awd_abstract_narration": "Video case studies highlighting the role of science in construction problems are the core of this professional development program that includes video, print, and web components. Faculty from Oregon State University and Chemeketa Community College are adapting a research-based instructional model and problems familiar to the construction industry generated in previous Advanced Technological Education projects for use in science teaching. The instructional materials are organized into a complete professional development program for middle and high school science teachers and community college science and technology faculty.  The project is creating a professional development course in DVD format with video, print, and web components that (a) demonstrate teaching standards-based science through construction problems, (b) demonstrate ways to highlight how high school science is valuable for a wide range of technical professions specifically in construction fields, and (c) present tools and information for helping students understand the relationship between content knowledge and career pathways ranging from the apprentice trades to professional engineer. The design capitalizes on a personal connection between people and their built environments through a focus on construction concepts that link science to people and their communities. Video components supported by web and print material utilize a research-based form of professional development that links cases in professional construction environments with model classroom teaching. Media production is being handled by the Science Media Group at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.",
