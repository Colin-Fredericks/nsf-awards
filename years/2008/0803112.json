 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third biennial Gordon Conference on the Metabolic Basis of Ecology and its Graduate Research Seminar will be held at the University of New England from 5 - 11 July 2008. The Gordon Research Conference format, honed since the turn of the century, fosters intense intellectual discourse. Networking opportunities at these conferences are unusually good because the week-long schedule and the emphasis on discussion time promotes interactions among young investigators and more established researchers from around the world.  No other conference focuses on metabolic ecology and the goal of this conference is to build new collaborations among scientists who seek a greater understanding of the metabolic laws that govern the structure and function of living organisms and the communities and ecosystems in which they live. The speakers and discussion leaders represent scientists from diverse backgrounds, academic ranks, genders, and national origins. In addition, there will be a graduate research seminar in which students, postdocs and junior faculty will have a chance to interact with established investigators prior to the Gordon Research Conference. The success of this conference will be evaluated by using the Gordon Research Conference's standard evaluation process.",
