 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intelligent Merit: The intent of this proposal is to conduct a national, retrospective study of specialized science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) schools that provide a more rigorous course of study for academically talented, science-focused students.  The main goal of the proposed work is to determine what contributions can be made to public policy decisions about SMT education relative to specialized schools.  The study will examine the educational and career consequences of these schools to gain better insights about their contributions to the SMT workforce.\r\n\r\nThrough a three-phased approach, this study will focus on graduates from specialized high schools and their counterparts from regular high schools as a comparison group.  During the first phase of the study, graduates from one specialized high school and from a comparison group will be studied, while during phase two, three specialized schools and comparison groups will be studied.  In phase three, the study will be expanded using the same study respondents from the first two phases.  Throughout the first two phases, methods and instruments will be crafted, piloted, and revised.  Overall, the study will involve 5000 graduates from specialized SMT schools and 1000 graduates with similar backgrounds from regular high schools.\r\n\r\nThe research questions for this study include:\r\n\r\n1.\tAre graduates from specialized SMT high schools more likely to enroll in SMT-related studies and career fields when compared with graduates from regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?\r\n2. \tWhat school models employed by specialized SMT high schools are most associated with entrance into SMT-related studies and career fields? (School models include: residential schools, schools-within-schools, regional centers with half-day courses.)\r\n3.\tTo what degree do graduates from specialized SMT high schools who pursue non-SMT degree concentrations and careers attribute value to the SMT skills and content they experienced at their high school?\r\n4.\tDo graduates from specialized SMT high schools differ in their professed understanding and personal interest regarding science-related public issues from graduates of regular non-magnet non-examination high schools with comparable academic and demographic backgrounds?\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The study will likely advance discovery and understanding about how schools should be structured to ensure academically talented students, including those historically underserved, reach their fullest potential. The results could inform policy about the value of SMT schools to the STEM workforce, hence, in that regard, it could e transformative.  Key partners (e.g. schools, universities, and corporations) have been assembled to provide broad-based support to specific aspects of this project.  The qualitative phase of the study will target the perspectives of graduates on factors (e.g. education, success, ethics), other than enrollment and achievement. The advisory board represents a variety of expertise and stakeholder communities and will likely yield a wider dissemination of results and findings.\r\n\r\n",
