ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER\r\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Halkiadakis, Eva\r\n\r\nTITLE:  CAREER: New Physics Searches in Top Pairs and Jets Channels, Silicon Pixel Operations at CMS and Particle Physics Outreach with Spark Chamber Stations\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests partial support for a program of research in experimental elementary particle physics based primarily on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and for an education and outreach program involving high school teachers and pre-college women students.\r\n\r\nFor the past few decades, physicists have been able to describe with increasing detail the fundamental particles that make up the Universe and the interactions between them. Much of this success has been due to the Tevatron program at Fermilab with D0 and CDF making major contributions.. Professor Halkiadakis has been a major participant in the physics analysis for the CDF experiment, particularly in top physics, as well as in many leadership roles.  Now the LHC and CMS will start operation in new regimes of energy and luminosity holding even greater promise for discoveries and measurements leading to revisions of our views on how the world is constructed and the nature of the laws that govern its operation. Professor Halkiadakis is now transitioning into the CMS program where she will parlay her wealth of experience in top analysis into a study of top pair production at CMS for new physics searches. With the Rutgers group making significant contributions to the CMS pixel detector and the pivotal role the detector plays in identifying b-quarks, Professor Halkiadakis also has assumed the responsibility for developing major portions of the pixel data quality monitoring (DQM) system.  In addition, she plans to expand her searches to involve jets as a complimentary program to a study of decay signatures with leptons or missing momentum.  \r\n\r\nOn Broader Impacts, she plans to use cosmic ray muons to bring particle physics to the public. The objective is to set up an experiment to test Einstein?s special theory of relativity and to demonstrate that high energy particles surround us. This project will be assembled by local high school teachers and pre-college women students from the Rutgers Douglass Project. Together with the PI, they will build particle physics detectors to measure the number of cosmic ray muons observed at different altitudes and study the effect of time dilation. The results of the experiment will be seen ?in action? via web-based displays at their schools, and exhibited in science museums around the state of New Jersey, such as at the Liberty Science Center.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nParticle physics has answered many questions about Nature and the fundamental interactions, yet there are still many unsolved mysteries.  Over the course of this award, the Tevatron collider at Fermilab handed over the baton to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, bringing the dawn of a new energy frontier. \n\nOne of the main objectives of this project has been to search for \"new physics\" using the data collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC .  For example, a leading  \"new physics\" theory called Supersymmetry or SUSY provides elegant solutions to many of the mysteries in physics.  We are able to test the validity of this theory by searching for SUSY particles, or sparticles, at the LHC.  The PI of this project and her team has performed many such searches.  In particular, she has focused on signatures involving several \"jets\".  Certain Standard Model (SM) particles, such as quarks and gluons, manifest themselves in the detector as a collimated spray of particles we refer to as \"jets\".    The PI and her colleagues pioneered a new technique labeled as \"the ensemble method\" to help distinguish jets coming from a new particle resonance and that of SM background processes.    The data were analyzed from the Run I of the LHC and are consistent with the SM.  This has resulted in placing stringent limits on the existence of new particles, such as the SUSY partner of the gluon (and the top quark) called the gluino (stop) when a quantum number called R-parity is not conserved.   \n\nAnother main goal of this project has been to contribute to the maintenance and operation of the ultra-precise silicon pixel detectors, the innermost tracking device of the CMS experiment.  This precision detector is crucial for the CMS physics program, such as measurements of secondary vertices necessary for b-quark identification.   In particular, her team has been one of the leaders in the development of the Data Quality Monitoring software for the pixel detector, ensuring the detector\u00c6s excellent performance. \n\nFinally, the funding of this project has helped support educational outreach.  The PI has been involved in an outreach program with local New Jersey high school teachers and students through the Quarknet program during the summer months to build large cosmic ray detectors based on scintillating bars read-out by wavelength shifting fibers.    A prototype array has been built and used in their classrooms.    Once the rest of the large area cosmic ray arrays are built, the longer-term plan is to have the arrays exhibited in a highly visible public area in the state of NJ (such as in a science museum exhibit), exposing the public to particle physics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/22/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eva Halkiadakis"
