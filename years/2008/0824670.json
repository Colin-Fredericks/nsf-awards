 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project, acquiring and developing a 3D Imaging and Virtual Environment System, aims at bridging the content gap that limits the use of 3D models because of the difficulty of creating and obtaining 3 D content. The integrated platform collects laser range data in conjunction with photometric stereotypes. Motivations include:\r\n\r\n-Enabling development of integrated digital imaging and visualization tools for different areas,\r\n-Providing powerful tools for developing new approaches for acquiring, processing, and visualizing 3D data, and\r\n-Sharing the facility to expand the contributions.\r\n\r\nThe facility, used for a wide variety of research and teaching activities, should enable improved methods and tools for 3D characterization and modeling in several areas. Expectations include: \r\n\r\n- A Versatile digital imaging and analysis system for rapid characterization of 3D field objects, including procedures for 3D shape capture, generating 3D textures surfaces, stitching images, automated image interpretation and data extraction, and\r\n-Virtual environment system particularly suited to visualizing, manipulating, and processing digitally scanned 3D images.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Societal impacts involve integration of education and research, participation of minorities and women, enhancement of infrastructure, and rapid and broad dissemination of results.\r\n\r\n",
