 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diadromous (migratory) fish are experiencing a 'rebirth' of late. Researchers, managers, and communities are recognizing that restoring migratory fish can benefit the health of entire river ecosystems. However, in many regions, including the Penobscot River and the Gulf of Maine, diadromous species restoration is occurring in a scattered and uncoordinated fashion. The Diadromous Species Restoration Research Network (DSRRN) will integrate these diverse activities in ways that improve understanding of ecosystems and enhance restoration outcomes. Diadromous fish, such as Atlantic salmon, present unique management and conservation challenges as they move between local habitats lakes and rivers and regional/international waters during their lives. DSRRN will facilitate the study of questions fundamental to diadromous fish ecology and restoration through scientific meetings, workshops and local networking. DSRRN will enhance coordination of diadromous species restoration efforts of academic, government, and watershed stakeholders in the Penobscot River by providing administrative structure, and by supporting information management and outreach.\r\n\r\nThe strength of DSRRN is its integration with the Penobscot River Restoration Project in Maine, the most ambitious restoration effort ever proposed for a watershed of this size. This project is significant because of its magnitude, its collaborative nature, and the very real potential to restore a diverse community of fishes that have important commercial and recreational value. The knowledge gained from DSRRN's efforts will guide future restorations of these valuable natural resources.",
