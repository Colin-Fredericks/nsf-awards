 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues the support for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Dartmouth College which has been running since 1999.  As materials research within the campus has evolved and broadened, so have the trends and research theme of this REU Site.  Initially focused on Molecular Materials, the current program draws on the facilities of the Center for Nanomaterials Research at Dartmouth and offers interdisciplinary research projects involving faculty research groups in the departments of Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and Dartmouth Medical School.  Ten undergraduate students will be recruited nationally each year for a nine-week summer program that will engage them in collaborative research projects in materials synthesis, computation and characterization.  Students will be encouraged to present their research results at professional meetings and publish them in journals. In addition, the REU students will participate in weekly seminars, short course in Ethics taught by faculty from Philosophy Department, and receive training on technical communication skills.  The program also includes field trips to local industry and government laboratories as well as recreational activities that would enhance interaction among the participants.  \r\n\r\nThis REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
