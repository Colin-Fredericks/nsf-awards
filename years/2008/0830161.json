 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Investigators  propose to develop and implement novel and\r\nefficient Gaussian-beam-based computational methods for large-scale computational\r\nelectromagnetics motivated by industrial and military applications. The project addresses\r\nseveral fundamental issues in scientific computing and applied mathematics, such as\r\nmulti-scale modeling, simulation, and inverse problems, which are essential in material\r\nsciences and nanotechnology. Computational electromagnetics has become a fundamental,\r\nvigorously growing technology in diverse science and engineering disciplines, ranging\r\nfrom radar, sonar, seismic imaging, medical imaging, lithography processing, detection of\r\nland mines, submarine detection, stealth technology, remote sensing, electronics to\r\nmicroscopy and nanotechnology. The new methodology resulting from Eulerian Gaussian beam\r\nmethods has substantial impact on computational electromagnetics and applications,\r\nparticularly at high frequencies.\r\n\r\nThe research involves  large-scale direct and inverse scattering problems for electromagnetic\r\nwave propagation with high wave numbers. The Investigators will develop efficient and accurate\r\nEulerian Gaussian beam methods for Maxwell's equations in inhomogeneous media in the high\r\nwave number regime. Furthermore, the Investigators will apply the new Gaussian methods to three\r\nchallenging and practically important problems for Maxwell's equations: inverse medium\r\nproblems, large cavity problems, and diffraction grating problems. New Eulerian\r\nGaussian-beam-based algorithms will be developed for the first time for these applications.\r\nThe Gaussian beam method will be capable of producing uniform asymptotic solutions beyond\r\ncaustics for wave propagation with high wave numbers. These new Eulerian Gaussian beam\r\nmethods should also provide an efficient tool for many other applications related to\r\nelectromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous media.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n",
