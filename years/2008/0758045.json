 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of an ongoing experiment to measure the strength of certain types of electroweak interactions. The electroweak force (one of the fundamental forces in nature) gives rise to an intrinsic energy difference between right- and left-handed configurations of particles and electromagnetic fields. Here, molecules are used in a novel scheme to amplify this (usually tiny) effect by many orders of magnitude. This should make it possible to measure as-yet unseen features of the electroweak force, in particular how it is modified by the presence of strong forces inside an atomic nucleus.\r\n\r\nThis work involves extensive student training. Two current PhD students will complete their theses on the project, and another will be sought. Five undergraduates have participated to date, and a similar continued level of undergraduate involvement is anticipated. In addition, this project will continue to provide significant collaborative effort, including: participation of (at least) two faculty members from nearby small colleges, where on-campus research is not feasible; cross-disciplinary collaborations with chemists; and work with theorists in both Russia and the U.S.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to study certain aspects of the weak interaction&mdash;one of the four fundamental forces of nature.  True to its name, this force produces extremely tiny changes in the quantum energy levels in atoms.  Our experiment is centered on a novel approach, which uses some features of diatomic molecules to amplify the effect of the weak interaction by a factor of roughly 100 billion compared to the case of atoms where previous studies have been made.  This amplification is predicted to be large enough to allow us to measure some aspects of the weak interaction that have never before been seen. This in turn will allow a comparison to theoretical predictions, cross-checking the validity of one of the most fundamental theories in science, in ways not before possible.\n\nAt the inception of this project, the experimental methods needed to precisely control and measure diatomic molecules, as needed to study the weak interaction, were poorly developed.  Our team made significant advances in this area.  We devised a method to detect the required type of molecules with unprecedented sensitivity.  We also demonstrated the ability to measure the relevant quantum energy states of these molecules, with resolution at the anticipated (but never before achieved) level of precision.  While we were not able to measure the effects of the weak interaction during this phase of the project, our progress has put us on the threshold of doing so in the near future. \n\nIn the meantime, our improved ability to understand and control the relevant quantum states of molecules may prove to have impacts well outside the original goals of our study.  For example, the exact same system we have studied has recently been proposed for use as a novel sensor for microwave radiation.  It has also been proposed for use as a way to simulate the behavior of a very general but poorly understood class of chemical reactions.  Hence, as often happens in the course of experiments aimed at studying fundamental phenomena, it appears that our work could end up having impact in more applied realms.\n\nIn addition to the Intellectual Merit of the work described above, our work has had substantial Broader Impacts.  Most significantly, this grant contributed to the education and training of five doctoral students and four undergraduates.  These young scientists have had to develop extensive skills and experience in a wide variety of technical and scientific areas, including analog, digital, and radiofrequency electronics design, construction, and testing; design and use of lasers, optics, and electro-optics; theory and practice of magnetic resonance techniques; software development and use for data acquisition and experimental modeling; CAD design for mechanical, optical, and vacuum equipment; etc.  Our project also included the participation of two faculty members at nearby undergraduate-only institutions, where on-campus research is not feasible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Demille"
