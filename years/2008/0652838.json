 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) is to integrate and synthesize knowledge of arctic environmental change, including global feedbacks and impacts of arctic processes, by planning, fostering, and conducting arctic research of the highest possible quality in cooperation with international partners. IARC has pursued a goal of reduction of uncertainty in component models of various aspects of the arctic system, as well as the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data against which to compare model results.  During the present award, IARC will focus on capturing the gains made in previous work, and look to a future role in which it serves as a focal point and catalyst for national and international collaboration on understanding the arctic system through modeling and synthesis, and transferring the resultant knowledge to the broader US and international community through a series of creative and vibrant outreach and educational programs. During this period the IARC will also assess its organizational structure under its new management and firmly establish its relationship to the broader arctic research community.",
