 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 0810537  \r\nEchekki \r\n\r\nThis collaborative computational-experimental efforts will study the mechanisms thermo-diffusive instabilities in turbulent flame kernels at lean fuel conditions. The flame kernel is an important fundamental canonical problem of relevance to many practical applications where fuel-lean combustion technologies are developed to reduce emissions. The computations, led by the U.S.-based PI, will be based on spatially- and temporally-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) with realistic descriptions of chemistry and transport. The experiment is based on non-intrusive optical diagnostic approaches to image the transient evolution of turbulent kernels. This study is directly relevant to an emerging combustion technology based on burning fuel-lean mixtures to minimize pollutants emissions while maintains a high degree of combustion efficiency. The project activities will support two junior scientists: one from Egypt and the other from the US program. The planned activities will promote the exchange of expertise and ideas among the U.S. and Egyptian researchers on a topic of global importance. This project is supported by the U.S. Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology, which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.",
