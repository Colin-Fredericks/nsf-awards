 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThis project is enabling students in the second semester general chemistry laboratory course to participate in an authentic research experience involving the synthesis and characterization of novel fluoride perovskites as potential pigment materials. The project stems from university's participation in the REEL (Research Experiences to Enhance Learning)consortium which includes 15 Ohio colleges and universities dedicated to introducing laboratory based research into first and second year courses. Whereas previously students analyzed X-ray and spectroscopy data collected by others now they are collecting their own data. So far, about 100 (mostly unreported) perovskite fluoride-related compositions have been prepared by students. In preparing these materials, the general chemistry students are providing a combinatorial approach to synthesis and characterization. This project also involves a component in which the funded equipment is enabling integration of hands-on experiments in undergraduate courses in the Geology Department.",
