 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Estimating Compensated Discount\r\nFunctions\r\nInstitution: Boston University\r\nAbstract Date: 07/11/08\r\n\r\nThis research uses economic experiments to empirically test fundamental theories\r\nabout how people make economic decisions in dynamic situations. Existing\r\nexperiments on intertemporal choice do not provide conclusive evidence for or against\r\nthese theories, because they do not control for the fact that subjects might expect\r\nchanges in their future financial situation.\r\n\r\nThe investigators conduct a series of experiments designed to address this problem. In\r\ntheir experiments, they ask subjects to decide between dated prizes that are contingent\r\non the subject's real income. The prizes are either a money payment to the subject or a\r\ncontribution to a charity chosen by the subject.\r\nThe experiments are conducted in Iceland in collaboration with researchers from the\r\nInternal Revenue Services of Iceland and the University of Reykjavik. Iceland is unique\r\nbecause under Icelandic law personal income tax returns are public information, so the\r\ninvestigators will be able to determine each subjects actual earned income in future\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThis research will resolve a debate in economics that is directly relevant for public\r\npolicy. Researchers have been concerned that many people do not make consistent\r\nchoices in dynamic situations. If this is the case, then society may be better off with\r\npublic policies that constrain individual choices about retirement savings, unhealthy\r\nbehaviors, and other goods where an individual may choose pleasure today despite\r\nlarge costs in the future. The results will tell us if inconsistent choices are truly a\r\nwidespread phenomenon.",
