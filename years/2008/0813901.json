 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on multiscale and stochastic numerical methods\r\nfor complex multiphysics problems. A parallel computational framework\r\nfor modeling various multiscale applications will be developed.  The\r\nmodels of interest will be based on coupling the Stokes or the\r\nNavier-Stokes equations with single phase or multiphase Darcy flow.\r\nThe flow system will be coupled with reactive transport.  The research\r\napproach is based on a multiblock domain decomposition methodology.\r\nThe simulation domain is a union of subdomains (blocks).  Each block\r\nis associated with a physical, mathematical, and numerical\r\nmodel. Physically meaningful interface conditions are imposed on the\r\ndiscrete level via mortar finite elements. The formulation provides\r\ngreat flexibility for multiphysics and multinumerics\r\ncouplings. Furthermore, this domain decomposition approach, combined\r\nwith coarse scale mortar elements, provides a multiscale approximation\r\nand an efficient way to solve the coarse grid problem in parallel.\r\nUncertainty in the physical characteristics is modeled via stochastic\r\npartial differential equations. Approximation in probability space is\r\nachieved using stochastic finite element and collocation methods.  The\r\nmain components of the research will be 1) development of multiscale\r\nmathematical models, identifying appropriate interface conditions, and\r\nanalysis of the well-posedness of the models; 2) novel discretization\r\ntechniques for stochastic partial differential equations; 3) a\r\nposteriori error estimates and adaptive mesh refinement algorithms in\r\nphysical and stochastic space; and (4) efficient parallel domain\r\ndecomposition solvers and preconditioners.\r\n\r\nThe research methodology can be applied for the design, analysis, and\r\nimplementation of computational methods for a large class of problems\r\narising in science and engineering applications. The project will\r\nemphasize accurate, robust, and efficient numerical methods for\r\nproblems exhibiting behavior on a wide range of scales in space and\r\ntime. The research also aims to quantify uncertainty in the prediction\r\ndue to to uncertainty in the input parameters through stochastic\r\nmodeling.  The research results will be applied to two main\r\napplication areas: couplings of surface water with groundwater flows\r\nand modeling complex multiscale processes occurring in the\r\ninflammatory response in the human body. Computer modeling of\r\nsubsurface and surface flow and transport has a major economic impact\r\non environmental and energy industries. Due to the proximity of\r\ngroundwater and surface water systems, contamination of rivers, lakes,\r\nand wetlands can lead to contamination of aquifers and\r\nvice-versa. Simulating these complex interactions is a major\r\ncomputational challenge. Acute inflammation, which occurs in response\r\nto trauma or infection, may lead to a systemic inflammation or\r\nsepsis. Sepsis frequently leads to organ failure and death (with more\r\nthat 500,000 fatal cases per year in the U.S.). Effective treatments\r\nare lacking, due to the complexity of the process. Mathematical and\r\ncomputer modeling is becoming a more common tool in the effort to gain\r\ninsight of the dynamics and spatial characteristics of the\r\ninflammatory process.\r\n",
