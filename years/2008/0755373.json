 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an REU Site offering undergraduate students to participate \r\nin research activities associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives conducted at the \r\nUniversity of Connecticut. The initiatives aim at advancing the application of modern \r\ncomputing infrastructure and information technology to research and practice in various \r\nlife-science disciplines. Specific research activities include several inter-disciplinary \r\nprojects led by researchers at the University of Connecticut. This REU Site supports ten \r\nundergraduate students for an eight-week summer research program in each project year.\r\n\r\nStudent participants have a sufficient background in computing or biological science and \r\nare interested in both. A series of training seminars by the project staff is designed to \r\nequip students with preliminary background knowledge. The seminars introduce to students \r\nconcepts about modern grid computing infrastructure and related information technology, \r\nas well as some ongoing life-science research projects that rely on or benefit from such \r\ninfrastructures. A major component of the program is for students to work with the project \r\nstaff on one research project. Students have the opportunity to participate in the Annual \r\nInternational Bio-Grid Workshop. This further broadens their vision by allowing them to \r\nwitness similar research projects conducted worldwide. Intellectual merits of the proposed \r\nactivity are associated with the Bio-Grid initiatives in the investigation of computing \r\ninfrastructure, algorithmic techniques, middleware support and resource management strategies, \r\nthat are generally applicable to research and practice in life sciences. Broader impacts \r\nresulting from the proposed activity therefore lie in the preparation of software engineers \r\nto formalize and solve problems emerging from life sciences, as well as life-science \r\nresearchers and professionals to gain a strong background in information processing techniques.",
