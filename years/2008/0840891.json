 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the critical resource constraints, it is important to provide an optimization of utilization of the deployed resource for reliable communication in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). One of the main challenges is developing a scalable and distributed method to identify the resource deficit and redundancy and to control the corresponding scheduling/balancing activities within local area, i.e., a cost-effective localized solution for max-min problem.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the management of the deficit and the redundancy of network coverage and connectivity to solve the hole problem in WSNs. The research provides a comprehensive understanding of network topology in the local view of each sensor node as well as a local description of the network configuration for the resource of the coverage and connectivity.  As a result, the global configuration can be inferred into each local description. Therefore, the global optimization can be achieved while keeping all the actions into a limited area. The investigator finds a new routing scheme to avoid the effect of resource deficit caused by holes, provides a hole-repair process with synchronization and conflict control, and extends all the results from 2-D networks to 3-D networks and from uniform disk communication range model to realistic model. This research leads to new directions in efficient resource management in the fields of energy conservation, secured communication establishment and management, data delivery in delay tolerant mobile networks, and node collaboration. It is likely to make WSNs more affordable and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications.",
