 "awd_abstract_narration": "0824978\r\nZachos\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funding for a new gas source dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Kiel carbonate device. Requested is a Thermo MAT 253 with a Kiel IV prep device. The system will be capable of routine carbon and oxygen isotope analyses from carbonates with high precision and low sample size (~5 \u00b5g C). The acquisition will allow the use of individual acid reaction vessels, increasing precision and minimizing sample sizes. The instrument will add to existing analysis capability. General research themes outlined for the new instrumentation fall into the areas of paleoclimatology, paleoceanography and paleoecology. One focus is understanding the biogeochemistry and climate evolution of the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic ?greenhouse? worlds; the causes and evolution of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The PI intends to measure shell carbonates spanning the PETM in the fossil record. Shell analysis obviates artifacts due to sediment reworking or bioturbation, but requires low sample volumes. A related project will look at the coupling of biogeochemical cycling, including nutrients, and climatic forcings during the PETM. The instrument will also be applied to understanding paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental forcings on the ecology, evolution of extant and ancient vertebrates (extinct). In addition, foraminiferal isotope analysis will be used to reconstruct paleoclimates associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Aside from the PI and co-PI research thrusts, a number of other PIs at UCSC and elsewhere will be supported. The management plan has the new instrument replacing an Optima (which will be retired). No additional laboratory space will thus been needed. A lead technician and lab manager is currently employed and partial support is requested in Year 1. Zachos will oversee the installation and initial management of the Kiel IV device. It is expected that grant support and per-sample fees will support the facility long-term. The UCSC Stable Isotope Laboratory operates on an open access policy. This helps attract users from UCSC, other regional institutions and the international scientific community. Users have been roughly ~50% female. Recharge rates are kept low and the laboratory manager provides extensive training. UC-wide programs such as the California Alliance for Minority Participation ensures a diverse in-house user base.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
