 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum Control of Impurity States in a Semiconductor\r\nBrage Golding and Mark Dykman\r\nMichigan State University\r\nE. Lansing, MI 48824\r\nABSTRACT\r\nQuantum information is a new and rapidly developing interdisciplinary area of research\r\nthat resides at the interface between quantum physics and information science. It\r\naddresses some of the most challenging fundamental problems in science and technology\r\nwhile seeking to advance our understanding of the unique properties of the quantum\r\nworld. Among the predictions in this field is that of an exponential speedup of computers\r\nthat operate on purely quantum principles. If quantum properties are to be exploited for\r\nqualitatively new capabilities, it is necessary to build systems that exhibit long-lived,\r\ncontrollable quantum states. In addition, the devices should be compatible with\r\nconventional electronics and photonics. The devices based on controlled impurity states\r\nin semiconductors stand out as particularly attractive, since they should be scalable,\r\noperate at high speed, and take advantage of existing semiconductor technology.\r\nThe quantum systems studied in this experimental and theoretical research are based on\r\nacceptors in a semiconductor such as silicon. These are substitutional dopants, whose\r\natomic-like properties are well-known and invariant. The two states of a qubit are the\r\nlowest orbital states of the acceptor, a result of splitting of the ground state by strain and\r\nelectric field. The distance between the energy levels is in the range of a few GHz and\r\neach qubit is individually controlled by a gate electrode. Single-qubit operations can be\r\nperformed with short microwave pulses whereas two-qubit operations are enabled by the\r\nlong-range dipolar interaction between the acceptors, which allows the qubit-qubit\r\ndistance to be more than 100 nm. The readout of the final state of the system is based on\r\nquantum nondemolition optical measurement of light scattering by an exciton bound to\r\nthe acceptor.",
