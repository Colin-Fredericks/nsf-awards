Prof. Hilier's research program focuses on the development of highly sensitive surface plasmon spectroscopic methods for quantitative studies of adsorption of analytes to surfaces. Prof. Hilier and his students will perform detailed experimental and modeling studies to better understand and optimize the conditions needed to facilitate maximum enhancement of light transmission through metal-coated gratings.  The proposed studies will be directly applicable to the development of a greatly improved surface plasmon spectroscopic technique. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a spectroscopic method development project wit the potential to revolutionize the field of surface plasmon spectroscopy.",
