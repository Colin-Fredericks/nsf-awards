 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artin groups are a large class of groups commonly studied by geometric\r\ngroup theorists.  They are related to Coxeter groups, they include and\r\ngeneralize the braid groups, and they have a natural definition\r\ninvolving complexified hyperplane complements.  Despite these\r\naffiliations with well-known objects, very few Artin groups are\r\ncurrently understood, even at a basic level, and those that are belong\r\nto highly restrictive families defined primarily by the situations\r\nwhere existing techniques can be applied.  The approach described here\r\nis fundamentally new and different.  The goal of this proposal is to\r\nunderstand the natural, continuous geometric objects (recently\r\nintroduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators) that\r\nhave the potential to serve as a geometric foundation for the study of\r\nall Artin groups in a uniform fashion.  These geometric objects,\r\ncalled factor geometries, are of interest in their own right.  There\r\nis, for example, a natural continuous group G that has the orthogonal\r\ngroup as a quotient, contains the braid group as a subgroup, and is\r\nthe fundamental group of a finite-dimensional metric simplicial\r\ncomplex whose universal cover is the contractible factor geometry with\r\na building-like structure on which G acts.  This unusual uncountable\r\ngroup and space, defined via the collection of minimal factorizations\r\nof spherical isometries into reflections, is a hybrid mix of Lie\r\ngroups and metric simplicial complexes, and every Artin group acts on\r\na similarly defined continuous geometric object.  The eventual\r\nstructure theory should resemble that of Lie groups and early\r\nindications are that these types of complexes carry geometric and\r\ncombinatorial structures sufficient to resolve many longstanding\r\nconjectures about arbitrary Artin groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical objects, like many physical objects, can be better\r\nunderstood when we fully understand the symmetries they possess.  The\r\nalgebraic structure that records how these symmetries interact is\r\ncalled a ``group'' and the groups under consideration here are a class\r\nof groups generated by ``reflections'' (a symmetry like the reflected\r\nimage one sees through a mirror).  The main goal of this project is to\r\ndeepen our understanding of the relationship between symmetry groups\r\nbuilt from reflections (specifically Coxeter groups) and a second\r\nclass of symmetry groups, called Artin groups.  The most famous\r\nexample of an Artin group is the braid group, the group that keeps\r\ntrack of the distinct ways in which several strands of string can be\r\nbraided together.  Constructions involving Coxeter groups, Artin\r\ngroups and braid groups proliferate throughout mathematics, including\r\nsome recent mathematical physics. In many of these cases, the\r\nimmediate connections are, strictly speaking, to Artin groups rather\r\nthan Coxeter groups, but these connections have not been pursued\r\npartly because the theory of Artin groups is underdeveloped.  Once\r\nthis situation is rectified within geometric group theory, the next\r\nstep will be to export the resulting structure theory to these\r\nneighboring domains\r\n",
