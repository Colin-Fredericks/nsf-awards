 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by the Science, Technology & Society program at NSF, investigates a key mechanism for the technical community in designing the Internet.  It is widely agreed that the design of the Internet both restricts and offers opportunities to the U.S. government as it makes and implements laws and regulations.  This project will analyze how designers involved in technical decision-making for the Internet treat legal and policy issues.  A comprehensive content and policy analysis will be made of the documentary record of the discourse method through which this decision-making has been taking place since 1969.  Known as the Internet Requests for Comments (RFCs) process, this conversation has by now produced over 5000 texts.  Research results will contribute to our understanding of the intersection of Internet and legal issues by:  (1) analyzing the extent to which, and how, specific legal issues were treated by technical decision-makers;  (2) providing insight into the process by which the Internet has been designed, itself now a model for a number of other policy-makers involved with technological systems; (3) helping to bring technical and legal decision-making issues into a common conversation; (4) advancing the development of research methods for analysis of technological discourses that have policy consequences.  This research will provide information for scholars and policy-makers seeking to understand how technical decision-making, global management (e.g., by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), and the laws of the U.S. and other governments interact.",
