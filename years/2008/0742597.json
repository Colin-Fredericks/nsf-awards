The unit will be used for a wide range of geoscience and environmental science applications. The requested unit from Chemchek Instruments allows uranium measurement in water, environmental samples, industrial solutions and for bioassay. In addition, the unit can measure lanthanides (Dy, Eu, Sm, Tb, and Tm) in solution. Detection limits of 0.01 \u00b5g L-1 uranium is possible with the instrument as is speciation determination between U(IV) and U(IV). Uranium contamination is a serious environmental threat impacting groundwater, soils, and sediments. The KPA unit will be instrumental in the following research efforts, 1) understanding the role of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria in precipitating toxic metals via enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes, 2) understand the fate and transport of nanometer sized uraninite particles in groundwater and vadoze zone, 3) the fate, transport and migration (including aerial) of U compounds associated with historical mining activities, 4) the role of humic substances as electron acceptors and its impact on dissimilatory U reduction, and 5) U complexes in aerosol particles and their changes during atmospheric transport. Sani will administer the instrument and provide training. Sani will also provide radiation safety training. Lab space is already available. Project funds will support consumables. Students will be exposed to environmental issues related to heavy metal and radionuclide contamination. Research results will be disseminated via publications and through presentations at meetings.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
