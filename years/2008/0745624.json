The Northern Basin and Range reveals crustal deformation resulting from extension that has been overprinted by Yellowstone volcanism.  Hotspot volcanism influences extensional processes in its track through increased heat flow, decreased earthquake activity and mafic dike intrusions over distances of 350 km from the hotspot's current position. The Yellowstone Hotspot has significantly modified the composition of the crust in the Snake River Plain from the surrounding basin and range regions.  Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the pronounced seismic quiescence of the Snake River Plain surrounded by very active regions.  The project includes resurveys of 60 GPS monuments and combination of these measurements with an extensive data set covering the Snake River Plain and adjacent basin and range.  These measurements are used used to define regions of coherent strain, estimate strain rates, predict fault slip and assess block motions, thereby constraining the tectonic processes within the Northern Basin and Range and track of the Yellowstone Hotspot.",
