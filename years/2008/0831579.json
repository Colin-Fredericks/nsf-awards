 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project investigates a number of fundamental \r\nproblems that are very critical to wireless mesh network (WMN) \r\nthroughput optimization. Wireless mesh networking is believed to \r\nbe the most effective and efficient technology for the last-mile \r\ndata connection to the Internet. The proposed research targets \r\nto solve the following challenges: 1) Throughput optimization in \r\nMR-MC WMNs: the complexity of throughput-optimal scheduling, \r\nreal-time logical topology characterization and inference, the \r\njoint exploitation of both rate diversity and channel diversity, \r\nand game theory based throughput optimization. 2) Non information \r\ntheory based approaches to throughput optimization in multi-hop \r\nMIMO-enabled WMNs: stochastically modeling different aspects of \r\nthe mesh network, constructing Network Utility Maximization \r\nformulations, and applying Information Geometric Programming to \r\nsolve global optimization problems. 3) Biologically-inspired WMN \r\ndesign for throughput optimizatio n. 4) A testbed to accomplish \r\nexperimental tasks to validate the effectiveness of the design. \r\n\r\nThis project is in nature multidisciplinary. It requires the \r\njoint effort from computer science, electrical engineering, \r\nmathematics, statistics, and biology, and therefore has the \r\npotential to inspire revolutionary methodologies that could be \r\napplied to many domains. In addition, the novelty of the proposed \r\nresearch has strong impact on wireless research. Furthermore, the \r\nsuccess of this project is able to enhance the four universities? \r\nability to educate, through the multi-disciplinary research effort, \r\nfuture scientists and engineers.",
