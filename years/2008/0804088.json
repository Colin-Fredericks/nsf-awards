 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, a renewal of an earlier one, to Washington University by the Solid State Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to develop an understanding of factors governing the synthesis of metal nanostructures so that one may predictably prepare them with well-controlled shapes, sizes, and compositions for integration into various technologies.  The main focus of this work will be on the mechanistic studies of the generation and control of the twin defects in the nanostructures and hence a deeper understanding of the fundamental framework within which nanostructures of a certain shape can be fabricated.  This is an important area and yet challenging issue in nanoscience and nanotechnology in that the materials properties and functionalities (e.g., photonics and catalysis) are sensitively dependent upon the surface morphologies. The current state of the art is more like art than science. The proposed work is anticipated to offer some fundamental insights to the mechanistic control and hence a rationale for materials design and preparation. Such a fundamental understanding is highly relevant to design such nanoparticles for applications in sensing, electronics, catalysis and medicine.\r\n\r\nThe project has links with many scientific disciplines that include solid state chemistry/physics, catalysis, and photonics, and has potential applications in medicine, environment, energy and other fields.  The PI plans to continue to widely disseminate the results from his studies to the science community.  This project, if successful, is expected to provide new advances in such areas as new class of nanomaterials for sensing, biomedical applications, and catalysis that will address issues related to national security, health, environment, and energy.  In addition, the planned research is expected to enhance both graduate and undergraduate education through this multidisciplinary research and training.\r\n",
