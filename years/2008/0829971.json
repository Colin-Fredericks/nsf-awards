The 7th International Symposium will take place in Mexico City, Mexico on the campus Institute Polytechnical National (IPN) from May 20-22, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual focus areas of the Symposium are the state of the Chemical and Metallurgical process engineering from both the industrial and academic point of view, and the energy needs for society in the 21st century. The potential broader impacts of sending a group of U.S. professors to this Symposium include (a) creation of new and strengthening of existing U.S.-Mexico academic research interactions, (b) enhancement of interactions of U.S. faculty with PEMEX, the Mexican Petroleum company as well as other industrial participants of the symposium (c) improved understanding of the impact of globalization and NAFTA on U.S. chemical manufacturing and (d) international dissemination of NSF-supported research results.\r\n\r\nThe 7th International Symposium will be chaired by Prof. Luis A. Galicia-Luna. The U.S. participants to be supported are Prof. Ram B. Gupta (Auburn Univ.), Prof. Kenneth R. Hall (Texas A&M), Prof. Athanassios Z. Panagiotopoulos (Princeton Univ.) and Prof. Philip E. Savage (U. of Michigan). As stated above, the focus of the Symposium is the state of the Chemical and Metallurgical process engineering from both the industrial and academic point of view, and the energy needs for  society in the 21st century.  The symposium is normally attended by close to 100 Mexican and other Latin American professors and students. Some of the non-USA participants ultimately attend USA Universities to initial and complete collaborative research projects.\r\n\r\nThe ESIQIE - IPN Symposium organizers will provide support for local\r\nlodging, thus significantly reducing the net cost to the NSF of USA participation.",
