 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative effort, Drs Bruce Balick (University of Washington), Richard Henry (University of Oklahoma), and Karen Kwitter (Williams College) will complement extant studies of the least evolved and most extended stellar populations with observations of the metal-enriched gas ejected from early generations of stars in the Milky Way (the \"Galaxy\") and our nearest sibling neighbor galaxy, M31.  The results will constrain and challenge extant models of how all galaxies evolved or merged into others. In addition, the means by which elements such as nitrogen and oxygen have been formed in dying stars will be determined by measuring the historical rates of their production. The data products will include databases of spectra and abundances of planetary nebulae (PNe) in all galactic environments, doubling the size of the present sample derived for of PNe near the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe history of galaxy formation must be read from the shape, dynamics, and chemistry of its oldest and least evolved \"fossil\" stars. These stars are found throughout the extended, largely undisturbed outer regions of all galaxies, large and small. The chemistry and kinematics of these stars help to constrain the models for the early assembly of galaxies, the role of ongoing assimilation of dwarf galaxies, the ejections of younger stars into the old thick disk and halo, the feedback of heavy elements from the nucleus, supernovae, and AGB mass loss, the influence of dark matter, and the rates and size scales of the formation of structure in the early and highly chaotic universe.  As a part of this research, new methods for analyzing the data and measuring chemical abundances will be developed for faint nebulae. These will have application throughout extragalactic astronomy in such areas as element production rates in very early supernovae and the chemical properties of distant quasars.  In addition, all of the activities that will take place as a part of this research program have been conceived with the goal of providing research opportunities for undergraduate students, especially those students from underrepresented groups.  The students will be direct participants in analyzing the data and developing creative interpretive ideas that form the core motivation for practicing science and research, and for understanding its role in modern society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first chapter of the history of cosmic life is the story of the atoms from which DNA is constructed: primarily carbon(C), nitrogen(N), and oxygen(O).  However, no CNO survived the Big Bang. Instead the story of CNO production is a story of stellar nuclear processing and gas ejection that enriches these elements in subsequent generations of stars.    \n\nThe present program was designed to study the historical production and ejection rates of CNO by measuring the abundance of oxygen in aging stars (called planetary nebulae, \"PNe\") of various masses and ages located throughout galaxies such as the Milky Way.  We chose oxygen because its signature emissions are bright for all likely ionization stages, O+ and O++.  (Optical observations of C and N are far more problematic.)  That is, oxygen is an excellent proxy for CNO.\n\n A complete set of observations that address our goals would include stars in both the inner regions of the disks of galaxies like ours (where stars are continuously being formed in the spiral arms) and the surrounding halos (where the star formation has long ceased and stars are thought to be ancient).  The ancient stars were supposed to reveal the abundances of O at the time the galaxies first formed just 2-4 billion years after the Big Bang.  The newer stars in spiral arms would have incorporated O from several previous generations of stars and, hence, have much higher O abundances.\n\n\nSince local dust occludes our view of the ancient outermost stars of the Milky Way we elected to observe our sibling galaxy, Andromeda (M31) located 2 million light years away.  M31 is alleged to be generally similar to but far less active than the Milky Way.  Although they are fainter than PNe in the MW, the brightest of the 3000 known PNe in M31 are within reach of large telescopes.  Another advantage of M31 is that the abundances of its major stellar populations have been studied in great detail by the Hubble Space Telescope.  This provides extremely valuable complementary information for our study.  To this end we received the equivalent of 10 nights of time on two of the largest telescopes in the world since 2009 (with more three more to come in 2015).\n\n\nOur findings surprised us.  The O abundances of PNe appear to be nearly solar everywhere in M31.  Such O enrichments are truly extraordinary.  We attribute them to a recent and previously undetected episode of star formation despite the fact that fresh gas and dust in this outer region today is undetectable.  We favor a scenario in which the outer regions of M31 have been \"polluted\" by the debris of the near collision with M31's largest neighbor galaxy, M33 (a small spiral galaxy), about 3 billion years ago.  This M31-M33 encounter could have stripped some of the CNO-rich gas from M31's inner disk and spread it from disk radii of 25,000 light years to distances ten times larger. The PNe that we observed would have evolved from stars that formed from the detritus of this encounter.\n\nSince our the stunning results of our observations were originally published (2013) other groups have been confirmed in the populations of stars both in the inner and outer parts of M31 and two of its brightest companion galaxies.\n\n \n\nIn summary, the original objectives of our program &mdash; the mapping of oxygen abundances as a function of distance from the inner disk of M31 (radius &lt; 50,000 light years) to its outermost reaches (radius 50,000 to 300,000 light years) led to deeply puzzling results: the trends in the abundance of oxygen are vastly different than for heavier elements.  We expected the oxygen abundance to behave like iron; i.e., decrease from about its solar value in the inner disk of M31 to 1-5%.  Instead, the oxygen abundance remains nearly solar. \n\nThis result means that the history of oxygen enrichment is far different than all current well-established theories predict for the Milky Way.  Does this result falsify long standing theories of galaxy evolution?  No.  We propos..."
