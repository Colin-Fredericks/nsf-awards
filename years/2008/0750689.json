The project will make use of ground-based magnetic pulsation measurements from the McMAC magnetometer array.  The ground-based pulsation data will be supplemented with solar wind measurements from the ACE satellite and magnetic pulsation measurements from the Geotail and GOES satellites.  The data analysis will include 3-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using a realistic plasmasphere density structure.  Cavity mode waves may play an important role in the transport and energization of particles in the radiation belts.",

The short answer to the question is that the magnetosphere is a resonator.  A resonator is an object that oscillates at selective frequencies.  We are all familiar with musical instruments such as the pipe organ and piano, which emit sounds at a particular pitch or tone (frequency in physics terms) when air is blown into a pipe (organ) or a key hits a steel wire tied at two ends (piano).  These are good examples of resonators.  Here, the organ and piano are chosen deliberately to remind you that there are two different kinds of resonators.

We were thus able to conclude, for this event, that cavity mode resonance existed in the magnetosphere.\n\n \n\nIn other studies conducted within the N..."
