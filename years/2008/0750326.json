 "awd_abstract_narration": "Srinivasan Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for work to develop a combination quantum wavepacket molecular dynamics technique for the simulation of vibrational events in hydrogen bonded systems. The system Iyengar is developing is known as the quantum wavepacket ab initio molecular dynamics, or QWAIMD, method and is being applied to the study of vibrational properties of hydrogen bonded clusters.\r\n\r\nOne of the most challenging issues in modern theoretical chemistry is determining the proper way to combine the inherently quantum mechanical description of molecules with the description of a molecule's motion, which involves classical mechanics.  This work is addressing that issue and, if successful, will have a wide impact on the development of proper descriptions of a number of important application topics including tunnelling effects in biological systems and hydrogen transfer in fuel cells.  The work is, thus, expected to have a broader impact on both biology and materials science and through the PI's extensive outreach work to under-represented students at area high schools.",

Together these have been used to understand properties in a large number of systems including those of interest in biological and materials (energy research related) chemistry.\n\nSpecial experimental techniques are required to gauge these molecular vibrations. This is because molecules vibrate at the rate of a trillion times in one second. As a result, a range of experimental techniques have been developed over the years to probe molecular properties under different conditions. In many cases the results obtained from these experiments can be quite complex. One major focus area in our pertains to developing new computational methods based on quantum mechanics, to understand and predict such properties.\n\nImpact: Through these efforts we have been successful in developing a number of new analysis tools to understand the complex behavior of molecular systems under different temperature conditions.Fig. 1 displays one such set of analysis tools. The systems shown here contain a fundamental interaction, known as the hydrogen bond, that is common in biological and materials chemistry. Detailed understanding of such systems will have a significant impact in impact in biologicalchemistry and materials science.\nOutcome 2:\nElectron transport through molecular wire systems\n\nSignificance: Electron transport between a donor and an acceptor mediated by a bridgemolecule to facilitate electron transfer, has a fundamental role in a many areas. These include: biological redox reactions where electron transport through an intervening bridge molecule iscentral to photosynthesis, advanced materials where molecular nano-electronics has now come to fore withpotential applications in problems such as sensors, photonics, electro-catalysis and solar photo-conversion,charge transfer systems in DNA and large biomolecules and atmospheric and condensed phase systems wheresolvated electron chemistry plays a critical role.

This problem is complicated by the fact that in several biological and atmospheric reactions, not only electrons, even light nuclei such as hydrogen display quantum behavior. A good example of this problem is seen in the hydrogen transfer dynamics involved in an enzyme called Soybean Lipoxygenase-1, that has been p..."
