 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well-known that the introduction of predators into ecosystems in which they were not historically present can dramatically reduce local biodiversity. Yet the effects of predators at larger spatial scales may differ substantially from their local effects if predators alter the mechanisms by which communities assemble. This study will explore how the introduction and eradication of fish predators in previously fish-free freshwater habitats affects patterns of community assembly and the resulting local and regional biodiversity. First, an experimental pond array will be constructed to test for the causal relationship between fish introductions and biodiversity at different spatial scales. Second, in cooperation with public agencies and private landowners, the PIs will experimentally determine if eradication of introduced fish successfully restores local and regional biodiversity, or whether other interventions are also needed.\r\n\r\nOverall, this project will advance the understanding of how predator introductions and eradications structure biodiversity at different spatial scales. Furthermore, information from this project may ultimately lead to new practices for restoring biodiversity at large spatial scales, including protected natural areas. In addition to providing invaluable training for future scientists by incorporating several graduate and undergraduate students, this research will be integrated with an outreach program consisting of in-depth research experiences for Saint Louis, Missouri, area high school students.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThroughout the lifetime of this project we have focused on understanding how environmental disturbances in natural habitats alter biodiversity.  In particular we have focused on understanding if and how the loss of species at local scales (for example, from a single pond) \"scale up\" and lead to regional or global extinctions.  Our work has focused on freshwater aquatic habitats (ponds), which are among the most endangered ecosystems in the world, having lost much of their biodiversity owing to habitat loss, chemical contamination, invasive species, and other disturbances.  We have conducted this work through simulation modeling, manipulative experimentation, and observational field studies in natural and artificially-constructed habitats.\n\nWe have found that whether local species losses become regional extinctions depends largely on whether disturbance act randomly or selectively.  Selective disturbance target specific species repeatedly and are thus more likely to cause extinctions of those suceptible species across large areas.  We have further found that among the disturbances in aquatic habitats that we have examined (invasive predatory fish, chemical contamination, and drought) these disturbances are strongly selective on biodiversity, leading to significant losses of biodiversity at local and regional scales.  These results suggests that, if environmental disturbances are geographically widespread, they are likely to cause more extinctions than would be predicted based on their effects at any single location.\n\nThe latter part of this project addressed if and how the loss of biodiversity across spatial scales, as described above, can be mitigated throught restoration activities.  One theory is that even once the disturbance itself is removed (for example, the removal of invasive predators), that a \"legacy\" of that threat could still persist, preventing biodiversity from recovering fully to pre-disturbance level.  We predicted that liek the initial biodiversity loss, that this legacy effect would be greatest at large spatial scales.\n\nIn several experiments addressing this restoration question, we found that biodiversity recovers surprsingly radpily following removal of the disturbance, even at large spatial scales.  These results hold for aquatic insects and other invertebrates, many of which can recolonize habitats via disersal.  For more dispersal-limited species, such as aquatic plants, recovery of biodiversity was not complete, but could be improved with assisted dispersal.  Although our results apply only to a single system, small freshwater habitats, they do suggest that several forms of passive restoration may be successful as long as dispersal limitation is not significant and the restored habitats are not extremely isolated.  And in these more challenging cases, our results further suggest  that human-assisted diserpsal can effectively restore local and regional biodiversity.\n\nThe above results will contribute to the general understanding of how biodiversity loss occurs and can be mitigated in aquatic ecosystems, and is relevant to similar topics in other ecosystems worldwide.
