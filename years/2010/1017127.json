 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data centers have become the main networking infrastructure to\r\nsupport online services, ranging from end-user applications (e.g.,\r\nWeb search and IM) to distributed system operations (e.g., GFS and\r\nMapReduce).  In this project, we explore a different design paradigm\r\nto data center networks (DCNs). We take a new server-centric\r\nsolution approach, in contrast to the switch-centered paradigm. We\r\npush intelligence into servers, which generally have more open and\r\nstandardized hardware architecture and software platforms. Multiple\r\nlayers of low-cost, commodity off-the-shelf, mini-switches are used\r\nto connect servers. We leverage the large number of servers in a\r\ndata center. Even when each server just adds one more link to the\r\nrest of servers, we obtain many links in the DCN system given the\r\nlarge server population. These added links, without using high-end\r\nswitches but using only mini-switches, provide the foundation for\r\nenhancing scalability, inter-server capacity, and fault tolerance.\r\nTaking the approach, we can design DCNs with high scalability,\r\nenhanced fault-tolerance, and high inter-server capacity, and better\r\nsupport data center applications that exhibit various traffic\r\npatterns of one-to-one, one-to-several, one-to-all, and all-to-all\r\ncommunications.  Our design also opens more space for stimulating\r\ninnovations in the DCN software through the more open programming\r\nplatform on servers, while abandoning expensive, proprietary core\r\nswitches. The results in scalable and modular data centers and\r\nassociated management tools are expected to show that, the added\r\ncomplexity into servers will incur only minor systems overhead but\r\nproduce large performance gains.",
