 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The research objective of this BRIGE award is to assemble nanostructured materials and devices with superior electrical transport properties.  Such materials will enable the creation of solar cells that are both highly efficient and affordable, a combination which has been elusive to date.  The crucial improvement in electrical transport will be attained by using biomolecules to assemble type-II semiconductor heterojunctions.  The unparalleled assembly abilities of biomolecules produce nano-architectures not possible with other techniques, but which are essential for enhanced electrical transport in these materials.  Type-II junctions have spatially distinct local energy minima for electrons and holes, thus causing rapid separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs.  The blend of bio-based assembly and type-II heterojunctions will significantly improve electrical transport within nanostructured materials and devices, transforming the field of photovoltaics and tackling the energy challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Biomolecule-assisted assembly of semiconductor heterojunctions will address the challenge of poor carrier transport in nanostructured materials and advance understanding of separation and collection of carriers within these materials.  Enhanced electrical transport in bio-assembled nanostructured materials will make low-cost, efficient solar cells a reality and aid in development of general design rules for controlled assembly of nanomaterials.  Furthermore, the BRIGE Award will provide support for a number of mentoring and outreach activities designed to increase diversity and broaden participation in engineering through coursework, research experience, and professional development opportunities.  The PI will develop and teach a service-learning class in which undergraduates address real-world problems while serving the needs of the local community.  The interdisciplinary course will nurture mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships and generate enthusiasm for solar engineering projects while building working relationships between future engineers and teachers.  Furthermore, the PI will expand her efforts to support and mentor undergraduate researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe sun supplies solar energy several orders of magnitude in excess of human consumption to the Earth\u00c6s surface each day, however the technology necessary to use this solar energy in a highly efficient, affordable manner requires further development.  In contrast to man-made approaches, Nature has been assembling complex, highly organized nanostructures for solar energy conversion for millennia.  Biomolecules such as proteins and peptides are capable of nanoscale assembly with precision and specificity far superior to the most advanced technological approaches.  During in vivo assembly the size, shape, organization, and ultimately functionality of materials can all be dictated by biomolecules such as proteins and peptides.  The objective of this research project is to understand and harness peptide interactions with abundant semiconductor materials such copper sulfide and evaluate the relevant properties of these biologically-assembled materials for future solar energy conversion applications.\n\nTwo bio-assisted methods for copper sulfide synthesis were developed during this project: one controlled by specific peptide interactions and one driven by non-specific electrostatic interactions between biomolecules and copper sulfide chemical precursors.  The type and strength of interactions between the biomolecules and chemical precursors dictated the shape and organization of the resulting nanostructures.  Depending on the biomolecule and synthesis approach, either chains of copper sulfide nanoparticles or continuous wires were formed.  Ultimately, the yield and coverage of the materials formed by non-specific interactions was greater under the experimental synthesis conditions explored.  The electrical and optical behavior of the bio-templated materials was evaluated.  The materials were low in resistance with broad spectrum absorption well-suited for solar energy conversion.  Optical absorption and electrical resistance measurements taken over time revealed material instabilities associated with atmospheric conditions.  Notably, compositional changes resulting from oxygen exposure are widely reported for nanoscale copper sulfide and are not necessarily associated with the use of biomolecules for assembly.\n\nThis research project served to train and inspire a number of science, technology, engineering, and math students, in addition to enriching the professional development of middle school science teachers and college level faculty.  Two graduate and four undergraduate students participated in the laboratory research associated with this project.  Each of these students learned not only laboratory skills, but also valuable presentation and written communication skills important for dissemination of results.  An additional three undergraduate students participated in the development, implementation, and assessment of three lessons on solar energy as well as a solar car design activity for students at local middle schools.  Over the course of the project, these lessons and activity improved the solar cell knowledge and understanding of nearly 600 middle students.  These activities cultivated collaboration between two university faculty and three middle school science teachers, improving understanding of and appreciation for the complementary needs of scientific research and science education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elaine D Haberer"
