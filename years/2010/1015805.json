 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many individual host organisms, including humans, are simultaneously coinfected by multiple pathogen species. The diversity (number and identity) of coinfecting pathogens can modulate both pathogen transmission among hosts and pathogen impacts on hosts. Nonetheless, little is known about the processes that govern pathogen diversity. This research will integrate field experiments and mathematical models to study the causes and consequences of pathogen diversity. The study consists of a model system of five viral pathogens of grasses (the cereal and barley yellow dwarf viruses). This approach will allow the investigation of the interacting roles of the pathogen species themselves, the insect vectors that transmit them, their plant hosts, climate conditions, and spatial processes in controlling the dynamics of systems that include multiple pathogen species. Further, it will elucidate the mechanisms by which pathogens interact, and evaluate the consequences of these interactions for pathogen transmission and host fitness.   \r\n\r\nThis study will be of both scientific and societal significance. The work will advance the understanding multi-pathogen dynamics - a key step towards developing a comprehensive understanding of the ecology of infectious disease. It will include participation of under-represented groups, community outreach, and dissemination of results through both public talks and peer-reviewed journals. The investigators will integrate this research with education at both K-12 and university levels. The pathogens are among the most economically important viruses of crops, so this study may have benefits for agriculture. Moreover, these pathogens provide an experimentally tractable model for vector-transmitted generalist pathogens, the dominant type of emerging pathogen of humans, crops, and other species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvery animal and plant individual hosts a diversity of microbes that together comprise the microbiome.  These microbes range from viruses to fungi, and can have impacts on the hosts ranging from positive (mutualists) to negative (pathogens).  It is common for a single host organism (for example, one human being or one stalk of corn) to simultaneously harbor multiple species of pathogens, which is termed a coinfection.  This project addressed two major questions.  First, what are the causes of pathogen coinfections?  (For example, why are some host individuals infected by one pathogen species, while other host individuals are coinfected by multiple pathogen species?)  Second, what are the consequences of pathogen coinfections?  (For example, if a host individual infected by one pathogen then becomes coinfected by a second pathogen species, will that decrease or increase transmission of the first pathogen species?)   \n\nTo address these questions, this project use a model system, the barley yellow dwarf viruses, which infect grasses and are transmitted by certain insects.  The project\u00c6s intellectual merit is highlighted by several key findings.\n\nFirst, a common assumption has been that, since coinfection allows pathogens to compete within a host individual, then coinfection will increase the potential for a more competitive pathogen to exclude other pathogens from the host population (competitive exclusion).  This project helped to overturn this common assumption.  A mathematical model incorporating data from experiments conducted over five decades revealed that, in fact, coinfection decreases the potential for competitive exclusion.  This is because, while coinfection allows competition within a host, that is a less severe form of competition than if the first pathogen coinfecting a host can completely prevent other pathogens from infecting that host.  Since most studies of coinfection focus on processes within a host individual, this finding is valuable in helping to predict the outcome of those processes across an entire host population.\n\nSecond, it is common to study spread of a pathogen group from data aggregated across multiple species of pathogens, based on shared symptoms in the host (for example, the common cold can be caused by over 100 viruses).  To investigate how shifts in prevalence of a pathogen group result from transmission of multiple pathogen species, this project utilized a regionally-replicated experiment that planted 5000 individuals of six grass species at sites spanning 400 miles of the Pacific coast of the US.  Greater virus prevalence in areas with more perennial grasses resulted from greater transmission of all the virus species.  On the other hand, greater prevalence under addition of phosphorus fertilizer resulted from greater transmission of a subset of the virus species.  Thus, this project revealed that shifts in prevalence of a pathogen group can result from at least two contrasting mechanisms. \n\nThird, shifts in the supplies of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen, can cause changes in ecological communities of plants and animals, but the consequences for pathogens are less known.  This project used experiments to test how nutrients influence competition between viruses within a host individual.  Phosphorus decreased transmission of the virus that was the weaker competitor, but did not alter the outcome of competition.  In contrast, nitrogen decreased competition between the viruses, allowing the weaker competitor to persist in a coinfected host individual.  This suggests that increases in nitrogen supply will increase virus coinfections.\n\nFinally, this project has sought to extend results obtained from its plant-virus model system to a broader range of systems by generating a series of conceptual syntheses that together integrate three scientific dimensions.  First, a synthetic paper written in collaboration with disease biologists who study human and animal systems outlined an int..."
