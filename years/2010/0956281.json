 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to compile and provide information (e.g., species name, location, habitat, and flowering time) from California-collected vascular plant specimens held at 19 herbaria in California and at Harvard University (repository of many older California specimens). The plants targeted are those that dominate California habitats and those most imperiled by threats to biodiversity (including climate change). Specimen information will be available online at the Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH) Web portal (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium). The project will also accomplish the seamless provision of data on California plants held by the museums of SEINet (Southwest Environmental Information Network) via the CCH web site as a step toward building regional and national consortia.\r\n\t\r\nThis project provides tangible benefits to the public, students of all levels, and the research community. Specimen data will be downloadable so that anyone can use the information to pursue interests and questions (e.g., understanding current plant distributions, identifying plants of a particular place, predicting future plant migrations). Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with data entry, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits. This project is a major step toward building a United States virtual plant museum that provides information on the distribution of plants nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.",

The Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) at the University of California Santa Barbara was a sub-awardee and we collaborated with the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden (SBBG) and the Hoover Herbarium at  California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo (SLO).  \n\n \n\nDuring the five year grant period our node was responsible for databasing and georeferencing plant specimens that are dominants in California habitats and those most imperiled by threats to biodiversity in the following regions Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo County, and Ventura County.  To date collectively we have databased &shy;&shy;&shy;39,943 and georeferenced 49,319 target specimens.  CCH has provided data on the number of times specimens from each institution have been accessed online.  The combined number of records returned in general searches from December 2014 to October 2015 for the three institutions is 10,237,987.  The figures represent a monumental accomplishment in providing access to specimens and data to researchers, students, and the worldwide community. \n\n \n\nOur node provided multiple training opportunities in museum bioinformatics for our students and volunteers.  At CCBER and SLO formal courses in the Curation of Natural History Collections were established and they have been taught multiple quarters.   In addition, CCBER offers Kids in Nature (KIN) an environmental education program, which promotes the aspirations and achievements of students in underserved schools by providing quality environmental science education.
