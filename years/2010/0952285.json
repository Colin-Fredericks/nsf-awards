 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is focused on investigating the propagation of fundamental-mode surface waves across North America using data recorded on the EarthScope/USArray Transportable Array employing a variety of methods of analysis. A goal of the research is the development of comprehensive high-resolution maps of phase velocity across North America to help constrain the deep structure of the continent.  The propagation of short- and intermediate-period surface waves depends on the elastic structure of the crust and shallow mantle, and observations of propagation characteristics of these waves are therefore useful for constraining the state, composition and dynamics of this portion of the Earth's interior. The Transportable Array of EarthScope/USArray is generating an unprecedented data set for the seismological imaging of the North American crust and mantle using surface waves, and the project aims to exploit these data using three approaches. First, the project involves the collection of a new set of observations of surface-wave polarization for earthquakes recorded on USArray stations. Owing to the uniform calibration of USAarray station, and the state-of-the-art technology used to orient USArray stations, this data set is ideally suited for polarization studies. Second, a recently developed method of analyzing cross spectra of ambient noise recorded on two seismic stations for the determination of inter-station surface-wave dispersion is applied systematically to USArray stations. The method, which is based on Aki's seminal 1957 paper, allows Love and Rayleigh wave phase velocities to be mapped automatically across the footprint of USArray at a spatial resolution smaller than 100 km, and at periods as short as 5 s. Third, the phase velocity maps derived from short-period ambient noise and intermediate-period earthquake signals are used, together, to determine the elastic structure of the crust and uppermost mantle of the North American Continent.\r\n\r\nThe project will lead to an improved characterization of surface-wave propagation across North America and will facilitate more specific interpretation of the composition and thermal state of the Earth's interior. Several documented data sets that can be useful for other investigators wishing to constrain the elastic structure beneath North America will result from the research.",
