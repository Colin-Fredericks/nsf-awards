 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of an isolated atom with an intense electromagnetic field is the basis for one of the forefront problems in atomic, molecular and optical physics. The ability to couple large amounts of light energy into an atom by the absorption of many photons poses many intriguing questions and has led to many new discoveries such as above-threshold ionization, high-harmonic generation, multiple ionization and adiabatic stabilization. At the core of the problem is the non-perturbative response of the atom to a laser pulse that imposes an external field comparable to the forces binding the electrons to the nucleus. This project undertakes a comprehensive study of the single atom response under novel interaction conditions that will not only provide basic tests of scaling laws and theory but also result in the ability to couple an unprecedented amount of energy into a single atom. The project's overall objective is to broaden the scope of experimental investigations by utilizing the wavelength scaling of the strong field interaction in the regime where the single-photon energy is extremely small compared to the atomic binding energy. Various aspects of the strong-field interaction have an implicit wavelength-dependence that is a crucial scaling parameter and has not been explored or exploited in a systematic fashion.\r\n\r\nThe continuing interest in this fundamental atomic physics problem is derived from its broad implications in other areas of physics and technology. The single atom response is the initial condition of more complex phenomena found in plasmas, inertial confined fusion concepts, advance particle acceleration and astrophysics. The intense laser-atom interaction itself is opening new opportunities in short wavelength science, quantum control and advancing an emerging discipline in hyperfast electron physics, attophysics. Recently, the optical techniques used for producing the ultra-fast laser pulses for these studies have reached a level of sophistication where the electromagnetic field can be completely determined. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary nature of this research coupled with state-of-the-art ultra-fast optical technology provide an excellent training ground for both undergraduate, graduate students and post-doctoral research associates.",
