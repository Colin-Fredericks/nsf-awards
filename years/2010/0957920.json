 "awd_abstract_narration": "How is sensory information used to coordinate the many joints of the body during stable standing, while simultaneously allowing for the performance of other more dynamic movements?  This project will examine the influence of visual information on muscle and joint coordination related to the control of the body's center of mass and head position. The generality of sensory influences on multijoint coordination will be assessed by modifying tactile information from the support surface. Finally, the work will examine how postural stability is maintained when some of the body's segments are prevented from moving, analogous to what may occur as a result of injury and some disease processes.\r\n\r\nPoor standing balance is a leading contributor to falls and subsequent hospitalization of the elderly and this project may provide important insights to guide the development of new treatments. The project will also provide laboratory experiences for undergraduate students (through the University of Delaware's Undergraduate Research Program) and  for  high school students (through the STEM program of Cecil County, Maryland). The work fosters an international collaboration between investigators at the University of Maryland and the University of Delaware and those at the University of Bochum in Germany, including international research experience for a graduate student from each of the two participating U.S. universities.\r\n\r\nThis work is co-funded by SBE/BCS, EPSCoR, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
