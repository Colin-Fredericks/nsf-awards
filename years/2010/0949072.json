The ISC is internationally supported and the requested budget is based on the relative GDPs of sponsor countries with funding from the U.S. NSF estimated at 21.4% of the ISC operational costs over the next four years.  NSF support will provide for continued production of the ISC Bulletin - the definitive global summary of earthquake hypocentres, magnitudes and source mechanisms, as well as station arrival times, amplitudes and other measurements with links to original waveforms where available.  The international support and non-governmental status of the ISC allows the Centre to collect and freely distribute data from otherwise unavailable sources. Specific tasks to be supported include: 1) collection, automatic merging and association of reported bulletin data from networks and data centers around the world, including NEIC, EMSC, USArray, JMA etc; 2) manual review of hypocentres, phase readings, and related data for events simultaneously reported by several networks approximately of magnitude 3.5 and above; 3) distribution of the ISC Bulletin by means of the web-search, ftp, CD-ROMs and the printed ISC Bulletin Summary; 4) maintenance and enhancement of the International Seismograph Station Registry jointly with World Data Center for Seismology, Denver (USGS) and in coordination with the Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN); and 5) establishment of a ISC database and web facilities mirror at IRIS DMC; 6) re-production of the entire ISC Bulletin for 1960-2012 using a newly developed location algorithm.  The ISC Bulletin supports the global seismology community for fundamental research on Earth structure, earthquake physics and earthquake hazards mitigation.  The Bulletin also aids in monitoring of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\r\n\r\n***",
