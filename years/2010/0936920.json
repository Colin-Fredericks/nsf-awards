 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface adsorbed organics affect the heterogeneous and photochemical reactivity of atmospheric aerosols, thereby impacting tropospheric photochemical cycles and altering aerosol properties. Due to the diverse composition of surface adsorbed organics in the troposphere, our understanding of this chemistry is far from complete. This project describes condensed-phase infrared spectroscopic studies aimed at identifying condensed-phase products, quantifying reaction kinetics, and elucidating reaction mechanisms by means of isotopic experiments. Specific systems of interest include: lignin pyrolysis products, nitrophenols, and functionalized polycyclic aromatic compounds, including humic and fulvic acids, exposed to nitrogen dioxide or ozone under dark and light conditions; and a comparison of the heterogeneous reactivity of these organics adsorbed on tropospheric aerosol surrogates.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include (1) Supporting the first active research program in physical/atmospheric chemistry at Drew University, a small liberal arts college. (2) Providing nine undergraduate summer research positions over the three-year duration of the project. Under the guidance of the principal investigator, undergraduate students at Drew will play an integral role in all aspects of the project, including experimental design, data acquisition and analysis, and communication of results to the scientific community as journal articles with undergraduate co-authors and as presentations at professional meetings. (3) Providing one local high school teacher a research opportunity for three summers. Preference will be given to a teacher from a district with a high percentage of students from groups underrepresented in science. Atmospheric science curricular material will be co-developed and co-implemented by the teacher and principal investigator. (4) Supporting curricular expansions in environmental and atmospheric chemistry by integrating research and teaching to enhance the Drew University chemistry major and by supporting a new major in environmental studies and sustainability. Support will contribute to the momentum of this new major to attract and support undergraduate students interested in environmental sciences.",
