 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy laboratory in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts houses a Bruker Vertex 70 infrared spectrometer coupled with a Hyperion 3000 microscope.  The FTIR laboratory, and particularly the mapping capability of the system, has made possible research projects on the relationship between flow banding and water concentration variations in rhyolitic lavas, volatiles in the K-T Deccan basalts of India, the role of water in deformation of quartz crystals in shear zones, and water concentrations in lunar and Martian glasses and crystals, among others.  This grant will fund the purchase of a heating stage that will be used to homogenize bubble-bearing melt inclusions so that accurate measurements of volatile concentrations can be obtained.  In addition, the grant will fund the purchase of a cooling stage that will be used to freeze samples so that the spectral characteristics of H-O species can be examined to determine whether water occurs as part of the mineral structure or whether it occurs in fluid inclusions in the crystal.  Finally, a video camera for characterizing textural characteristics of specimens, and a rotatable stage to permit collection of spectra in orientations parallel to principal crystal vibration directions are funded.  This instrumentation all contributes to the analytical goal of evaluating the origin and evolution of volatiles in igneous systems.  \r\n\r\nThe broad significance of this project is the exploration of volcanic processes through Earth history and the role that volatile compounds play in explosive behavior and in climatic effects of volcanic eruptions.  Minerals host samples of the molten material from which they crystallized.  These captured samples of the parent melt are known as melt inclusions.  Analyses of melt inclusions provide an evaluation of the climate-affecting gases that were dissolved in the parent melt and that were contributed to the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.  The equipment funded by this grant will be used to improve the ability of the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts to accurately measure volatile concentrations in melt inclusions and to evaluate the behavior of volatile compounds in Earth reservoirs.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to acquire equipment to support the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy facility in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Massachusetts, focused on the identification and measurement of concentrations of volatiles in glasses and crystals.  Funds were provided for acquisition of two stages.  The first is a Linkam FTIR600 cooling/heating stage that will be used to freeze samples to examine the spectroscopic characteristics of water in specimens.  Specifically, water in fluid inclusions produces differences in infrared spectra compared with water in structural sties in minerals, so freezing of a sample allows the user to distinguish between water in fluid inclusions and in structural sites.  This is valuable information because water is incorporated into the two different kinds of locations under different sets of geologic conditions.  Distinguishing between the two provides some of the geologic history of the location from which the specimen was collected.  The second stage is a Linkam TS1200 heating stage.  This stage will allow us to heat samples to a high enough temperature to melt glass inclusions in minerals.  These inclusions are sampes of the melt from which the crystal grew, captured during growth of the crystal.  Melting the inclusions causes them to be homogenized, so that volatile concentrations can easily be measured in the melted glass after it is rapidly quenched.  These measurements provide information about volcanic gases that were added to the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions, and their effects on climate.  The purchase of these stages, and of a digital microscope camera for characterizing petrographic specimens, has greatly enhanced the range of types of analyses, and accuracy of interpretation of spectra, that can be done in the infrared spectroscopy laboratory at  the University of Massachusetts. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheila J Seaman"
