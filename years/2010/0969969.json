 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information processing (QIP) harbors vast potential scientific and technological payoff, in the form of algorithms which are fundamentally more powerful than their classical counterparts. One of the most promising ways of achieving QIP involves adiabatic processes, wherein a system is slowly tuned from an initial lowest-energy input state to a final output lowest-energy state which contains the answer to a computationally difficult problem. This approach is known as adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). The rate limiting step for AQC is passage through a regime where the energy gap to the nearest excited state is smallest. In the limit of large system sizes this passage is usually accompanied by a quantum phase transition (QPT). AQC can be understood as a flow on the manifold of control parameters used to tune the system. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop new differential geometry and variational calculus tools for an analysis and unification of AQC and QPT. For AQC this will be done by using two complementary approaches. On the one hand, it is natural to view AQC as a time-optimal control problem, wherein one attempts to minimize the time it takes to tune the system subject to the constraint of adiabaticity. This leads to the formulation of AQC as a variational optimization problem. On the other hand, optimal AQC can be seen as a geodesic on a manifold equipped with an adiabatic metric tensor. This project aims to place these two approaches on a rigorous footing, and to show their equivalence. The investigators will find new optimal AQC algorithms, by solving the corresponding Euler-Lagrange and geodesic equations. For QPTs, this project aims to develop a powerful new differential geometric approach based on the concept of operator fidelity susceptibility (OFS), which is also a metric, namely a pull-back of the metric on the projective quantum space onto the control parameter manifold. The OFS detects the change in fidelity between operators for a quantum system in a state that is evolving over time as control parameters are varied. This approach can be directly applied to the problem of QPTs that arise as an AQC algorithm is taken through a critical region. In this manner the investigators hope to unify the description of AQC and QPTs using differential geometric methods, and shed new light on both.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The introduction of differential geometry into the analysis of AQC is likely to generate new insights for the larger quantum information science community, as well as bring mathematicians closer to the plethora of fascinating problems that have arisen in the field of quantum computation. The unification of AQC and QPTs via differential geometry will also benefit mathematical physicists working on problems involving strongly correlated systems in condensed matter physics. The work provides a significant training and educational opportunity to the graduate student and postdoc involved. The graduate student, postdoc, and principal investigators will participate in institute-wide programs to increase the role of underrepresented minorities in the sciences.",
