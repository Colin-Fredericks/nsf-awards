 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Web promises unprecedented access to the perspectives of an\r\nenormous number of people on a wide range of issues.  Turning that\r\nstill untamed cacophony into meaningful insights requires dealing with\r\nthe linguistic diversity and scale of the Web.  Most current research\r\nfocuses on specialized tasks such as tracking consumer opinions, and\r\nvirtually all current research treats the Web as both monolithic and\r\nmonolingual, ignoring the variety of languages represented and the\r\nrich interplay between topics and issues under discussion.\r\n\r\nThis project moves the state of the art forward by focusing on two key\r\nchallenges.  First, highly-scalable MapReduce algorithms for\r\nlinguistic modeling within a Bayesian framework, making use of\r\nvariational inference to achieve a high degree of parallelization on\r\nWeb-scale datasets.  Second, novel Bayesian models that learn\r\nconsistent interpretations of text across languages and a wide range\r\nof response variables of interest (for example, views on an issue,\r\nstrength of emotion relative to an event, and focus of attention).\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will be demonstrated on large\r\ncrawls of Web pages and blogs.  Potential applications for these\r\ntechnologies include helping a schoolchild learn that people in\r\ndifferent countries may view some issues very differently, helping a\r\npolitician understand how constituents are reacting to proposed\r\nlegislation, or helping an intelligence analyst understand how public\r\nopinion is evolving in a hostile country.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project Web page:\r\nhttp://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud-computing",
