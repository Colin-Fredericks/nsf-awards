 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S - Argentina Planning Visit proposal will support four senior researchers and two graduate students from the U.S., under the direction of Dr. Victoria Lawson of University of Washington, on two planning visits to Argentina between May, 2010 and September, 2011.  The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers in sociology, political theory, the law and geography in Argentina, Norway and the U.S.  The U.S. investigators will collaborate intensively with colleagues from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina and from the University of Bergen, Norway as well as policy-makers in the international arena.  The latter is possible because all team members are part of the Critical Global Poverty Studies network (CGPS) that forms the intellectual backdrop and institutional platform for this research.  In this collaboration, researchers will investigate how middle class actors understand and respond to poverty across the Americas as new forms of economic globalization are transforming the economic position, identities and poverty politics of middle class groups.  The team will meet with Dr. Atilio Boron, Professor of Political Theory, Dr. Susana Murillo, Professor of Social Sciences, and Dr. Alberto Cimadamore, Professor of Political Science, all from the University of Buenos Aires.  The investigators plan to submit research proposals to the National Science Foundation, Geography and Spatial Sciences Program and the Norwegian Research Council.\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to the development of educational and research capacity in Argentina and the U.S. through its involvement of PhD students in both countries.  The U.S. graduate students are women from diverse economic backgrounds who will have an invaluable educational opportunity, being involved in the creation of substantive research and learning how to engage in international collaboration. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nThis grant funded two planning visits to Buenos Aires which launched comparative research on the links between middle class vulnerability, identities and poverty politics in Argentina and the United States.  A team of U.S. researchers are collaborating with two teams of Argentinian scholars led by Susana Murillo, Professor of Social Sciences (UBA) at the Gino Germani Institute of Social Sciences and Ezequiel Adamovsky, Professor of History and CONICET scholar.  Our planning visits finalized our research project which explores how middle class actors understand and respond to poverty across the Americas.  We identified the following questions for collaborative international comparative research: how are middle class groups experiencing economic crisis?  How are cultural and economic processes mutually intertwined and embedded in geographies and economic histories to produce certain understandings of impoverishment?  Under what circumstances do middle class actors define themselves in opposition to, or in solidarity with the poor as they engage with political and economic agendas in their countries and beyond their borders?  These planning visits refined research questions and hypotheses; secured access to secondary data sources, finalized our common research design and allowed US scholars to visit potential field sites for primary data collection.  These planning visits have consolidated research plans and led to submission of proposals to the National Science Foundation, Russell Sage Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies and the Royalty Research Fund at the University of Washington.\n\nIntellectual Merit.  This research responds to calls in both U.S. and international development circles for poverty research from a comparative perspective across the Global North and South.  This comparative research in North and South America explores i) the interconnected processes (of economic crisis, of middle class identity formation) that produce and name the poor and ii) the role of the non-poor in producing and solving poverty.  Middle classes are key actors in articulating social and political agendas that are often inclusive of those above (elites) and those below (the poor) (Kildal and Kuhnle, 2005; O\u00c6Connor, 2002).  At the same time in some contexts, middle class actors are involved in framing poor others as deviant and dysfunctional in discourses of upward mobility (Lawson, Jarosz and Bonds, 2008; Schram, 2002).  So this research project explores where, when and under what circumstances social alliances in support of the poor emerge and persist? \n\nFindings.  Our planning visit discussions were extremely fruitful.  Our ongoing activities include:\n\ni) Design of a  in-common research design to be used in both countries and across all research teams so that our empirical research will be fully comparable.\n\nii) Design of case study, empirical projects that each team will carry out.\n\niii) Developed a shared internet space for sharing research papers and other resources for the project.\n\niv) Planned for a virtual seminar across Argentina, the US and also with Canadian colleagues who are joining our project.\n\nv) Submission of a series of funding proposals to continue with the empirical portion of the project.\n\nBroader Impacts.  We involve both doctoral students and faculty who are working to develop new understandings of how poor and middle class actors interact in Argentina and the U.S. and what sorts of creative policy solutions to poverty can be learned from those interactions.  This interdisciplinary group from the U.S. and Argentina includes sociologists, geographers, political scientists and lawyers.  The U.S. graduate students are women from diverse economic backgrounds who have had an invaluable educational opportunity by being involved in the creation of substantive research and learning how to engage in international collaboration.  All team members are involved in our grant proposals to the NSF Geography and Sp..."
