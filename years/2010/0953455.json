 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents an initial effort to study the cultural, emotional and social factors that contribute to forgiveness for mass atrocities.  Human history is replete with examples of groups committing mass atrocities against each other, such as the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks, and slavery in the US. Negative emotions and mistrust can be directed at the perpetrator group by members of the victim group for generations long after the actual perpetrators and victims have died.  These negative emotions and mistrust can potentially prevent positive intergroup relations and exacerbate or increase the likelihood of conflict.  \r\n\r\nThe research supported by this grant will study the forgiveness of Jews for the Holocaust and Armenians for the Armenian genocide.  Using experimental methods, the investigators will explore whether and to what extent ethnic and religious identity are associated with forgiveness, and expressed feelings towards the offender groups (Germans for Jews, Turks for Armenians).  In addition, the investigators will consider the impact of the passage of time since the event.  The proposed research will make several important contributions by advancing theories about cultural influences on forgiveness and intergroup relations, and enhancing understanding of a set of processes that have direct implications for the lives of individuals and groups across the globe.",

We plan to study this with reference to slavery for Black Christians and the Holocaust for Jews.  \n\nTo be able to experimentally change how much people are thinking about ethnicity or religion, With NSF support, we pilot tested two versions of ethnic or religious primes with Yeshiva University Jewish students&mdash;word unscrambling (which was quite successful) or writing an essay or religious vs ethnic identity vs control condition (120 participants).  We focus here on the word unscrambling because we discovered that many of our Ps wrote \u00e6White\u00c6 or \u00e6Caucasian\u00c6 for their ethnicity when probed open-ended&mdash;not Jewish. \nComparing people in the Ethnic unscramble condition (e.g., turning ASHK_N_Z_C into Ashkenazic), religious condition (R_BB_NI_ into rabbinic), or control condition, there was a suggestion of  differences in forgiveness of the Holocaust.  People primed with ethnicity were less forgiving than those in the control condition, and the same was marginally so for people in the religious condition.
