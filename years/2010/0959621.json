 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Ruth Ann Armitage and colleagues Gavin Edwards, Cory D Emal, Harriet A Lindsay and John Texter from the Department of Chemistry at Eastern Michigan University will acquire a high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with direct acquisition in real time (DART) and electrospray ionization (ESI) sources. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) method development for rapid, non-destructive characterization of organic cultural heritage materials in works of art; 2) isolation, identification, and synthesis of biologically relevant molecules such as polyphenols; 3) atmospheric chemistry of biogenic, volatile organic compounds; 4) development of microwave-assisted reaction methodology; 5) advanced materials such as porous co-polymers from ionic liquids; 6) identification of end-groups in self-assembling block copolymeric materials; 7) signal transduction pathways in the regulation of normal and cancer cell growth and proliferation; 8) determination of microbial metabolites in rat cecal fluid and in vitro co-cultures; and 9) insulin-based inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide.\r\nMass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique used by chemists and biochemists to identify the chemical composition of a sample and its purity. TOF-mass spectrometry with ionization capabilities is an excellent technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on small and large molecules. Use of this type of mass spectrometer has become a standard technique, especially in studies involving labile molecules. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry, materials chemistry, the environment and biochemistry as well as in the preservation of works of art. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award provided the funding to purchase a high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer with multiple ionization sources to enhance the on-campus infrastructure of Eastern Michigan University and the EMU Chemistry Department.  This instrument has led to the development of new interdisciplinary research opportunities within the sciences at EMU &ndash; specifically between the Polymers and Coatings and Chemistry programs &ndash;  with the Detroit Institute of Arts and several archaeologists from around the United States, and with Lourdes University, a nearby four-year liberal arts college that does not offer a major in chemistry.  Numerous publications, theses, and presentations have been generated by researchers utilizing the NSF-funded mass spectrometer.  These publications have included several women co-authors, and numerous presentations at conferences included student co-authors from underrepresented groups.  The new $90 million EMU Mark Jefferson Science Complex is now complete, and the instrument is a centerpiece for interdisciplinary research and education.\n\nThe AccuTOF-DART-MS has been used by researchers in synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and analytical chemistry.  The Armitage group is using the instrument for developing minimally destructive methods of analysis for archaeological and artists\u00c6 materials from the Detroit Institute of Arts, bridging the fields of chemistry, archaeology, and conservation science.  The Lindsay and Emal groups have confirmed the molecular weight of nearly 100 unique new organic molecules, and are using that information to design new ways of designing molecules that have potential as drugs for diabetes and heart disease, and as greener pesticides in agriculture.  The Pernecky group is evaluating DART-MS as a method for studying the interaction of gut bacteria through the short chain fatty acids produced in co-cultures.  A student from the Kennedy group has utilized DART-MS to confirm the mass of silicon phthalocyanine monomers and dimers that have potential as phototherapeutic agents in treating cancer.  The electrospray ionization source has also proven valuable to the Kennedy group for confirming the nature of the trimer and dimer forms of the same Si phthalocyanines, and to the Heyl-Clegg group for confirming the identity of the peptides synthesized for testing the role of aggregation in cell wall damage, an important aspect of understanding the mechanisms of diabetes and Alzheimer\u00c6s disease.  The Texter group has utilized the ESI-MS to characterize advanced stimuli responsive block copolymers.\n\nSeveral students, both undergraduates and graduate students (M.S.), have used the DART-TOF-MS, and thus have gained hands-on experience with using mass spectrometry, an important skill for finding employment in chemistry.  The instrument has been used in many chemistry and biochemistry courses at EMU.  At least 75 students have directly benefited from the AccuTOF mass spectrometer.  Three of the research students using the DART-TOF-MS with Dr. Armitage are members of underrepresented groups (African-American and Hispanic women) in chemistry.  Dr. Barbara Stallman from Lourdes University utilized both the AccuTOF-MS and the EMU NMR to characterize modified sugars for an undergraduate student research project on developing biodegradable surfactants for oil spill cleanup. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruth Ann Armitage"
