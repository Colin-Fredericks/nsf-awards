Five years of anticipated program funding are essential to research the impact of project strategies on STEM student retention, graduation, and transfer rates. The project objectives are as follows: 1.) By September 2015, to increase the number of students majoring in STEM at CMN by 50%; 2.) By September 2015, to increase the retention rate of CMN\u00a1\u00a6s STEM cohorts by a minimum of 25%; 3.) By September 2015, to develop a two-year Multimedia Programming degree.\r\nProject Plans: In order to achieve this project CMN has established several strategies.\r\n?h\r\nObjective 1\r\n?X\r\nDevelop and implement bridge program: Main activities include coordinating bridge activities, family math and science nights, AISES chapter development, campus exposure, and high school level math and science competitions.\r\n?h\r\nObjective 2\r\n?X\r\nInfuse culture into STEM courses: Key activities include faculty training, development, revision, piloting, and assessment of courses, and incorporation of culturally relevant projects and site visits in STEM courses.\r\n?X\r\nDevelop and maintain a STEM resource room: Main activities include hiring a STEM resource demonstration coordination, purchasing equipment and supplies for resource room, coordination of workshops, hand-on tutoring, mentoring, project assistance, demonstrations and speakers.\r\n?X\r\nDevelop and Implment a STEM scholars program at the Oneida campus: Major activities include setting up the program at that campus, implementing prescribed interventions, coordinating cohort activities, and providing stipends for participation.\r\n?X\r\nCoordinate STEM extracurricular activities: Major activities include chapter support, research and internship development and implementation, and student travel to major research labs and national chapter events.\r\n?h\r\nObjective 3\r\n?X\r\nDevelop a Multimedia programming degree: Major activities include curriculum and course development, piloting of those courses, revising as necessary, and working on essential articulation agreements.",

With interactive hands-on exercises students were introduced to high level STEM topics, including computer scripting, digital imaging, 3D mesh and models, textures, sound design, animation and interpolation, 3D coordinates as well a movement by manipulating values and parametric equations.&nbsp; The progam was a remarkable success and will be offered to a broader group of high school students in the future.</p>\n<p>Through this project, CMN renovated its STEM Resource/Demonstration and Academic Support facility to accomodate larger scale projects and project teams.&nbsp;
