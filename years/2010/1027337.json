The participants will include experts and leaders in photovoltaics research and product development from universities, large companies, small firms and national laboratories.  Through a combination of invited talks and breakout sessions, the participants will brainstorm the future technical emphasis in photovoltaics, build networks for potential partnerships and collaborations to accelerate technology transfer from academia to commercial market, and propose new strategies to foster future collaborations among universities, large companies, small firms and national laboratories. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project will be the potential to serve as a catalyst for stimulating innovations in photovoltaics.  Maintaining a leadership in solar industry not only will benefit the environment, but also create more jobs domestically.  The major challenges that hinder the wide adoption of solar electricity are the high cost, low manufacturability and/or non-abundant sources of the raw materials.  The ultimate solutions to these challenges depend on the continuous innovations in photovoltaics technologies.  Research collaborations among universities, large companies, small firms and national laboratories are essential to ensure that US is on the leading edge in this area.  This workshop emphasizes on the technology transfer to bring the advance technologies from research level into viable products, and eventually to commercial market, thus realizing societal benefit and economic impact.",

Development of National User Facilities for Photovoltaic Manufacturing Research\n \nAll PV technologies discussed here have matured to a point that future advances will require simultaneous optimization of the many components that constitute a complete solar cell. An innovative process or new material may have tremendous intrinsic properties, but its value cannot be accurately assessed or fully exploited until integrated into a complete device structure. This poses a major barrier for both small business and university researchers alike, who most often cannot maintain the infrastructure of a full solar line.

We advocate that a similar investment be made in photovoltaic manufacturing science, perhaps organized with facilities focused on individual process technologies. Such facilities would dramatically accelerate the rate at which innovation can be harnessed to meet the terawatt challenge. \n\nII. Advanced photon management\n \nThe importance of this topic is self-evident as this phrase was used in conjunction with the discussion of nearly every technology. Typically, advances and improvements in efficiency involve materials that are applied externally to the cell, allowing them to be developed independently without impacting cell designs that are highly optimized. Specific topics within this area, in order of increasing complexity are as follows.\n1)      Antireflection Coatings.\n2)      Increasing the Path Length through the Absorber.\n3)      Optical field enhancement. \n4)      Downshifting.\n5)      Downconversion.
