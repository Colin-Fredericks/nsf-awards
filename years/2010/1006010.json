 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\n\r\nCarbon nanohorns are hollow, closed \"containers\" with widths one hundred thousand times smaller than a hair.  Their interior is separated from the exterior by a one-atom-thick wall of carbon atoms.  Nanohorns group into tiny balls.  The spaces between nanohorns in the balls are conically shaped.  When a gas is placed in contact with these balls, it goes into these conical spaces and remains there (like liquid absorbed by a sponge).  If the walls of the nanohorns are punctured, the gas will also fill the interior of the nanohorns.  This project investigates, through experiment and computer simulation, how gases collect in the nanohorn balls; how fast gases penetrate into the spaces available; and how the amount of gas collected varies with gas species, temperature, and pressure.  Confining gases into these tiny \"sponges\" will make them behave differently from three-dimensional matter.  It can also lead to new technologies for gas storage, selective gas trapping, and gas mixture separation.  In this project one post-doctoral researcher, two graduate students, and several undergraduates will be trained in techniques used for studying the flow and storage of gases in porous materials.  Student exchanges between Howard University and Southern Illinois University will enhance the training efforts of the project. \r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\n\r\nThis project aims at carrying out experimental and computer simulations of the thermodynamics and kinetics of gas adsorption on carbon nanohorns.  Nanohorns are a form of single-wall carbon.  Unlike nanotubes, nanohorns form spherical aggregates.  The interstitial spaces between nanohorns in the spherical aggregates form quasi-conical pores, readily available for adsorption.  The interior hollow space of a nanohorn can be made accessible by oxidizing its walls.  Gases adsorbed on the pores in the aggregates provide realizations of matter in less-than-three dimensions, making these systems interesting from a fundamental perspective.  The wide entrances of the quasi-conical pores provide favorable adsorption kinetics, and the pores have high binding energies; both characteristics are useful for applications to gas purification, separation, and storage.  The results obtained will yield useful insights into the kinetics and thermodynamics of gas adsorption on porous media.  They may also lead to new technologies for gas storage, selective gas trapping, and gas mixture separation.  The project provides excellent opportunities for training one post-doctoral researcher, two graduate students, and several undergraduates, in the experimental and computational aspects of gas adsorption in porous materials.",
