 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Rim Workshop on Geometric Analysis will be held at UBC/PIMS, Vancouver, Canada, July 20-30, 2010. The first week will be a summer school, and the second week will be a research-oriented conference. This workshop/conference will bring together experts from all over the world in geometric analysis. The core areas of concentration will be (i) Geometric flows: Ricci flow, Mean Curvature Flow, Willmore Flow, (ii) K\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics, constant scalar curvature metrics and K\\\"ahler-Ricci flow, (iii) Mathematical General Relativity Theory, (iv) Manifolds with positive curvature, and (v) Minimal submanifolds. These are currently some of the most active research areas in geometric analysis. There are broader applications of many of these topics to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry,  and also applications to related physical fields, such as general relativity and string theory.\r\n\r\nThis conference will have a significant educational component. The first week will consist entirely of mini-courses geared towards graduate students. The aim is to give sufficient background in the main scientific areas, so that the participants will be able to follow the more recent developments. These will be presented in the second week, where there will be 16-18 research-level talks. The conference will be advertised though PRIMA and through a conference website in order to build as diverse an audience as possible. The organizing committee will encourage applications from female mathematicians. Lecture notes from the mini-courses and workshop will be posted on the conference webpage, and will be widely disseminated to mathematicians at all levels. The funding from the NSF will be used to provide travel and lodging expenses for fifteen workshop participants from the United States. Preference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty who do not have their own travel funding sources.",
