 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n To generate nanoparticle (NP)-based functional devices that capitalize on the unique characteristics of NPs, it is mandatory to control the macroscopic ordering and orientation of the NP assemblies and the inter-particle ordering with high precision in thin films. Block copolymer (BCP)-based supramolecules provides unique opportunities to address this challenge. The influence of small molecule loading, NP loading, film thickness, interfacial interactions, solvent fields and sample treatments on the thermodynamics and kinetics of hierarchical assemblies in thin films of the NP/BCP-based supramolecule blends will be systematically studied. Approaches will also be developed to tailor the ordering of the small molecules within the BCP microdomains so as to achieve control over inter-particle ordering. The proposed study will transform our existing knowledge of the hierarchical assembly of hybrid materials and enable one to capitalize on the unique properties of the numerous off-shelf NPs. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe proposed studies will lead to a foundation in understanding the fundamental principles underpinning the hierarchical assembly of multicomponent composite systems, establishing a framework and protocols for the fabrication of nanocomposite materials that will transform approaches for device fabrication in the renewable energy, microelectronics and storage industries. \r\n\r\nThe PI will continue to devote herself to mentoring students and promoting public awareness of materials science. She will take advantage of her prior outreach experiences and expertise and will collaborate closely with existing on-campus outreach programs and local organizations to educate the next generation of material scientist. Her outreach efforts include developing laboratory modules to strengthen two polymer courses initiated by the PI; expanding her existing efforts for career mentoring of postdoctoral fellows and senior graduate students; and promoting polymer science among the younger generation through research opportunities and seminars at local high schools.",
