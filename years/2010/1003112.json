 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Rebecca Calisi-Rodriguez is \"The role of the newly discovered neurohormone, gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH).\" The host institution for this research is the University of California - Davis and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. John Wingfield. \r\n\r\nExpression of behaviors appropriate to a particular stage within an individual's life is critical for reproductive success. Many animals experience hormonal changes when transitioning from aggressive/territorial and mating behaviors to caring for their offspring. This transition often involves a decrease in circulating androgens, like testosterone, as high concentrations of testosterone can interfere with male parental care. Androgens can also affect female behavior, though these effects are much less well-understood. Also, how the brain acts to regulate these patterns of circulating androgen concentrations is unknown. Based on preliminary results from birds (male and female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris), the project predicts and explores if a specific novel neurohormone, gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), mediates the inhibition of circulating androgens during parental care. \r\n\r\nTraining objectives include experimental field and laboratory techniques, methods to measure hormone concentrations, and genomics approaches to studying mating versus parental care phases. This project bridges a gap between neuroendocrinology and behavior. Because GnIH presence and function appear to be conserved throughout most vertebrates studied, including humans, the findings in birds promise to inspire new avenues into not only the study of reproductive physiology but into the neural mechanisms that may control reproductive strategy and behavior. Additionally, this project provides laboratory and field research opportunities for undergraduates and increases the participation of underrepresented groups in science.",

This hormone inhibits the release of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone, a very important hormone found in the pituitary and necessary for reproduction. Thus, it was named gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH). Since its initial discovery, GnIH had been identified in many different species of vertebrates, including humans. It has been found to be associated with stress and certain reproductive behaviors; however, we still know very little about how it functions and why.&nbsp; Receiving a post-doctoral fellowship from the National Science Foundation allowed me to explore this topic further. I discovered that GnIH is associated with parental care behaviors in birds and mammals. When birds first begin to incubate their eggs, the number of GnIH cells present in the brain changes significantly. When eggs hatch, GnIH changes again. In rodents, when pups are born, GnIH also changes significantly at this time. These changes suggest a role for GnIH, and I have been conducting multiple studies to better understand the relationship of GnIH and parental care in birds and rodents, and how this relationship evolved. Because GnIH is found in almost all vertebrates examined, including humans, applications of knowledge gained can be far-reaching. During my fellowship, I have had the privilege of mentoring numerous undergraduate and graduate students. I have also partaken in and led multiple outreach projects to educate and inspire others in the field of science.
