Liquid Xe is readily available, relatively cheap, large gamma-ray detection efficiency, and excellent energy and spatial resolution.  Gamma-ray detectors with good energy resolution and imaging capabilities offer the highest attainable performance for locating interesting sources at long range; these include the use of HEU for 1001 keV and 2614 keV.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities also include the training of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students in detector simulation, design, fabrication, and characterization. The PIs plan to work with students at public schools, including students in high school, middle school, and first to six grade schools.   The development of a two-phase Compton imager is expected to improve the position and energy resolution of gamma cameras used in liquid xenon PET (LXePET), which will result in better localization of the emitting malignant cells.",
