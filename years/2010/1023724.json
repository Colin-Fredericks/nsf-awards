 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the United States' contribution to the Past Global Changes (PAGES) International Project Office (IPO) in Bern, Switzerland. PAGES is one of several scientific programs that operates under the broad umbrella of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). \r\n\r\nOperated as a partnership between the US National Science Foundation and the Swiss National Science Foundation, the PAGES program has enabled the collaboration of international teams of scientists and students from developed and developing nations on projects searching for answers to critical questions in paleoclimate science. The specific responsibilities of the IPO include organizing meetings and workshops, publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts and books, producing newsletters, and maintaining and facilitating contacts among international scientists. \r\n\r\nThe scientific data generated by PAGES-coordinated research projects are readily available through various publicly accessible databases including those of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, PAGES actively seeks participation in research projects by scientists in developing countries thereby enabling technological transfer and capacity building within the scientific community.",
