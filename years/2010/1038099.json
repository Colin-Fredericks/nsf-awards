 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposed here integrates existing University of Michigan activities to increase participation of \r\nunderrepresented minority students in STEM fields in three ways: (1) by attracting a new group of \r\nunderrepresented minority students to doctoral education in biology, math and physics via master?s \r\ndegree programs; (2) by enhancing and strengthening the intergenerational community among \r\nunderrepresented minority scientists and engineers at all student and faculty levels of the University: (3) \r\nby strengthening the capacity of all faculty members to provide effective mentoring to students who come \r\nfrom educational and cultural backgrounds different from their own.  \r\nDiversity in the STEM disciplines has only begun to reflect the diversity of the U.S. population. We believe \r\nit is urgent to encourage more of the nation's talented underrepresented minority undergraduates to \r\npursue scientific doctorates by engaging them in research master's programs that will provide full funding \r\nand strong preparation for doctoral programs. The traditional path of moving students directly from \r\nundergraduate study to doctoral education has not accomplished the goal of increasing diversity in \r\nSTEM, and may even be counterproductive. Some evidence suggests that underrepresented minority \r\nstudents are more likely than other students to pursue master?s degrees before committing to doctoral \r\neducation. Our proposed master's programs aim particularly at attracting students in fields (ecology and \r\nevolutionary biology, mathematics and physics) where other efforts to diversify doctoral programs have \r\nbeen relatively unsuccessful.  \r\nThe master?s programs are thoughtfully designed to incorporate scientific rigor and active learning \r\ninnovations. However, by themselves they are unlikely to be successful; our plans call for active \r\ncontributions of key institutional partners. We will recruit and support students via a strong \r\nintergenerational community of underrepresented minority faculty and students at all levels in the \r\nUniversity. To surround master's students with an intergenerational community we will take advantage of \r\nmany existing programs currently aimed at either undergraduate or doctoral students. The master's \r\nstudents will also be supported in creating their own community within and across programs. We will \r\ndevelop the faculty to offer focused, competent and intentional mentoring. Strong and effective faculty \r\nmentoring will encourage these students to pursue doctoral education, and simultaneously will increase \r\nthe campus capacity for excellent mentoring of underrepresented minority students at all levels. This \r\nprogram, then, will integrate our NSF-funded and UM-funded efforts to recruit and support URM students \r\nat all levels of science education.  \r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nOur proposal is based on solid social science evidence about the support structures that predict the \r\nacademic success of students from underrepresented groups. Moreover, it creates strong links between \r\nresearch excellence and successful educational outcomes for both students and faculty mentors, through \r\ndeep ties across academic generations in research groups and faculty mentoring teams. It leverages \r\nexisting federally-funded and university-supported resources (all of which have been carefully evaluated) \r\nto enhance underrepresented minority students' seamless transitions and ultimate success in academic \r\nscience careers. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact: \r\nBy increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in selected STEM fields, we seek to have a \r\nbroader impact by attracting new students into doctoral education, and by providing URM students at all \r\nlevels of university education with intergenerational community and wise mentoring. If successful, we will \r\nprovide a new model of graduate education for URM students that can be shared across the STEM \r\ndisciplines and disseminated to other research universities. Our successful students, as they complete \r\nmaster?s degrees and doctorates, will become mentors in their own right, and will generate \"positive \r\nfeedback\" in the education system, moving the scientific workforce towards equitable representation by \r\nunderrepresented minority groups. \r\n\u00a0 \r\n1",
