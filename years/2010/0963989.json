 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops, from the ground up, a new theoretical framework for analyzing and designing algorithms for dynamic ad-hoc wireless networks. This proposal embraces network dynamics as an opportunity to be exploited, not an adversity to be overcome. \r\n\r\nThe approach is based on four inter-related thrusts:\r\n1. Incremental Topology Learning: Tracking changes in the network much more efficiently than re-learning entire topology, using sparse \"error graph\" representations.\r\n2. Topology and Traffic Shaping: Controlling the \"effective\" wireless network topology so that (i) at any instant of time it appears to be highly disconnected to scheduling algorithms, but retains global connectivity over time; and (ii) modifying traffic statistics to ensure statistical spatial correlation decay.\r\n3. Warm-starting Distributed Algorithms: Message-passing algorithms that can warm-start the optimization based on local knowledge of past solutions.\r\n4. Proteus - A Mobile Robot Testbed: This project validates its approach via implementation on a mobile robot testbed called Proteus, which is used to optimize algorithms in a practical setting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Industry is involved in this research from the start, via the WNCG Affiliates program at UT.  The research will be disseminated via publications in top-tier venues, industry interactions, and specially organized workshops. Both graduate students and undergraduate students, via a REU program at UT (with emphasis on recruiting women and minorities), get exposure to both real-world wireless networks (via the testbed), and  cutting edge theory.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the interplay between learning network structure, communicating over networks, and making optimal distributed decisions for network constrained optimization problems is an important and challenging task.  \n\nThe main outcomes of this project include:\n1) developing new conditions for correctness of the max-product\ndistributed message-passing algorithm. One of the main difficulties with running the max-product algorithm for Gaussian factor graphs is the fact that the distribution defined on the computation tree may be a non-negative definite covariance matrix.   We have identified a particular weighting scheme that ensures well-posededness of the max-product algorithm.\n\n2) developing quantitative tools for identifying locality in network optimization problems.  This method allows one to determine how local perturbations at one node in a network can effect decisions made at nodes far away.  Our techniques can be used to design scalable optimization routines.\n  \n3) developing the notion of k-separability as the key notion of complexity for learning graphical models from data.  Our method can be used to learn a larger class of topologies that current methods cannot learn.\n\nThe techniques and tools developed herein will have an immediate impact on practitioners work.  This work  has the potential to affect many technologies including: network communication, networked control, sensor networks,  ad hoc networks, and distributed optimization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sekhar C Tatikonda"
