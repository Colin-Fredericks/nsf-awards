 "awd_abstract_narration": "Westdickenberg\r\nDMS-0955051\r\n\r\n     The investigator takes up problems in the areas of (i) slow\r\ncoarsening or dynamic metastability of gradient flows, and (ii)\r\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequalities (LSI) and the hydrodynamic\r\nlimit.  In the first part, the investigator and collaborators\r\napply the abstract sufficient condition for dynamic metastability\r\ndeveloped by Felix Otto and the PI to the Cahn-Hilliard Equation\r\nand then develop new but related methods to tackle the more\r\napplied problem of coarsening rates in two-dimensional epitaxial\r\ngrowth models.  In the second part, the investigator and\r\ncollaborators push forward their two-scale method for LSI and the\r\nhydrodynamic limit to prove convergence of the microscopic\r\nentropy to macroscopic entropy under general sufficient\r\nconditions.  The educational and outreach component of the\r\nproposal encourages and supports women in mathematics and\r\ndisseminates knowledge on multiple levels both in coordination\r\nwith the research plans detailed above and through four explicit\r\ninitiatives headed by the PI. \r\n\r\n     The work of this project focuses on understanding the way\r\nthat energy (or entropy) and energy dissipation (or entropy\r\ndissipation) affect the nonlinear dynamics of a physical system. \r\nIn general, science has a good understanding of global minimizers\r\nbut a very weak understanding of local minimizers and pathways\r\nbetween them -- where many physical systems spend all of their\r\ntime.  A broader understanding of multiscale energy landscapes is\r\nof both scientific and practical importance; for instance,\r\nepitaxial growth models have implications for nanotechnology and\r\nsemiconductor development, technology with impact in medicine,\r\ncommunications technology, and other fields.  The education and\r\noutreach component of the proposal addresses a critical need to\r\nrecruit and keep more women in mathematics, increase diversity in\r\nthe sciences, and build international ties between the scientific\r\ncommunities.",
