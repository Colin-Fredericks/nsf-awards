In particular, silicon micromechanical resonators have the potential to replace conventional\r\nelectronic and mechanical devices in a variety of timing, sensing and spectral processing applications,\r\nthus enabling the development of completely new products. There are, however, a number of areas where\r\nthe performance of such resonators lags significantly behind that of currently existing discrete\r\nalternatives. These areas include the sensitivity of the resonant frequency to process fluctuations, its\r\nstability with respect to changes in temperature, and the fact that the quality factor and impedance of\r\ncurrent silicon resonators degrades dramatically in the high UHF range (1 GHz and above). The goal of\r\nthe proposed research is to develop and demonstrate radically new technologies that will bring the\r\nperformance of silicon MEMS resonators to a level suitable for widespread insertion into commercial\r\napplications. Specifically, the proposed research will advance the state of silicon MEMS resonator\r\ntechnology in the following areas (intellectual merits of the proposed research):\r\n(a) Deeper understanding of intrinsic loss mechanisms in silicon, and consequent development of ultrahigh-\r\nQ silicon resonators that are completely compatible with standard IC fabrication processes, and (b)\r\ndevelopment of zero-power temperature compensation techniques based on the engineering of material\r\nproperties and resonator geometries that avoid degradation of the Q of the resonator.\r\nDissemination of the scientific results will take place in the form of presentations at national and\r\ninternational professional conferences, articles in technical journals, and university seminars. Technology\r\ntransfer to the commercial sector will be facilitated by the Georgia Electronic Design Center, whose goal\r\nis to sustain the technology growth of the semiconductor industry by placing an emphasis on significant\r\nlong-term research.\r\nBroader impact of the proposed research\r\nThis effort will promote advanced research and education in the area of micro and nano-mechanical\r\nsignal processing. Integration of research and education will be pursued through graduate and\r\nundergraduate courses developed by the PI. These courses cover the principles of micro- and nanoelectromechanical\r\nsystem analysis and design, with an emphasis on MEMS resonators. The course\r\nmaterial is constantly updated, and will include the results of research activities that are undertaken during\r\nthe course of the research project described in this proposal. The existing graduate level course on\r\n?Interface IC design for MEMS and Sensors? will be augmented by hands-on laboratory sessions.\r\nInvolvement of undergraduate students in research and educational activities is another important task of\r\nthis proposal. To this end, the PI will seek applicants among the participants in the Summer\r\nUndergraduate Research in Engineering/Science Program at Georgia Tech, a ten-week summer research\r\nprogram designed to attract qualified minority students into graduate school in the fields of engineering\r\nand science. The program has received highly favorable evaluations from past participants. It is hoped\r\nthat this unique experience will encourage these students to become applicants for graduate school in\r\nensuing years.",
