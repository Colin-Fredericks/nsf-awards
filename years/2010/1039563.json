 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The proposed project aims at establishing the stationary PHEV test/emulation system. This system, based on the acquisition of requested instruments, will be used to support various research activities, including intelligent controls of permanent magnet motors; fault tolerant power converters; battery power and thermal management, and digital diagnosis of progressive damage in the battery. In addition, the project will provide a state-of-the-art PHEV design/testing facility in engineering education.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed project plans to incorporate control/diagnosis technology and evaluation/test training for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in the research and education to meet the current and future demands of the U.S. automotive industry and the paradigm shift in U.S. energy dependency. The proposed approaches will investigate: 1. Performance improvement of the electric motor drive based on intelligent direct torque control; 2. Power converter fault detection/compensation schemes; 3. Battery thermal management and digital diagnosis of progressive damage in batteries. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The University of Michigan-Dearborn is uniquely housed in the midst of the Big 3 (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) and numerous small automotive companies. They need an institution in close proximity capable of supplying qualified personnel in the new technology. The proposed project and acquisition of the instruments will create opportunities to co-operate with local automotive companies. The outcomes of the proposed project will not only offer a useful and needed research and educational experience that is relevant to the automotive industry of the day, but they will also help to bolster the industry by providing more qualified students.",
