Goldberg\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO); namely overhaul of the vessel?s seismic compressors.  Funding of this item will greatly enhance science support capability and reliability.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The LANGSETH supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in the academic fleet.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete over 75 NSF sponsored days in 2010.",
