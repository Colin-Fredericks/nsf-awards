 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer programming languages play a central role in scientific\r\nproductivity. They are the interface between domain experts and the\r\nmachine. The first generation of scientific languages were statically\r\ncompiled computer programming languages such as Fortran, C and C++.\r\nOptimized for efficiency they stayed close to the hardware at the cost of\r\nease of use.  The languages of choice for scientists are increasingly\r\ndynamic ones like Perl, Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica, Maple, and\r\nJavaScript. Educational material in Bioinformatics, for example, includes\r\nmany textbooks for Perl, Python and R and none for C, C++ or Fortran. But\r\nthe application of cutting-edge scientific methodology is limited by the\r\ncapabilities of the system in which it is implemented.  While dynamic\r\nlanguages start out as glue for native libraries, with time, more and more\r\nof the actual computations is expressed in those languages.  But quickly\r\nusers experience limitations of these languages: performance is not adequate\r\nfor compute intensive tasks, space overheads preclude manipulating large\r\ndatasets, and information security and reproducibility of results must be\r\naddressed.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop explores the need for a Scientific Software \r\nInnovation Institute (S2I2) centered around Virtual Execution Infrastructures \r\nfor Next Generation Scientific Programming Languages.  There is a need\r\nto develop expertise and momentum to encourage development of open source \r\nhigh-performance implementations of productivity-oriented scientific\r\nprogramming languages.  To this end, the VEESC workshop brings together\r\nexperts in virtual machines and compilers, designers and implementors of\r\nhigh-level dynamic languages and related systems, and key representatives\r\nfrom end-user communities in the sciences.",
