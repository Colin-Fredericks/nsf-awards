 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place during June/ July 2011 at various sites within the Peruvian Amazon region.  Organized by Drs. Scott Saleska (University of Arizona), and Steven Wofsy (Harvard University), with the collaboration of Drs. Plinio Camargo (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil), Dan Metcalfe (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden) and Norma Salinas (Universidad San Antonio Abad, Peru), the PASI will explore how differences in forest structure along an elevation transect may give insight into the future of Amazon forests under climate change.  The course will begin at 3,000 m in a Peruvian Andean cloud forest and finish at a lowland Amazon forest site.  The creative component of the proposed activities is the integration of classroom- and field-based instruction with group projects developed along well-defined themes.  This approach has proven effective in facilitating interdisciplinary research in new areas, especially in laying the groundwork for future collaborative international research projects. \r\n\r\nThe PASI aims to advance knowledge and understanding of the ecological and biogeochemical mechanisms driving forest-climate interactions in the Andes-Amazon region through an international and interdisciplinary course for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from the U.S., U.K., Peru and Brazil.  The knowledge generated from the PASI on the structure and function of tropical forests, now and in the future, stands to inform questions important to a number of disciplines, including ecology, atmospheric science, hydrology, biogeochemistry, soil science and spatial sciences, and has the potential to increase the number of researchers working in tropical environments.  The PASI complements an existing NSF PIRE program in the Brazilian Amazon, which will help leverage significant financial and logistical resources.  Course projects, as outlined in the proposal, will likely lead to research activities and published papers.  Results of the PASI will be disseminated through a program website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Amazon Basin contains the largest tropical forests on earth, unparalleled biological diversity, and a vast store of organic carbon. It is a potent engine in global water and energy cycles.  Large changes in Amazonian biodiversity and in biogeochemical cycling of carbon and water, expected to occur with climate change or deforestation, could have global as well as local impact. Hence it is critically important to understand the ecological and biogeochemical mechanisms that drive forest-climate interactions in Amaz&ocirc;nia.  Yet such understanding is hampered at multiple levels, including the remoteness and lack of science infrastructure of pristine tropical locations; the lack of collaboration between biological and physical science disciplines needed to achieve the necessary integrated understanding; and finally, insufficient emphasis in the institutions of higher education on the skills and training needed to develop authentic international collaboration.  \n\nMotivated by these concerns, we conducted a Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) in the Amazon that integrated focused instruction, interactive discussion, and field-based short research projects.  The Institute\u00c6s activities took place along an elevational transect in Peru, beginning at a 3,000 m Andean cloud forest and finishing at a lowland Amazon forest site.  The theme of the Institute (spanning 18 days during July, 2011) was framed by the question:  What is the future of Amazon forests under climate change?  We explored how differences along the elevational transect &ndash; in climate, forest structure (that of the physical arrangement of the canopy as well as of the taxonomic community), ecophysiology, hydrology, and soil biogeochemistry &ndash; could give insight into answers to this question.  \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The intellectual merit emerged in the discussion sessions which probed current debates about tropical forest ecology, biogeo&shy;chemistry, and climate change, and in the core activity of the course:  the intensely focused short field research projects, conducted by 5-6 groups of participants.  These group projects were designed to address cutting edge research questions. \n\nThe PASI was a collaboration with our existing NSF-funded Partnership for International Research and Education (PIRE) (operating in the central Amazon of Brazil).  We attracted approximately 35 advanced graduate students and post-doctoral scientists from the U.S., Brazil, and Peru, including (with separate funding) several from the U.K.  \n\nBroader Impacts: This project advanced international collaboration and education to improve scientific understanding of the future of the Amazon under climate change.  We engaged a diverse group of  young scientists in rigorous interdisciplinary science and international field work through hands-on projects.  Ongoing interaction and dissemination of results continues be facilitated by a website (www.amazonpire.org).
