This biennial conference, one of the largest regularly-held topical meetings in astrophysics, concentrates on \"cool\" stars with temperatures less than that of the Sun.  The subject matter includes all aspects of the evolution of low-mass stars, including their formation and ultimate death.  The conference will also explores connections between stellar and solar research.",
