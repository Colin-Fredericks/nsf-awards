The meeting focuses on chemical physics, nonlinear analysis, and control theory, with emphasis on molecular simulation and control.  Topics to be addressed include new computational methods in chemical physics, simulation of chemical reactions and quantum control, quantum dynamics and nonlinear analysis, and control of linear and nonlinear quantum dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe meeting features a one-day pre-conference tutorial for participants on molecular simulation and control.  The conference will include invited presentations by leading researchers, as well as contributed talks.\r\n\r\nThe conference will foster collaborations among junior and senior researchers.  Invited lectures and contributed talks will be posted on the conference web site.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://sciences.unlv.edu/Mathematics/MSCC.html",
