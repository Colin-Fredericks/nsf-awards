 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a two-year engineering pathways study that is extending research findings from the NSF funded Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education's (CAEE's) Academic Pathways Study (APS).  The APS conducted a series of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of undergraduate engineering students' learning experiences and their transition to the workplace.  In this project, the experiences of early career professionals (ECPs) are being studied in order to better understand what educational institutions and employers can do to facilitate the transition from engineering student to practicing engineering professional.  More specifically, the project is conducting a mixed-method study of two research questions:  (1) What factors or combinations of factors facilitate the transition of ECPs into a professional culture, and their conceptions of and preparation for their specific professional careers?  (2) How, and to what extent do the factors that influence the professional development of ECPs contribute to their future careers?  The proposed research is grounded in social cognitive career theory that has been shown to be a useful framework for exploring engineering career persistence.  The project includes a rigorous evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to monitor the progress of the project and to study evaluation research questions about the integration of the APS results and the impact of collaboration.",

Our study is framed around the goal of improving education, based on a comprehensive understanding of the needs/experiences of early career professionals (ECP).  We define an ECP as someone who has graduated from an engineering program within five years. It has been well established in studies of adult development that the five-year period post-graduation is a highly formative one for the acquisition of work attitudes, understanding, and motivation across all the professions, including engineering.  Yet we know little about ECP in engineering.  To develop a more complete picture, we designed the Engineering Pathways Study (EPS).  Through EPS we have extended the findings from the NSF-funded Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (CAEE), and in particular findings from CAEE\u00c6s multi-method, multi-institutional Academic Pathways Study (APS) research project, where the main focus was engineering student pathways.\n\nEPS is a mixed-method, multi-institutional, longitudinal study designed to answer the research questions:\n\nWhat factors or combinations of factors facilitate early career professional\u00c6s transition into a professional culture, and their conceptions of and preparation for their specific professional careers?\nHow and to what extent do the factors that influence ECPs\u00c6 professional development contribute to their future careers? \n\n\nWe incorporated interviews and surveys to generate outcomes that are both rich in description and grounded in statistical measures. We used Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to frame our study enabling us identify factors from ECPs\u00c6 educational preparation and current work environments that influenced early career pathways.\nIn addition to the publications, two significant outcomes from this project include an interview protocol and a survey instrument both of which proved to yield trustworthy, valid and reliable results.  The interview protocol is unique in that it is situated in SCCT and draws on specific undergraduate experiences as a means to longitudinally explore current post-graduation experiences.  The interview protocol was developed through extensive pilot testing.  To insure consistent use by multiple interviews, we also developed an Interviewer\u00c6s Guide to facilitate use of the interview questions.  A total of 35 ECP participated in interviews.  Preliminary interview data analysis directly contributed to the development of the Pathways of Engineering Alumni Research Survey (PEARS) survey. \nSimilar to the interview protocol, the survey development and deployment plans of PEARS included extensive piloting/prototyping of the instrument and forging new ground in working with schools\u00c6 alumni organizations for respondent contact information.  PEARS was deployed in the fall of 2011 to engineering graduates from 2007 from TPub, LPub, SPri, and MPub resulting in nearly 500 responses (institutional response rates ranging from 16 to 32%, with an overall response rate of 28%). \nThe groups of participants, or Cohorts, that make up EPS are listed below.  Along with a description of the Cohort, we include the data collected with each cohort and number of participants:\n \nCohort 1:  (TPub, LPub, SPri), 35 ECP\u00c6s who were originally part of APS longitudinal study, with data collected through interviews;\nCohort 2: (TPub, LPub, SPri, MPub), approx. 500 ECPS\u00c6s (2007 Graduates @ 4 schools), with data collected with PEARS\nNote that TPub, LPub, and SPri are existing institutional pseudonyms from APS.  Midwest Public University (MPub) was added for this study.\n \nSpecific research outcomes from this project include:\n\nQualitative descriptions of and patterns in the career goals of ECP\nQualitative descriptions of and patterns in the specific actions ECP take in meeting their goal\nQualitative descriptions of and patterns in the relative success..."
