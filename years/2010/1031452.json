 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop concepts and methodologies that can be used to co-design transportation modeling methods and privacy protection techniques in collecting and using data from mobile traffic sensors. Mobile sensors such as cell phones move with the flow they are monitoring as opposed to fixed-location sensor in the road infrastructure. They promise low-cost collection of traffic data but also raise privacy concerns since their information is more closely tied to individual vehicles. Building on a close collaboration of transportation researchers and location privacy experts, this research aims to answer the following two interrelated questions: (1) what form of mobile data to use and how their use will impact privacy; and (2) what methods should be used to protect mobile data privacy and what are their implications to data requirements for modeling? Answering these questions will result in a framework with privacy-aware transportation modeling application-aware privacy protection, which can transform the way how mobile data are collected and used in transportation and many other science and engineering fields.\r\nThis project builds on and will promote multidisciplinary collaborations, which benefit many audiences, including undergraduate and graduate students, transportation and location privacy researchers, and practitioners. Graduate and undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, can participate in the research. Results from this research will be used to enhance undergraduate and graduate level courses in both transportation engineering and computational privacy. Research findings can also help policy makers design proper policies/regulations on what mobile data to collect and how to better protect privacy. The PIs will work closely with transportation agencies and Standard groups and will make their best effort to convey research findings to transportation decision makers, engineers, the industry, and the academic communities.",

Results from this research were used to enhance undergraduate and graduate level courses. The PI worked closely with transportation agencies and the industry to make his best effort to convey research findings to transportation decision makers, engineers, the industry, and the academic communities.\n\nMajor findings of the research are summarized as follows:\n\nPrivacy      definition:      In an urban environment, traffic related privacy can be defined as the unlinkability of an individual      vehicle over multiple locations (such as intersections).\nVirtual-trip-line      (VTL) zone based privacy protection framework: If      vehicle traces are only collected for the VTL zone (defined as the area      between an upstream location and a downstream location around an      intersection) for sample vehicles, supplemented by specially designed      filtering algorithms to remove traces if the tracking probably of those      traces are high, vehicle privacy can       be reasonably protected. Furthermore, the collected traces are      sufficient for urban traffic modeling applications.\nMobile-data-based      traffic modeling methods: Such methods require a proper integration      of traffic principles/knowledge and advanced learning/optimization/statistical      techniques.\nMobile data      for estimating transportation fuel consumption and emissions: mobile      data, enhanced by newly developed modeling methods in this research to      estimate the traces of un-sampled vehicles, can be used to accurately      estimating vehicle emissions and energy use in urban areas.\n\n\nMajor outcomes of the research are summarized as follows:\n\nResearch      activities and results: this research produced eight (8) journal      papers (see the detailed list below), one (1) book chapter, and 8      conference proceeding papers. \nTeaching      activities:      integrated research results to multiple courses the PI taught in the last      three years, including: Traffic Engineering, Traffic Control and      Simulation; and developed a new course on Advanced Transportation Models.\nStudent      advising:      two (2) Ph.D. students were (partially) supported by this research, who      graduated in the summer of 2013 and 2014 respectively\nUndergraduate      research:      Eight (8) undergraduate students worked on this research through the REU      fund of this project. Three (3) of them are minority or underrepresented      students. They were trained for traffic data collection, analysis,      modeling, and presentation of research results.\nOutreach: During      the course of the project, the team conducted: (i) two (2) invited talks      and fifteen (15) conference presentations; (ii)  multiple meetings with traffic/transportation      practitioners on topics of mobile sensing and privacy protection,      including New York State Department of Transportation, New York City      Department of Transportation, and New York State Association of      T..."
