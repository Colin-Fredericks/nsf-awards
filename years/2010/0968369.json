 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PIRE project, a collaboration between three U.S. and seven foreign institutions in Europe and Asia, will investigate the cognitive and neural consequences of bilingualism to understand the ways in which multiple languages are learned and used. Recent behavioral and neuroscience evidence suggests that there is more extensive processing interaction between the two languages of a bilingual than previously thought, and this is true even when bilinguals are using only one language. Bilingual science therefore provides a tool for revealing fundamental principles about the mind and the brain otherwise obscured in research focused on monolinguals. The next stage of research on bilingualism calls for national and international collaborations to unify our understanding of the nature of the bilingual mind and brain, the process of bilingual language development, and the consequences of bilingualism for cognition. International collaboration is essential for accessibility to widely differing bilingual populations of several spoken, written, and signed languages. This award enables an international network of collaborators with common research goals and methods to exploit unique and complementary opportunities to investigate properties of human languages. Leveraging the diverse perspectives inherent in interdisciplinary and cross-cultural research will facilitate the establishment of a world-class research context for investigating bilingualism science, enable generalization of research findings, and exploit bilingualism as a tool for investigating the representation and processing of language in the mind and brain. \r\n\r\nThis PIRE project will bring together the complementary international expertise of collaborators studying bilinguals who communicate in a variety of languages (e.g., Spanish, Catalan, Welsh, and Chinese). A unique feature of this project is the partnership of U.S. and Dutch scientists exploring the consequences of bimodal bilingualism in deaf people. The NSF-funded VL2 Science of Learning Center at Gallaudet University, a world leader in education for deaf students and research on topics related to deaf people, focuses on issues of visual language processing recognizing deaf readers as bilinguals using a signed language for communication yet reading a written language. Researchers in The Netherlands also study sign language and gesture, deaf literacy development, and speech-sign translation but using different signed and written languages. The convergence of these projects provides a unique opportunity for cross-linguistic collaboration and training that would not be possible in the U.S. alone.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for bilingualism research naturally draws an unusually diverse group of students, scientists, and research participants. This PIRE project will be committed to harnessing that excitement to create opportunities for broadening participation in science by research participants from a broad spectrum of ages and linguistic abilities, and by students and researchers from groups under-represented in the sciences. This PIRE project will provide training and research opportunities to students and scientists not possible without the international collaboration, such as conducting research abroad, participating in virtual international colloquia, developing and sustaining international collaborations, and training by industrial partners with specific expertise in speech, literacy, and neuroimaging. The project also provides institutional opportunities for research with diverse populations, enriching undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral training, and increasing opportunities for early career faculty to develop research programs globally engaged and solidly grounded in cross-disciplinary collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe nature of the science of bilingualism is inherently interdisciplinary and cross-cultural and this project provides opportunities for the participating U.S. institutions to strengthen international offices and activities, develop survey tools to evaluate student's international experiences, and provide energy and synergy for integration and for strengthening links across disciplinary units. This project will strengthen the U.S.'s scientific capital through international training not otherwise available in the U.S. U.S. institutions will benefit from attracting international visiting researchers and students to enrich the internationalizing initiatives and cultures on their campuses. The U.S. population is also increasingly bilingual with ever-diversifying demographic and cultural characteristics so research results are expected to reach well beyond academia.\r\n\r\nU.S. project partners include The Pennsylvania State University, Gallaudet University (D.C.), and Haskins Laboratories at Yale University (CT). International partners include ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory and Practice, Bangor University (Bangor, UK), the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany), Universidad de Granada (Granada, Spain), Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain), Radboud University Nijmegen (Nijmegen, The Netherlands), Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China), and the University of Hong Kong (China). \r\n\r\nThis project was jointly funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.",

A number of investigators are now pursuing a program of research to ask whether new language learning training for older adults will produce benefits to counter age-related cognitive decline.\n\nThe PIRE grant \"Bilingualism, mind, and brain: An interdisciplinary program in cognitive psychology, linguistics, and cognitive neuroscience \" awarded to the faculty affiliated with the Center for Language Science at Penn State University, has provided funding to train undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and early career faculty members in conducting the type of research that leads to new findings, similar to those described above. We refer to this research as \"the science of bilingualism.\" The funding has allowed students to travel abroad to conduct research on the science of bilingualism in one of our partner sites in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe students' visits to research labs abroad in Europe and Asia have facilitated the development of a broad and sustainable international research network that has enabled new discoveries about the consequences of bilingual and multilingual experience for learning and the brain, and has allowed our research team in the US, Europe and Asia to be at the leading edge of a new frontier of research, with a diversity of perspectives, including linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience, and speech pathology. The new results have shown that there is more extensive processing interaction between the two languages of a bilingual than previously thought, and that this is true even when bilinguals are comprehending or producing in only one language. It has also shown that bilinguals who mix two languages in the same discourse do so following specific rules. \n\nThe research experiences have included a wide range of bilinguals in the US and international sites, from young Hispanic children whose bilingualism may affect the development of literacy skills, to adult speakers of many different spoken languages, and deaf individuals whose bilingualism entails the use of sign language together with a written language. By extending our research questions to the study of widely differing bilingual populations and by using a range of converging neurocognitive and linguistic methods, it has been possible to increase the generality of our research findings and to exploit bilingualism as a tool for investigating the representation and processing of language in the mind and brain. \n\nAlthough the PIRE experience has benefited all trainees, the exceptional opportunities it has brought to undergraduate students  are especially noteworthy. During the eight weeks of summer research abroad, the undergraduate PIRE students were required to maintain a blog about all aspects of their experience. The blog can be viewed at http://sites.psu.edu/pireblog/. Many of our PIRE undergraduate students (some who did not even have a passport before receiving training through our PIRE grant) are now in top graduate programs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paola E Dussias"
