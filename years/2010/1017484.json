 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for support of a conference. It is a request for a small amount of funds to support the 16th Annual Black Graduate Conference in Psychology (BGCP). Since 1995, the BGCP has contributed to the scholarly and career development of over 650 participants by: (1) improving the research capabilities of graduate students by providing them with a supportive atmosphere in which to present their research and receive constructive feedback; (2) providing graduate students with an opportunity to exchange strategies and experiences that will help them to thrive in graduate school and beyond; and (3)providing a forum for graduate students in psychology to network and develop collaborative relationships with future colleagues.  The activities proposed are designed to provide a sustained approach to the training of African American graduate students in psychology.  As one of the few venues for examining the psychological experiences of African Americans, the conference serves as an important incubator for new ideas in the field. These new ideas not only benefit the study of African Americans, but also enhance the field of psychology as a whole. Additional broader impacts of the conference include its important role in: (1) retaining African American students in psychology graduate programs, and (2) developing psychologists at top-tier research institutions.",
