 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a manufacturing process to synthesize metal oxide, sulfide and other nanoparticles.  The subject method simply involves mixing of common dry chemical starting materials and heating the resulting precursor material to a modest temperature.  The objective is to demonstrate feasibility and scalability of this low-cost manufacturing process.  Methods of dispersing aggregated particles in aqueous and polar solvents will be also be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to offer a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly process to produce a broad spectrum of high quality nanoparticles.  Current methods of making nanoparticles involve heavy energy consumption, large amounts of waste, and/or purification problems.  The synthetic approach in this project has the potential to become the method of choice to supply novel nanoparticles in many low to high technology applications.  It is anticipated to obtain nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 15 nm, size variations within \u00b110-20%, and purities as high as 99.9999%.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Phase II and Phase II-B project focused on developing the scale-up and commercially viable applications of a novel method of synthesizing nanoparticles.  A metal salt and a base are mixed in the solid state without the addition of any solvent to form a precursor material which is then heated to form metal oxide nanoparticles and all of the byproducts are gases which escape leaving a very pure product.  The nanoparticles are extremely uniform in size and vary beetween 2 to 40nm depending on the metal and process conditions.  Mixed matal oxides can also be manufactured by simply starting with two or more metal salts.  Simple, commercially viable methods of producing materials in large quantities were developed, and numerous applications for commericial utilization were explored.\n\nBecause the reaction takes place in a highly solvent deficient environment, the formation of the nanoparticles and their aggregation can be highly controlled.  Hence, these characteristics suggested that the most useful application of the technology would be in the development of catalyst systems.  The following are generalized descriptions of the technologies which were developed:\n\nCatalyst Support Materials - Metal oxides are the materials of choice for supporting or immobilizing the catalyst nanoparticles.  It is desirable to produce support materials that are highly porous (sponge-like) so that they will have a very large surface area (100-400 m2/gm) so that the catalyst nanoparticles can be deposited throughout the pores.  The reactants diffuse through the pores where they come in contact with the catalyst and the desired chemical reaction takes place at high rates with as little catalyst material as possible.  Cosmas developed methods of producing catalyst support materials from a variety of metal oxides.  These support materials are formed because the nanoparticles will aggregate in such a way that the aggregates are highly porous.  The aggregates can be stabilized by heating them to very high temperatures so the particles begin to fuse together.  Furthermore, because production of the supports does not take place in solution, the Cosmas process can be manipulated to control the aggregation of the nanoparticles and ths precisely control the size of the pores.  No other method comes close to being able to control the porous structure that can be achieved with this process.  Aluminum oxide supports can be made with pore diasmeters from 3 to 55nm in steps of about 5nm.  This enables the customization of the catalyst/support system to optimize performance.  For example, in an automobile catalytic converter 1-2nm platinum or palladium catalyst nanoparticles will perform optimally in a support with 3-7nm pores.  But, the optimal size of a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst (converts natural gas to diesel fuel) is 8-12nm and the product molecules are rather large.  Hence, a pore diameter of 20 to 30nm is ideal. \n\nCatalyst Support Stabilization - By the addition of proper chemicals (doping) to Cosmas' solvent deficient reaction, the stability of the catalyst support at very high temperatures can be increased.  Cosmas has developed alumina catalyst suport materials which are stable at over 1200oC.  If this support were used in an automobile catalytic converter, it could be placed much closser to the engine where the temprerature of the exhaust gas is much higher.  Chemical reactions occur at higher rates at higher temperatures, so much less expensive plantinum and palladium would need to be used.\n\nSimultaneoius Production of Catalyst and Support - Certain metals such as the noble metals, planinum and palladium (the most commonly used catalysts for many different preocrsses), do not form mixed metal oxides when their metal salts are combined with the materials used to make the support.  Hence, the Cosmas process will produce a highly porous aluminum oxide support with 1-2nm platinum catalyst nanoparticles dispersed on the surfaces of the pores throughtout the s..."
