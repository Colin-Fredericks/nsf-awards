Byam\r\nCo-PI:  [None]\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely up-grades to the CTD handing system, a new 70hp outboard for the vessel?s work boat, design for a new (aft) side load handling system, and noise treatments for the active anti-roll fins.   All items will either enhance safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises.  The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool.  The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support 77 NSF-funded days in CY 2010.",
