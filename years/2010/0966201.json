 "awd_abstract_narration": "0966201\r\nWeimer\r\n\r\nThere is a need to develop cost-effective, renewable energy processes for the production of clean fuels such as hydrogen gas (H2).  If H2 can be obtained cost effectively by the splitting of water using concentrated sunlight, then it is possible to operate a fuel cell using renewable H2 to generate electricity or to synthesize other fuels based on renewable H2. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the ability of metal ferrite spinels to split water into hydrogen gas via a solar-thermal reduction/oxidation (REDOX) cycle. The focus of the research is nickel ferrite (NixFe3-xO4) produced through atomic layer deposition (ALD) on zirconia and alumina substrates. The ALD process allows for precise control of the atomic ratio of Ni/Fe in this material, and also has the potential to provide tight control over the mass loadings of the active ferrite on high surface area substrates.\r\n\r\nThe performance of various ferrite materials and alternative water splitting cycles will be evaluated for their potential to produce H2.  Variables to be investigated include ferrite stoichiometry, substrate composition, substrate surface area, REDOX temperatures, rate of reduction heating, and water concentration for oxidation.  Specific measurements include REDOX reaction rates and thermochemical cycling using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for both thermal reduction at up to 1500 C and steam oxidation at up to 1200 C; depth profiling via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to evaluate chemical and structural changes during REDOX cycling; and finally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) to evaluate the robustness of ferrite materials and to assess the possibility of \"islanding\" resulting from sintering.  Experiments are planned to carry out the REDOX cycles under simulated solar-thermal conditions using a High Flux Solar Furnace equipped with a TGA for real-time measurement of heating and cooling rates.  By all of these approaches, the importance of diffusion vs. kinetic rate limitations on the splitting of water to H2 by metal ferrite spinels can be assessed.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is potentially transformative because metal ferrite materials produced through the ALD process have unique a potential to provide high hydrogen gas production rates at the efficiencies needed to make solar-thermal hydrogen production technology viable.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe education activities will make use of existing NSF (REU) and Department of Education programs (GAANN) to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research, including students from under-represented groups.  Outreach to K12 will also be organized through these programs using students involved in the proposed research.",

Solar energy has the potential to provide the energy needs of a growing and energy demanding population, for example the use of renewable H2 to power a fuel cell (Figure 1).  However, the capture, storage, and distribution of this dispersed sunlight remain a challenge. In two-step metal oxide based STWS, a metal oxide is heated using concentrated solar thermal energy to a temperature at which it reduces, generating O2. Subsequently, H2O is introduced to the system to re-oxidize the material and generate H2 (Figure 1).  STWS has the potential to be substantially more efficient than those processes using solar energy to drive an electrolyzer for splitting water (Figure 2).  The efficiency is higher since concentrated sunlight is directly driving water splitting and intermediate electricity, inefficient to produce, is not required.  Conventional STWS operates in a temperature swing water splitting (TSWS) mode in which water splitting is driven solely by a temperature difference of at least 300&deg;C.   In the course of this work, we developed unique doped hercynite cycle materials (CoxFe1-xAl2O4) and demonstrated that significant H2 could be produced using an isothermal water splitting (ITWS) redox cycle in which the reduction and oxidation steps are performed at the same temperature, and an oxygen chemical potential difference drives water splitting (Figure 3).  We showed that this method could potentially be more efficient than TSWS. The results were transformational as they changed the standard direction of research which was TSWS.   A paper was published in Science.   Based on this result, we show that STWS can also be driven by combinations of temperature and chemical potential differences using temperature changes between the reduction and oxidation steps of less than ~150&deg;C, which we have called near-isothermal water splitting (NITWS).

We have developed new models and methods to describe and predict complex thermodynamic and kinetic behavior which are applicable to many chemical systems, taught several graduate students and many undergraduate students how to conduct scientific research and brought the promise of efficient H2 generation from sunlight and water by STWS closer to fruition.  A block flow diagram is shown in Figure 5 for our STWS process to produce 50,000 kg H2/day.  As shown in Figure 6, we believe that future improvements in the process will allow STWS to be carried out such that an ultimate cost of $2/kg H2 can be achieved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Weimer"
