  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF grant assisted students in attending the 26th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM 2010) that was hosted by the Politehnica University of Timisoara in Romania on September 12-18, 2010.  ICSM provided a premier international (world wide) venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the area of software maintenance and evolution.  ICSM conference is a vital venue for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results advancing state of the art in software maintenance and evolution.  The grant was used to support and broaden student participation in ICSM 2010 by subsidizing the travel for participants who might not otherwise travel to attend the conference.  The funds were used solely to provide travel support for students from the U.S. based institutions.\n\nApplications were solicited via e-mail mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web-site.  The selection process considered the applicant\u00c6s level of participation in the ICSM 2010, followed by how closely the student\u00c6s research interests matched areas covered by ICSM, and, in the case of the undergraduate and starting graduate students, the advisor\u00c6s endorsement stating the student\u00c6s potential and progress towards their degree.  The selection process was based on the merit of student applications, making every possible effort to include underrepresented groups of students.  The funds from this grant were used solely for students at U.S. based universities and colleges, with preferences given to U.S. citizens and underrepresented categories. We also asked eight students, who have been awarded travel supplements from this NSF grant, to provide a one-page report on their ICSM 2010 experience.\n\nThis grant notably augmented both the training and development of graduate students working in the area of software maintenance and evolution by attending this conference, who participated in ICSM 2010 through this grant.  The students receiving travel support personally benefited from the chance to engage in the important technical professional and social opportunities that ICSM 2010 fostered.  Moreover, the ICSM 2010 conference was indirectly strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support provided.  Finally, the funds from this grant were used solely for students at U.S. based universities and colleges, with preferences given to the U.S. citizens and underrepresented groups of students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Denys Poshyvanyk"
