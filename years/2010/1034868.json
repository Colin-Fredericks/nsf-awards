 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 9th International Congress of Neuroethology (ICN) will be held on August 2-7, 2010, in Salamanca, Spain.  The ICN is the scientific meeting of the International Society for Neuroethology (ISN) that has been held since 1986.  This meeting brings together diverse neuroscientists who investigate the neural basis of behavior across a broad spectrum of animals.  It is an outstanding venue to bring together international scientists with a broad range of perspectives, but who all focus on common basic-science questions that have important implications for neural function.  Topics include sensory and motor processing, central integrative processes, development, synaptic plasticity and learning, regeneration, and systems-level approaches to understanding plasticity and behavior.  In addition some sessions focus on emerging technologies. Neuroethology aims to explain natural behaviors in terms of the activity of individual neurons and networks, and to explore developmental and evolutionary aspects of behavior. Neuroethologists use a comparative approach to seek common solutions to common problems.  This involves an understanding of evolutionary principles as they apply to nervous systems and the generation of adaptive behaviors.  Evolutionarily informed comparisons of equivalent behaviors in different species can help to identify the common principles that guide the generation of behavior in all species, including humans. The broader impacts of this meeting are to promote engagement in this area for junior investigators, and in particular women and minority scientists, and to stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas among the participants. Support will be directed to fund travel and registration for student, postdoctoral and junior investigators.  The benefits to American scientists in general, and to young investigators in particular, will be the opportunity for exposure to cutting-edge research and techniques from around the world.",
