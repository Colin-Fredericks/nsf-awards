 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to improve the control of multiple\r\ntesting error rates.  A popular approach to multiple testing is based on\r\npermutation. One motivation for the use of permutation-based\r\ntesting is to reduce the conservativeness of the tests while still\r\ncontrolling error rates.  Permutation-based tests are thought to achieve\r\nthis by incorporating the multivariate distribution of the multiple test\r\nstatistics. However, the hypotheses for which permutation testing is known\r\nto be appropriate are different from those usually considered in multiple\r\ntesting. In this project, the investigators precisely describe model\r\nassumptions and conditions for permutation testing to control multiple\r\ntesting error rates.  In particular, the investigators study precise model\r\nassumptions connecting the marginal distributions of interest in multiple\r\ntesting to the joint distributions known to be appropriate for permutation\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\nWhile the methods studied in this project can be used in many fields, they\r\nwill be particularly applicable to genetic association studies.\r\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are conducted to discover\r\nbiological pathways and prognostic biomarkers, and to guide treatment.\r\nSome GWAS discoveries have failed to replicate, possibly due to\r\nstatistical testing procedures lacking error rate control.  In this\r\nproject, the investigators study the conditions under which currently used\r\nmethods are guaranteed to appropriately control statistical error rates.\r\nSuch control will lead to better return on investments in developing drugs\r\nand treatments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMultiple testing for significant association between predictors and responses has a wide array of applications.  One such application is pharmacogenomics, where testing for association between categorical responses (e.g., healthy or diseased) and many categorical genetic markers is of interest.  Permuting response group labels to generate a reference distribution is often thought of as a convenient technique that automatically captures dependence in the data and leads to more powerful tests.  However, the PIs and their colleague showed that strong model assumptions are required for permutation testing to control multiple testing error rates (Kaizar, Li, and Hsu, 2011 Journal of the American Statistical Association).  When these assumptions are violated, permutation-based multiple testing can give incorrect unconditional and, especially, conditional assessment of the statistical significances.  Such flawed procedures may \u00e6discover\u00c6 important genetic markers that are in fact not related to disease, or fail to identify those that are in truth important to the disease mechanism.  Regardless of the study design, the statistical research showed that how misleading permutation-based assessment can be is primarily driven by covariances among the markers that differ between the two response groups (e.g., those with and without disease). \n\nThe PIs and their colleague further showed that these same flaws extend to permutation-based tests for markers that predict a response to treatment, known as \"predictive markers\" (Kaizar and Kil, 2013).  In fact, this research suggests that permutation-based tests for predictive markers actually identify markers that are associated with the outcome of interest (e.g., disease), regardless of its effect on the efficacy of treatment (i.e., prognostic markers).  Thus, using flawed permutation-based tests may erroneously identify subpopulations for targeted pharmaceutical use, when the drug should actually be used either more or less broadly. \n\nIn response to these troubling findings regarding permutation-based multiple testing procedures, the PIs have also developed statistically correct methods for subgroup discovery.  In particular, the new research considers the common case of finding a classification rule to group patients into target and non-target populations based on a continuous characteristic.  A frequently cited method in this setting relies on permutation-based multiple tests (Jiang, Freidlin and Simon, 2007 Journal of the National Cancer Institute).  The PIs and their colleagues have demonstrated the use of a different method that accounts for the correlation among nested subgroups without relying on permutation (Tang, et al, 2013).  A related method for categorical outcomes is still under development.  By using these new methods instead of permutation-based techniques, pharmaceutical researchers will be able to correctly identify subpopulations for which new drugs are effective and safe.\n\nTo broadly caution researchers against careless use of permutation-based multiple tests, Jason Hsu has taught five short courses on multiple comparisons that included precise conditions for validity of permutation multiple tests (FDA Center for Device and Radiologic Health, October 2010, Deming Conference, December 2010, Multiple Comparison Procedures Conference, August 2011, International Conference on Health Policy Statistics Conference, October 2011, and Multiple Comparison Procedures 2013, July 2013).
