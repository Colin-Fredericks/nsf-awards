 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth.  Increased heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has elevated the temperature of the 300 m of shelf water below the permanent pycnocline by 0.7 degrees C. This trend has displaced the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate, and is causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. One striking example of the ecosystem response to warming has been the local declines in ice-dependent Ad\u00e9lie penguins. The changes in these apex predators are thought to be driven by alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition, and the foraging limitations and diet differences between these species. One of the most elusive questions facing researchers interested in the foraging ecology of the Ad\u00e9lie penguin, namely, what are the biophysical properties that characterize the three dimensional foraging space of this top predator? The research will combine the real-time site and diving information from the Ad\u00e9lie penguin satellite tags with the full characterization of the oceanography and the penguins prey field using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). While some of these changes have been documented over large spatial scales of the WAP, it is now thought that the causal mechanisms that favor of one life history strategy over another may actually operate over much smaller scales than previously thought, specifically on the scale of local breeding sites and over-wintering areas. Characterization of prey fields on these local scales has yet to be done and one that the AUV is ideally suited. The results will have a direct tie to the climate induced changes that are occurring in the West Antarctic Peninsula. This study will also highlight a new approach to linking an autonomous platform to bird behavior that could be expanded to include the other two species of penguins and examine the seasonal differences in their foraging behavior and prey selection. From a vehicle perspective, this effort will inform the AUV user community of new sensor suites and/or data processing approaches that are required to better evaluate foraging habitat. The project also will help transition AUV platforms into routine investigative tools for this region, which is chronically under sampled and will remain difficult to access",

One of the most elusive questions facing researchers interested in the feeding ecology of the Ad&eacute;lie penguin, namely, what are the ocean properties that characterize the three dimensional feeding space of this top predator? Answering this question is one of the foci of the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program because of its implications\nto understand the mechanistic processes that regulate associated food web\ndynamics.  In association with this program, this project aimed at addressing the feeding ecology of the Ad&eacute;lie penguin using a combination of technologies, namely location/dive depth satellite tags for the penguins and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  While not new technologies, this was the first time this combination of technology was applied.  The satellite tags provide a location and the dive depths for the penguins.  The AUV is\na torpedo shaped device that carries a number of sensors and is  reprogrammed to fly underwater (untethered &ndash; see figure).  The AUV performance capabilities match the known penguin dive depths,\nswimming speeds and duration and therefore the AUV was thought to be an\nappropriate tool for this effort.  The AUV sensors were able to measure salinity, temperature, chlorophyll (a proxy for plants &ndash; the base of the food web), and using sound could measure the distribution of krill, which makes up almost the entirety of the penguin diet.  The AUV missions would be informed in real-time based on the location of the tagged penguins.  This cycle of tagging, AUV missions, and data collection were repeated over the course of the penguin\u00c6s chick rearing period, a critical period for the penguin population.\n\n \n\nSatellite tags were placed on 27 penguins, each for a duration of 48 hours in order to minimize impacts on the penguins and to not bias the data (see figure).  During this time we also conducted 21 AUV missions covering over 550 km and almost 100 hours underwater (see figure).  There was excellent performance by the AUV with the ability to operate in all weather conditions without the assistance of a ship.  This is an important consideration given that it avoids hazardous duties by individuals, is cost effective and is able to collect information in poor weather conditions.   \n\n \n\nWith this data and working with other colleagues we have been able to demonstrate that the feeding behavior of the Ad&eacute;lie penguin and duration and distance of their feeding trips are influenced by the tidal forcing in the area. \nWe have also established that the area of large number of krill patches\nare overlapping with the foraging area of the Ad&eacute;lie penguin, showing this\nproof of concept worked.  We also showed that this krill \"hot spot\" is at the intersection of the foraging habitats of the Ad&eacute;lie and Gentoo penguins (see figure).  The depth distribution of dive depths and krill also show that there are two depths where krill were distributed and that these correspond to the different diving depth of the two penguin species (see figure). We demonstrate for the first time that an AUV can be used repeatedly to characterize the feeding habitat and simultaneously measure physical and biological food web information that is critical for understanding the feeding ecology of the these birds.\n\n\nIn the broader impacts of this study, we demonstrated the application of a new tool for looking at feeding ecology, bridging disciplinary boundaries (biology, engineering, oceanography).  The results of the study have not only been disseminated within the scientific community, but in a number of individual talks to community groups and public outre..."
