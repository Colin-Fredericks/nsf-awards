 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concentrates on creating a novel, economical and powerful production technology for eukaryotic membrane proteins, a group of proteins that remain intractable yet are of tremendous medical and scientific importance. A majority of membrane proteins are very difficult to obtain in any significant quantities, even at milligrams scale since their natural biosynthesis levels often are very low and currently available production methods are not effective for membrane proteins. This research project will utilize a versatile and easy-to-cultivate microorganism that can generate proliferated membranes under certain conditions to host the recombinant membrane proteins. The efficiency of various strategies will be evaluated through activity assays and direct protein isolation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the technology are new generations of efficacious medicines in virtually all therapeutic areas including infectious diseases, cancer, genetic diseases due to genetic defect in membrane proteins, central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular system diseases, digestive system diseases and many others. The impact of this technology in science, in medicine and in society will be very significant. The technology can be utilized to mass-produce a very large number of membrane proteins, especially surface membrane proteins for applications in structure-based drug design, in protein engineering, in protein therapeutics, and for the development of diagnostics and vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. These efforts will not only provide new scientific understandings of very difficult-to-study membrane proteins but also eventually transform the current landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for human diseases and illnesses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMembrane proteins account for one third of the approximately 34,000 genes found in the human genome while the remaining genes encode soluble proteins.  Even though membrane proteins are very difficult to work with, they constitute the majority of drug targets.  Blockbuster drugs that target membrane proteins have long been a mainstay of the pharmaceutical industry.  Furthermore, membrane proteins on the surface of cells are typically exposed to the host immune system and as a result, they also make excellent vaccines and attractive targets for immunotherapy and immuno-diagnostics.  In contrast to soluble proteins, membrane proteins are difficult to work with and producing large amounts of these proteins even at milligram scale is not only very challenging, but also very expensive.  All of the currently available protein expression vehicles yield very poor results for membrane proteins even though the most powerful systems, for instance, Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, insect cells/baculovirus, can generate gram quantities of recombinant soluble proteins. The difficulty in producing large quantities of membrane proteins economically has hampered the study of medicinally important membrane proteins and created many bottlenecks in the drug discovery process, substantially increasing time and cost.  The ability to mass-produce membrane proteins is certainly one of the critical issues in the medicine development process, whether that is for disease diagnostic and vaccine development or for small molecule drug discovery.\n\n \n\nMembrane proteins especially those of eukaryotic origins as well as viral surface envelope glycoproteins pose significant challenges.  These proteins often require folding factors that do not exist in prokaryotic hosts. In many cases, they also require activating factors like unique lipids not synthesized by prokaryotes.  Many eukaryotic membrane proteins contain secondary modifications like glycosylation.  Prokaryotic protein synthesis machinery lacks the necessary components to perform these tasks.  As a result, recombinant eukaryotic proteins prepared through prokaryotic hosts do not contain these secondary modifications.  Furthermore, many eukaryotic membrane proteins and viral surface glycoproteins are often processed through complicated cleavage steps catalyzed by unique processing proteases existing only in eukaryotic hosts.\n\n \n\nThe eukaryotic membrane protein overexpression technology which TransMembrane Biosciences (TMB) has developed with funding from the National Science Foundation, should provide a solution to this significant problem.  The eukaryotic membrane protein overexpression technology relies on protease-deficient strains of the eukaryote S. cerevisiae and expression vectors containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proliferation signals.  These signals are essentially segments of certain signals known to cause extensive proliferation of ER-derived membranes in S. cerevisiae.  TMB are able to exploit these ER membranes proliferation signals for use in vectors to overexpress chimeric recombinant membrane proteins containing these signals under certain permissible and inducible conditions.  This system could be very useful, particularly for eukaryotic membrane proteins since these membrane proteins are synthesized in the ER, an environment quite different from the periplasmic membrane environment in prokaryotes.  Certain eukaryotic membrane proteins might require certain proteins present only in the ER for correct folding and activity activation.  Furthermore, the yeast host is also capable of introducing a variety of secondary modifications into the recombinant membrane proteins, normally absent if made in prokaryotic hosts.\n\n \n\nExploiting the technology, TMB were able to express a variety of eukaryotic membrane proteins and viral surface proteins for vaccine and diagnostics development. One of the most notable successes is the overexpression of a surface membrane protein that could be utilize..."
