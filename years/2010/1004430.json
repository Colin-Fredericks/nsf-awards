 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Kenneth W. Olsen at Loyola University of Chicago for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on research in a wide number of areas in the chemical sciences.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the synthesis and characterization of an improved hemoglobin polymer; (2)  the study of the regulation of starch synthesis in bacteria and plants; (3) the synthesis of supramolecular structures for host-guest investigations; (4)  the computational study of electronic structure and nuclear dynamics in electrocyclic reactions; (5)  the study of DNA adducts formed with the water disinfection byproduct dibromonitromethane; (6)  the study of charge injection in nanostructures; (7) the study of electron transfer processes in clays; (8) the computational study of complexes containing divalent metal cations; (9) a study of quorum quenching hydrolases in bacteria; and (10) a study of the ways in which lake breezes off of Lake Michigan process and transport atmospheric pollutants.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in site visits (e.g. the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory), and a variety of professional development activities. Students in the City Colleges of Chicago will be recruited, as well as other colleges in the region.  Many of the schools in the area have large numbers of students from underrepresented groups.  Students will be selected on the basis of their enthusiasm for research, intellectual curiosity and motivation.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The possible projects span a wide range of topics of current chemical research, giving the students working at Loyola University's REU site excellent examples of the kinds of research problems that chemical scientists investigate.  Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.  The pool of student participants will diverse, and many will come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF REU grant funded chemistry and biochemistry research experiences for undergraduates at Loyola University Chicago.  Although there were significant scientific findings, the most important and long-lasting result was turning on young Americans to career in science.  Over the four summers that the program ran (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015) a total of 32 new students from 26 different colleges were introduced to chemistry and biochemistry research under the guidance of faculty mentors.  Most of these students did not have research opportunities at their home institutions.  Although one student went to medical school and another to law school after their graduations, the overwhelming majority who have graduated so far have continued into scientific careers, primarily through the route of graduate education.  The interactions between the undergraduates and the faculty and graduate students who they worked with was essential to this result.  Additional programs given each summer on how to get into graduate school were also helpful.  Students were given their choice of 17 different projects prior to their arrival on campus.  These programs ranged from the chemistry of organic light emitting diodes to the development of new antibiotics to the effects of mutations on the activity of a bacterial enzyme.  Each summer the research program lasted 10 weeks.  While the main emphasis was on laboratory work, their were weekly seminars on safety and on other research projects as well as a trip to visit the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.  All of the students were given an opportunity to present their research in a scientific symposium.  Several have been co-authors on publications generated by their research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth W Olsen"
