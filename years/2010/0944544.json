 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I attempts to unify electronic communications into a single interface. Which, to date, has been difficult to achieve with existing technology. When each new communications modality results in a new \"inbox,\" it only makes the situation worse. Social networks, some with over 200 million users, are the most egregious example, attempting to lock users into using only their site to access social networking messages (essentially proprietary captive email). The problem intended to be solve in the proposed project is to integrate a broad range of message modalities from disparate, often proprietary, and blocked sources into an integrated solution.  In the current effort, the architected server will channel all incoming social networking messages through published APIs and other means.\r\n\r\nRocketvox's target markets are the 75 million \"Millennials\" and the 30 million Mobile Professionals in the U.S. - mobile, technically savvy, heavy users of multiple modes of communication, highly social, experimental, and interested in simplicity. These users frequently are required to use over a dozen different modes of communication on a daily basis. Each mode may require a different application which requires they learn each application and they must maintain them all on their computers. Further, studies show great time lost and cognitive dissonance when having to constantly change from one client to another. Rocketvox is building a comprehensive, cross-platform, integrated ecommunications.  If successful, the solution will markedly simplify the management of our digital lives.",
