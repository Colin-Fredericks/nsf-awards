Network coding\r\noffers the promise of improved performance over traditional\r\nnetwork routing techniques used in practical engineering\r\napplications.  Emphasis is placed on the fundamental theory of\r\ncommunication in networks that allow coding in addition to\r\nrouting.  Applications include improved throughput in packet\r\nnetworks and power savings in wireless ad hoc networks.  The work\r\nexploits the diverse mathematical, engineering, and computer\r\nscience background from the investigator's previous work and\r\ninvolves mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and computer\r\nsimulation.  The main topic areas investigated are: the role of\r\nalphabet size and error correcting codes in network coding,\r\ntechniques for computing or bounding network capacities,\r\ndetermining the scalar or vector solvability of networks,\r\ntheoretically achievable rates under a limitation of the number\r\nof network nodes that can perform coding, and bi-directional\r\nnetworks. \r\n\r\n     This project has applications to practical engineering\r\nproblems involving packet switched networks, such as sensor\r\nnetworks, military battlefield networks, and local area networks. \r\nThe most prominent example is the Internet, which is used on a\r\ndaily basis by billions of people for sending email, downloading\r\nimages and video, transferring data, and many other applications. \r\nThis project studies the theoretical foundations of how\r\ninformation can be sent across such networks using mathematical\r\ncombinations of data rather than just routing of data. \r\nSpecifically, the project studies the fundamental limits of data\r\ntransmission, the best methods to transmit such data, and\r\nvariations on the types of networks used.  The project includes\r\ngraduate student participation as well as some undergraduate and\r\nhigh school student contributions, with emphasis on the\r\ninterconnection between mathematics, engineering, and computer\r\nscience.",
