 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers and researchers at the University of Wisconsin are creating and studying a professional development model that extends the Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI) model developed by the PI and his colleagues. The proposed model is targeted at children in pre-kindergarten, particularly four-year-olds, and focuses on culturally relevant teaching and learning. The model stresses a specific, circumscribed content domain - basic number operations - with the intention of exploring the domain in depth. \r\n\r\nThe project designs, develops, and tests innovative resources and models for teachers to support ongoing professional learning communities. These learning communities are designed to identify and build on the rich mathematical understandings of all pre-K children. The project's specific goals are to instantiate a reciprocal \"funds of knowledge\" framework for (a) accessing children's out-of-school experiences in order to provide instruction that is equitable and culturally relevant and (b) developing culturally effective ways to support families in understanding how to mathematize their children's out-of-school activities. Teachers are observed weekly during the development and evaluation process and student assessments are used to measure students' progress toward meeting project benchmarks and the program's effectiveness in reducing or eliminating the achievement gap.\r\n\r\nThe outcome is a complete professional development model that includes written and digital materials.  The product includes case studies, classroom video, examples of student work, and strategies for responding to students' understandings.",

A culminating course engaged teachers in action research on their own practice, focusing on their emerging understanding young children?s learning of number and counting. Over three cohorts, 54  early educators completed year 1 and 26 year 2. \n \nBased on the professional development program, we offered a state wide conference for early childhood educators called Math Counts, held on the University of Wisconsin campus in the summer of 2015.  Attended by 120 Wisconsin early educators, the conference included panel discussions about teaching number and counting through developmentally responsive practices that tapped children?s funds of knowledge.  Past PD participants presented posters of their projects and described their experiences and current implementation of the the PD programs ideas. Conference costs were covered by participant support from the grant so teachers attended for free.  The second activity was a variant of the initial PD model, offered in collaboration with UW Madison?s Office of Educational Outreach and Partnership.  The hybrid format provided face to face meetings once per month paired with online instructional support from a math ed specialist with online teaching expertise. The course  was designed around the book Young children?s arithmetic: Cognitively guided instruction for preschool and kindergarten by Tom Carpenter, Megan Franke, Nick Johnson, Angela Torrou, &amp; Anita Wager, developed out of the phase 1 professional development study. Approximately 10 teachers completed the course Young Children?s Mathematics each year across the two years offered.  \n \nIn addition to developing and providing the professional development, the research team studied the process, coming to the following conclusions in three categories:\n\nChildren?s learning:  \nUsing well researched model of Cognitively Guided Instruction required some adaptation to the developmental needs of four year olds. The notion of a group, the ability to sort on a single characteristic and attend and hold another?s idea, and the capability to inhibit impulsivity were all necessary for easy grasp of number problems. In addition, children?s home mathematical practices shaped their engagement in number and counting. \nWe identified three contexts for math learning in the classroom:  during instructional time, during engagement with mathematical games or manipulatives, and during free play.

Teachers who could notice these multiple mathematical resources planned instruction that took up children?s funds of knowledge and mathematical understanding, resulting in robust learning opportunities. \n\nInstructional practice\nA trajectory of math talk described a range of teaching practice that supported children?s math talk.  A) teacher initiates conversation around an activity s/he developed. B) teacher responds to children?s math engagement in an activity, C) teacher responds to children?s engagement in mathematics in free play. \nImprovisation was a metaphor useful to describe how teachers enacted the PD?s concepts. Teachers who utilized these knowledge of pedagogical content knowledge, funds of knowledge, and knowledge of developmentally responsive practices in a balanced way engaged children in richer forms of instruction than those who did not.  \nEveryday interactions position some children as doersof mathematics and others as not taking upmathematics.  Recognizing that instructional practices set up this dichotomy rather than something inherent in a child can help teachers support children so that they move to mathematical doers.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary E Graue"
