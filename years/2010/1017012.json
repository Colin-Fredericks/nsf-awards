 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network coding brings the promise of increased wireless network capacity by decreasing the overall number of\r\ntransmissions. In practice however, many challenges remain in realizing the gains from network coding. In particular\r\nthe interactions between network coding and transmission rate control have not been carefully studied to date.\r\nWhile transmission at higher rates favor a capacity increase, they can diminish overhearing possibilities, a key requirement\r\nof network coding.\r\nThis proposal considers the problem of transmission rate control and network coding in a holistic\r\nway. A framework that examines the interdependencies between the use of network coding and multiple transmission\r\nrates with respect to various functions  spanning the link and routing layers, is developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tasks are being undertaken: (i) Design a network-coding aware transmission rate control module\r\nthat allows nodes to transmit at the high bit rates while at the same time facilitating network coding.\r\n(ii) Design a set of functions at the link and routing layers that provide the best trade-offs between applying\r\nnetwork coding and controlling interference and network congestion\r\n(iii) Implement and extensively evaluate a unified framework combining all of our functional modules on wireless testbeds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is tightly knit with  new education programs by establishing wireless teaching\r\nlaboratories and introduce cross-disciplinary courses that bridge the physical and higher layers.",
