Improvements in the precision of isotope measurements open up new avenues of scientific inquiry and significantly enhance our understanding of natural processes. Multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometery (MC-ICPMS) is a relatively new technique for the measurement of isotopic compositions at high precision and as such this instrumentation has important implications for earth, ocean, and environmental sciences. \r\n\r\nThis National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation funding will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to pursue diverse geochemical, environmental and geochronological research at the University of Wyoming. Housing an MC-ICPMS will lead to a substantial improvement in the University of Wyoming?s capabilities to conduct cutting-edge research. This MC-ICPMS will provide essential research experiences for graduate and undergraduate students using state-of-the-art facilities, as well as serving other regional, national and international researchers.",
