 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is dedicated to the development of new directions of representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and related structures, and applications to models in theoretical physics.  The proposal consists of three interrelated parts.  The first part of the proposal outlines a new construction of the Monster vertex operator algebra via chiral three-dimensional quantum gravity, which is strongly suggested by the recent works of the author on Rademacher sums.  The second part is dedicated to the continuation of the author?s work on the development of quaternionic analysis with expected applications to representations of three dimensional current algebras and relations to four-dimensional quantum field theory.  Finally, the third part contains further steps towards realization of various structures in quaternionic analysis using the semi-infinite cohomology of the Virasoro algebra that recently was set forth by the author.  It also links and reinforces the first and second part of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe relation between representation theory and physical models was very fruitful in the twentieth century  with the famous examples of representations of Lorentz and Poincare groups and special relativity, representations of the  Heisenberg group and quantum mechanics, representations of the group  SU(3)  and quark composition of elementary particles. The author actively participated in the development of a recent relation between representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and two-dimensional quantum field theory.  His present proposal outlines a new representation theoretic approach to important areas of modern theoretical physics, namely, three dimensional quantum gravity and four dimensional quantum field theory, and has a profound relation to different areas of mathematics such as Monstrous Moonshine, absolute Galois group, quaternionic analysis, theory of instantons and non-commutative geometry.",

The mathematical theory of the quaternionic analysis naturally leads to various structures of four-dimensional quantum electrodynamics including Dirac and Maxwell equations and Feynman integrals. The PI studies a deformation of the quaternionic analysis related to the anti-de Sitter space, he also obtains a six-dimensional realization of the quaterionic analysis and connects it to the  AdS(5)/CFT(4) correspondence in  physics.\n\nThe author also studies the quantum deformation of the quaternionic analysis based on the theory of quantum groups. This leads  him to a general construction of the principal series representations of split real quantum groups and to a general program of the future development of this theory. The study of the quantum deformation of the quaternionic analysis also leads to a simple construction of the quantum universal Teichmuller space from the representation theory of the quantum plane. This can be viewed as a step towards a rigorous approach to three-dimensional quantum gravity. The PI  also studied partition functions of  the three-dimensional quantum gravity and has discovered profound connections with the Rademacher sums in  analytic number theory and Moonshine vertex operator algebra.\n\nUsing the equivalence of categories of the simplest quantum group and the Virasoro algebra the PI was able to realize the quantum space-time as semi-infinite cohomology, which suggest a ``stringy'' realization of the quantum quaternionic analysis. The dual picture to this realization of the quantum space-time provides a construction of the modified regular representation of the Virasoro algebra with the critical central charge equal to 26.\n\nDuring the duration of the grant the PI also wrote various other papers related to the main project. One work is dedicated to a construction of a continuous series representations of a loop algebra. Another is  dedicated to a geometrization of  representation theory of loop algebras using  the Laumon spaces. The third provides a categorification of the  boson-fermion correspondence in  two-dimensional conformal field theory using a representation theory of the Lie algebra of infinite matrices. This is the first example of categorification of a two-dimensional conformal field theory using representation theory. It suggests  important hints towards another categorification using representation theory of gauge groups of four-dimensional space-time conjectured in the proposal.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The project outcome consists of papers, preprints, graduate lecture series, lectures at the conferences and other invited lectures, many of which are videotaped. The results of the project develop representation theory, quaternionic analysis and models in quantum physics. In addition to representation theory, the author employs theories of homological algebra, Hopf algebras, algebraic geometry, complex analysis, functional analysis and various structures of mathematical physics.\n\nBroader Impact: The proposal is valuable in establishing the relations between various areas in pure mathematics and theoretical physics. The proposal also helped in the training of eight (8) graduate students and four (4) postdoctoral appointees. The PI gave two graduate lecture series, invited  videotaped lecture series and several other videotaped lectures, which were studied by many mathematicians.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Igor B Frenkel"
