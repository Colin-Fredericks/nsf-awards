 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Brittain will lead and carry out a project that will enhance our understanding of the process of planet formation by studying gas in the inner region of circumstellar disks. While it is accepted that planetary systems form out of the gas and dust seen around newly formed stars, fundamental questions remain about this process. This project will study the planet-forming region of circumstellar disks using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. This study will be able to measure the amounts of warm gas present in these disks and will help constrain the timescales for gas dissipation which is likely related to how quickly gas giant planets like Jupiter can form.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of this proposal are centered on attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse group of students to the sciences. The PI proposes to develop astronomy related workshops for disadvantaged students through the collaboration of elementary education and physics majors at Clemson. The students come from the 'Creative Inquiry Initiative' program (which is already established at active at Clemson) which matches teams of students with a faculty mentor for a five semester project. Additionally, the research proposed here will make up a significant portion of a Clemson student?s Ph.D. Dissertation.",

To do this we used infrared spectroscopy to study warm gas in disks around young stars. This work led to the first calibration of the luminosity of HI emisison and the stellar accretion rate, the application of a new technique, spectro-astrometry, to better determine the spatial distribution of gas in the disk (Fig. 2). We also modeled the asymmetric profile of OH emisison lines in order to infer the presence of a gas giant planet in a disk (Fig. 3). Perhaps the most exciting discovery emerging from this work has been the detection of warm molecular gas emission from a forming companion in the disk surrounding the star HD100546 (Fig. 4).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>The priniciple broader impact of this work was the incorporation of undergraduate (physics majors and elementary education majors) and graduate students in this effort. This work benefited from the participation of 18 undergaduate researchers, five M.S. students and four Ph.D. students. These students have taken their training into the K-12 education sector, industry, regional colleges, and research universities. One of the activities to emerge from this effort is a Math/Science partnership with Laurens County 55 and 56 school districts.
