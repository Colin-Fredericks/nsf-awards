 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to study the explicit construction of class fields by proving explicit formulas for Gross-Stark units. This will build on recent work of the principal investigator in collaboration with Henri Darmon and Robert Pollack, in which the weak Gross-Stark conjecture was proven under certain assumptions. It will also incorporate previous work of the principal investigator in which an exact formula for Gross-Stark units was conjectured. Furthermore, this project proposes to develop a unified theory of locally constructed \"Darmon style\" cohomology classes by linking Darmon's integration theory with the p-adic Langlands program.  Connections to other outstanding conjectures concerning trivial zeroes of p-adic L-functions will be studied.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to help foster an increased community of interaction and collaboration between the University of California, Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the American Institute of Mathematics.  This increased interaction will be highlighted by regularly held mini-conferences on the topics of Number Theory and Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry.  Furthermore, a postdoc will be hired at UCSC to help foster the research environment, and in particular to interact with students on research topics.  As part of this proposal, the PI plans to continue expository writing aimed at communicating high level mathematics to a student audience. Kronecker's \"dream of youth\" was to explicitly construct all the abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields. Hilbert presented the problem for general number fields as the 12th problem in his famous list. The search for an explicit class field theory has motivated many great advances in number theory. Its prime successes include the Kronecker-Weber theorem and the theory of complex multiplication. This project hopes to extend the understanding of explicit class field theory beyond the setting of complex multiplication. The main technique is to study the connection between units in number fields and special values of zeta-functions. This connection is a central motivating theme in number theory.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the five years that the PI was supported by an NSF CAREER grant, he made significant progress of several important research problems.  Several of these problems were outlined in the grant proposal, whereas others were new projects that grew out of mathematical exploration.\n\n \n\nThe PI proved Greenberg\u00c6s conjecture on symmetric square L-invariants attached to elliptic curves with good ordinary reduction by proving a factorization for p-adic Rankin L-functions.  This factorization had itself been conjectured by Citro, and the PI proved it by combining older techniques of Gross with recent results of Darmon and Rotger.  Next, the PI helped informally advise a graduate student at UCLA (Kevin Ventullo) who was able to remove two important assumptions in the PI\u00c6s work with Darmon and Pollack on the Gross-Stark conjecture.  In separate work, the PI presented a conjectural product formula for Brumer-Stark units over real quadratic fields following ideas set out by David Hayes.  All of these projects were directly mentioned in the PI\u00c6s proposal.\n\n \n\nIn addition, the PI successfully completed a number of projects that grew out of themes described in the proposal but were not mentioned explicitly.  For example, the PI embarked on a study of the Eisenstein cocycle in ongoing collaboration with Pierre Charollois and Michael Spiess.  This collaboration has led to the publication of several papers, which include new constructions of the Deligne-Ribet p-adic L-function, a lower bound on its order of vanishing at s=0, and a proof of an integral refinement of the order of vanishing conjectured by Gross.  In separate joint work with Joel Bellaiche, the PI proved a factorization for the p-adic L-series of critical Eisenstein series as conjectured by Stevens.\n\n \n\nThe PI was also successful in implementing many components of his educational plan.  The PI hired a postdoctoral researcher, Cameron Franc, for 3 years at UC Santa Cruz.  The PI worked closely with the mentoring of Franc, who wrote research papers, taught classes, and organized seminars while at UC Santa Cruz.  After his time at UC Santa Cruz, Franc successfully obtained a second postdoc at University of Michigan and will be starting a tenure track position at University of Saskatchewan in the fall.\n\n \n\nThe PI was also the lead organizer and principal funder of the Bay Area Algebraic Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry Day.  This twice yearly conference rotates between UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and UC Berkeley, and brings together researchers and students at the three universities.  Speakers have included distinguished faculty from around the world as well as local faculty, postdocs, and students.  The conference, which was envisioned and created by the PI, has been a great success and has done wonders to bring together the local number theory community in the Bay Area.\n\n \n\nFinally, we mention that together with Matthew Greenberg, the PI was one of the speakers at the 2011 Arizona Winter School.  This involved presenting a lecture series, writing 100 pages of notes that are publicly available on the internet, and leading a group of students in a project.  The course was a great success and helped the PI in his work on the Eisenstein cocycle mentioned above.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samit Dasgupta"
