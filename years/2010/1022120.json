The specific aims are to investigate the factors that control the autonomous unfolding of segments of the triple helix and to determine how these microunfolding processes affect the self-assembly of the triple helix.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of self-assembly of collagen is important from fundamental and applied points of view.  The knowledge gained will inspire and inform the design of different complex protein structures, biomimetic materials and scaffolds. Students will be exposed to research at the interface of chemistry and biology, and the research results will be integrated into course material at Hunter College which serves a diverse student population.",
