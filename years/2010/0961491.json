 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit\r\nThis is a multi-institutional research project to study the regional atmosphere-ocean interactions, and the global ramifications, that result from a more accurate treatment of the eastern boundary coastal upwelling regions of California, Peru-Chile and Benguela, their ecosystems and biogeochemistry in a fully coupled global multi-scale climate model. The novel computational development provides the ability to selectively increase the resolution of the ocean component in desired regions while keeping the two-way coupling to the atmosphere. This project will address the question of physical and biological mechanisms affecting the CO2 air-sea exchange and export in these regions and the climate variability in the present, and under future scenarios, for the selected regions from physical, ecosystem and biogeochemical perspectives. As a study of the role of continental shelves in the climate system, and by addressing known biases/deficiencies in current climate models, it will contribute to our understanding of the climate system and improve projections of climate change. By directly including a biogeochemical model, this study can begin to address climate change impacts on the ecosystems of three of the most productive oceanic regions, and the ecosystems interaction with climate\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed research has significant impacts to many communities on several levels. By studying regions that are commercially significant, this project will contribute to the knowledge that is needed for future ocean resource management. The inclusion of an ocean model (ROMS) that has been extensively used for ecosystem studies, brings the climate, biogeochemical and ecosystem communities closer together and will permit the study of the role of climate change on ecosystems including higher trophic levels all the way to human activity. The project also contributes significant technical developments to the climate modeling community. The results will lead to the availability of a regional ocean model fully embedded within a global climate model and linked to all its components, including a multi-resolution atmosphere, land surface and sea ice models. By working within the NCAR Community Climate System Model framework all the technical developments will become part of the model that is accessible to the scientific community and can benefit emerging interdisciplinary programs. This project includes the training of three post-doctoral scientists one at University of Maine and two at U.C. Santa Cruz. All the academic institutions involved have a significant track record in teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students and outreach activities. Outreach and teaching activities are also an important part of the mission at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) where regular summer colloquia (organized by the advanced studies program) educate graduate students on various aspects of the climate system and its modeling, and well-visited websites are maintained for both the scientific community and the public.",

This work presented significant technical challenges that we were able to resolve on the way to developing a generic, relocatable multi-scale climate model. \n\nMost of the effort was concentrated on implementations in the California Current System and the Benguela Current System.  However, for testing purposes we also developed an implementation in the northwest Atlantic&mdash;a western boundary current.  Furthermore, we were able to explore the role of model resolution in determining the potential role of Eastern Boundary currents (EBUS) as sources/sinks of CO2.   All the initial simulations focused on climate variability simulations, permitting us to explore the mechanisms linking boundary currents to the global climate system. \n\n \n\nSome of the salient results from our work include:\n\n \n\nThe multi-scale implementation was able to more accurately represent upwelling dynamics, improving upon the known biases in EBUS regions in climate models.\nA better representation of upwelling dynamics resulted in both local and remote effects on the climate system.\nIncreased model resolution changed the sign of the CO2 flux from a net source to a net sink.\nA comparative study between the California Current (CCS) and the Benguela Current (BCS) illustrated the different dynamics that dominate the different upwelling systems.  The details matter!\nAtmospheric resolution also has a significant role and ultimately it is a combination of ocean and atmospheric dynamics that are needed to represent each system.  Furthermore, the resolution need not be the same in different systems.\nFor the Benguela system, at low resolution (~100km or coarser), broad and strong wind stress curl leads to Sverdrup dynamics and Ekman pumping  &ndash; consequently warm horizontal advection and weak, broad upwelling, both favoring warm SST.\nIncreasing atmosphere resolution to 50km reduces wind stress curl, increases cold advection and intensifies coastal upwelling &ndash;cooling the SST. However currents and upwelling are still weak and broad when the ocean model is non-eddy resolving (~100km).\nIncreasing ocean resolution to ~7km does not improve SST when the wind forcing has strong curl. \nIncreasing ocean resolution whilst modifying the wind at the coast towards observations, and reducing curl, does lead to cooling of SST at the coast and more realistic upwelling.  (The high-resolution ocean resolves the Rossby radius, ocean coastal jet and upwelling.) \nSimilar modification to the coastal wind when using a non-eddy resolving ocean model (POP) do not give such dramatic changes.\nIncreasing ocean resolution to ~3km for a fixed, low-res atmosphere product (CORE or CAM 50km or coarser) does not improve SST.
