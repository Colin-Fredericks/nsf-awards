In spite of its widespread use and its acknowledged impact on water quality and quantity, the changes in the basic stream processes are poorly defined.  This project will collect hydrologic and meteorological data, sample and analyze stream and precipitation for O-18 and deuterium beginning August 2010, prior to the start of mining operations.  The project will also measure streamflow and chemistry at the outlet of Sycamore Creek and continually track stream stage.",
