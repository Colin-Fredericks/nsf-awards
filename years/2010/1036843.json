  "por_txt_cntn": "This report covers the 2010 - 2015 operating funds for the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF).  Resources provided under this award include the manned Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV) Alvin, the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Jason and the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry.  These assets are available for use with funded science programs utilizing the engineering and operational personnel of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\u2019s Deep Submergence Group.\n\nThe final operating schedule contained a total of 2,113 NSF assigned operating days for HOV Alvin, the ROV Jason and AUV Sentry.  There were 432 charge days for HOV Alvin, 948 charge days for the ROV Jason, and 733 charge days for the AUV Sentry.\n\nThe facility\u2019s time requested by this proposal is for direct support of the at-sea fieldwork requested by the National Science Foundation\u2019s principal investigators as well as principal investigators from ONR and NOAA.  The peer-reviewed proposals resulting in these cruises have been thoroughly evaluated for scientific and intellectual merit as an integral part of the grant review and award process.  The competitive nature of this award granting process insures a high level of intellectual merit.  The knowledge to be gained and the discoveries to be made will enhance our understanding of the oceans and our planet.  The supported operational days will provide scientists and students with the tools required to safely and productively pursue their research endeavors in the deep ocean using some of the most reliable and capable oceanographic research facilities in the world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew D Bowen"
