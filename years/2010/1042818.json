The technical meeting will be held October 4-6, 2010 at Iowa State University, Ames, IA. Approximately 20 students will present their research as part of the undergraduate and graduate paper competition during the technical meeting.  Recipients will be selected based on contributions outlined in extended abstracts and relevance to the overall theme of the technical meeting. \r\n\r\nThe Society of Engineering Science fosters and promotes the exchange of ideas and information among the researchers working in the field of mechanics that lies at the interface between engineering sciences and mathematics.  The travel support provides the financial means for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the technical meeting, participate in the student paper competitions, intermingle with leading researchers, and advance their professional and intellectual development in areas of national importance.  By encouraging participation of undergraduate and graduate students, who typically have limited financial resources for conference travel, the long range interests of NSF in broadening participation and preparation of an engaged workforce are served.  This support will be especially important for the undergraduate researchers, as it will motivate them to pursue graduate education and expose them to the state-of-art research developments.",
