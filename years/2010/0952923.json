 "awd_abstract_narration": "To answer three open questions in the field of extra-galactic astronomy Dr. Scott will lead and carry out a study of three related, but distinct, topics in this CAREER proposal. While the study of each of the topics in itself is interesting, there is extra motivation for this work in the way that the research topics overlap. Starting with an analysis and improved measurement of the extragalactic ultraviolet radiation field at high redshift, and ending with a look into the large scale environs of distant quasars, the PI and her research team are poised to answer broad questions about processes at work in the early Universe. Both ground-based and space-based telescopes will be used in this research program.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposal are centered on the development of research opportunities for the undergraduate science students at Towson University. Additional educational and outreach activities will take advantage of both an on-campus planetarium where Dr. Scott will lecture to students and the public and at an existing ProjectASTRO site in nearby Baltimore. As part of her CAREER award Dr. Scott will maintain and expand this ProjectASTRO site.",
