 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kai C. Hulzsch of Rutgers University New Brunswick is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop novel rare earth and group 4 metal based catalyst systems for the hydroamination reaction, with particular attention given to stereochemical aspects of this transformation. A key goal of this project is to identify catalysts that combine high catalytic activity and consistent high stereoselectivity for a broad range of substrates. A broad substrate screening with particular emphasis on functional group tolerance will be accompanied by mechanistic and kinetic means to elucidate the structure of reaction intermediates and develop models for the transition states. \r\nThe hydroamination reaction represents a highly valuable transformation that promises to revolutionize the synthesis of nitrogen containing molecules, with potential applications in the syntheses of nitrogen containing basic and fine chemicals, as well as pharmaceuticals, directly from petrochemical feedstock. \r\nGraduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state of the art synthetic techniques, and will be exposed to a variety of spectroscopic techniques including multidimensional NMR, and a mutual exchange program with universities in Germany will be developed to increase cultural and social exchange between US and German students.",
