 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zachariah Etienne is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Dr. Etienne will perform fully general relativistic simulations of black hole-black hole binary (BHBH) mergers in gaseous environments, as well as binary neutron star-neutron star (NSNS), black hole-neutron star (BHNS), and white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) mergers. To model these systems realistically, the PI will develop massively parallel, cutting-edge simulation software, incorporating new physics for the first time, such as realistic equations of state, radiation transport, magnetohydrodynamics, and black hole spin. NSNS and BHNS binary mergers are among the most promising candidates for powering gamma-ray bursts. Moreover, electromagnetic radiation signatures of these compact binary mergers, as well as binary black holes in gaseous environments, are potentially detectable by conventional telescopes, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, among others.\r\n\r\nDr. Etienne will also spearhead an annual seven-school lecture tour. Dr. Etienne's lectures will be prepared on two levels--one designed for general physical science classes and the other for physics and advanced-placement physics courses. The lectures will be supplemented by computer-generated movies of Dr. Etienne's compact binary merger simulations, prepared by the PI in cooperation with the Illinois numerical relativity group's Research Experience for Undergraduates visualization team. In conjunction with the UIUC Physics Illinois Partnership Program and his lecture tour, the PI will develop a website that provides an interactive, multiple \"mini-lesson\" introduction to his research for students and teachers.",
