 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program supports the collaborative efforts of Profs.  Daniel Burden and Lisa Keranen-Burden at Wheaton College to develop new methodologies for monitoring aggregated proteins and ion channels in lipid membranes by improving single-molecule fluorescence imaging techniques.  The research uses the alpha-hemolysin channel from Staphylococcus aureus as a model.  This protein has been shown to play a significant role in the virulence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.  In recent years, MRSA ?superbugs? have been plaguing hospitals and schools nationwide, causing extreme human illness, and forcing draconian measures to keep outbreaks from spreading. \r\n\r\nBeyond the immediate model target system, the work gains broad impact from the important role of lipid membrane protein channel assemblies in nervous signal transmission, intercellular communication, toxin potency, and disease states.  This highly interdisciplinary research offers extraordinary opportunities for involvement by undergraduate students, enhanced by a unique collaboration with Dr. John Kasianowicz at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Aspects of the program will be integrated into the undergraduate curriculum, including general chemistry, advanced analytical chemistry, and the general biology laboratory.",
