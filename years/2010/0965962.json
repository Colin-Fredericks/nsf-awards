 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is awarding up to 86 one-semester scholarships to academically talented but financially needy students who are working towards baccalaureate degrees in engineering and applied science.  The program is targeting first-time, first-year students, and the scholarships are supporting students through their undergraduate programs. The success and eventual graduation of the scholars is being supported not only through scholarships, but also with monthly scholar meetings.  These meetings include discussions of available university resources, field trips to local industries, seminars with speakers from industry, and workshops on career planning and development.   Each scholarship recipient is participating in one of three professional development programs:  Student Organizations of Professional Societies, Undergraduate Research, or Co-Op.  Scholars may choose different professional development programs in different years.  The goals of the project are to enhance the retention and graduation rates of students in engineering and applied sciences and to prepare these students to successfully enter professions or continue in graduate studies.\r\n\r\n",
