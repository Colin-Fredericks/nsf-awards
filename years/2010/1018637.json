 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for hosting Internet scale applications in large computing infrastructures due to their desirable features of unlimited resources and infinite scalability, pay-per-use model requiring no up-front investment, elasticity of resources, and fault-tolerance.  Since one of the primary goals of the cloud is to host data-intensive applications, large-scale data management is a crucial component. Traditional relational databases have been extremely successful but lack scalability, elasticity, fault-tolerance, and self-management features that are required in cloud settings. This has led to the emergence of a new storage model referred to as the key-value store model. Although key-value stores have the desired features, they provide minimal consistency and reduced functionality due to their single-key access guarantees thus placing unprecedented burden on application developers. This project explores two alternative scalable data stores designs in the cloud -- ElasTraS: an elastic transactional data store targeted towards enterprise applications requiring a relational storage model; and G-Store: a transactional multi-key value store targeted for applications which favor the data model of key-value stores, but require consistent and scalable access beyond single keys. This project brings forth many novel research solutions for designing and implementing scalable data management systems, and acts as a building block for developing commodity solutions dealing with the growing scale of the Internet. The project enables both graduate and undergraduate students to be trained in the design and development of software and solutions for large-scale distributed systems.

The papers reporting these systems are highly cited (source: Google  Scholar).\n\nOne of the main, long term impactful results is the fundamental lower  bound result that provides a bound on transaction latency in terms of  the round trip time communication between data centers.  The lower bound  is especially interesting as it is stated in terms of the sum of the  transaction latencies in different data centers.  This result opens the  way for designers to trade off latency delays in different data  centers depending on application demands, so for example, it is possible  for the latencies at one data center to be zero, while the other data  centers has to absorb the entire delay specified by the bound.
