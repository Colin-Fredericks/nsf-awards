 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI-R2) award is to develop a reduced-gravity simulator. Physical simulation of human activities in a reduced gravity condition on Earth is often needed not only for training astronauts but also for aerospace and biomechanics research. Simulation of a reduced gravity condition for a person requires that the person's body parts experience the forces and movements consistent with that condition. This award will enable implementation of an innovative design of a reduced-gravity simulator. Based on robotics and passive gravity compensation technologies, the simulator could offload any amount (from 0% to 100%) of the body weight of a person such that the person moving within the simulator will feel as if he/she were experiencing reduced gravity.  The equipment will provide a platform for investigating many research questions, such as how to optimize the design for best dynamic performance; how to identify the mass properties of different body parts; and how to automatically adjust the system for different individuals to achieve the desired level of gravity reduction. A fully functioning, tested, and documented prototype of the proposed simulator will be delivered.\r\n\r\nThe technology and instrumentation system developed by this project will provide a strong infrastructure at New Mexico State University to advance the current interdisciplinary research and education in aerospace science for manned space exploration and biomechanics science for better understanding of human-body dynamics. The facility could provide a new and low-cost technology for training astronauts and space travelers. It could also be used to create a human motion database including detailed body inertia properties, enhance biomedical research for neuro-rehabilitation of disabled people, and support human performance research for achieving optimal motion gaits. The research team will work with the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation to enhance higher education of Hispanic and other minority students.",
