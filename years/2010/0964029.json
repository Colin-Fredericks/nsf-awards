To ensure engineering sustainability is a focal point for long-term development. The chemical and allied industries have been working collaboratively towards solutions to these pressing issues. This has also greatly stimulated academic institutions to develop sustainable engineering-focused innovative and aggressive research and educational programs. A forum for researchers and practitioners in this area to share their research and educational experience will be highly desirable. In this regard, the Second International Symposium on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering on Sustainable Chemical Engineering is being organized and will be held in Hangzhou, China, May 9-12, 2010.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe second symposium will have the following main objectives: (i) to share knowledge and research experience in studying engineering sustainability, (ii) to assess the state-of-the-art green material, product and process engineering, (iii) to bridge the gap between research and development and strengthen the linkage between academia and industry, (iv) to discuss research directions for the chemical and allied industries to move towards sustainability and educational approaches for the integration of industrial sustainability into the chemical engineering curriculum.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe conference will (i) facilitate the exchange of knowledge between US researchers and educators with those in over 10 countries, and (ii) help the US delegates identify international collaboration opportunities in the research and education of sustainable chemical engineering. Junior faculty and researchers as well as graduate/undergraduate students, especially members of underrepresented groups will be encouraged to participate in the symposium, which will include two mini-workshops for catalyzing international collaborations on sustainable chemical engineering research and education.",
