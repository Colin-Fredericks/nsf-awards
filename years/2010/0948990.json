 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to further develop a panel of multicolor oligonucleotide fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for performing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and detecting aneuploidies in eggs used for in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols.   The use of oligonucleotides offers advantages such as enhanced specificity and sensitivity, shorter hybridization times as well as a reduction in manufacturing cost when compared to currently available genomic DNA derived probes.  The panel that the company plans to develop will cover 8 chromosomes known to be particularly susceptible to deletions and rearrangements and would allow simultaneous detection of any abnormalities that may be associated with them.\r\n\r\nThe development of a panel of probes for the detection of genetic abnormalities in preimplantation embryos will increase the success rate of IVF procedures and thus reduce the financial and emotional cost associated with them.  Moreover, use of the proposed labeling method can be useful in a variety of areas outside of PGD, including basic research, clinical diagnostics and cytogenetic testing.  \r\n",
