 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nResearchers at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California received an MRI-R2 award to provide support for the purchase of an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system, a NanoDrop 2200c spectrophotometer, a Beckman Allegra-25R benchtop refrigerated centrifuge, and a Beckman DTX 880 multimode detector and workstation. The instrumentation greatly improves research and training capabilities and enables the current biology faculty to undertake new research projects. Research areas include microbial ecology, animal physiology, and plant biology. Acquisition of state-of-the art instrumentation is key to maintaining and enhancing the high quality of science research and education. In addition to the use of the proposed instrumentation by students conducting independent research projects, this equipment will also be made available to students in advanced Biology courses taught by the PIs, including Microbial Diversity, Symbiosis, Plant Form and Function, Plant Physiological Ecology, and Vertebrate Physiology. These include students majoring in Biology, Biochemistry, Kinesiology, Cognitive Science and Psychobiology. Occidental College is a research- intensive learning environment, with goals that complement the goals of the MRI program - to increase access to, and improve the quality of, shared scientific instruments for faculty research and research training of future scientists.  Data and findings from research enabled by these instruments will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented by students and faculty at regional and national meetings.",
