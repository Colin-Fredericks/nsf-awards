 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for a workshop on Emerging Applications and Future Directions of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to be held at University of Akron in Akron, Ohio from September 1st through 3rd, 2010.  The workshop will start with a two-day short course for students, researchers and engineers on the BEM formulations, solution techniques, Green's functions, symmetric Galerkin approaches, and fast methods for solving the BEM equations. Following the short course, a one-day symposium will focus on discussions of emerging applications and future directions of the BEM. Six invited speakers who are leading researchers in the world will open the topics and lead discussions on various important directions in the BEM. Scholarships will be given to 15 students from US universities to support their participation in this workshop. A competition of poster presentations for students will be held and a review article will be prepared based on the discussions during this workshop. \r\n\r\nRapid developments of the BEM in the last decade have significantly broadened its applications. There is an apparent need for training students, researchers and engineers, especially those in the US, on the recent developments in the BEM, to help further advance the BEM research and applications. This workshop will bring leading researchers together to discuss the emerging applications and debate the future directions of the BEM, help train a new generation of undergraduate and graduate students who will be interested and motivated in conducting research in the BEM and in computational science and engineering in general.",
