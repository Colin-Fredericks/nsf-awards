 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nFounded as an Institute within the University of Puerto Rico in 1967 by the renowned neuroscientist Jos\u00e9 del Castillo, the Institute of Neurobiology (INB) was established with the goal of using simple organisms to understand neural structure and function. UPR is a major minority-serving institution, and the INB graduate student population is predominantly Hispanic. The focus on Poikliothermic model systems holds new significance in furthering the understanding of the impact of climate change (seawater temperature, salinity, etc.) on ecosystems. The institution is focusing on simple organisms, and common interests such as neural plasticity, temperature adaptation, and signaling molecules. Funds are provided to correct significant deficiencies including 1) an antiquated air conditioning system and 2) an obsolete network cyberinfrastructure. The rejuvenation of the INB will significantly improve ongoing and planned research opportunities and create new opportunities for collaborative research. The renovations will have immediate broader impacts including: 1) significant benefit to the minority student body served by the University of Puerto Rico; 2) an innovative approach to \"ecological neurobiology\" that will provide the first wave of researchers equipped to deal with the emerging and important issues of global climate change; 3) the establishment of a Neurobiology Education Center that will serve to educate teachers, children and the public about the study of neuroscience, and the special relevance of these studies to Puerto Rico's tropical ecosystem.",
