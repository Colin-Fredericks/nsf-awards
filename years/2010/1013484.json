 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of healing wounds to the surface of the eye with a novel biomaterial.  This biomaterial resembles a contact lens and initial animal studies show that when placed on a wounded eye it acts as a regenerative bandage that stimulates healing while simultaneously absorbing naturally over time.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are significant to the Americans that suffer from ocular surface wounds and fear loss of eyesight.  A wounded eye can cause extreme pain, swelling, blurred vision, and even vision loss.  Such wounds are commonly associated with house hold injuries such as chemical burns from cleaning agents, traumatic impact from items such as falling objects, or removal of a contact lens that has been left in too long.  Furthermore, infections and diseases can cause corneal injury.  This regenerative bandage could treat these patients with a non-invasive and less expensive procedure that saves millions to the American health care system.",
