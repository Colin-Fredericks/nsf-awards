The meeting features invited talks by leading researchers, as well as formal directed discussion sessions and a session of presentations contributed by junior participants.\r\n\r\nThe workshop brings together mathematicians, computational chemists, computational materials scientists, and experimentalists to facilitate research progress in areas that address the pressing need for a more efficient energy infrastructure to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  Funding is directed to ensure broad participation by students, postdocs, junior faculty, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2010/404/info.php3?wsid=404",
