 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on Learning Through Service (LTS), a pedagogical method that combines academic learning with service. Engaging investigators from five diverse institutions, the project is invoking a 4D Process (Discover, Distill, Design, Disseminate) to evaluate the impacts on faculty currently engaged in LTS efforts and to empower additional faculty to implement LTS.  Major activities that are being undertaken include surveying and interviewing engaged faculty; convening  a meeting of experts in LTS program/course designs, implementations, and assessments; conducting intensive faculty training workshops on LTS that lead to new LTS efforts at course and program levels; and sustaining faculty engagement via a continued dissemination of efforts.  Assessment research methodologies (development and use) are being integrated throughout these activities. The project engages faculty through systemic implementation and support for LTS in engineering education. The project expands the use of LTS in engineering education and highlight LTS as a viable research endeavor and scholarly activity. The project identifies challenges and facilitators to LTS for different faculty and institution types.",

Nineteen participants were invited.  The Colorado workshop was a refined version of the Michigan Tech workshop (with the above noted decrease in worksheet time and increase in poster session time).\n\n \n\nThe third workshop was hosted by Purdue University, June 18-20, 2014 immediately following the ASEE Annual Conference in Indianapolis. We were able to invite 71 participants. The Purdue workshop,..."
