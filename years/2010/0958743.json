Maney\r\nHofstra University\r\n\r\nThis project compares two cases of ethno-nationalist contention (patterns of action and reaction between authorities, challengers, and their opponents):  the early stages of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the first Palestinian Intifada. The investigators identify: (1) distinct effects upon contention of different types of media outlets; (2) types of coverage that promote escalation or de-escalation of political violence; (3) contextual factors influencing coverage, and (4) ways that interpretive disputes may contribute to conflict. The investigators link qualitative data on event coverage by multiple media sources with quantitative data on levels, forms, agents, and targets of contention. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  This study advances the fields of peace and conflict, social movements, and political communication. Theoretically, it develops a framework that specifies the relationship between media coverage and contention. Methodologically, it assesses hypotheses in an innovative way that is nuanced (investigating possible contrasting roles played by different types of media outlets), comparative (examining coverage across two political contexts), longitudinal (accounting for different stages of contention), and interactive (inclusive of multiple actors). By analyzing the distinct effects of different types of media coverage across political contexts, the results will assist policy makers, journalists, and activists in recognizing when and how their framing of political events impacts the dynamics of contention.",
