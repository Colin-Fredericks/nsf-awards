 "awd_abstract_narration": "The probabilistic method is a powerful tool to establish the existence\r\nof diverse objects of importance in several applications. For example,\r\nShannon's famous theorem asserts that a random codebook can be used\r\nfor reliably transmitting information at optimal rates on a noisy\r\nchannel. It is well known that a random graph is typically \"Ramsey\"\r\nand has no large clique or independent set, and a random sparse graph\r\nis very likely to be an expander with excellent connectivity.  Yet, in\r\napplications it is important to explicitly construct such an object\r\nwith a certified guarantee of the desired property. Obtaining such\r\nconstructions of comparable strength to what is guaranteed by the\r\nprobabilistic method is typically much harder and often unknown.\r\n\r\nPseudorandomness is a broad area that deals with efficiently\r\ngenerating objects that exhibit the desirable properties of\r\n\"random-like\" objects despite being constructed either explicitly or\r\nwith limited randomness. Such pseudorandom constructions are important\r\nin the study of error-correcting codes, complexity theory,\r\ncombinatorics, cryptography, and high-dimensional geometry. Research\r\nin recent years has addressed some of these challenges and led to\r\npowerful constructions of error-correcting codes, expander graphs,\r\nrandomness extractors, Ramsey graphs, compressed sensing matrices,\r\netc. Despite the seemingly different definitions and motivations for\r\nthe study of these objects, much of this progress was based on\r\ninsights uncovering intimate connections between them, leading to a\r\nrich theory with a common pool of broadly useful techniques.\r\n\r\nThis progress notwithstanding, explicit constructions with optimal\r\nparameters typically remain open, and the area is full of exciting new\r\ndirections motivated by emerging applications. This project will\r\ninvolve a comprehensive collection of interconnected research\r\nactivities focusing on the theory of error-correcting codes and\r\npseudorandomness. The directions pursued will include strengthening\r\nthe existing connections between various pseudorandom constructs and\r\ndiscovering new computational applications thereof, and investigating\r\nthe pseudorandom properties of codes and related objects that have\r\nimportant structural characteristics often needed in applications\r\n(such as linearity or sparsity). Topics in coding theory inspired by\r\ncomplexity theory such as list decoding and locally testable codes,\r\nand codes for poorly understood noise models such as deletion channels\r\nwill be studied.  Another important goal of the project is to bridge\r\nthe gap between worst-case and probabilistic noise models via codes\r\nfor channels with natural computational restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe research will use ideas from computer science in setting new\r\ndirections for research in coding theory as well as discovering new\r\nconstructions of codes and decoding algorithms, thereby enhancing the\r\nconnection between the computer science and information theory\r\ncommunities.  The discovery of new coding schemes has potential direct\r\napplications in communication and storage of data. Many of the\r\nquestions to be addressed, therefore, have a natural practical\r\nconnection alongside their fundamental theoretical appeal.  On the\r\neducation front, the project will engage several graduate students and\r\nprovide a stimulating research environment for them, and help with the\r\nplanned writing of a \"goal-oriented\" textbook on coding theory.",
