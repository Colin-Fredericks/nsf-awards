Does the influence of norms or socioeconomic conditions vary by gender? What are the mechanisms through which norms shape migration? The researcher will address these questions through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data from the Gender and Generations Survey and the National Household Survey, both conducted in Georgia in 2006, will identify the predictors of migration in national samples and determine if there are gender differences. Qualitative data from interviews with returned migrants and family members of migrants in two regions of Georgia will provide insight into the potential motivations for migration and the gendered nature of migration experiences. The economic and political conditions that motivate migration such as individual human capital, household socioeconomic status, social networks, state policies, and labor market demands are well documented, particularly in Latin America and Asia. Research on social norms and migration is less extensive, but demonstrates that norms can facilitate or discourage migration. Understanding the joint influence of norms and socioeconomic conditions is particularly important to understanding women's migration, because women are most likely to face conflict between economic conditions that encourage migration and social norms that discourage it. Examining social norms and migration in Georgia can expand existing migration theories, particularly those related to gender. The Georgian context of strong patriarchal norms coupled with high levels of human capital and labor market experience among women makes it an interesting case to explore the influence of norms and socioeconomic conditions on migration. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an analysis of the selectivity of migration from Georgia, which will be beneficial to policymakers looking to take advantage of the development potential of migration. Findings from this research will be disseminated broadly to the academic community via professional conferences and publications, and shared with colleagues in the academic and migration communities in Georgia.",

Previous research highlights the cultural patterns and social norms that influence migration, and these cultural aspects of migration are highly gendered. Both men and women participate in the process of migration, but they experience it in very different ways. While migration can be seen as acceptable or even desirable for young men, migration is often viewed much more negatively among women, because it comes into conflict with traditional female domestic responsibilities. The literature on gendered aspects of migration has remained largely separate from the larger body of literature on the political, social, and economic conditions that influence migration, leaving questions of how gender norms in origin countries might interact with other factors to shape migration processes.</p>\n<p>To investigate the factors that influence migration processes in Georgia, we use a combination of survey and interview data. We analyze data from three existing household surveys in Georgia: 1) The 2007 Caucasus Barometer; 2) The 2008 Development on the Move: Measuring and Optimizing Migration&rsquo;s Economic and Social Impacts in Georgia (DOTM) survey, and 3) A 2008 migration survey conducted by Georgia&rsquo;s national statistical department (GeoStat). In addition to the survey analysis, in the summer of 2010 we conducted 34 in-depth, semi structured interviews with former migrants and family members of current migrants in two Georgian cities, as well as 15 interviews with government officials, researchers, journalists and NGO workers in the capital city. Georgia provides a particularly interesting place to explore gender and migration because the Georgian context combines strong traditional gender norms with high levels of education and labor market experience among women. The emergence of large scale women&rsquo;s labor migration is fairly recent, but today both men and women in Georgia migrate to a wide variety of different countries.
