The PSID is a longitudinal study of a representative sample of US individuals and the family units in which they reside.

SPECIFIC GOALS OF PROJECT\n\nThe percentage of Americans who volunteer to support community organizations and the number of hours they spend is foundational information for the voluntary sector. Policymakers, nonprofit organizations, and scholars all use accurate findings about volunteering to inform and strengthen their work. However, since Independent Sector ceased annual surveys in the 1990s, regular national estimates of volunteering and giving behavior have not been produced. Additionally, the lack of consistent, longitudinal volunteering data inhibits any rigorous evaluation of the relationship between public policy changes and volunteering rates.\n\n \n\nThe main goal of the project is to collect information on volunteering from approximately 9,123 families of the 2011 longitudinal sample of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). A 1.5 minute question module on volunteering will be administered. \n\n \n\nThe PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families that began in 1968.  With primary sponsorship from NSF for data collected on the same families and their descendents, the PSID can justly be considered a cornerstone of the data infrastructure for empirically based social science research in the U.S. Carrying out the aims proposed here by collecting information from these families who have participated in the PSID is advantageous for the following reasons.  First, a high annual continuation rate is critical to the success of a long panel study such as the PSID.  In recent waves, the study has achieved unprecedented wave-to-wave response rates in the range of 96-98% which is of critical importance to maintaining the national representativeness of the sample and response rate.\n\n \n\n2.
