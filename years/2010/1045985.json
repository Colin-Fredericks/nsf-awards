 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current approaches to predicting changes in community structure and function fail to consider relationships between species' attributes that affect their ecological function, genetic variation underlying those functional traits, and the dynamics of the communities of which they are part. This project will focus on Protea and Pelargonium, two South African plant genera that have undergone dramatic diversification and currently span two biodiversity hot spots, the fynbos and succulent karoo biomes in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GFCR). This project will develop an understanding of functional trait variation in both genetic and evolutionary contexts, allowing predictions of the characteristics of communities in which they occur and the resilience of those communities to climate change. The project will examine detailed relationships between functional traits, photosynthesis, water use efficiency and leaf life span, including the genetic basis of trait variation and rates of trait diversification. This information will be used to examine effects of taxonomic and trait diversity on ecosystem resilience in response to fire cycle interval.\r\n\r\nThe project will expose postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduates and high school students to international research, including students actively recruited from underserved populations both in the US and South Africa. It will actively enhance conservation infrastructure by working closely in all aspects of the project with the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) to promote biodiversity science, policy and conservation action.",

In this project, we aimed to describe this high plant diversity across a range of levels, from the genetic diversity of local populations of particular species, to the responses of populations and species to drought and temperature stress, up to the response of the whole vegetation of the region to fire disturbance.</p>\n<p>We focused primarily one of the main plant groups that make this region so diverse, Protea shrubs, which have large, showy flowerheads often used in flower arrangements. We also collaborated with researchers at UConn to support their studies of Pelargoniums (smaller, woody and herbaceous plants including many &ldquo;geranium&rdquo; houseplants, with a wide range of flower types, colors and leaf scents). &nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Linking genes to traits and drought vulnerability in a widespread protea species </em></p>\n<p>To learn about how genetic factors and plant responses to stress vary across the region, we focused on measuring specific characteristics of the plants that are known to affect their growth and survival &ndash; functional traits. We found that these traits were often variable within a single species in different environments. To assess whether these differences are based on genetic differences among these different parts of the species range, we collected seeds of focal species <em>Protea repens</em> from 20 different sites around the region and grew plants from all these seed sources in a single experiment at Kirstenbosch botanical garden. By measuring plants in this common environment, we found that plants from distinct environments have different traits, including leaf shape and growth rates. To see which particular groups of genes are related to this trait variation, we used new laboratory methods and high-output next-generation sequencers to profile the expression levels (how active each gene is) of &gt;10,000 genes of plants from different environments. We found that gene pathways related to plant growth were more active in plants from warmer sites, and identified genes apparently related to growth and leaf traits.</p>\n<p>To follow up on these results, we also did a &ldquo;stress test&rdquo; in the greenhouse on plants from different source environments. We again grew plants from different source environments, but this time dried them down or heated them up until many died of drought stress. We found that in general, plants from warmer areas could adjust more strongly to stress (had higher plasticity) and also performed better. We found several stress-related genes that responded differently in plants from warmer environments, potentially contributing to their plasticity and survival. We have begun sequencing the genome of <em>Protea repens</em> to support further work.</p>\n<p><em>Protea population dynamics</em></p>\n<p>Since <em>Protea repens </em>is a major species in the vegetation, with many birds and insects that use it for food and habitat, it is important to be able to forecast where it will persist in the future. By combining field data from over 50 areas in its range, we related its performance (growth, survival, seed production) to climatic and soil conditions across the region. We used these relationships to predict population persistence for locations across the region. The models did a reasonable job of where the species currently occurs. Further, we identified adult mortality as a particularly important factor in the persistence of the species, especially in drier areas.</p>\n<p><em>Postfire regeneration in fynbos shrublands</em></p>\n<p>We used data on the greenness of vegetation measured every ~2 weeks since 2000 by NASA&rsquo;s MODIS satellites to study how South African fynbos shrubland vegetation responds to wildfire, which occurs frequently in this region. This allowed us to relate how fast different areas regenerate after fire to environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall and soil type. The analysis showed that warmer winter temperatures are associated with faster regrowth after wildfire. But the rate of recovery also depends on having enough moisture, especially in warmer months, so that in the driest interior parts of the region with rainfall that falls exclusively in winter, future projected climatic changes may drive a shift from shrubland to karroo desert vegetation.</p>\n<p><em>Education and outreach</em></p>\n<p>This project supported professional development of a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and two recent college graduates.
