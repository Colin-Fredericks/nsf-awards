The instrument will enhance instrumentation and research capabilities useable by multiple programs and interdisciplinary researchers at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. The following is a list of immediate projects that will utilize the instrument: 1) Optical Properties of Reef Inhabitants for Determination of Bleaching Resistance in Coral Species; 2) Correlation of satellite data and optical properties of coral reefs to determine global environmental effects on coral decline; 3) Determination of optical properties of breast cancer cells following treatment with mammalian cardenolides; 4) Comparison of optical properties of cancerous cell lines and perturbations; 5) Optical properties of nanoparticles, and correlation to size and concentration: basic research to determine biomedical and environmental impacts; 6) Hyperspectral investigation of optical properties of materials (1D) and structures (2D); and 7) Research Training of underrepresented groups.",
