  "por_txt_cntn": "\nICAPS-10 Doctoral Consortium Travel Awards\n\nDaniel L. Bryce\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes\n\nThis project supported nine doctoral students from US universities to attend the Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS), held in Toronto, Canada on May 13, 2010.  The event included a total of twenty-five students from around the world, including those from US institutions.  The funds enabled the students, which would have otherwise had financial difficulty, to attend the DC.\n\n \n\nThe objective of the annual DC is to provide a forum where doctoral students, in any phase of their training, can receive career and research advice from peers and mentors, present preliminary results and plans for their dissertations, and build professional relationships. A popular component of past ICAPS DCs, that was included, is the formation of several small focus groups where students and assigned mentors meet to discuss each student\u00c6s dissertation topic. To broaden their feedback, students also prepared posters that they presented during a social event open to the entire ICAPS conference. To support career development, two invited speakers addressed the students:  Derek Long of the University of Strathclyde (UK) spoke on \"How to keep your advisor on a tight leash\" and Wheeler Ruml of the University of New Hampshire spoke on \"Job Hunting\".  The organizers also arranged a group through LinkedIn to enable extended interactions between the participants.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe intellectual merit of the activity was to contribute to the professional development of young researchers through interaction with senior researchers in their field and to make connections with their peers that should support their future careers.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe broader impacts of the project were to help disseminate and shape the research of young scientists in the field of automated planning and scheduling, as well as improve the student retention within the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Bryce"
