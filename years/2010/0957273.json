 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Skeel of Purdue University and Klaus Schulten from University of Illinois Urbana-Champain have received a collaborative award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods. The project focuses on the creation, analysis, and implementation of methods of broad applicability for calculating pairwise interatomic interactions in atomistic computer simulations with applications in chemistry, physics, and materials science.\r\n\r\nAtomistic simulations of macromolecules, biomolecules, nano-systems, and condensed phases of atomic or molecular systems require vast amounts of computer time. Typically, the bulk of this time is spent on calculating pairwise interactions between particles. The calculation of pairwise interactions is done either directly or with standard tools like the fast multipole method or the particle-mesh Ewald sums. This proposal will investigate the advantages of a less well known O(N) algorithm, the multilevel summation method (MSM). This algorithm has the potential of becoming very useful for approaches such as molecular dynamics. The project will explore creative implementations involving mathematical techniques for improving the software and exploring implementation in emerging hardware like GPUs. It is the objective of the proposal to study the efficiency and scalability of MSM as applied to several interdisciplinary  molecular dynamics problems, to analyze the implication of approximations both theoretically and experimentally, and to implement and disseminate the results.\r\n\r\nThe project provides an opportunity for graduate students to engage in high-impact interdisciplinary research. Open source implementations of the algorithms as libraries of modules will be made available. The software modules will also be embedded in simulation software such as NAMD. Molecular dynamics has applications beyond chemistry, and N-body solvers have applications outside of molecular dynamics. Better methods and software in the hands of scientists will enable chemical and biomolecular simulations of much larger systems with improved accuracy, and this will result in benefits to society. The impact will be broad.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Computer simulation enables scientists to investigate the biological processes inside of cells, providing an atomic scale view of the structure and function of the physical machinery that constitutes our life and health.  These simulations can require weeks running on the world's largest computers.  One of the most time-consuming parts of these simulations is to calculate forces between all pairs of atoms, a calculation that needs to be performed repeatedly, as many as a billion times for a single simulation.  This NSF project has been to develop a new and faster method for the calculation of these pairwise forces, called the multilevel summation method.\n \nThe multilevel summation method combines some of the best advantages of the other more widely known approaches.  The method calculates forces that are continuous with respect to the positions of the atoms, which produces good quality results over long simulations.  The manner in which the method sums its results is well suited to modern computer hardware and allows more effective use of large parallel supercomputers.  The software that we have developed for this method has been benchmarked on the new Blue Waters supercomputer at the University of Illinois.  The benchmarks show parallel scaling that matches the currently used approach and, in some cases, gives better overall performance.  Continued development of the method is expected to produce further gains in performance, enabling more efficient software tools for scientific studies.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Klaus J Schulten"
