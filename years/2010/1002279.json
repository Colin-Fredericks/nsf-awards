 "awd_abstract_narration": "GOALI: Semi-Packed Gas Separation Columns with Monolayer-Protected Gold Phases\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to introduce a new architecture for GC columns named semi-packed and a new method for stationary phase coating. The approach is to use MEMS technology for the fabrication of semi-packed columns and to utilize nanotechnology to uniformly functionalize the column surfaces.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed semi-packed columns consist of a microfluidic channel with an embedded array of ordered pillars (posts). These new columns, which do not have any conventional counterpart, offer both higher sample capacities and higher separation efficiencies. Four specific goals are proposed: 1) fabricating semi-packed columns with on-chip heaters and temperature sensors, 2) depositing functionalized gold nanoparticles or gold thin films on all surfaces of the MEMS-based columns with nanometer resolutions, 3) evaluation of the performance of MEMS columns with their monolayer-protected gold phases, and 4) coating the MEMS columns with commercial phases under industrial conditions to analyze their performance against those coated with proposed stationary phases. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The outcome of this project will set an outstanding example of how MEMS and Nanotechnology can become highly complementary methodologies to develop low-cost, low-power, high-performance microdevices. This research will also advance discovery while promoting teaching and learning through research opportunities for undergraduates, recruiting of graduate students into a highly interdisciplinary research program, incorporation of the project results in the courses taught by the PIs in different departments/institutions, and annual joint seminars by Virginia Tech, College of William and Mary, and Restek Corporation on micro gas chromatography and novel stationary phases.",
