 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an effort to understand the properties of pulsating neutron stars across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The research team will create a population synthesis code that will be used to characterize the sample of neutron stars detected by the Fermi satellite and in other surveys.   The codes will incorporate treatments of the acceleration/emission geometry, operating radiation mechanisms and population characteristics.  The principal goal of this coding effort is to determine how the geometries of the radio and gamma-ray emission are defined and how they evolve with the age of the pulsar.\r\n\r\nThe project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.   Undergraduates from Hope College will engage in collaborative visits at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and make presentations at meetings.  The team also outlines plans for outreach and public education.  In addition, they will make their codes available to the community via a website that will facilitate comparison between their work and that of other groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNASA\u00c6s new flagship in gamma-ray astronomy, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (Fermi) launched in June 2008, has already dramatically refined and redefined our understanding of gamma-ray emission from the neutron stars known as pulsars.  Since its launch, Fermi\u00c6s Large Area Telescope (LAT) has discovered over 160 new gamma-ray pulsars.  The group of pulsars within the second pulsar catalogue divides into three essentially equal subgroups with 40 gamma-ray millisecond pulsars (MSP), 42 radio-loud and 35 radio-quiet young, gamma-ray normal pulsars (NP).  As of November 6, 2014, there are now 161 publicly-announced, gamma-ray pulsars.  The group of MSPs is growing the fastest with now over 70 members.\n\nUnderstanding the acceleration/emission geometry, operating radiation mechanisms and population characteristics were core objectives for pulsar science in this project.  The observational findings of Fermi suggest that pulsar gamma rays emerge from regions located at high altitudes in the pulsar magnetosphere have ruled out high-energy models that invoke polar cap emission near the stellar surface.  A series of high-energy emission models was tested with population synthesis study of NPs and MSPs.  These included various theoretically motivated high-energy models, which include the beam geometry as well as the luminosity of the high-energy radiation.  These models were also implemented in various studies to fit both radio and gamma-ray light curves.\n\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques were implemented in the computer code to maximize the likelihood of the model description of the data to better constrain the parameter space governing the distributions.  Currently for MSPs, these MCMC population syntheses have provided regions of confidence in the model parameter space.  General outcomes of these studies have suggested that similar agreement is achieved within the framework of the various tested high-energy models, in some sense agreeing with the studies of radio and gamma-ray light curves that a single model cannot fit all pulsar profiles suggesting that either various high-energy mechanisms within these models operate concurrently in pulsar magnetosphere or a more realistic pulsar magnetospheric description of the high-energy emission is required.  These studies have lead to broader impacts that have motivated improved efforts in order to increase our understanding of high-energy processes in pulsar magnetospheres.  Recently, great theoretical advances have been made in this regard and call for a new series of tests.\n\nA synergistic component of the program encapsulated a new formulation of the magnetic Compton scattering cross section, which correctly treats spin-dependent effects at the cyclotron resonance.  The case for scattering of relativistic electrons was completed with useful analytic formulae disseminated for the astrophysics community.  This effort tackled the correct formulation of Compton scattering cross section by implementing appropriate lepton wave functions that treat correctly the spin-dependence of the lifetime of the excited intermediate virtual states of the scattering event.  Significant differences in the cross section were highlighted in the study when compared to the cross section when the spin-dependence is neglected.  Broader impacts of this study encourage improvements of the physics being applied to a magnetic Compton upscattering models for the phase-resolved, steep X-ray spectra detected by the Chandra, XMM and RXTE observatories, in the class of high-field pulsars known as magnetars, constituted by Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters.\n\nBesides the science goals, the primary broader impacts of this project focused on the education of undergraduate students by providing an environment that enhances their knowledge and skills.  The project incorporated one to three undergraduates during the summers as well as during the academic semesters in the pursuit of the edges of knowl..."
