Thirty-one Noyce Scholars are participating in a year long Master of Arts in Teaching program designed to prepare them to effectively teach culturally, linguistically, and socio-economically diverse learners. They are participating in a common core of education courses and disciplinary-specific pedagogical courses designed to help them translate their subject matter knowledge into effective practices for teaching and encouraging students in grades 6 - 12 to excel in the areas of mathematics or the sciences. The program offers both course related and non-course related experiences to engage these scholars in a professional learning community and to provide ongoing support throughout the program and during their first two years as classroom teachers.",
