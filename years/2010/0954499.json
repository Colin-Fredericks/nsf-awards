The method will use distributed temperature sensing technology by relating the heat pulse induced thermal response of a buried fiber optic cable to the soil water potential.  Three-dimensional, variably-saturated groundwater flow modeling will be performed to extend in space and time already extensive field data so that hydrologic niches can be estimated for past climatic conditions.   Using this knowledge, a coupled vegetation and hydrologic modeling framework will be created to enable quantitative prediction of the vegetation composition and patterning and hydrologic feedbacks that would result from potential restoration strategies.  With the models produced in this study, the extent to which desired vegetation can be re-established by restoration activities will be able to be predicted during the design phase of projects and a set of guidelines will be created for restoration practitioners of the region.  The project has broader impacts related to both improving the practice of river restoration and providing context-based educational opportunities to middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  This award is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability program in ENG and the Hydrologic Sciences program in GEO.",

We observed that the intended shift to wetter hydrologic conditions and establishment of target wetland species occurred with a spatially uneven and unintentional distribution.  To understand why patterns like this occur, we developed an innovative system for continuous monitoring of soil moisture along transects to relate moisture regimes to the presence or absence of vegetation types and species.  This distributed soil moisture sensing system consisted of commercially- available distributed temperature sensing systems that monitor temperature at high temporal frequency (seconds) and fine spatial resolution (meters) along fiber optic cables which we bundled with heating elements and buried underground.  When we initiated a heat pulse along the cable, the temperature rise that occurred was dependent upon the moisture of the soil surrounding the cable. We used this signal to estimate soil moisture along the length of the transect.  By collecting co-located groundwater, soil moisture, and vegetation composition measurements, we were able to develop quantitative relationships to describe the hydrologic conditions that are needed to support key wetland species.  We then developed hydrologic models of the system that predicted where hydrologic conditions would provide suitable habitat for individual species.  We found that upwelling groundwater was critical for supporting the targeted wet prairie and sedge meadow species, but low permeability clay layers prevented groundwater from reaching the plant roots in some areas.

Such knowledge of how groundwater, soil moisture, and plant growth interact can support efforts to restore desired vegetation species and create a highly biodiverse mosaic of vegetation patches capable of providing many of the desired ecosystem services. \n\n            The modeling tool we developed provides practitioners with a framework for better anticipating the outcome of riparian and wetland restoration projects and a scientific basis for designing restoration projects that maximize the desired outcomes.  Throughout this project we worked directly with the organizations performing restoration in the region, specifically the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and The Nature Conservancy, to ensure that our findings were translated into practice quickly.  In addition, we worked with local middle school teachers and classes to develop and lead field trips to stream restoration sites, which taught students about hydrology and ecology in a local, outdoor setting and facilitated a more meaningful and long-lasting educational experience.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted..."
