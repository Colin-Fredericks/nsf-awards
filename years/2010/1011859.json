 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professors Maria Ngu-Schwemlein, John Merle, and Sayo Fakayode at Winston-Salem State University to carry out fundamental studies on the rational design and synthesis of peptide derived binding agents for the toxic mercury(II) ion.  Evaluating the mercury(II) binding affinity of some cysteine-containing peptides will reveal the selectivity and thermodynamic factors that are important in assessing their mode(s) of interaction.  Correlations between the chemical structures of some cysteinyl peptide ligands and their binding activity for mercury(II) will be explored by microcalorimetric measurements, and identification of the binding specificity will be conducted by a combination of theoretical calculations and solid state studies.  Additionally, the molecular interactions of these compounds with some biological molecules will be monitored by spectroscopic measurements.  Selective and effective mercury(II) binding agents are extremely useful for the development of mercury(II) trapping agents for chelation therapy of mercury poisoning.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research study will enhance the research environment of the chemistry department at Winston-Salem State University in preparing undergraduates, primarily underrepresented groups at this historically black institution, for entry into advanced degree programs and careers in science.  This research may also afford a basis for subsequent research in the environmental and health sciences such as the development of microsensors for monitoring toxic and harmful metal ions in environmental and biological samples.  Additionally, this research may provide useful peptides for future application in genetically engineered plants that are useful for phytoremediation of mercury(II) pollution in soil or watersheds.",

The long-term goal of this project is to design effective peptide-derived chelating agents for mercury(II).  Current clinical chelation therapy of mercury poisoning generally uses thiol compounds such as dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), dimercaptopropane-sulfonic acid (DMPS).  However, these compounds are not well-optimized molecules for mercury chelation therapy.  Exploring the significance of cysteinyl-peptide ligands and some of their analogues as selective mercury(II) chelating agents will provide valuable information for the development of mercury chelation therapy agents and the development of microsensors for monitoring toxic and harmful metal ions in environmental and biological samples.  Moreover, cysteinyl -peptides could also be explored subsequently for the possibility of using recombinant DNA technology to encode peptide analogues in transgenic plants for phytoremediation. \n\nOur work on cysteinyl-peptides identified dicysteinyl tripeptides as effective mercury(II) chelating agents and they are promising motifs for the design of multi-cysteinyl peptides for effective mercury ion sequestering.  Our subsequent studies confirmed that multi-cysteinyl peptides present an attractive option for mercury chelation or environmental heavy metal remediation.  Our work also demonstrate that the number of mercury(II) associated with each cysteinyl peptide can be determined by using high resolution ESI mass spectrometry based on distinct mercury isotopic distribution patterns.\n\nWe have investigated the binding affinities and associated thermodynamic parameters of the association of mercury(II) and various cysteiny-peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry.  We found that small peptide with one cysteine show two sequential binding for mercury (II). Their stability constants for the first binding are largely due to favorable contribution of the enthalpy term to the free energy of complexation.  As more mercury (II) ions are added, this enthalpy contribution decreases and the free energy of the second binding is partially compensated by the entropy term.  As the one cysteine containing peptide increases in size, the binding decreases.  However, binding can be improved by increasing the number of thiol S-donor groups in the tripeptide.\n\nWe also investigated peptide containing two cysteine residues for mercury ion binding.  We found that they can serve as effective \u00e6\u00e6double anchors\u00c6\u00c6 to accommodate mercury(II) to form predominantly one-to-one Hg(peptide) associations.  Di-cysteinyl peptide linked by less flexible linkers also forms two-to-two associations.  Generally, these peptide&ndash;mercury complexes potentially form highly ordered structures.  The results from this study show that dicysteinyl tripeptides are effective in binding mercury(II) and they are promising motifs for the design of multi-cysteinyl peptides for binding more than one mercury(II) ion per peptide.  Our subsequent studies show that multi-cysteinyl peptides consisting of three or four cysteinyl groups exhibit enhanced binding efficiency for mercury(II) by binding more than one mercury per peptide.  These structurally larger mercury(II) and cysteinyl peptide complexes could better evade transport into brain cells via amino acid transporters and could be better alternatives to the current clinical agents for mercury chelation therapy.\n\nOur work also demonstrates that an accurate stoichiometry of mercury and peptide in the complexes formed under specified electrospray ionization conditions can be determined by using high-resolution mass spectrometry based on distinct mercury isotopic distribution patterns.  It could be especially useful for analyzing complexes formed by other metal ions that can exist in different isotopic forms.\n\nOur results suggest peptides containin..."
