 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will advance the field of \"energy harvesting\" by creating a low profile, high-energy electromagnetic device at a low manufacturing cost point.  The concept is a multi-pole energy generator to convert mechanical energy from vibrations into electrical energy for use in wireless sensor applications (lighting, smart phones, digital cameras).  It will replace or supplement battery power in these kinds of units.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project will be the reduction of the use of standard batteries currently being used.  This will result in less hazardous waste, longer-lived devices, and, possibly, conservation of global fossil fuel supplies.  The need for standard batteries will be reduced, the lifespan of batteries will be enhanced, and it is expected that the smaller size, reduced profile, and increased energy voltage of the solution will ultimately reduce manufacturing costs.",
