 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site program at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will focus on the research theme of the NAE Grand Challenges.  The Grand Challenges investigated in this program are to: 1) Make solar energy economical; 2) Provide access to clean water,; 3) Advance health informatics; 4) Secure cyberspace; 4) Restore and improve urban infrastructure; 5) Engineer the tools of scientific discovery; and 6) Engineer better medicines.   These research topics, with their broad societal impact, will allow undergraduate students from multiple engineering disciplines and computer science to work together on exciting and critical problems.  \r\n \r\nThis specific objectives of this 10-week summer REU Site program include the following: 1) training of undergraduates in multidisciplinary research fields; 2) generating student interest in playing a role in a grand challenge with critical societal impact; 3) developing technical and professional skills offering increased future opportunities; 4) networking with fellow REU students and faculty mentors; and 5) motivating students to pursue graduate studies. In addition students will attend the following professional development workshops: 1) Ethics in Research; 2) The Craft of Writing a research Paper; 3) Writing a Captivating Abstract; 4) Creating and Delivering an Effective Oral Presentation; 5) Creating and Presenting and Attractive and Informative Research Poster; 6) Applying to and (and Paying for) Graduate School; and 7) Life as a Graduate Student.  Social activities are planned that will enhance the cohort experience. At the end of the summer, each student will participate in a poster session and work with their faculty mentor to publish and present research results at a regional or national conference. \r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\r\n\r\nThe PI intends to recruit 50% of the students from underrepresented groups. A unique aspect of this program is that all faculty mentors are female two of which are African American.",
