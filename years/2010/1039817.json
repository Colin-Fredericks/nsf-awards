 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary: Zeta potential and submicron particle size measurement is an integral part of the emerging interdisciplinary areas of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology owing to its unique capability of measuring size and surface charge of nanomaterials present in the chemical and biological systems. The present instrument will offer a full range of measurement capabilities ideal for research areas ranging from material science to evolutionary biology. It is also capable of measuring Zeta potential of solid surface in solution which will be beneficial for research projects related to nanoparticles or graphene assembly on the surface. In addition, the possible size measurement range of particles in solution will facilitate its application in the research involving nanoparticles, nanoshells and even spider sperm suspensions in dilute or concentrated solutions. The proposed instrument will help the PI and the Co-PIs to build a comprehensive research and teaching program at the interface of physical and biological sciences at the Department of Natural Sciences, University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-D). The present instrument will fulfill the necessary support required for various active research projects including (1) Organic Monolayers as Templates for In Situ Generation of 2D Nanoparticles, (2) Carbon Nanotube Array for DNA Detection, (3) Toxic Potential of Metallic and Magnetic Nanoparticles on Yeast Cells, (4) Gold Nanoshells as High Efficiency Selective Solar Absorbers, (5) Sperm Competition: Sperm Morphology, Storage, and Activation in Spiders, (5) Toxicological and Biomedical Characterization of Engineered Magnetic Nanoparticles and (6) Iron oxide Incorporated AOT-Alginate Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery. This instrument will expand the existing research opportunities for undergraduates to participate in the exciting multidisciplinary areas of Physical and Biological sciences. Additionally, the proposed instrument will create unique opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds, particularly; promote the participation of under-represented minorities in bio-engineering and physics. High school students from the Detroit metropolitan area will continue to obtain opportunities to participate in summer research. \r\n\r\nLayman Summary:  Nanotechnology is the use of novel and unusual properties, phenomena, and processes that occur when size is reduced to 1-100 nanometers (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter). A Zeta potential and submicron particle size measurement system is an integral part of this interdisciplinary area of science due to its unique measurement capability of particle size and zeta potential (related to surface charge) of the nanometer scale molecular structures present in the chemical and biological systems. The present instrument at the Department of Natural Sciences, UM-D will attract prospective students intending to work in the interdisciplinary research areas involving physical and biological sciences like nanotechnology/nanobiotechnology. In addition, this instrument will have a major impact on our existing courses involving nanotechnology and will further expand the opportunity of undergraduate student participation in number of active faculty research programs. This instrument will also be of great support to the current outreach program of the department with local community colleges and to improve the K-12 science education of the Detroit metropolitan area.",
