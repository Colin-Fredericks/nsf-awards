 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award to Auburn University funds the acquisition of a water analysis system to enhance the scientific response to the Deep Horizons Oil Spill and its effects on coastal ecosystems.  The overarching goal is to better understand how planktonic microinvertebrate and microbes will be affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  Auburn researchers and their students will use the equipment throughout the upcoming year to monitor the Northern Gulf of Mexico water and its particulate and planktonic assemblages.  Specific objectives of this project include 1) examining how long oil droplets persist in the water column, 2) determining the degree to which organisms accumulate oil initially and thereafter into lipid-rich regions of the body, and 3), determining the effect of the oil on invertebrate larval and protist populations.  An expected result of this NSF-RAPID award is timely and critical information to inform policy and remediation efforts in response to the oil spill.    Results from the studies and education efforts will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journal publications, though participation at regional and national scientific meetings, and through a range of public outreach efforts that include meetings with affected citizens.",
