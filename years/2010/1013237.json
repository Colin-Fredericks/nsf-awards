 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal \"A Mentoring and Networking Workshop for\r\nJunior Women Faculty in the Big 10\" is to address and overcome some of the barriers to the broader participation of women in\r\nthe engineering academy. This proposal will develop and present a networking\r\nworkshop for approximately 45 women assistant professors of engineering at ten\r\nsimilar, large engineering schools in the upper Midwest. The workshop is designed to provide the assistant professors information critical to early success in their career paths. Also, this workshop will generate a multi-university regional support system for these women faculty to counter isolation and lack of networking opportunities. In\r\naddition, this workshop will disseminate best practices from the four NSF-ADVANCE programs at the represented schools. The proposal also includes a plan for participants in this workshop to continue collaborations via travel to one anothers institutions following the workshop. This networking will provide the participants with opportunities to collaborative on future research topics of interest to the participants. \r\nThe budget request for this workshop proposal is an amount of $49,031. This proposal is exempt from external review in accordance with the PAM, Chapter V.B.2.m.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nAbstract\r\nProposal:1013237 PI Name:Tilbury, Dawn\r\nPrinted",
