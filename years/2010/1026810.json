HPDC 2010 will be held, along with nine workshops and a meeting of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) standards body, in downtown Chicago, Illinois on June 20 through June 25, 2010. \r\nHPDC is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications.\r\nHPDC seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, the OGF meeting, and would also participate in a birds-of-a-feather session to discuss their experiences. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities.",
