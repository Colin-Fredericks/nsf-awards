 "awd_abstract_narration": "The anticipated opening up of white space by the FCC for unlicensed\r\nuse has created exciting new opportunities.  It also presents unique\r\nchallenges: (i) it requires accurate wide-band spectrum sensing\r\ntechnique to avoid interfering with primary users, and (ii) it needs\r\ndynamic spectrum sharing in heterogeneous setting both within networks\r\nand across networks.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a holistic approach for spectrum sensing to\r\naddress spatio-temporal variability and spectrum sharing among\r\nmultiple secondary users and networks in white space.  In particular,\r\nit first develops efficient and accurate spectrum sensing techniques\r\nthat simultaneously exploit time- and frequency-domain features,\r\nsparsity in active transmitters, and temporal and spatial locality in\r\nthe transmissions. Second, it studies the cost and benefits of sharing\r\nnetwork state in a heterogeneous network where different nodes have\r\ndifferent information views. Third, it studies spectrum sharing across\r\nnetworks (e.g., CSMA/MaxWeight, TDMA/CSMA co-located networks). It\r\ndevelops algorithms and studies performance and fairness both with\r\nimplicit sharing (i.e., no state-exchange) and with explicit sharing\r\nof information across networks. Fourth, it proposes a ground-up design\r\nfor white space that leverages random CDMA-like codes for spectrum\r\nsharing with an OFDM physical layer that leads to a new efficient\r\narchitecture for sharing across users and networks in white space.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms, techniques, and software resulting from this research\r\nwill help enable effective communication in white space, create new\r\nwireless network technologies, and deepen our understanding of\r\nwireless networks. The research results will be incorporated into\r\nnetworking courses and widely disseminated through conference/journal\r\npublications and software distribution.",
