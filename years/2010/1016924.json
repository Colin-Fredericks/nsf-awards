 "awd_abstract_narration": "One dominant characteristic of today's large-scale computing systems\r\nis the prevalence of large storage clusters.  Storage clusters at the\r\nscale of hundreds or thousands of commodity machines are\r\nincreasingly being deployed. At companies like Amazon, Google, Yahoo,\r\nand others, thousands of nodes are managed as a single system.\r\n\r\nAs large clusters have brought many benefits, they also bring a new\r\nchallenge: a growing number and frequency of failures that must be\r\nmanaged. Bits, sectors, disks, machines, racks, and many other\r\ncomponents fail.  With millions of servers and hundreds of data\r\ncenters, there are millions of opportunities for these components to\r\nfail. Failing to deal with failures will directly impact the\r\nreliability and availability of data and jobs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we still hear data-loss stories even recently. For\r\nexample, in March 2009, Facebook lost millions of photos due to\r\nsimultaneous disk failures that \"should\" rarely happen at the same\r\ntime (but it happened); in July 2009, a large bank was fined a record\r\ntotal of 3 millions pounds after losing data on thousands of its\r\ncustomers; more recently, in October 2009, T-Mobile Sidekick, which\r\nuses Microsoft's cloud service, also lost its customer data.  These\r\nincidents have shown that existing large-scale storage systems are\r\nstill fragile to failures.\r\n\r\nTo address the challenges of large-scale recovery, the goal of this\r\nproject is to: (1) seek the fundamental problems of recovery in\r\ntoday's scalable world of computing, (2) improve the reliability,\r\nperformance, and scalability of existing large-scale recovery, and (3)\r\nexplore formally grounded languages to empower rigorous specification\r\nof recovery properties and behaviors.  Our vision is to build systems\r\nthat \"DARE to fail\": systems that deliberately fail themselves,\r\nexercise recovery routinely, and enable easy and correct deployment of\r\nnew recovery policies.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit this website:\r\nhttp://boom.cs.berkeley.edu/dare/",
