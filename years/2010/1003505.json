This region is a significant source region for desert dust today and data suggest that the area was much wetter during the Humid Period and, as a consequence, less of a source of dust. \r\n\r\nThe research team aims to examine the role of dust during this time period as follows: i) compile available desert dust deposition records for this time period; ii) simulate desert dust in the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and match the available data; and iii) evaluate the impact of dust radiative forcing on climate during this time period. \r\n\r\nThe primary broader impacts involve supporting undergraduate and graduate students as well as helping improve the characterization of aerosols in the CCSM.  Improving aerosols for the CCSM has a wide appeal to a broad spectrum of atmospheric scientists.",

In fact the lives of millions of people living nearby \"dusty\" areas are heavily affected by dust in North Africa and the Middle East, in Australia and China just to name a few.

On this matter, science can inform policymakers so that they can better shape climate and land use policies to the benefit of the well being of current and future generations.\n\nGeological evidence shows large variations in the deposits that windblown dust from the Sahara left on the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, with low dust levels associated with the green Sahara; in fact increased vegetation and moisture caused a reduction in dust emissions. In our project we worked to collect all the relevant data of this kind from that time period. We then screened the data that were retrieved worldwide retaining the ones with adequate quality, and organized them for the first time in a consistent way. This new way of looking at the data highlighted some inconsistencies that were not deducible from the analysis of individual works.  This dust database constitutes a new tool to support and inform future research for many colleagues, as shown in the following figure extracted from Albani et al., 2015.\n\nThe data collection also proved to be a rich source of information regarding several aspects of importance to the dust cycle, that is the chain of events that control dust erosion from the land surface, specifically its transport in the atmosphere by the winds, and subsequent deposition back to the surface. In particular the collected information was used to improve the representation of dust in the Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The CESM is an Earth System Model (ESM) that is a mathematical representation of the Earth and its climate system. It is composed by over a million lines of programming code that constitute a simplified but complex representation of the real world in terms of equations, which are solved by powerful supercomputers, in a fashion similar to the models used to provide weather forecast..."
