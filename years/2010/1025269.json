 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigators study the fundamental aspects of\r\nincorporating uncertainty with sensitivity analysis in the visual\r\nanalytics process. They also aim to develop novel and scalable\r\nvisual representations of sensitivity, from the visualization of the\r\nraw sensitivity coefficients to visual summaries of multivariate\r\nderivatives obtained from the analysis.  Uncertainty-aware visual\r\nanalytics helps enhance analysts' confidence levels on the insight\r\ngained from the analysis. Furthermore, it gives toolmakers a\r\nmethodology for measuring and comparing the robustness of\r\ndata and visual transformations. Sensitivity coefficients of data and\r\nvisual transformations are useful for discovering the factors that mostly\r\ncontribute to output variability, identifying stability regions of the\r\ndifferent transformations within the original data space, and\r\ntelling the analyst what the interaction is between variables,\r\noutputs and transformations.\r\n\r\nUncertainty is introduced throughout the process of data generation,\r\ntransformation, and analysis in most real-world applications. The ability to\r\nincorporate uncertainty into visual analysis is therefore critically important\r\nfor insightful reasoning and key decision making. This project will have a\r\nwide-reaching impact on those areas relying on the ability to reason\r\nabout large amounts of data. On one hand, it suggests to provide a variational\r\nview of the visual analytics process, which opens up new directions and\r\nparadigms for visual data analysis and mining. On the other hand,\r\nthe improved understanding of the visual analytics process will help\r\nestablish the field as a scientific discipline.",
