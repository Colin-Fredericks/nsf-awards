 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current engineering practice for determining the volume change behavior of unsaturated expansive soils are mostly based on simplified tests, and correlations with index properties. Such practices can lead to uneconomical and distress prone foundation designs. Hence, there is a fundamental research need to review the current characterization practices in expansive soils and to revise them to reflect the current state of knowledge of unsaturated soil mechanics. The research team from both UT Arlington and Arizona State University are working towards accomplishing this research need by performing various experimental and modeling tasks. Experimental tasks include investigations on eight types of expansive subsoils to determine Soil Water Characteristic Curves (SWCCs) over a wide range of soil suction, measure volumetric swell strain and swell pressure with consideration of clay mineralogy, moisture content, dry unit weight, and stress history. Modeling tasks include development of analytical formulations to predict swell characteristics using SWCC attributes, clay mineralogy, pore void data, and study flow and deformation based finite element modeling to simulate volume change behavior. The final outcome of this research is the development of methods for better predictions of expansive soil properties using unsaturated soil mechanics principles.\r\nThe broader impacts of the research will focus on training graduate and undergraduate students in unsaturated soil mechanics and expansive soil characterization; incorporating research findings into undergraduate and graduate courses; strengthening understanding of volume change behavior of expansive soils and providing better characterization tools for design of infrastructure foundations on expansive soils;  involving women and minority students in research tasks; and teaching simple experimental modules in summer classes to K-12 students to enhance their interests in civil engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes from Collaborative Research: SWCC based Models for Realistic Simulation of Swell Behavior of Expansive Soils\n\nIntellectual Merit: In this study, a team of geotechnical engineering faculty students at University of Texas, Arlington, and Arizona State University worked collaboratively to develop an approach for estimation of unsaturated soil properties of expansive soils based on clay mineralogy.  The team used these estimated properties (adjusted for soil fabric, structure, and porosity change), together with unsaturated soil mechanics principles to develop improved methods of prediction and enhanced understanding of volume change response of clay soils.  The primary objective of this study was the development of a deeper fundamental understanding of expansive soils under various soil compositional and environmental factors. Specifically unsaturated soil properties of expansive soils, including in particular soil-water characteristic curves, were linked to their fundamental soil composition.  As a part of the research, available models for estimated of unsaturated flow and soil heave were evaluated using mineralogical-linked expansive soil properties that were determined through laboratory testing.  Research findings support that mineralogy alone, while helpful, cannot be used to estimate all required unsaturated soil properties. Soil fabric and structure, including soil suction-change induced changes in porosity, are important factors in obtaining unsaturated soil properties of expansive clays. Cost-effective and sustainable designs of infrastructure systems on expansive clay profiles require knowledge of the role of clay mineralogy in volume change response of expansive soils. This study fills a knowledge gap by linking clay mineralogy, together with data on soil fabric and structure, to soil parameters required for implementation of unsaturated soil principles to predictions of soil heave.\n\nBroader Impacts: Expansive soils are responsible for an estimated $15 billion/yr loss to infrastructure in the U.S., and opportunities for large cost savings arising out of improved fundamental understanding of expansive soil behavior are great.  The results of this study have been widely distributed to engineers and educators through presentations and publications. The study provides a societal benefit through providing improved understanding of expansive clays that can directly impact the cost and performance of public and private infrastructure. It is anticipated that the findings from this study will have influence on the current practices for building on expansive soils.  This project also broadened participation in engineering through the education of engineering students, including the education of underrepresented STEM student participants. New educational materials, primarily aimed at the general public and students in grades 9- 12, were developed to explain the types of infrastructure damage that can occur when structures are built on expansive soils and to provide information on causes of distress and how to co-exist with expansive soils. These new educational materials have been used in various university outreach programs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Claudia E Zapata"
