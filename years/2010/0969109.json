 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is implementing a common approach to improving student retention in biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, mathematics and physics in order to increase the average STEM major graduation rate from 120 to 160 graduates.  Activities being introduced through this project include: common, inquiry-based approaches for all STEM introductory courses; structured learning assistance to gateway courses with pervasive high student failure rates; development of an electronic portfolio-based mentoring program emphasizing undergraduate research; establishment of a three week, residential summer bridge program; creation of a STEM residential learning community; and development of stronger connections with local community colleges through improved transfer orientation programming. These six interventions are designed to prepare and encourage students to take advantage of existing undergraduate research and internship opportunities later in their careers. They were chosen to overcome specific barriers to STEM persistence as determined by institutional research with the current student body.  Participating community colleges are Cape Cod and Massasoit Community Colleges.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The underlying intellectual principle of this project is that a coherent set of institutional changes known to support the retention of three traditionally underserved populations (students of color, first generation college students, and low income students) will result in a substantial rise in the total number of BSC STEM graduates through all populations. These three traditionally underserved populations represent approximately 42% of the institution's students. With the exception of the summer bridge program designed to jumpstart a group of at risk students from the traditionally underserved population, all these interventions will be available to all STEM students. Students are being closely tracked via surveys and focus groups in order to determine the efficacy of various program components as concerns increasing persistence. These assessments are being used in real time to improve the delivery components.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This project allows for a study of best practices for STEM retention within traditionally underserved populations on college campuses, an underserved resource for possible STEM graduates, and therefore has the potential to assist the large number of public colleges and universities that struggle to serve these students well. Key personnel will present results of these studies at regional and national disciplinary meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSTudent Retention Enhancement Across Mathematics and Science (STREAMS) was an NSF-STEP grant funded between May 1, 2010 and April 30, 2016: NSF-DUE 0969109.  The overarching goal of STREAMS was to make structural changes that would lead to a lasting increase in the number of science and mathematics graduates from Bridgewater State University (BSU) by approximately 40 additional graduates per year.  STREAMS supported students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics and physics.\n\nThe major activities of STREAMS included six elements: the reform in the teaching of introductory (or gateway) science and mathematics classes; the creation of a set of peer-led, small-group, inquiry-based learning supports for the gateway courses that were required of all students; a three-week, research immersive summer bridge program for incoming science and mathematics freshmen; a mentoring program for new students; a residential learning community for science and mathematics freshmen; and improved transfer articulation, advising, and connections with two local community colleges.\n\nAs a result of improved teaching and mandatory student support structures put into place by STREAMS for the traditionally difficult, introductory science and mathematics courses, the percentage of students in the introductory science and mathematics courses who earned grades of D, F, or W fell from 34.1% to 24.4%, and the percentage of students earning A or B grades increased from 41.9% to 51.3%.  As a result, each academic year, 79 fewer D, F, and W grades and 90 additional A and B grades are earned by BSU science and mathematics majors. \n\nImproved introductory course success combined with improved mentoring, delivered most effectively through STREAMS\u00c6s residential learning community, are responsible for an increasing the retention rate of science and mathematics between their freshmen and junior years from 48.0% to 59.0%.  This statistically significant difference generates an additional 20 graduates per year.\n\nCollaborations with two local community colleges led to improved advising and an increase in the number of science and mathematics students who transfer to BSU.  As a result of STREAMS funding, both community colleges created new 200 level biology classes and increased the number of course offerings needed by science and mathematics majors to transfer effectively into BSU programs as junior status science and mathematics majors.  These activities led to an additional 22 transfer students per year at BSU, resulting in an additional 12 graduates annually.\n\nOverall, the number of science and mathematics graduates from BSU has increased from an average of 127 graduates per year between 2008 and 2011 to an average of 210 graduates per year between 2013 and 2015.  The 2013 year is the first year STREAMS activities might plausibly have had a significant impact on the number of graduates.  The increase in science and mathematics graduates is in part due to increases in enrollment. However, at least 32 additional graduates are directly attributable to STREAMS activities regarding initial science and mathematics major retention and increases in transfer students from community college partners.  Activities undertaken by STREAMS to create community and convince undeclared students to join science and mathematics majors are difficult to measure, but may be responsible for adding a handful of graduates per year.  The number of undeclared students joining science and mathematics majors during the STREAMS grant time-period exceeded grant predictions.\n\nThe results of the STREAMS grant program, and explanations of the activities undertaken by the STREAMS grant team, have been widely disseminated at national and regional meetings of Project Kaleidoscope in conjunction with the American Associate of Colleges and Universities, at disciplinary meetings in chemistry and physics, and in peer reviewed publications.
