 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research activities of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee LIGO Scientific Collaboration (UWMLSC) group. The central theme of the project is the extraction of astrophysical information from gravitational-wave observations. Building on broad expertise, the group will engage in specific activities spanning all aspects of gravitational-wave astronomy. The award will foster synergy by focusing expertise in gravitational physics, astrophysics, and grid-computing on gravitational-wave data analysis challenges that are on the critical path to the scientific success of LIGO.\r\n\r\nGravitational waves are a fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Yet almost 100 years after the theory was put forward these waves have eluded direct detection. Having recently constructed exquisitely sensitive detectors, such as LIGO, scientists from the United States and around the world are poised to make the first detection. With these instruments now operational, the challenge is to dig deep into their data to find the imprint of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, such as black holes, neutron stars, and signals from the beginning of the universe. The first detection will usher in a new era of scientific discovery: the era of gravitational-wave astronomy.  This work will make a significant contribution to many critical-path components of the LIGO data analysis effort, which will enable the first detection of gravitational waves and the wealth of astrophysical information thereby garnered.  This award also supports research into the nature of highly energetic astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation which will provide valuable insight into the nature of Einstein's theory of gravity. Graduate students receive valuable training in the emerging field of gravitational wave science.",
