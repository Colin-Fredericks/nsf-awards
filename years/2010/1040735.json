 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at the design and experimental validation of a comprehensive clean-slate future Internet architecture. The proposed MobilityFirst architecture is motivated by the ongoing paradigm shift of Internet usage from today?s fixed PC/host (client)?server model to emerging mobile data services and pervasive computing applications. The major design goals of the architecture are: mobility as the norm with dynamic host and network mobility at scale; robustness with respect to intrinsic properties of the wireless medium; trustworthiness in the form of enhanced security and privacy; usability features such as support for context-aware services, evolvability, manageability and economic viability.  The key components of the MobilityFirst network design are: (1) separation of naming and addressing, implemented via a fast global dynamic name resolution service; (2) self-certifying public key network addresses to support strong authentication and security; (3) generalized delay-tolerant routing with in-network storage for packets in transit; (4) flat-label internetwork routing with public key addresses; (5) hop-by-hop transport protocols operating over segments rather than an end-to-end path; (6) a separate network management plane that provides enhanced visibility; (7) optional privacy features for user and location data; and (8) an integrated computing and storage layer to support programmability. The project?s scope includes architectural design, validation of key protocol components, testbed prototyping of the MobilityFirst architecture as a whole, and real-world protocol deployment on the GENI experimental infrastructure. The results of this project will provide architectural guidance for cellular-Internet convergence, and are expected to influence future technical standards in the networking industry.",

The overall goal of the project was to design and validate a clean-slate mobility-centric and trustworthy architecture for the future Internet.  The scope of research included specification of the proposed new network architecture, detailed design and verification of key protocol components, analysis of economic and policy aspects, evaluation of network security and privacy, system-level prototyping and validation of the network as a whole, and \"real-world\" testbed deployments for evaluation by application developers and end-users.\n\nThe project has largely achieved the original goals, producing a full MobilityFirst protocol specification and proof-of-concept implementation centered around the following key concepts: (1) separation of the names of network objects from network addresses; (2) public-key-based GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) for all Internet-attached objects, assigned by multiple independent name certification providers; (3) name (i.e. GUID) based protocol layer as the \"narrow waist\" of the protocol with support for advanced services such as dynamic mobility, disconnection tolerance, multicast, multi-homing, content retrieval and context-aware message delivery; (4) Global name resolution service (GNS) for dynamic binding of names to network addresses; (5) New inter-domain and intra-domain routing protocols with in-network storage, hop-by-hop transport, edge-awareness and late binding capabilities; (5) Separate management plane instrumented for visibility of network performance and resource usage; and (6) Computing layer for optional in-network service features. \n\nResults from the project include detailed design and evaluation of the above mentioned core protocol components, including the global name service (GNS), the intra- and inter-domain routing (GSTAR and EIR), hop-by-hop transport layer protocol, in-network compute layer and service API.  The global name service has been identified as the critical new component of the architecture, motivating two complementary GNS designs (Auspice at UMass and DMap at Rutgers) and both these alternatives have been successfully prototyped and validated at a reasonably large scale.  The storage-aware routing protocol proposed for MobilityFirst is the other core technology component which has been evaluated in depth during the course of this project, resulting in a baseline intra-domain routing protocol (GSTAR) and two alternative inter-domain routing approaches (EIR and hierarchical routing).  An optional in-network compute layer service has also been developed and validated at the initial proof-of-concept level.

These use cases have been mapped to service features in the MobilityFirst protocol stack and are being used as reference models for evaluating protocol performance.  Demonstration systems for some of these use cases have also been built. \nIn parallel to the above design and analysis activities, the project team engaged in a significant experimental validation and proof-of-concept effort for the MobilityFirst network as a whole.
