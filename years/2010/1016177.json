 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop efficient multilevel\r\nalgorithms for large-scale optimization problems constrained by partial\r\ndifferential equations (PDEs) with additional inequality constraints (ICs)\r\non the controls and states.  The computational revolution of the last two\r\ndecades has fostered not only high-resolution numerical computations based\r\non PDE models, but also a shift from model based simulation to model based\r\ndesign. The latter translates into the question of solving optimization\r\nproblems in order to identify initial and/or boundary values, material\r\nproperties, sources, and other parameters for which the PDE models behave\r\nin a desired way. However, in general, by increasing resolution not only\r\ndo optimization problems get larger, but they also become more difficult\r\nto solve, thus rendering an ever widening gap between the resolution of\r\nPDEs and that of associated parameter identification problems that can be\r\nsolved using state of the art resources; in order to take full advantage\r\nof these resources, highly efficient algorithms are critical. While such\r\nefficient algorithms have been developed over the past few years, they are\r\nmostly restricted to problems without ICs. The addition of ICs on the\r\ncontrols and/or states normally increases the difficulty of the problem\r\ndue to the presence of Lagrange multipliers that have lower regularity\r\nthan the solution. Recent years have witnessed a sensible progress in the\r\noptimization algorithms that target such problems, however, it is expected\r\nthat significant efficiency can further be gained by improvements in the\r\nlinear algebra technology needed during the optimization process.  In this\r\nproject the PI specifically aims to develop optimal order multilevel\r\npreconditioners for the linear systems arising in the interior point\r\nmethod and semismooth Newton method solution processes of optimization\r\nproblems constrained by linear and semilinear elliptic or parabolic PDEs\r\nwith ICs on the controls and/or states.  For the more difficult problem of\r\nstate ICs, both Lavrentiev and Moreau-Yosida regularizations will be\r\nconsidered. The long term goal is to develop efficient multilevel\r\nalgorithms for large-scale control problems for fluid flows (Stokes, and\r\nNavier-Stokes systems).\r\n\r\nThe results of this project are expected to enable end users of the software\r\n - engineers, applied scientists - to solve\r\nhigh-resolution, relevant optimization problems at a cost that is\r\ncomparable (a small multiple of) to that of performing a single\r\nsimulation. Long-term targeted applications include data assimilation for\r\nweather prediction and air contamination modeling.  Fast data assimilation\r\nfor high resolution models would enable, for example, gaining in a timely\r\nmanner a better quantitative understanding of the current state of the\r\natmosphere around a hurricane, thus potentially improving the current\r\npredictive capabilities.  From an educational perspective, the successful\r\nproject will help the PI's efforts in promoting this field of research at\r\nUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), and it will allow graduate and undergraduate UMBC students to gain\r\nexperience in a research area of strategic interest, which is likely to\r\nincrease their opportunities of finding a good position in a research\r\nuniversity or laboratory.",
