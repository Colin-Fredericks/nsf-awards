The meeting discussions will advance the leading edge of Photonic Switching research by bringing together researchers from the different impacted disciplines, to define and answer their emerging needs of the next decades.\r\n\r\nBroader impact:\r\nThe Photonics in Switching Topical Meeting has been the premier meeting addressing the technology since 1987 and attracts bright researchers in academia, industry and government agencies. By rotating its venue between the US, Asia and Europe on a three year cycle it offers an international forum conducive to direct dialog, dissemination and discussions in identifying novel directions. \r\nThis meeting has been instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands in internet traffic and for reduction in power consumption and device footprint.\r\nThis Topical Meeting of the Optical Society of America will contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.",
