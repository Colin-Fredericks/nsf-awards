 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort aims at conducting comprehensive diagnostics on precipitation variability, elucidating differences between observed and modeled precipitation data. Dynamic mechanisms and uncertainties associated with these differences will be explored and uncertainties will be quantified for  both reconstructed and modeled data. The deliverables include (i) error estimation for global precipitation fields; (ii) precipitation dynamics, data analyses and corresponding uncertainty estimates; (ii) benchmark datasets of the reconstructed precipitation data on daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual scales over the globe and specific regions; (iii) feedback and guidance on reduction of systematic biases in model precipitation; and (iv) professional training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high-school students with special attention to minority and underrepresented groups.  This research effort has significant broader impacts: in addition to the training and outreach to underrepresented minority students,  this activity has the potential of enabling stakeholders interested in precipitation optimize decisions and mitigate impacts due to droughts and floods.",
