 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine first-principles modeling with extant observations and novel data analysis techniques to develop a more complete description of ion composition at high-latitudes, particularly regarding drivers of its variability and its role in regulating the amount and types of ionospheric ions supplied to the magnetosphere.  Specifically, theoretical modeling will be used to quantify the efficacy of factors governing ion composition, and a new technique of estimating ion composition from incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data will be developed and applied to a large database of high-latitude measurements acquired from the Sondrestrom and AMISR facilities in particular.  Measurements by POLAR/TIMAS mission will also be incorporated in the analysis to assess the relationship between ion outflow and variations in molecular composition.  The improved radar remote sensing capability resulting from this work will be available for community benefit and will contribute to advancements in understanding magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at high latitudes with implications for space weather prediction and mitigation as well as CEDAR and GEM science.",

These energy sources can be highly variable in space and time, resulting in a high degree of structure in the ion composition. Variable composition is important to the geospace environment since the high-latitude ionosphere sources plasma to the magnetosphere.  This source plasma, in turn, is known to impact the response of the magnetosphere system to solar wind forcing.  \n\nPrior to this work, relatively little has been known about the role that variable ion composition plays in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The main remote sensing tool for probing the ionospheric plasma, incoherent scatter radar (ISR), is typically not able to derive the composition of the plasma from analysis routines existing before this project.  Hence, the main goals (and outcomes, as outlined below) of this project were to (1) Develop comprehensive models of ion composition at high latitudes and use these to characterize how the composition varies in response to different auroral energy inputs and different solar and geomagnetic conditions, (2) develop and test a model-based analysis approach that would allow for processing of ISR data for composition, and (3) apply this new method to investigate the behavior of the ionosphere during a typical geomagnetic storm.  \n\nDuring this project our team has developed new estimation schemes for deriving ion composition from ISR data and has developed new models for simulating impacts of auroral currents systems on ion composition.  Detailed data-model comparisons with these new tools have yielded new insights into ion composition variability in auroral regions and its connection to auroral density cavities and ion escape to the magnetosphere.

The impacts of neutral winds on upflow during moderate frictional heating events have also been investigated.  In general, these activities have improved our ability to both predict and remotely sense/interpret the ionospheric state, including composition, temperature, and ion upflow.  Moreover, these studies have illustrated some basic features of ion composition locally (during active auroral conditions) and globally (during geomagnetic storms).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew D Zettergren"
