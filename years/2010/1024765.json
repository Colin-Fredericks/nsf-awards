 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current state of knowledge in the area of complex networked systems lacks formal theories that can accurately predict, and hence help control the behavior of such systems. The scientific objective of this project is to develop a theoretical basis to understand, analyze, and control emergent behavior in complex systems operating in uncertain environments. In order to validate the theoretical ideas, the project specifically considers complex swarm robotic systems and aims to apply the proposed analytical framework to such systems. The central approach uses the mathematical framework of stochastic differential equations wherein the swarm is treated as a dissipative Hamiltonian system coupled by nonlinear interacting potentials. In this framework, the influence of uncertainties (noise) is treated mathematically using both the discrete and continuum formulations to be obtained from a Fokker-Planck approach. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is the development of a theoretical basis for modeling of complex systems and their analysis based upon given control inputs and inherent system uncertainty. This framework facilitates modeling the complex interactions, higher-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in complex systems as well as the control of desirable emergent behavior. Potential future applications of this research include power grids and communication networks. Furthermore, this project has broader impacts that include promoting teaching, training, and learning; broad dissemination to enhance understanding; and involvement of the underrepresented groups. Undergraduate and graduate students are mentored and trained via courses and involvement in research and outreach activities. Broad dissemination is achieved through special sessions, workshops, and tutorials at conferences that target both the dynamic systems and control as well as mathematics communities. Participation of undergraduates and students from underrepresented groups is facilitated via summer projects, summer camps, and other programs such as Women in Science and Engineering and Emerging Ethnic Engineers.",

In order to validate the theoretical ideas, the project  specifically considers complex swarm robotic systems and aims to apply  the proposed analytical framework to such systems.\n\nThis project developed new theories for multi-agent swarm robotic models and systems.  In a collaboration with the University of Cincinnati we implemented a dual-testbed design of swarming robots in which internet communication is required to maintain the heterogeneous team.  Results from this study demonstrated the degredation of the theoretical model in the case of packet loss.  We also studied the stability of swarming algorithms to complex network topologies in which communication between agents is decided by a random graph.  The theoretical study required the use of results from random matrix theory.  We studied two-species swarming models with pairwise interaction potentials.  These systems were shown to exhibit much more complex pattern behavior than the case of single species systems.  The project resulted in new theories and algorithms for robotic swarms and also involved the training of several PhD students and undergraduate researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea L Bertozzi"
