 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kevin Cavicchi of the University of Akron will study the fundamental physical chemistry of supramolecular assembly by organogelators.  The approach is to prepare tris-amide gelators and nonvolatile, liquid polymer solvents.  The phase behavior of these two component systems will be determined, and for combinations that form organogels their structures and physical properties will be characterized using thermal methods, x-ray scattering techniques, dynamic mechanical analysis, and microscopy techniques.  The ultimate goal is to correlate qualitative gelation behavior with the chemical details of supramolecular assembly by the gelator.  The broader impacts involve training graduate students, a research experience for teachers internship in the PI's laboratory, and broad dissemination of results through publications and presentations at national meetings.\r\n\t\r\nThis work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how supramolecular assembly of small organic molecules can lead to the gelation of organic solvents.  The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on many applications including oil recovery from aqueous media, drug delivery, cosmetics and tissue engineering.",
