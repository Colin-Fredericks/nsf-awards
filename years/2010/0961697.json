 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconstructing past sea ice cover is a fundamental challenge in paleoceanography/paleoclimate research. Conceptual and numerical models of abrupt changes and the role of high vs. low latitudes as the drivers of climate change invoke sea ice as a principle cause of variability, but to date there have been no reliable proxies of past sea ice extent. Understanding the role of sea ice in past changes also critically impacts our understanding of the consequences of future changes in Arctic sea ice cover. This research calibrates and applies a set of new organic biomarkers (IP25 sea ice index, and TEX86 temperature index) to reconstruct changes in sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures from a series of high sedimentation rate cores from the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Specifically, the researchers will 1) produce a high latitude spatial dataset of relative IP25 concentrations and compare the distribution of these compounds with modern sea ice extent, 2) generate a new database of biomarker distributions in surface sediments from high-latitude oceans and compare with known SST variations, and 3) reconstruct past changes in seasonal sea ice and associated sea surface temperatures during the late glacial and Holocene from selected high latitude sites. In addition to the societal relevance of better understanding the role of sea ice extent in climate change, broader impacts include support of a PhD student, summer research projects for undergraduates, and a new faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInstrumental climate data suggests that the Arctic is changing rapidly, leading to significant concerns about the potential consequences of these changes.  However, because of the relative inaccessibility of the Arctic, very little is known about the long-term magnitudes and frequency of natural climate variations.  To address these issues, a number of novel approaches are being developed to better understand past changes in Arctic climate using marine and lacustrine sediment records. Several of these approaches utilize changes in the geochemistry of organic molecules preserved in these sediments, which provide a record of the biological response of organisms to changing environmental conditions and can be used to infer past climate.  For example, the biomarker IP25 is only produced by algae that grow in sea ice (as opposed to the water column).  Thus, concentrations of IP25 in marine sediments potentially provide a means of reconstructing past sea ice cover.  Similarly, previous studies at lower latitude sites have shown that marine Thaumarchaeota alter their membrane lipids as a function of temperature, providing a proxy for past sea surface temperature variations (the TEX86 index).  In this study, we used a large, Arctic-wide array of modern marine surface sediments spanning a range of SST, sea ice and environmental conditions to better understand the applicability of these two proxies to SST and sea ice cover in the Arctic.  Our results show that IP25 concentrations increase with the extent of seasonal sea ice cover throughout the circum-Arctic oceans, though the relationships can be locally and regionally variable.  Adjusting for differences in algal productivity removes much of this local variability, providing regionally consistent sea ice-IP25 relationships that can be used for reconstructing changes in sea ice cover using marine sediments.  Initial downcore investigations of IP25 in the Bering Sea suggest that there were significant changes in sea ice cover over the past 5,000 years.  SST reconstructions using the TEX86 proxy proved to be more complicated, yielding much higher SSTs than expected based on modern temperature data. We hypothesize that the anomalously high SST estimates obtained from TEX86 values in Arctic sediments reflect either the presence of different populations of Thaumarchaeota in the Arctic Ocean compared with the lower latitudes, or the influence of terrestrially-derived lipids delivered to the shelf by Arctic river systems.  This project provided a thesis research topic for 1 graduate student and supported 4 undergraduate student workers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Shanahan"
