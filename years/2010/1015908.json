 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases in the ecological context of networks of host movements. Specifically, the goal is to understand transmission and maintenance of Foot and Mouth Disease Viruses (FMDV) in networks of livestock movements in the Far North Region of Cameroon. Because FMD is endemic and vaccinations are not used, the region provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine how different networks of livestock movements affect disease epidemiology. Data on disease incidence and prevalence will be collected for four years in overlapping networks of livestock movement including daily foraging, annual transhumance, regional markets, and transboundary trade. The data will be used to develop coupled models of infections within herds and models of movement and connectivity between herds within and across networks.\r\n \r\nBeyond the development of modeling approaches that will be useful in the study of other infectious diseases with networks of host movements, these models will be used by veterinary and human health services in Cameroon and other nations in the Chad Basin to monitor disease and explore possible interventions for many diseases. The project will also include training Cameroonian veterinary students and researchers in the use of the model and in epidemiology and modeling in general. In addition, local herders will be trained to assist in data collection and surveillance of disease outbreaks using a cell-phone reporting system. The combination of local surveillance system that is embedded in the pastoral system and a regional monitoring system that can analyze epidemiological trends, can improve disease interventions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: Viruses cause some of the most persistent (influenza) and emerging (Ebola) diseases.  Though viral diseases are ancient, we do not understand why they persist in some populations and disappear from others.  Using the case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus in the Far North Region, Cameroon, this project followed herds of cattle to look at drivers of disease transmission.  The Far North Region of Cameroon is like a natural laboratory with both stationary (village) herds and mobile (transhumant and nomadic) herds.  Our analysis determined that different FMD viruses have different transmission patterns and characteristics.  Because different viruses showed different patterns in the same cattle, we can assume that the virus causes the differences, rather than the cattle.  Some viruses appear to die out locally and come back later.  We collected viruses in cattle crossing international borders into Cameroon that were identical to viruses from local outbreaks and were related to very distant outbreaks in East, West and North Africa.  So international cattle trade may cause some outbreaks.  Other viruses likely stay in the local livestock population without reintroduction.  These viruses can produce larger outbreaks when mobile livestock congregate.  Though congregation may contribute to the size of outbreaks, mobile cattle herds did not affect every part of the project area the same way.  In computer simulations based on field and experimental data, some areas had large outbreaks and some areas rarely had outbreaks with or without mobile cattle.  Mobile cattle only affected a limited part of the project area.  Overall, this project adds to knowledge about viral and population characteristics that contribute to FMD in Cameroon and to viral disease persistence and spread in general.\n\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project were in three domains: training of students, increasing awareness of research in livestock health, and improving collaboration to combat FMD.  Students - One hundred and nineteen students were trained in some way by this project.  This included post-doctoral (4), doctoral (15), masters (17), veterinary professional (11), and undergraduate (10) students completing guided research projects at five different US and African institutions, and 62 students taking a newly developed class in computer modeling of infectious diseases.  Students completing research and taking courses under this project worked in interdisciplinary and international settings with students from the US and abroad as well as from majors as varied as anthropology, virology, mathematics, computer science, geography, public health, and veterinary medicine all participating together in project meetings and learning activities.  We included professional development activities in our training and our students have won awards, obtained good jobs, started families, and advanced science through academic publications.  Awareness - The project conducted two meetings of study participants (cattle herders) and livestock health stakeholders in Cameroon.  Both meetings included presentations and discussions about research and livestock diseases including a tour of a local diagnostic and vaccine production laboratory and chances to discuss livestock health with researchers and government officials.  Based on herder's concerns at these meetings, the project produced illustrated guides on how to treat cattle for common illnesses and distributed these to herders at smaller workshops in Cameroon and Ethiopia.  Collaboration - This project worked with two universities, two government laboratories and local, regional, and national animal health offices in Cameroon.  In doing this, we brought together resources that would not necessarily have come together or been concerned with FMD.  We also joined Cameroonian labs and universities with international partners in the US and Europe.  These efforts have resulted in improved diagnosis and prevention of FMD in Cameroon and globally.  A tangible example of this is the first FMD vaccine produced and tested for livestock in Cameroon (distributed beginning in 2014) that used strains of virus collected by this project. \n\nOverall, this project contributed to scientific knowledge, collaboration and application across a wide range of people and settings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca Garabed"
