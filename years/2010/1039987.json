 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary:  This award enables West Virginia University to acquire a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system to grow a variety of oxide thin films, multilayers, and nanostructures with applications in physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and health sciences. The PLD system will be used to study the magnetoelectronic properties of multiferroic oxide films on polar semiconductors, the effects of tunneling through active ferroelectric junctions, the fabrication of novel reversible biosensors, new photovoltaic and photocatalysis devices, coatings for biomedical applications, and solid oxide fuel cell materials, among other projects. PLD is recognized as an efficient way of growing nanostructures with desired stoichiometry, but there is presently no PLD system at West Virginia University. The instrument will complement existing sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy growth facilities. The system will not only grow oxides using laser ablation deposition, but will also be able to ablate target material using electron beams, for materials that cannot be ablated with the laser, and will include two sputtering guns for deposition of metals. Additional functionality will be provided by analyzing the x-ray fluorescence emitted by the reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) gun to provide in-situ structural and stoichiometric information. The PLD system will be made available to a large number of students, postdocs, and faculty, both at WVU and at other universities, and to private companies in the region, by incorporating the instrument into the WVNano Initiative's Shared Facilities. The instrument will also tie into the WVNano Initiative's undergraduate and graduate student research, education, and outreach programs that target a large proportion (greater than 50%) of underrepresented minorities and women from the State of WV and the Appalachian region. Because users are trained to operate the WVNano instruments, skills useful for the students' future careers will be developed. The research enabled by the instrument will have impacts the regional, national, and international levels because of collaborations with external investigators.\r\n\r\nLayman Summary:  Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile technique designed to fabricate nanoscale structures with high chemical and structural precision. When combined with other advanced fabrication and diagnostic tools, PLD can be a powerful tool with a wide-range of research and technology applications. Because there no such system currently exists at West Virginia University, the instrument will allow researchers to pursue new avenues that will have a significant impact on the development of future energy and health care technology. In particular, the research enabled by the instrument will result in more energy-efficient electronic devices, smaller and more reliable data storage devices, biomolecular sensors for real-time monitoring, better coatings for biomedical implants, improved solar energy conversion devices, and more efficient fuel cells. The PLD system will be operated by the WVNano Initiative's shared facilities infrastructure at WVU which will make the instrument available to a large number of students, postdocs, and faculty, both at WVU and at other universities, and to private companies in the region. The instrument will also tie into the WVNano Initiative's undergraduate and graduate student research, education, and outreach programs that target a large proportion (greater than 50%) of underrepresented minorities and women from the State of WV and the Appalachian region. Because users are trained to operate the WVNano instruments, skills useful for the students' future careers will be developed. The research enabled by the instrument will have impacts at the regional, national, and international levels because of collaborations with external investigators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The WVU Shared Research Facilities installed and commissioned the shared pulsed laser deposition system for oxide thin film growth in September 2012.  The system is useful in interdisciplinary research, which complements existing MBE and sputtering growth facilities.  The PI and several of the Co-PIs have been utilizing this system to grow high-quality complex oxide heterostructures, specifically CuFeO2.  The facility is run by a full-time shared research facility technician. Two manuscripts have been submitted for publication related to samples grown over the past year in this system.  \nIntellectual Merit:  This system will be used to grow complex oxides for the research of several faculty in Physics and Engineering.  Right now the delafossites CuFeO2 and CuGaO2 are being grown for possible photovoltaic and multiferroics applications.  Other complex oxides, such as correlated electron materials that undergo metal-insulator transitions, will be grown in the near future. \nBroader Impacts:  This system allows us to grow a wide range of oxide thin films and heterostructures for applications in advanced electronics.  It also provides an important testbed where a diverse group of faculty members can test their ideas.  Students and postdocs are trained by the technician to grow their own samples, thus contributing to the education and training goals of the university.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Lederman"
