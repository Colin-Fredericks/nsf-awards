 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is to understand and, ultimately, control one of the poorly understood phenomena in electrochemical energy storage, namely the coupled mechanical/chemical degradation in lithium ion batteries. As a result of lithium diffusion, electrodes may fracture which limits the durability and performance of lithium ion batteries. Fracture can also prevent electrodes from achieving their high theoretical capacity. This project focuses on characterization and modeling of stresses in electrodes. In situ techniques will be used to measure the effects of diffusion, surface reactions, and mechanical properties on stresses in electrodes. Ex situ observations will reveal the mechanisms of crack formation and growth. The experimental findings will be used to further advance coupled mechanical/chemical degradation models for lithium ion batteries.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will form the basis for surface engineering approaches to control stresses and mitigate the coupled mechanical/chemical degradation in lithium ion battery electrodes. The results will also help establish materials selection criteria for high capacity and durable lithium ion batteries, as well as enable battery life prediction and health monitoring. The research will directly impact a number of technological areas that depend on energy storage, including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and communication. Participating postdoctorial researchers and students will gain deep knowledge and broad experience in electrochemistry, mechanics of materials, thermal sciences, chemistry, and physics by conducting collaborative research in academic and industrial laboratories. A new course on energy storage will be jointly developed and taught at both the University of Kentucky and General Motors. The research results will be disseminated through publications to advance the state of knowledge in electrochemical energy storage.",
