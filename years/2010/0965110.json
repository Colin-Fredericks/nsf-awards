The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Bilal Haider to work with Dr. Matteo Carandini at University College London in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis project tests the idea that activity patterns in the cerebral cortex play a strong if not decisive role in when and how cortical neurons respond to sensory stimulation. The host and PI first characterize, then quantitatively predict, and finally causally manipulate patterns of cortical neural population activity during visual stimulation. These investigations utilize advanced electrophysiological and optical techniques, respectively, to monitor and manipulate excitatory and inhibitory cortical activity.  Further, these investigations are performed in the mouse visual system, a preparation which is uniquely amenable to combined electrical and optical techniques, and which is emerging as a model of choice for advanced neurophysiological recording during behavior. Their investigations extend the study of visual processing to the most utilized model organism for mammalian neuroscience, and provide significant potential for development and implementation of advanced electrical and optical technologies in the intact brain.\r\n\r\nMore generally, how do external stimuli and internal activity states interact at the neuronal level to serve sensory processing? While some insight has been gained into the responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimulation, and also gained insights into the interactions of cortical neurons with each other, full understanding of the dynamic interaction between sensory inputs and ongoing cortical activity remains elusive. It has often been suggested that the response properties of cortical neurons are largely inherited from incoming sensory inputs, rather than by the surrounding assembly of cortical neurons.  By directly manipulating activity patterns in the cortex while also manipulating aspects of visual stimulation, they can assess the contributions of internally generated versus externally elicited activity that underlies sensation.",
