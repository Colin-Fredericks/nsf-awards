 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific with emphasis on TC life cycle, track, and structure; TC interaction with the North Pacific jet stream; and high-impact weather events over the eastern North Pacific and North America that are linked dynamically to western North Pacific TCs. Atmospheric predictability will be addressed in terms of conventional statistical measures of model forecast skill, and will be assessed in the context of episodes of individual western North Pacific TCs and downstream high-impact weather events. \r\n\r\nThese project goals will be accomplished through an analysis of recurving and transitioning TCs, including those TCs that undergo extratropical transition (ET) and subsequent reintensification as extratropical cyclones (ECs), over the western North Pacific from July through December.  The analysis will address the ability of operational numerical weather prediction models to forecast episodes of western North Pacific TCs and associated high-impact weather events occurring downstream over the eastern North Pacific and North America; the behavior of large-scale flow regimes in which these episodes occur; and the transitions between large-scale flow regimes that take place in conjunction with these episodes.  Multiscale investigations of interactions involving TCs and the North Pacific jet stream and the ET/EC of western North Pacific TCs will be conducted to understand how initial-analysis and model-physics errors limit predictability, and will be accomplished through the synoptic evaluation of the skill of the operational National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System for projections out to two weeks.\r\n\r\nThis project may be expected to advance scientific understanding by isolating factors that limit predictability for episodes of western North Pacific TCs and associated downstream high-impact weather events over the eastern North Pacific and North America, establishing the relative levels of predictability for the large-scale flow regimes and regime transitions in which these episodes occur, and increasing understanding of the mechanisms that govern the predictive skill of high-impact weather events. The anticipated advances in scientific understanding may be expected to translate into improved forecasts of high-impact weather events over the eastern North Pacific and North America that are challenging to predict, thereby benefiting operational forecasting practice in the U.S.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResults produced by this NSF grant are relevant to understanding how the occurrence of extreme weather events over the United States depends upon the behavior and evolution of the fast upper-level westerly current that defines the North Pacific jet stream.  Our research showed that poleward-moving typhoons and equatorward-moving midlatitude disturbances that interacted with this jet stream over the western North Pacific could cause this fast westerly current to buckle, amplify, and develop elongated wavy north-south excursions over the central and eastern North Pacific. \n\n \n\nWhen this amplified wavy jet stream pattern reached North America it permitted an extensive north-south exchange of polar and moist tropical air masses.  Where these moist tropical air masses moved well poleward ahead of one of these jet stream waves there was an increased risk of abnormally warm or wet weather.  Where these polar air masses moved well equatorward behind one of these jet stream waves there was an increased risk of abnormally cold or stormy weather.  Where these amplified jet stream waves slowed down or became quasi stationary an atmospheric blocking pattern resulted. During an atmospheric blocking pattern the weather you have is the weather you get for days or even weeks.\n\n \n\nAtmospheric blocking patterns, which are characterized by persistent weather patterns, can also feature the occurrence of extreme weather events.  Frequent heat waves and extreme droughts may characterize summertime blocking patterns in some regions (e.g., much of the central United States in summer 2012) whereas other regions will have persistent heavy rains and flooding (e.g., parts of the eastern United States in summer 2014).  Extended cold waves and heavy precipitation, often in the form of paralyzing snowstorms, may characterize wintertime blocking patterns in some regions (e.g., parts of the Northeast in winter 2015) whereas other regions may experience extended benign weather and continuing drought (e.g., parts of the western United States in winter 2015).  Our research results can be used to help understand what antecedent weather conditions over the North Pacific Ocean can lead to jet stream changes that can increase the likelihood of the occurrence of extreme weather events over the United States.\n\n \n\nOur research findings contributed to the education of several graduate students, all of whom are now working in the field as early career scientists.  We have tried to transition our research findings to operations by means of conference presentations, discussions with operational forecasters, and broader interactions with the larger community through a listserv for weather and climate discussions that is maintained at the University at Albany and has an international membership of more than 500 participants.  One of us, PI Bosart, was one of the organizers of a summer 2012 colloquium on the weather-climate interface that was held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.  Our research findings were shared with the broader scientific community during this colloquium through presentations by the PI and former graduate students who were supported by this grant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lance F Bosart"
