The Symposium is a premiere meeting for modeling and simulation of low density, nonequilibrium flows and will return to the United States after a twenty-two year absence. It typically attracts about 200 participants from 30 different countries, spanning academia, government, and industry. Members of the organizing group are experts in rarified gas dynamics from academia, government, and industry. The conference will be run by Penn State Conferences and Institute and has received support from the Department of Aerospace Engineering and the College of Engineering.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impact:  The Symposium includes topics in nanotechnology and plasmas, both of which we are paying particular attention to attract more of the more semiconductor community participates by locating the meeting close to Silicon Valley.  Since its initiation, the Symposium topics have grown to include both the engineering applications of plasma processing, space, materials, and propulsion, as well as, the basic physics of molecular interactions, gas-surface interactions, kinetic theory, astronomical observations, transport, multi-phase flows, combustion, and non-equilibrium hypersonic gas dynamics.",

Since the first symposium held in 1958 in Nice, France, the RGD Symposia are recognized as the principal forum for the presentation of recent advances in the field of Rarefied Gas Dynamics.

The Harold Grad Lecture was presented by Prof. Francois Golse from Ecole Polytechnique, Centre de Mathematiques of Palaiseu Cedex France.   The Grad Lecture was inaugurated at the 17th RGD Symposium to present recent developments from a premier theoretician.   The Lloyd B. Thomas Memorial Lecture was presented by Prof. Barker, Physics and Astronomy, University College London, London, United Kingdom.  This lecture was established at the 19th RGD Symposium to draw researchers who have made outstanding contributions in the field of experiments in rarefied gas phenomena.\n\n \n\nPresentations were made in honor of two leaders from the RGD community that have passed away during 2010.  Professor Carlo Cercignani was celebrated for his extraordinary scientific contributions as well as for his warm personality and generous spirit with brief speeches, reminiscences and pictures by Prof. Aldo Frezzotti, Prof. Kazuo Aoki, Prof. Aleksey Rebrov, and Prof. Francois Golse.   Also, a remembrance of Professor Franklin Hurlbut was presented by Dr. Lawrence Gochberg highlighting his distinguished career as a leader in measurements and rarefied gases.\n\n \n\nNearly 300 abstracts covering the above diverse aspects of rarefied gas dynamics were received from approximately 25 countries.   There were 20 invited lectures spanning the traditional as well as new focus areas for RGD.  The Symposium participation was truly international.  Since students represent the future researchers in our field, it was considered vital that students be encouraged and helped to participate in the symposium.  We devoted a substantial portion of the support funding toward enabling students who would be paper presenters to attend and participate. \n\n \n\nThe Symposium sponsors were the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation; The Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering, San Jose State University, Spectral Sciences, Inc., and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Deborah Levin Fliflet"
