 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective response and adaptation to the physical world, and rigorous management of such behaviors through programmable computational means, are mandatory features of cyber physical systems (CPS).  However, achieving such capabilities across diverse application requirements surpasses the current state of the art in system platforms and tools. Current computational platforms and tools often treat physical properties individually and in isolation from other cyber and physical attributes.  They do not adequately support the expression, integration, and enforcement of system properties that span cyber and physical domains. This results in inefficient use of both cyber and physical resources, and in lower system effectiveness overall. \r\n\r\nThis work investigates novel approaches to these important problems, based on modularizing and integrating diverse cyber-physical concerns that cross-cut physical, hardware, instruction set, kernel, library, and application abstractions. The three major thrusts of this research are 1) establishing foundational models for expressing, analyzing, enforcing, and measuring different conjoined cyber-physical properties,  2) conducting a fundamental re-examination of system development tools and platforms to identify how different application concerns that cut across them can be modularized as cyber-physical system aspects, and 3) developing prototype demonstrations of our results to evaluate further those advances in the state of the art in aspect-oriented techniques for CPS, to help assess the feasibility of broader application of the approach.  The broader impact of this work will be through dissemination of academic papers, and open platforms and tools that afford unprecedented integration of cyber-physical properties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe are surrounded by applications on computers that care about how long it takes to do their job.   These real-time applications often have deadlines, beyond which the computation might as well not be performed.  In writing such applications, developers often must assume worst-case scenarios to have reasonable assurance that their work completes on time.  As an analogy, this would be similar to airlines stating arrival times based on expecting a 400 MPH head wind on every flight.  Such budgeting would result in people usually arriving very early but with planes not scheduled to take off again for hours.  Our research has considered how to associate more reasonable estimates of job time completion.  The advantage of our approach is that near-worst-case scenarios can be accommodated but with much more reasonable estimates of completion time.  This in turn liberates resources for other uses, making better use of a computer hosting such applications. \n\n \n\nWe have applied our ideas for some common tasks included in most applications and seen that our predictions of execution time are well matched by what we observe in practice.\n\n \n\nIn future work we hope to apply our ideas to the memory subsystem of a computer, where fast vs. slow components have a significant effect on program performance.  There, too, worst-case estimates of job completion times are likely never to be seen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ron K Cytron"
