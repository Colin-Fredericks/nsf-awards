 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human computation studies how to collect useful data as a by-product of another activity in which people are interested (e.g., playing games). A popular example is the ESP Game, where two players are shown the same image and must independently generate tags; tags that match become labels for the image. ESP Game players have generated millions of labels that help improve image search engines.\r\n\r\nCurrently, little is understood about how to capitalize on each person's individual expertise to produce the best results in human computation systems. For example, the ESP Game could generate better results if automotive enthusiasts labeled images of cars while biologists labeled images of animals. This project aims to better understand how each individual's different capabilities can be assessed, dynamically leveraged, and even improved for the purposes of human-driven data collection. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of human users as teachers and data sources; an intelligent new objective-driven model of data collection; novel opportunities to study machine learning algorithms that capitalize on human teachers' abilities; and an analysis of learning opportunities as incentives for people to participate in human computation systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Distribution of large new data sets (e.g., Wikipedia articles in multiple languages); several Internet-based human computation systems for large-scale evaluation of machine learning and other algorithms; a new course called ?Human-in-the-Loop Systems?; workshops held in conjunction with major conferences; and outreach activities (e.g., summer projects) that introduce female undergraduate students to interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSocial networks are now ubiquitous across many online services in diverse areas such as communication, music, education, health, and news.  Thisthesis provides an understanding of the interplay between network structure and user behavior in the Twitter network and on the Duolingo language learning platform.  We developed models and algorithms that can explain observed user behavior and distinguish between different patterns of behavior.\n\nIn the context of Twitter we introduced a model for diffusion that captures differences across topics such as news, politics, and popular culture and examine the initial conditions required to produce large information cascades. Additionally, we devised an algorithm for accurately inferring the times at which edges are created in a large subgraph of the social network.  Using these inferred edge creation times we evaluated several models of network formation, see the impact of real-world events such as news stories on network evolution, and show how user interface design choices such as \u00e6Who to Follow\u00c6 lists impact users\u00c6 following behavior.\n\nDuolingo is the world\u00c6s largest language learning service and provided a unique opportunity to understand the impact of social features in an online education platform.  Features such as an activity stream, leaderboard, and community sections exist to promote student-student interactions and keep students engaged in the learning process.  We studied the impact of these features on student behaviors and engagement over long periods of time (greater than six months).  The techniques developed in this work can be used by creators of social systems to measure, model, and understand the impact of their design decisions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luis Von Ahn"
