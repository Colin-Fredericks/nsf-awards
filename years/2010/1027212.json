The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a meeting for those in the region who are active or interested in any aspect of computer algebra, including theory, software, and applications. The one day format allows researchers from the community and those interested in learning more about computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting will be more informal than a traditional conference, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by graduate students from the region will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will include presentations by three speakers who are researchers in computer algebra or who make signi\fcant use of computer algebra in applications. In addition, there will be contributed poster and software demo sessions, and a panel discussion on trends, open issues and future directions of computer algebra.",

Computer Algebra refers to computer software that manipulates symbols, symbolic equations, and mathematical formulae.  Computer algebra systems provide a flexible and powerful tool for doing mathematics using the power of a computer and enable mathematical calculations that would be impossible by hand.    Computer Algebra is important in many applications of mathematics and underlies a lot of applied mathematics, for example, things like computer-aided animation and secure online communication would be impossible without computer algebra.\n\nThe purpose of ECCAD 2010 was to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a meeting for those in the region who are active or interested in any aspect of computer algebra, including theory, software, and applications.
