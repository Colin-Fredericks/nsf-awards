 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Morse function on a manifold decomposes the manifold into infinitely many  hypersurfaces (level sets). The typical level set is smooth but a few of them have singularities. A Dirac operator on the manifold induces Dirac-type operators  on these level sets. The investigator intends to prove that the index of the  original     operator can be recovered from invariants capturing infinitesimal behavior of this family of induced  operators  along  finitely many of these level sets. More precisely  the index  will be a sum  of two types of  invariants: soft  and hard invariants. The soft invariants  are described by infinitesimal spectral flows near finitely many smooth level sets, while the hard invariants are described by the Kashiwara-Wall indices of  triplets of infinite dimensional lagrangian spaces canonically determined by  the  singular level sets.\r\n\r\nThe Dirac type equations are  generalizations of the   famous Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetism.  A solution  of  such an equation can be viewed as a sort of  stationary  electromagnetic wave  on the Universe   under    investigation, known as the background manifold. The   number of solutions of a Dirac equation is highly dependent on the shape of the manifold (or Universe).   Morse theory is a technique of investigating the shape of a manifold by decomposing it   into certain elementary pieces. The investigator  intends to explain how   to compute the number of solutions  of a Dirac equation by studying the  behavior of this equation on these elementary pieces of space.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe investigations in this project have to do   with manifolds  which  are higher dimensional  generalization of the more intuitive  concept of `curved surface' such as the surface of a  donut, or the surface  of a planet with all its montains and valleys. \n\nMorse theory, named  after the American mathematician Marston Morse, is one method of investigating manifolds.  In non technical terms,  this technique assumes the existence of a temperature distribution and   extracts  global  information about  the manifold from the patterns formed by the  temperature fronts.   The  front   associated to a fixed value of the temperature  T  is the locus of all points on the manifold where the temperature   is equal to  that fixed value  T.   There is thus one front for each value of the temeprature. As we vary the teperature, the front  changes.   Morse observed  that most of the time  the  changes in the front as the temperature increases are mild but, r at certain values of the temperature,   the front  changes suddenly and dramatically.  Such values of the temperature   are called critical and the corresponding fronts are called  critical fronts.  The critical fronts display singularities  which are, roughly speaking sharp points on the front; think of the vertex of a cone. Such points are  called critical points of the temperature distribution. Morse theory  is about extracting information about the original manifold  by investigating these critical points. \n\nThe shape of the original  manifold is  difficult to quantify  but mathematicians  have  associated to manifolds numerical quantities  called invariants that  allow us to distinguish between various shapes.        I have achieved three types of outcomes.\n\n1.   Many invariants of a manifold are obtained by counting the solutions of certain partial differential equations on  that manifold. The corresponding number is clled the index of the equation.     By analyzing the geometry of the critical points of a temperature  distribution on a two-dimensional manifold I was able  to compute  the index of certain equations on that manifold called Dolbeault equations.   The answers   reveals    beautiful and deep conections to     qunatities that appear in quantum mechanics, more precisely the Maslov index.  This   was joint work with my former student Daniel Cibotaru, now professor    in Fortaleza Brazil.\n\n2.  I    have addressed the following question: how does a random distritribution of temperature  look like.      One result I proved  is a universality result   which  rougly speaking  says that,   random  temperature distributions of  temeprature on  different  manifolds   have on average the same numbe of critical points and critical values.  This result rougly says  that the statistics of raandom temperature distribution is blind to the  shape of the manifold.   However, I discovered more refined statistical invariants very sensitive  to the shape of the original manifold.  In fact, I proved that they are so sensitive that  they can be used to probabilitically reconstruct the  original shape.\n\n3.  The third  outcome   has   its origine in the   doctoral dissertation of my former student Brandon Rowekamp now assistant professor  at Minnesota  State University at Mankato.     Together    we used  Morse theoretic techniques  to solve a problem in computer imaging:   recover a black-and-white picture given a pixelated version of it.  We  were both   pleasantly suprised by the power of geometric ideas in  solving this problem.\n\n \n\nI am  personally very  excited about this line of research which  has  forced me to go into unexpected  and rather diverse  parts of mathematics.   The work  on pixelations has  given me an my former student the opportunity to glimpse  into   parts as science less frequented by theoretical  mathematicians  such as computer imaging.  We began  to   gain some understanding   on   the type of questions of interest  to  researchers in this rather applied field and..."
