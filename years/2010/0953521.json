 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, conducted by investigators from the University of California at Irvine, is an observation and intervention study of number-concept development in 3- to 4-year-old children, controlling for income and language status. Several lines of research have shown that children's number estimation acuity at the age of 3 years and their understanding of cardinal numbers when they enter kindergarten both predict performance on standardized mathematics tests many years thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe observation component will assess 260 children at ages 3 and 4 years and will be the first comprehensive, baseline description of the number knowledge of low-income English Language Learner (ELL) preschoolers. By assessing children in both Spanish and English, this study will separately describe (a) the children's knowledge of number concepts, and (b) the degree to which this knowledge can be expressed in English. Three comparison groups will also be tested: low-income English monolinguals, middle-income English monolinguals, and middle income Spanish/English simultaneous bilinguals. The children will be tested in 2 sessions, 6 months apart, on 10 measures that include such variables as receptive vocabulary in English and the home language, approximate number system (ANS) acuity, knowledge of the linguistic number systems of English and the home language, family demographic information, and attentional control. The intervention component will focus on 160 children from low-income households where Spanish is spoken. Three-year-olds will be randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. \r\n\r\nThe intervention has previously been shown to improve English monolingual children's knowledge of the linguistic number system and may also help children map preverbal approximate number representations to number words. It is hoped that the observation and intervention studies can lead to similar gains in this vulnerable and understudied ELL population.",

The observation study set out to describe children&rsquo;s strengths and needs in the area of early counting and number concepts. The population of interest was preschool-age, Spanish/English dual-language learners from low-income households in Orange County, California (the <em>low-SES DLL</em> group). The study also included three comparison groups: Low-income English monolinguals (the <em>low-SES monolingual </em>group), non-low-income, dual-language learners (the <em>high-SES DLL</em> group), and non-low-income, English monolinguals (the <em>high-SES monolingual</em> group). The average age in all groups was around four and a half years. The intervention study was conducted with the low-SES DLL group only. It tested the effects of a brief intervention aimed at boosting children&rsquo;s counting and number knowledge using shared reading of picture books and a board game.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><strong>INTELLECTUAL MERIT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">OBSERVATION STUDY.&nbsp; Table 1 (Image: Table of Assessments) summarizes the tasks used to measure children&rsquo;s vocabulary and number knowledge. Data will be posted on the Open Science Framework (<a href=\"https://osf.io/\">https://osf.io/</a>) after publication of the results. <em></em></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><em>Vocabulary</em>: Mean scores of children in the low-SES DLL group were below the normal range for their age in both English and Spanish. Mean English vocabulary scores for children in the other three groups were in the normal range. <em></em></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><em>Approximate Number System (ANS) Acuity: </em>This task measured children&rsquo;s nonsymbolic number discrimination (Image: Approximate Number System Task). Children in the high-SES groups performed slightly better than those in the low-SES groups on this task, but DLLs did not perform differently than monolinguals. <em></em></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><em>Counting and Number Words: </em>While most children in all groups could knew the counting list to ten in English, and could count a row of six items correctly, there were striking SES differences in children&rsquo;s knowledge of number words and their understanding of the underlying logic of counting. There were especially large SES differences in children&rsquo;s understanding of cardinality. Around 80% of children in the high-SES groups (both DLL and monolingual) demonstrated an understanding of cardinality on the Give-N task, whereas only about one-third of children in the low-SES groups did. <em></em></p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><em>Written Numerals and the Number Line</em>: Children&rsquo;s knowledge in these areas also showed large SES differences. Almost all children in both high-SES groups could identify all of the written numerals 1-10; children in the low-SES groups could identify, on average, about half of those numerals. We also tested children&rsquo;s familiarity with the number line between 1 and 10 using a classic bounded number-line task (Image: Classic Number-Line Task) and an easier, scaffolded number-line task (Image: Scaffolded Number-Line Task). Here too, we saw large SES differences. Children in the high-SES groups performed in the normal range for four-year-olds, but children in both low-SES groups performed at chance, giving no indication that they understood how the number line represents numerical magnitudes.</p>\n<p>INTERVENTION STUDY</p>\n<p>After completing the assessments for the observation study, a subset of children in the low-SES DLL group participated in a brief intervention. Children were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control group. Both received four sessions of intervention (one session per week for four weeks) lasting 15-20 minutes each. In each session, experimenters read books with the children in English and Spanish, and played a simple board game based on the number line from 0 to 10 (Image: Number-Line Game). At the end, children were re-tested on the series of assessments listed in Table 1. The intervention had only modest effects. Children in the treatment group were slightly more likely to learn the meaning of a new number word than those in the control group. The effect was statistically significant, but not large. On measures of vocabulary, ANS acuity, and familiarity with written numerals, the intervention had no discernable effect.</p>\n<p><strong>BROADER IMPACTS</strong></p>\n<p>We draw three main conclusions from these studies. (1) Although poverty is associated with serious delays in preschoolers&rsquo; learning of basic number skills, being a dual-language-learner is not. Neither is being a dual-language learner associated with accelerated number-concept learning. Language status is simply not a predictor of early math learning, if SES is controlled. (2) Children in the low-SES DLL group in this study performed as well or better in English than in Spanish on all number assessments, although they had larger Spanish vocabularies overall. This implies that they encountered more counting and numbers in English-speaking contexts than in Spanish-speaking contexts. Given that these children attend Head Start programs with instruction in English, their higher English performance may be evidence that Head Start provides early math input that they do not receive at home. (3) The SES-related gap on early number tasks is much larger for symbolic number tasks than for ANS acuity. Efforts to close this gap should focus on the symbolic number system (number words and counting, followed by written numerals and the number line) rather than on efforts to sharpen ANS acuity.<strong></strong></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/19/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Barbara&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sarnecka</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513706993262_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513706993262_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Table of Assessments\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513706993262_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Table of Assessments\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">These were the tasks used to assess children's number knowledge.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Barbara Sarnecka</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Barbara&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sarnecka</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table of Assessments</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513707125520_Image2ANS--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513707125520_Image2ANS--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Approximate Number System Task\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0953521/0953521_10017649_1513707125520_Image2ANS--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Approximate Number System Task\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of stimulus in the Approximate Number System (ANS) task.
