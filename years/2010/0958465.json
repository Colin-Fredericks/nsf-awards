 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the acquisition of an Azul Vega 3 compute appliance\r\nfor research on developing an open-source general-purpose transactional\r\ninfrastructure for high-level managed languages.  This appliance is equipped\r\nwith hundreds of processor cores, substantial memory, and bandwidth\r\navailability.  The cores compute in a flat SMP configuration, simplifying\r\nprogrammability and management.  The appliance has a number of novel\r\nfeatures including hardware support for concurrent garbage collection, and\r\noptimistic lock elision that provide critical building blocks for efficient\r\ntransactional memory (TM) support.  The project's research agenda is to\r\nexplore new approaches to scalable parallel program construction that\r\nexploits underlying hardware primitives that mask or mitigate critical\r\nbottlenecks that have thus far hampered effective scalable software\r\ntransactional memory systems.\r\n\r\nThe project will use the novel features of the Azul appliance to (i) explore\r\nnew language abstractions with special focus on scalability of transactional\r\napplications; (ii) understand how primitive support for garbage collection\r\nand transactions influence algorithm and application development built using\r\nthese abstractions;  (iii) examine the impact of these mechanisms on\r\ncompiler and runtime design; and (iv) develop a large number of benchmarks\r\nand workloads to better understand TM performance characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of a larger NSF-funded effort to catalyze TM research,\r\nwhich in turn is a key technique to improving software development for\r\ngeneral-purpose parallel computers.  Widespread adoption of new scalable\r\nconcurrency abstractions such as transactional memory is an essential\r\ncomponent in the technology roadmap of major industry players, and the focus\r\nof much attention in academia.",
