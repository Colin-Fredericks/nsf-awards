Documenting this often overlooked and imperiled natural heritage is the priority of the Auburn University Natural History Museum.  Although natural history collections are in decline nationwide, Auburn University has made a strong commitment to collections-based research, education and public outreach.  This award will fund improvements to the plant, invertebrate, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal collections in concert with their relocation to a new, central campus museum building. Upgraded cabinetry and shelving will allow efficient use of the new space, ensure preservation of valuable specimens and improve access to specimens by researchers, students and the public. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide numerous opportunities for the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students in collections-based activities as part of their academic experience.  Several students will participate as paid support personnel and receive on the job training to become the next generation of curators and collections managers.  This award will facilitate integration of the collections into several popular and effective public education programs, including K-12 mini courses, museum tours, and workshops that heighten public interest in and emphasize the importance of Alabama's natural heritage.",
