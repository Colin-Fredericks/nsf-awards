 "awd_abstract_narration": "The productivity of modern land plants is coupled to the structure and function of the plant vascular system. Specifically, it is the xylem tissue that determines the efficiency of water transport in higher plants.  A great deal is known about the structure-function trade-offs that limit water transport in woody taxa, and yet very little work has examined the vascular performance of their relatives, the ferns. Like conifer wood, fern xylem is primarily comprised of single-celled, hollow conduits, but it is distinguished by the absence of wood and other key anatomical features that promote transport efficiency in conifers.  What are the hydraulic and photosynthetic limitations imposed by this primitive type of primary xylem, and how can it inform our understanding of the evolution of vascular tissue?  The goal of this project is to examine the structure and function of fern xylem using hydraulic, chemical and anatomical methods, across the fern evolutionary tree.  These data will provide us with a deeper understanding of the evolution of plant vascular function, and will be used to model water transport in Archaeopteris, a Devonian conifer-fern hybrid representing the first modern tree. A second, long-term effort will monitor the morphology and physiology of local fern species in the redwood forest understory along a precipitation gradient spanning northern to central California.  Fern frond size is directly related to water availability, and can serve as a convenient indicator of  understory vegetation response in response to changes in precipitation. This  field-based project aims to increase the participation of under-represented undergraduates in the natural sciences, inform students about climate change and build a long-term database of understory community structure in coastal California.",

Throughout the plant body, water moves through xylem tissue, a network of dead, hollow, tube-like cells (Figure 1).  Much is known about the structure and function of xylem in woody plants but few studies have examined water transport in seed-free vascular plants such as ferns and lycopods.  Ancestral to conifers and angiosperms, seed-free vascular plants make their first appearance in the Early Devonian and manage to persist for over 400 million years through periods of climate change and the appearance of seed plants.  Yet despite their impressive history and their high species estimates, ferns and lycopods have been perceived as less adaptive and less successful than trees and flowering plants.

However, the picture changes dramatically when temperate species such as bracken fern and chain fern are examined.  By measuring water flow through frond petioles, our data show that these and other taxa exhibit high rates of water transport that are consistent with their large size and high demand for water.  In several ferns, transport efficiencies are greater than the average rates of of conifers and angiosperms.  Modern seed-free plants have no wood so how could so-called primitive plants possibly outperform more derived taxa?  The answer lies in three attributes of the xylem tissue: 1) conduit size, 2) conduit arrangement and 3) the lateral permeability of conduit walls to water.  Many temperate ferns have xylem conduits that are both wide (some over 100 microns) and long (up to several centimeters; Figure 1).  Exceptional species such as bracken fern have vessels, the wide and long conduits that are found in angiosperm xylem.  Since transport efficiency scales with conduit size, larger conduits are able to support higher flow rates.  Secondly, these large, conductive cells are arranged in close proximity, which means that very little of the xylem volume is consumed by non-conductive cells.  Lastly, our data indicate that the lateral permeability of fern conduits to water is surprisingly high, allowing water to move from one xylem conduit to another with little friction. Taken together, natural selection acted on fern and lycopod xylem tissue to increase transport efficiency in an otherwise ancestral, developmentally constrained vascular system.
