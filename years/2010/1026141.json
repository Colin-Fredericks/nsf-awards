 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this planning visit is to explore and identify potential collaborations in robotics with specific emphasis on rehabilitation robotics, humanoids and medical robotics, in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and to meet with the researchers, administrators and government officials there to discuss future research collaborations.   Rehabilitation and assistive robotics are active research fields that can significantly change the lives of the elderly and individuals with physical disabilities.   A U.S. team of 4 faculty members has been assembled.  The team is well qualified to address the objective and has expertise in broad robotics areas including rehabilitation robotics, assistive technology, kinematic and dynamic synthesis, smart and intelligent systems, computer vision and sensing, robotic control, and mechanism design.  Immediate outcome of this Planning Visit will be a report summarizing the findings and recommendations for potential collaborations.  We anticipate proposal submissions (e.g. NSF PIRE) aimed toward long-term goals to continue international collaborations. Our visit is expected to be \"ambassador-like\" and not just purely academic.  It is a ?fact finding\" mission to potentially pave the way for increased US-Gulf collaborations in areas of NSF CISE interest. This planning visit is funded jointly by IIS and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",
