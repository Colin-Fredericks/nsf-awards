 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation into the causes of interannual variability in estuarine salinity, stratification and circulation will be conducted using salinity observations, statistical methods, realistic 3-Dimensional hydrodynamic models, and simplified 2-Dimensional numerical models. The overall objective is to quantify interannual variability of estuarine circulation, stratification, and salinity, to explain the physical mechanisms responsible for such variability, and provide an assessment of the likely changes in these metrics in response to future climate change. Observational analysis and 3-Dimensional modeling will be focused on Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, for which (a) extensive salinity databases exist, and (b) a robust numerical model has been developed and validated. Process-oriented modeling studies will be conducted to examine how the estuaries respond to interannual variability in river runoff and shelf salinity, sea-level rise and potential changes in tidal and wind mixing. Multiple model hindcasts will be conducted in which the individual impacts of interannual variability in open-ocean sea level, river flow, shelf salinity, and meteorological forcing are assessed. Statistical models will be applied to the historical salinity data to investigate how salt intrusion length and estuarine stratification vary with river flow, shelf salinity and sea level rise. Projections of future climate impacts on these estuaries will be made by using the regional output of state-of-the art climate models that have been extensively evaluated for the Mid-Atlantic region. General insights into the sensitivity of estuarine physical processes to climate variability and change will be afforded by (1) the differing physics of Chesapeake Bay (partially mixed) and Delaware Bay (well mixed); (2) process oriented and realistic 3-Dimensional modeling studies; and (3) configuration of 2-Dimensional semi-analytical models over a large parameter space of river flow, tidal velocity amplitude, and estuarine geometry.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. Much of current estuarine research focuses on relatively short time scales (tidal, weather-related, and seasonal). Little is known of interannual variability in estuarine salinity, stratification, and circulation. The inevitability of sea-level rise and climate change demands a rigorous, physically based approach for quantifying their impacts. This project addresses that need with a collaborative effort between two teams with complementary expertise in numerical modeling, estuarine dynamics, climate change impacts, and time-series analysis.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This research project will impact the broader community of estuarine scientists and coastal managers as it will better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on estuarine salinity and stratification, factors that greatly influence water quality and the sustainability of living resources such as oysters and crabs. The long-term model simulations and analysis products will be made available to the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay management communities as they prepare for the impacts of climate change. Results will also be communicated to a broad range of stakeholders, including the general public, through several climate assessment activities underway in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Because the modeling and data analysis approaches developed here can be applied to any estuary, and because we will utilize simplified 2-Dimensional model to provide insights about the potential impacts of climate change on a broad class of estuaries, the impacts of the work extend beyond Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Educational impacts of the proposal are through the support of graduate and post-doctoral research at the interface of the disciplines of estuarine dynamics and climate change.",

Estuaries are highly vulnerable to many projected effects of climate change, including sea level rise, temperature increase and changes in precipitation and stream flows. The overall goals of this project are to improve our understanding of how estuarine physical processes respond to past climate variability and to apply that knowledge to project how future climate change may influence the estuaries. We selected Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay in the Mid-Atlantic Region as the two study sites. They have contrasting physical regimes but are subjected to similar large-scale climate forcing. Salinity in the estuaries is strongly influenced by incoming river flows. Wavelet analysis of the historical records of Susquehanna and Delaware River flows (which discharge to Chesapeake and Delaware Bay respectively) revealed a decadal (18-26 year) oscillation. This oscillation is strongly correlated with the large-scale climate indices El-Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation but weakly correlated with Northern Atlantic Oscillation. Long-term salinity records in Delaware Bay showed significant upward trends (after removing river flow effects), with salinity increase of 2.5 to 4.4 psu for one-meter of sea-level rise, consistent with a similar trend detected in Chesapeake Bay. A coupled estuary-shelf model has been developed for Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and Mid-Atlantic Bight. Hindcast simulations for 2002-2011 reproduced the observed interannual variations in subtidal sea level, temperature and salinity. Analysis of the salt flux budget and salt flux showed that the river flow is a major driver for the salinity variability but winds and shelf conditions also influence the salt flux into the estuaries. Climate-downscaling projections from regional climate models were used to force the estuary-shelf model to examine the potential impacts of future climate change. By 2070 the river flows are projected to increase by 34% in winter and decrease by 7.2% in summer while the relative sea level rise is estimated to be 0.55 m. Model simulations showed that salinity in the two estuaries will decrease by about 0.5 psu due to the projected streamflow increase in the future climate but increase by about 1.0-2.0 psu due to the projected sea-level rise, with a net salinity increase of 1-1.5 psu. Numerical experiments were conducted to determine how future sea levels affect tides in Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Tidal ranges in both estuaries will decrease if the low-lying lands are allowed to be flooded, leading to reduced turbulent mixing and stronger salt intrusion into the estuaries. This project is of broad interest to estuarine scientists and coastal managers for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on water quality and ecosystem productivity.
