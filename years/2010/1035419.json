 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia College, in partnership with the Cheche Konnen Center of TERC and the school districts comprising the Oconee Regional Educational Service Agency, are collaborating on a planning project to develop a Noyce Teaching Fellows/Master Teaching Fellows project. The project that is planned will focus on developing a cadre of highly qualified science and math teachers for rural, majority African-American middle schools, using a professional learning community design model. Objectives for the planning process include: 1) determining an appropriate scope and a vision for sustainability of the Noyce project that will be proposed, including identifying an appropriate nonprofit partner and non-federal matching funds; 2) designing a robust outreach plan for recruiting and retaining Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows; 3) developing an evidence-based and practical approach for the teacher preparation framework for the STEM Master of Arts in Teaching program at Georgia College; 4) building a foundation for a professional learning community for the Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows; and 5) developing an engineering focus for the project which will be primarily centered on supporting teaching in middle grades. The planning process includes an evaluation expert, who is helping to develop the evaluation for the full project alongside the project development, while also providing assessment of and feedback on the planning activities.",
