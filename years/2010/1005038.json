 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-year REU Site program at North Carolina State University will provide 10 undergraduate students each year the opportunity to work on research topics related to energy storage, semiconductor power electronics, electrical sub-systems, solar and photovoltaic systems, processing issues related to fabrication of solar arrays and semiconductor power devices.  This REU Site program builds on existing projects related to the Gen 3 Engineering Research Center (ERC) NSF Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) Systems.  The projects will provide fundamental understanding of energy conversion and generation, power transport and distribution in the electric grid, and energy-related problems that have a direct impact on society.\r\n\r\nEach student will work directly with a research advisor and a graduate student on an independent project. At the end of the summer, all students will give oral presentations at the NC State Summer research symposium allowing them to present their work in a friendly and supportive environment. Additionally there will be planned activities in the form of biweekly seminars and field trips. The objectives of these planned activities are to: 1) deliver safety and hands-on training for all REU students; 2) expose the students to the multidisciplinary nature of the engineering and science in energy related disciplines; 3) foster interactions with professionals that work in industrial settings related to power and energy; 4) instill work ethic, career planning and professional ethics; 5) offer workshop opportunities on public presentation skills; 6) allow participants to discover their potential within their boundaries; 7) tour research buildings, power testing laboratory, hybrid car and charging deck facilities, and processing laboratory facilities; and 8) participate in field trips to industrial and power utilities sites, solar farm and the nuclear reactor at NC State.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be recruited nationwide with special emphasis on recruiting women and underrepresented minority students, as well as from institutions that have limited summer opportunities for undergraduate research programs.  The REU Site program will contribute to the development of a well-trained diverse workforce in an area of national importance and increase public energy literacy.",
