Successful establishment of the technical feasibility of the integrated fixed-bed technology for algae biodiesel production will be a step forward in addressing the high capital costs, high production costs, and waste stream produced by using a traditional homogeneous alkali-catalyzed biodiesel production process.  It will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be economic biodiesel production using algae oil as feedstock, leading to the substitution of petroleum diesel with domestically produced alternative fuel, the reduction of diesel emissions and waste stream generation, the mitigation of global warming, creation of jobs, and the reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports.  Algae biodiesel has the potential to provide a breakthrough solution to both energy security and global warming concerns.",
