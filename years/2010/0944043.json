 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will explore first order principles governing magmatic processes for most planetary magmatic systems, particularly the spatial interdependence of physical and chemical processes. These basic principles are essential to planetary differentiation, the bimodality of sea floor basalt and continental granitics, modal layering in basaltic plutons, and the diversity of igneous rocks. This research will be conducted using samples from the Ferrar Magmatic System of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The PIs seek to: 1) Complete a 1:100,000 geologic map of the entire Dry Valleys that traces in detail the extent and interactions of all the sills to help understand magmatic processes recorded by the entire system; 2) Complete analyses to establish the extent of a newly discovered Opx-Tongue in the Peneplain sill and fingerprint the two upper sills; 3) Simulate the dynamics of sorting and self-organization of granular materials dynamically similar to the massive slurries of the Dais Layered Intrusion. This work is highly integrated in its use of field, theoretical, and experimental methods to reveal and contribute to solving long-standing problems in magma transport, solidification, and differentiation. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nPrevious work by this PI has had broad scientific impacts on Antarctic Earth Sciences. The results of his work have been used to design museum exhibits, to understand ore deposition, and to understand the mitigation of magmatic hazards. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the course of this research.",
