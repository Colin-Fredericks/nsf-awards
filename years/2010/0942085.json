 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary(99) WIKIed Biology provides a model of instruction utilizing Web 2.0 technologies to deepen and enhance teaching and learning in STEM disciplines, with the specific focus on learning biological concepts. The project supports the creation and implementation of two concurrent upper level undergraduate courses, one for computing students and one for biology students. Using the wave of momentum in Web 2.0 as a more dynamic, participatory and collaborative medium, computer science and information systems students research and identify the most feasible and sustainable of the current technologies for use in the courses. Computing students gain experience in practicing implementation and management of computing concepts, whereas biology students gain experience using Web 2.0 technologies to broaden and deepen their understanding of biological concepts. The model introduces new teaching strategies that incorporate ways students engage information and communication technologies and identifies best practices related to implementing Web 2.0 technologies into the teaching and learning process. The project also encourages interdisciplinary active learning experiences for students, which incorporate current information on how students acquire information and use web-based communication technologies. Information gained from the project expands knowledge in the field of student learning and pedagogical practices using technology.",
