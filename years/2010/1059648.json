It is anticipated that demand for capacity and connectivity of both wired and wireless networks will continue to grow, with the society becoming ever more dependent on the networks. This workshop intends to bring together researchers with diverse expertise in networking and areas related to networking. The goal of the workshop is to identify research directions that will help improve important metrics for the communication networks and the applications utilizing the networks. The workshop is expected to result in identification of potential directions for future research that will help improve the metrics of interest. It is expected that the workshop report will provide an important input to the research community and the funding agencies.",
