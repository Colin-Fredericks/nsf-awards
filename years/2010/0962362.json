 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The marine phosphorus (P) cycle is characterized by tight coupling between the uptake and decomposition of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) and dissolved organic P (DOP). DIP is incorporated into a broad range of cellular compounds integral for energy storage, genetic material and cell structure. Cell death and autolysis, exudation, viral lysis and grazing all lead to the release of DOP into the environment where it can be depolymerized, hydrolyzed, reassimilated, removed by absorption onto sinking particles or accumulate in the surrounding environment. In this manner, the form and composition of P in the marine environment is largely controlled by the metabolic activity of microorganisms and is intimately linked to the cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as particulate organic P (POP) and DOP is bound to C and N in multiple forms, including esters, phospholipids and phosphonates. Thus, a consideration of marine P cycling is most relevant when P transformations are viewed as part of the nutrient and energy flow in the oceanic water column. At the ecosystem scale, the balance of productivity and respiration in the open ocean is regulated by the availability of potentially limiting nutrients such as C, N and P. Therefore, understanding the coupling of C, N, and P cycles is central to the determination of the long-term controls of the magnitude and variability of primary production and particle export. Nonetheless, a paucity of simultaneous measures of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and DOP and a relative lack of information on production and decomposition processes have hindered progress in understanding the coupled dynamics of these pools. Recent studies of dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics show large departures from Redfield trajectories driven by alterations in phytoplankton species composition, the stoichiometry and chemical composition of organic matter production, differential lability of organic compounds and preferential remineralization of N and P by heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence of the potential liberation of greenhouse gases occurring via DOP hydrolysis.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the investigators will characterize the composition, lability and remineralization stoichiometry of organic P-C-N produced by ecologically significant photosynthetic genera.  They will conduct a series of in situ and laboratory-based bio-assays where particulate (POM) and DOM isolated from Prochlorococcus and phosphonate-containing strains of Trichodesmium are added to natural microbial populations and incubated in the laboratory and at sea.  Hypothesis driven experiments will address the following objectives:\r\n\r\n(1) Determine the elemental (P-C-N) stoichiometry and biomolecular alterations (31P-nuclear magnetic resonance) occurring in response to exogenous additions of Trichodesmium and Prochlorococcus POM and DOM to natural populations of heterotrophic bacteria, estimate the labile and semi-labile fraction of organic material generated by ecologically significant genera and measure potential aerobic production of select greenhouse gases (methane and ethane).\r\n \r\n(2) Initiate decomposition experiments in the NPSG at opposing phases of the seasonal cycle (summer/winter) in order to capture varying microbial assemblages having different initial metabolic status and community structure. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS: Implementation of the research objectives will serve to build collaborative networks through data sharing and critical discourse. Broader educational impacts include the provision of extensive interdisciplinary and inter-laboratory training for the young scientists included in the project and opportunities for the advancement of women in science. Research highlights will be incorporated into courses taught, including Communicating Ocean Science and scientific findings will be shared via publications, participation in conferences and workshops and maintenance of a research blog. Partnering with education staff at the NSF-funded Center for Microbial Research and Education, the investigators will develop a science kit to illustrate the role of biology in elemental cycles. The kit will be made available for distribution to all partner institutions. The broader societal benefits of the research are an increased understanding of the role of key biota in elemental cycling and the regulation of primary and export production in a fundamental oceanic habitat.",
