 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds to renovate existing research space in the research facilities for the Department of Biochemistry, Chemistry and Physics at the University of Central Missouri (UCM). In addition, a new Center for Alternative Fuels and Environmental Systems (CAFES) has emerged from the Department to better serve the scientific needs of central Missouri communities. The CAFES is currently facilitating projects on alternative energy production, environmental issues and analytical support. The renovated space will improve the conditions for many different research groups.  Work in the renovated facility will include the synthesis of azzaromatic N-oxides, computational and synthetic studies of thiacyclooctatetrenophanes, arsenic and selenium binding studies specific to natural organic matter functional groups, alternative energy projects such as biologic aerobic and anaerobic digestion, fuel formulations, synthetic biodiesel modifications and development of new analytical methods for fuel typing.  Undergraduate researchers in the department and CAFES will monitor nutrient and micronutrient concentrations in soil and runoff water during the production of biomass. Biochemical research projects that will be housed in the renovated space will include investigations of nucleic acids that can form triple helices, which will be categorized as either intermolecular or intramolecular complexes.\r\n\r\nThe renovated facility will support training programs for undergraduate research students and will allow the department to expand K-12 outreach programs including the ACS-SEED program to provide opportunities to underrepresented groups. CAFES as part of the Department of Chemistry will facilitate external collaborators from throughout the region.  The program will also use the facility and the CAFES to reach out to external collaborators, which may include researchers in small colleges, universities, small businesses, industry, and government agencies.",
