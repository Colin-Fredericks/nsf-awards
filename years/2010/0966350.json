The cohort is being drawn from a target population of engineering students with energy interests and from at-risk groups, with an emphasis on 1st-generation college students.  The project goals are achieved through a combination of scholarship support, academic and personal counseling, and cohort building using a three-pronged approach: cohort building, cohort focusing, and bridging activities.\r\n\r\nThe project builds on existed TRiO, McNair, and Upward Bound projects.  Students are primarily being recruited through existing channels (e.g., Upward Bound) and new ones such as the program web site and engineering outreach.  Twenty students are receiving four year scholarships averaging $6500 annually.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nKey Project Outcomes:\n\nGoal 1: Improve educational opportunities for 1st-generation and underrepresented students\n\nThe selection process for our E-Scholars participant group favored 1st-generation college students and students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in engineering (including females).\n\nAll 22 participants met the criteria for financial need.  15 students (68%) were 1st generation college students, 15 (68%) came from underrepresented groups in engineering.  These included 7 (32%) Hispanic or Latino, 7 (32%) from \"non-Caucasian\" racial groups, and 1 (5%) with a reported disability.\n\nGoal 2: Enhance retention of these students to degree achievement\n\nThe completion rates of our program group was well-above the reported national averages in engineering (see HERI report link below).  Our program\u00c6s 5-year completion rate was 73% (16 of 22), which rises to 82% (18 of 22) after 5.5 years. This compares favorably with national averages for 5-year completion of only 15-32% (see ref.).\n\nThe participants in the program placed a very high value on the financial aid and on the academic support services (especially in years 1-3) that were offered as part of this program.  We also believe that the cohort-based approach used here provided a significant peer-support structure that many students took advantage of in the early years of their studies, which helped develop good study habits early on. \n\nHERI Report:\n [http://www.heri.ucla.edu/nih/downloads/2010%20-%20Hurtado,%20Eagan,%20Chang%20-%20Degrees%20of%20Success.pdf]\n\n\n Goal 3: Support these students with formal, organized student support programs\n\nThe primary advising activities were handled by the UNR TRiO and McNair Scholars program (partnering with us on this grant).  TRiO counselors held regular meetings with participants, providing advising and monitoring of student progress and financial status.  These formal advising sessions were complemented by regular group meetings (mainly in the first two years) to discuss activities, plan trips, listen to guest speakers, or simply enjoy a pizza meal with mentors and faculty present.\n\nIn year 2, we implemented a \"Laptop Program\" with participants receiving additional support in this second year for the purchase of a computer for their studies (eligibility for this portion of funding was subject to student financial aid eligibility rules).  Feedback from students indicated that this was a valued benefit of the program, but that it would have made more sense to offer it in the 1st year, as many had felt compelled to get a laptop for school use well before they entered year 2 of the program.\n\n\n Goal 4: Develop a highly-educated and skilled workforce for energy industries\n\nBeyond the students\u00c6 regular coursework, this project aimed to provide opportunities for further professional development in the theme of energy.   Most of the activities and field trips conducted in this project was based on this theme, and provided out-of-the-classroom exposure to the subjects encompassed in the energy theme.  The STEM and \"energy\" themed activities that were conducted included workshops and guest speakers to expose students to the energy industry, and numerous field trips to hydroelectric, solar, geothermal, nuclear, natural gas, and coal electrical plants across the Nevada and California region.\n\nThis goal (Goal 4) was initially framed with the intent of preparing engineers for careers in energy.  However, we found that although the cohort had such intentions when entering college, by the time they graduated, there was a noticeable amount of wandering across the disciplines of STEM, and that this was (in hindsight) a natural and healthy phenomenon.  We encouraged and supported students pursuing the Renewable Energy Minor in the College of Engineering, and several of our graduated participants started jobs in energy or entered graduate school to study energy-related topics.  6 of our 22 participants earned this degree minor, ..."
