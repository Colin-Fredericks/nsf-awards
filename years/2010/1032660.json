 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to discover then disseminate tablet computer based teaching methods for engineering preparatory courses in community colleges.  The project will finalize development of materials which can be used for both face-to-face and distance education courses, support training of community college faculty in using these materials, and investigate the barriers to adoption of the materials in community college classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be the creation of networks among faculty who seek to overcome the challenges associated with offering high quality pre-engineering content at a range of community colleges.  The project, if successful, will help to increase the number of community college students who successfully transfer to four-year engineering programs.  Of particular note is the project's plan to impact a significant number of economically disadvantaged students and students from underrepresented groups who are enrolled in high numbers in community college programs.",
