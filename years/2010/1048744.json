 "awd_abstract_narration": "1048744\r\nZuo\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The objective of this research project is to establish and demonstrate a cost-effective and industrially scalable fabrication process of magnesium silicate (Mg2Si) and filled skutterudite thermoelectric (TE) components directly on cylindrical exhaust pipes using advanced thermal spray technology.  The research approach progresses from non-equilibrium material synthesis and bench mark study of initial process optimization using low-cost FeSi2, and then transitioned to Mg2Si and filled skutterudites.  A combined additive (thermal spray) and subtractive (laser cutting) processes will be used to pattern the various TE and support materials onto cylindrical pipes as most vehicle exhaust components.  And the thermoelectric property of the TE device will be fully characterized. The proposed research will be completed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of expertise from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, and the Center for High Pressure Research at Stony Brook University, and the Advanced Energy Materials group in the Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: If successful, the results of this research will provide a low-cost, large-scale, workable solution to integrate vehicle TEGs for significant fuel savings with concomitant benefits to energy usage and the environment. It creates a new approach for low-cost manufacturing of silicide and filled skutterudite thermoelectric materials and devices for higher ZT. The proposed process eliminates the complicated assembly steps required in conventional, module-based TEGs.  The interface adhesion between material layers is intrinsically strong, with no adhesives or mechanical clamping required, and thus enhances heat transfer, interface performance and durability.   \r\n\r\nThis research is integrated with are educational activities that will benefit both quality and diversity of graduate and undergraduate education as well as K-12 students through our one-of-a-kind outreach facilities and programs. The interaction with a national lab and industry at different ends of the application spectrum enable accelerated implementation of the developed knowledge.",

They are particularly attractive for automotive applications to convert exhaust waste heat into electricity to increase the fuel efficiency.  Traditionally, the vehicle TEGs start with material synthesis, module assembly, device design, and vehicle integration.

Several materials including iron silicide, magnesium silicide, and traditional thermocouple materials were thermal sprayed and fully characterized for their thermoelectric figures of merit.  The insulating and conducting layers of the device were successfully thermally sprayed and laser patterned to form electrically isolated regions. We demonstrated the 3D fabrication of the thermoelectric devices using thermal sprays and laser micromachining. The thermoelectric performance of the thermal sprayed materials, however, had performance somehow lower than the traditional methods.   This is attributed primarily to (1) the difficulty of obtaining high-quality thermoelectric feed stock,  (2) chemistry changes during the thermal spray process including oxidation and decomposition, (3) lower electrical conductivity because of the interface at layered microstructures of thermal sprayed materials.   Further work is needed to develop higher-quality source powders, and to better understand the fundamental physics during the thermal spray process to preserve the unique thermoelectric qualities of the source materials.\n\nIn terms of broader impact, the project was beneficial in bringing together the non-traditional fields of thermoelectric materials, thermal spray, laser processing, and fundamental materials science.
