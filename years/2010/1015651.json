The building of dams and other freshwater deviation projects throughout the mainland has led to changes in the natural discharge of rivers and creeks into these dynamic coastal systems.

Mangroves are salt tolerant trees that grow along coastlines and within swamps. These forests provide habitat and shelter for marine life; they serve as nursery areas for a wide variety of tropical fish, birds, crabs and sea snails. Pioneering plant species are the first to establish after a major disturbance to the landscape, these mangroves help stabilize sediment and create an environment where degraded costal systems can regenerate.</p>\n<p>I was interested in examining how the seeds of Mangrove Apple respond to the highly variable environments present along the coastlines. &nbsp;Until now information available about this particular species has been limited, but if we ever attempt to re-plant these trees into degraded sites as part of a restoration plan, it is crucial that we know the optimal conditions for its growth.
