 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in partial support of a workshop on Engineering Response to Climate Change: Adaptation, Mitigation, and Sustainability,to be held in mid-September 2010 in the Washington, DC area.  The workshop will focus on the integration of mitigation and adaptation approaches and will emphasize the centrality of engineering in developing a sustainable technological roadmap for climate change response.  The goal of the workshop is to identify key engineering challenges, needed advances, and systems level approaches to reduce future vulnerability to climate change.  The workshop will focus on the U.S., but with the perspective of a global framework.  The participants will be drawn from multiple disciplines, including engineers, climate change scientists, ecosystem biologists, and public policy researchers.  Workshop sessions are designed to be interactive, cross-cutting, and focused on outcomes.  The workshop report will address conclusions from the workshop including research frontiers and identification of research needs in adaptation, mitigation, and sustainability in response to climate change, from the perspective of engineering response.  A new website will be created for the materials for the workshop and the workshop final report.",
