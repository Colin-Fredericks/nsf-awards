 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is recruiting two cohorts of six students in the mathematical and physical sciences from the disciplines of chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, physical science and physics and offering them full scholarships for four years. The goal is to support each of these students through completion of a baccalaureate degree in a mathematical or physical science discipline so they can enter the science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) workforce.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  The program, based on the research literature on recruitment and retention of students, includes six elements: financial, academic and psycho-social support, mentoring, professional development for students, and faculty development. These components build upon ongoing activities within the college. Each element is being assessed through data regularly monitored by the college, and through instruments developed by a faculty learning community. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The college expects the program to lead to better experiences and better retention among all science students at the college. Since many institutions share the need to improve retention of students in STEM disciplines, the program is having a broader impact through dissemination of findings via publications and presentations.",
