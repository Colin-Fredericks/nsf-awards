 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to research problems on the intergalactic medium (IGM), quasar evolution, and galaxy formation by analyzing the spectra of close quasar pairs.  The existing dataset, comprised of over 100 pairs, enables a wide range of exploration in this grant period, including 1) Investigating the thermal history of the IGM at redshifts of 2 to 3;  2) Providing the first robust measure of the transverse proximity effect on scales of a few hundred kpc to several Mpc; and 3) Studying the physical state of the halo interstellar medium in the massive, high-redshift galaxies that host luminous quasars.   The program will assess the chemical abundances, ionization state, density, and kinematics of the gas at impact parameters of tens to hundreds of kpc from bright, redshift 2 to 4 quasars. These observations will inform the processes of massive galaxy formation and the nature of quasar feedback at high redshift.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students recruited from a Hispanic Serving Institution, graduate students, and a postdoc, and public outreach activities.",
