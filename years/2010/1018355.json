 "awd_abstract_narration": "Desktop computers run many different applications, the\r\ncompromise of any one of which can compromise the entire desktop given\r\nthe lack of isolation among applications.  Recovering a compromised\r\ndesktop remains a time consuming task, which typically requires wiping\r\neverything and reinstalling the system from scratch.  These \r\nsecurity issues pose fundamental challenges as desktop computers are\r\nrelied on for everything from financial transactions to\r\nmedical records.  To address these problems, we are creating novel\r\nvirtual layered file system (VLFS) technologies to improve system \r\nsecurity.  Unlike a traditional file system which is a monolithic \r\nentity, a VLFS dynamically composes together a set of software layers\r\ninto a single file system view for a desktop.  Changes to one layer\r\nare isolated and decoupled from changes to another.  The VLFS dynamic\r\ncomposition feature enables powerful and easy-to-use security\r\nfunctionality.  We are using VLFSes to build an architecture to enable\r\nsecurity patches to be deployed effectively when managing large\r\nnumbers of heterogeneously configured machines, and to speed system\r\nrecovery from security exploits.  We are also using VLFSes to develop\r\na transparent desktop application fault containment architecture that\r\nis effective at limiting the damage from exploits to enable quick\r\nrecovery while being as easy to use as a traditional desktop system.\r\nThe results of this proposal will provide a foundation for future\r\ncomputer innovations to provide improved system security for users'\r\nsystems.  Because we are working with industry-standard operating\r\nsystems and binary application and patch distributions, our results\r\nwill be directly applicable to the commercial world.",
