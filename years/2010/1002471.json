The symposium will continue for three full days and two half days and will involve approximately 55 invited and contributing speakers, three distinguished keynote speakers, plus a poster session.  Over the past five years this symposium has become a regular feature of the TMS annual meeting.  Significantly, it brings biomaterials into a forum where biomaterials has not traditionally been included in the discussion.  Thus, materials scientists with backgrounds in ceramic and metallic materials are afforded an opportunity to learn how their expertise can be brought into play in the fast growing biomaterials arena.  The following symposium sessions are planned:\r\n\r\nBio-inspired Materials Design and Processing I: Macromolecular Concepts and\r\n\tApplications\r\nBio-inspired Materials Design and Processing II: Bioceramics and\r\n\tBiomineralization\r\nMechanical Behavior of Biological Materials I: Nature-inspired Materials\r\nMechanical Behavior of Biological Materials II: Hard Tissues and their\r\n\tReplacement Materials\r\nMechanical Behavior of Biological Materials III: Soft Tissues and Materials\r\nSurface Engineering: Biomimetics and Biological Applications\r\nComputational Materials Science\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  A noteworthy characteristic of this symposium is its emphasis on involving students in the oral and poster presentations.  Indeed, all of the funds requested from NSF will be used to cover the travel expenses of student participants.  Review of the list of invited and contributing speakers shows that the organizers have been appropriately attentive to the NSF priorities of broadening participation and integration of research and education.\r\n",
