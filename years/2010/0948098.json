These images will define the extent of the subducted slab beneath the Baja California Peninsula and define where the mantle is upwelling beneath the Gulf of California.  This region is of high interest to the MARGINS community and results from the study will be relevant to those studying the spatial and temporal variations in volcanism in the Gulf of California, and those trying to understand the tectonic history of Baja California.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broader impacts include support of a graduate student and involvement of an undergraduate during the summer months.  The results will be of interest to a broad community of geologists and geophysicists.",

The magma generation process in the Gulf of California has enlighted the full geoscience community on how oceanic crust is created and the forces at play near Mid-Ocean Spreading centers.
