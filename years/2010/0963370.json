 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nFunds are provided to renovate the Biology Research Laboratory in the Classroom Building at the Schuylkill Campus of the Pennsylvania State University. The Lab was originally designed and constructed in the 1960s, and it has received little modernization since then. Consequently, it is severely deteriorated and outdated. The biology faculty at PSU Schuylkill conduct research in three major areas: parasite transmission and host-parasite interactions, effect of prenatal drug exposure on neurological development of mice, and chemical interactions of invasive plants and plant-soil interactions. The lack of adequate research facilities has severely impaired the ability of the faculty to conduct their research. The renovation will update the overall physical condition of the Biology Research Lab, construct a small vivarium where mice and mosquitoes can be raised, and improve the lighting and climate control of the greenhouse to make it better suited for research applications. One impact of the renovation is to increase significantly the number of students, especially minority students, who are involved in independent research projects and research training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  Success metrics (initiated, underway, measurement, success or completion, documentation) \n\nCompletion of construction.\nResearch projects have been completed.  We secured local funding for the projects, recruited undergraduate students, obtained IACUC approval (Medica) and the results are described, below. \n\nFour students conducted research with Dr. Medica during the spring semester on the attraction of mosquito larvae to specific chemicals, and presented their results at an undergraduate research conference on campus, and at a regional undergraduate research symposium at Penn State Hazelton.  \nDuring the summer, 2013, three students worked with Dr. Medica on the effects of riboflavin supplements on mosquito feeding behavior.  Riboflavin was administered orally and by injection in mice, and the feeding behavior of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes on these mice was measured.  There was no significant difference between the feeding behavior of mosquitoes on mice given riboflavin supplements and controls.\nDr. Heisey\u00c6s research focuses on tree-of-heaven, which is a common tree in Pennsylvania.  Tree-of-heaven produces chemicals in its roots and bark that are toxic to other plants.  Recently, it was discovered that tree-of-heaven seeds also contain high concentrations of the chemicals.  Dr. Heisey and his students investigated the ecological role of these chemicals.  They found the seeds did release compounds that inhibited other plants.  They hypothesized that the chemicals might also inhibit bacteria and fungi, thereby protecting tree-of-heaven seeds from pathogens.  Tests done by the students, however, showed the chemicals did not have antimicrobial effects.  An alternative hypothesis is that the chemicals are toxic or repellent to insects, thereby protecting tree-of-heaven seeds from being eaten by insects.  The students found that the chemicals did strongly inhibit feeding by certain insects.\n\n\nThe prospectus for a four year Biology degree at Penn State Schuylkill has been submitted to the Administrative Council on Undergraduate Education and will be considered at their December meeting.\n\n\n \n\nReview major action items for the previous year\n\nIACUC approval of animal facility\nMove-in\nFaculty and student research projects\nSubmission of prospectus for four year degree\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rod Heisey"
