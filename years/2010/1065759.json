 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to create new methodologies based on the concept of shell mechanics to investigate the complex and strongly nonlinear behavior of a number of inorganic and biological systems. The study will be carried out by developing technical models, detailed numerical simulations and experiments in two different testbeds that are of fundamental importance to the engineering and biological communities: i) stable localized structures in dynamical systems, and ii) patterns in plants and nature. The behavior and function of the systems will be studied by modeling the response of strongly deformed shells. The application of shell mechanics in simulating the behavior of these systems has the potential to provide unique tools for their investigation, while also exploring and highlighting the cross-disciplinary applications of shell mechanics.\r\n\r\nStrong efforts are planned to link the research results to educational activities and outreach, by curriculum development reflecting the interdisciplinary philosophy at the university level and by practical training for K-12 students. In this context, an educational website called \"Science of Shapes\" will be created to translate research into the K-12 and large science community.",
