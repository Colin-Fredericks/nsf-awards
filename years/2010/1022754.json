 "awd_abstract_narration": "The BRAID 2.0 project is: (i) creating intensely BRAIDed clusters of freshman undergraduate science and technology courses and (ii) pursuing a longitudinal research study of both the change in attitudes and understanding of students and faculty over time. Over four years the project is generating five sets of multiple curricular BRAIDs, that explicitly tie the overlapping topic content of three disciplinary courses, e.g. Math, Chemistry and History of Science, with a small additional weekly seminar class that emphasizes interdisciplinary discussions between students and all three faculty. In research, this project employs a longitudinal study tracking the performance of students who pass through the BRAID curriculum (and controls, i.e. students who do not participate) as they continue in their upper-level courses and progress to graduation. We expect the participating students to show improved interdisciplinary thinking skills and improved performance in subsequent upper-level courses where topics become quite interdisciplinary. These gains during the BRAID experience and following in the tracking years are being examined via expert interviews, surveys and course performances. In addition we are also studying change in faculty expertise and attitudes over time. In this project we are gathering data to strategically contribute to research on undergraduate learning of science. These results have direct applications for improving educational practice in undergraduate science and technology courses. They will impact our understanding of how this experience catalyzes change in students' attitudes and understanding, as well as in that for participating faculty.",

We believe \"future\" scientists will need to understand more than their \"first\" discipline (like their first language) to be highly successful. Therefore, innovative teaching approaches are needed to educate our students and prepare them to become scientists.\n\n \n\nWe spent several years developing and testing out new \"BRAID\" classes that included multiple topics rather than just one (mixtures of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and HPS[1]). These were taken by freshman and sophomore-year college students at Michigan State University (MSU). Students who took these classes were interviewed regularly and we tracked how well they did in courses taken after the BRAID class.\n\n \n\nDuring this grant, we ran a formal research program that implemented our \"high dose\" model of BRAIDing which involved three faculty from different fields together with students in a small classroom to debate and discuss connections between their three different fields (like biology, chemistry and history).

This lower stress environment, where students were able to share their own ideas and (perhaps equally importantly) join faculty from different disciplines in debate, allowed students to practice and gain confidence in creating connections between disciplines.  As one student said during a reflective interview, the best aspect of the BRAID seminar was:\n\n \n\n\"Well it was with the connections because sometimes they\u00c6re really hard to see when you\u00c6re just in your separate classes.  You don\u00c6t really think about the HPS aspect of chemistry or something like that or the biological aspect but with those discussions we got to pick a topic and then see each way that it connects with different things.  Then since you see those connections now then you can go to class and then you can also start making connections by yourself.\" \n\n \n\nThis kind of response was typical about the students expressing what they felt they had gained from the process.  Very few students indicated that they felt that they would have been able to make similar connections on her own without the class.\n\n \n\nImpact on faculty\n\nAs mentioned earlier, science teaching at the university remains slow to change. So to make innovative classes sustainable we also need to determine how to train faculty to teach them. We have observed evidence of change that occurred when three faculty worked together teaching the \"high dose\" class. The ten individual faculty who participated in the project by teaching at least one of the courses were effectively involved in a long-term training experience. Faculty spent up to a year wo..."
