The meeting is both integrative as well as timely and addresses many current topics of interest in both hydrologic sciences as well as surface earth processes. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a pre-meeting weekend Graduate Research Seminar on ?Emerging Research Opportunities and Challenges In The Characterization And Simulation Of Geological CO2 Storage?. The discussants will focus on a current topic that poses interesting and important couplings for reaction and transport in the national interest. \r\n",
