We were especially pleased to see a large number of junior researchers and graduate students at the conference.\n\nDesigns, codes and geometries are important research areas in discrete mathematics. Geometry, of course, has had a long history, while the areas of designs and codes are relatively young. Combinatorial designs first arose in recreational mathematics problems, such as Euler's 36 officer problem, and later in the design of statistical experiments. They have many applications in other disciplines, including coding theory, cryptography, computer science, and electrical engineering. Designs, geometries and codes are intimately related. Many efficient error-correcting codes are constructed from designs and geometries. These codes are used nowadays in our daily life, for example, in CD players, high speed modems, and cellular phones. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Qing Xiang"
