 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. The first 500 million years of Earth history - the Hadean Eon - is a period of 'lost' time as there is virtually no rock record preserved from this interval. However, the PI and colleagues have samples of detrital and xenocrystic zircons from western Australia (Jack Hills) with ages between 4.0 and 4.4 Ga. A massive analysis campaign has identified many thousands of these ancient zircons, and investigations of these grains have been interpreted to suggest the presence of liquid water at the Earth's surface, significant growth of continental crust, a mature sediment recycling system, and perhaps operation of plate boundary-type processes during the Hadean. Such evidence suggests the possibility that the very early planet was much more similar to the present day Earth than previously thought and this stimulates and justifies new measurements. Analytical developments, analysis programs, and experiments are proposed to address the following questions: 1) Could Hadean Jack Hills zircons have been formed by impacts? 2) Do Hadean zircons record the terrestrial counterpart to the ~3.9 Ga lunar cataclysm? 3) What happened to the highly enriched (low Lu/Hf) reservoir seen in 3.9- 4.3 Ga zircons? 4) Do mineral inclusions in >4 Ga zircons retain a pristine Hadean record? 5) Are available barometers applicable to inclusions in Hadean zircons? 6) Do Pu-U variations in Hadean zircons reflect water-mediated fractionation? and 7) Are the collective isotopic, mineralogical, and thermometry data evidence of Hadean continental recycling and plate boundary interactions? Proposed investigations include: 1) Laser ablation ICPMS measurement of initial 176Hf/177Hf in 3.9-3.6 Ga zircons, 2) U-Th-Pb ion microprobe depth profiling of >4 Ga zircons, and 3) characterization of zircons formed in terrestrial impact melts, 4) Hadean Pu-U geochemistry from fission Xe isotopes, 5) Nd isotopic systematics of Jack Hills zircon, 6) NanoSIMS analysis of Si/Al in micron-sized muscovite, 7) K-Ca dating of Hadean muscovite inclusions, and 8) calibration of the Si-in-muscovite barometer for\r\nperaluminous granitoids.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This research will directly benefit the UCLA graduate students supported by this project. Once trained on the ion microprobe, these students in turn provide support to visitors (including numerous graduate students) to the NSF-supported Keck Center for Isotope Geochemistry (see below). Several small projects have been identified that will be used to engender undergraduate research opportunities.\r\nResearch outcomes are of international interest and could be akin to the results of a planetary exploration mission if the Hadean paradigm is overturned. This project showcases scientific and technical leadership in a field of global interest, aids in capturing the imagination of young people considering a career in science and technology, and provides training opportunities for young scientists. Research results will be communicated to the scientific community via high citation impact scientific journals and to the public through sustained outreach activities (see http://sims.ess.ucla.edu/outreach/outreach.php).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough our planet is 4.5 billion years (Ga) old, the oldest known rocks preserved in the geologic record are only ca. 4 Ga in age.  However, grains of the mineral zircon have been found deposited in later sediments which can be isotopically dated (using the U-Pb system) to have crystallized earlier than 4 Ga.  The Jack Hills locality in Western Australia yields abundant zircon between 3.8 and nearly 4.4 Ga in age, and the geochemistry of these zircons has yielded much information changing our view of early Earth &ndash; for instance, earlier work has suggested that there was probably liquid water involved in the zircons\u00c6 formation, instead of the dry and inhospitable surface often envisioned for earliest Earth.\n\nThis project aimed to address several issues about Earth\u00c6s first few hundred million years using the information locked away in the Jack Hills zircons.  First, it has long been assumed that during this time, the Earth was pummeled violently by meteorite impacts such that the surface must have been much more inhospitable (potentially sterile) than more recently in its history.  Second, investigations of rocks from the Moon have led to the hypothesis that several hundred million years (most popularly ca. 3.9 Ga) after Earth and Moon\u00c6s formation, a large spike in meteorite impact rates occurred, forming many of the large craters we can see today on the lunar surface &ndash; and leaving a similar (or more intense) mark on Earth, which has since been erased by erosion and plate tectonics.  Evidence for very ancient continental-type crust has been found in the geochemistry of the &gt;4 Ga zircons (using the Lu-Hf isotopic system), but it was not clear the longevity and ultimate fate of this early crust.  Lastly, the zircons often contain trapped crystals of other minerals (\"inclusions\") which yield significant information about their host magmas and formation environments, but questions have been raised about whether the zircons had preserved these inclusions unaltered (\"primary\") over 4 Ga of Earth history.\n\nDuring the course of this project, we developed methods for chemically distinguishing zircon grown in impact events, which demonstrated that the majority of Jack Hills zircons do not appear to have been impact-related.  It appears that the region of Earth\u00c6s early crust represented by the Jack Hills zircons was not dominated by meteorite impact processing, calling into question this popular view of early Earth.  We also showed that many &gt;4 Ga zircons have younger rims grown on them dating to ca. 3.9 Ga; we interpreted this along with distinctive geochemistry among many 3.9 Ga zircon cores as evidence for metamorphic heating. This may suggest a signature of this bombardment event in the zircon record despite the lack of evidence for newly grown zircon in impact-formed magmas at this time or earlier.  Zircon Lu-Hf results also suggest that the ancient continental-type crust seen in the &gt;4 Ga zircons disappeared between 3.9 and 3.7 Ga.  We developed criteria for distinguishing primary versus altered inclusions in the zircons, confirming a primary inclusion population that is granite-like in character.  This also allowed for the identification of a primary graphite inclusion in a 4.1 Ga zircon, whose isotopic composition will help form the basis for understanding the carbon cycle and the potential for life during the Earth\u00c6s first few hundred million years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: T.
