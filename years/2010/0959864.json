 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the purchase of a next-generation sequencing system for the University of Puerto Rico- Rio Piedras.   The new sequencer system will support a range of research projects investigating biodiversity research in the Neotropics. The new system will significantly enhance research productivity and the training of students in this area.  Focal research areas are: 1) environmental genomics, 2) developmental genomics, 3) evolutionary and ecological genomics, and 4) bioinformatics. All projects foster inter- and trans- disciplinary synergies and interactions among research fellows within each research area, with other research areas, the University of Puerto Rico, and the local, national and international scientific communities. The intellectual merits of this project are fourfold: 1) enhance competitive research in a primarily Hispanic serving institution of secondary education; 2) train next generation of researchers in the use of world class genomic and bioinformatics techniques; 3) provides higher visibility for basic science research as a science career option to Hispanic students by providing competitive and attractive research training opportunities and, 4) builds an operational mechanism for inter- and trans-disciplinary research within the University of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. The broader impacts of the proposed activities include an expansion of genomic and bioinformatics services to the University of Puerto Rico research community. In addition to these services, seminars and workshops to researchers and students throughout academic institutions in Puerto Rico will incorporate data from the new sequencing system.   Such activities result in significant synergic and integrative activities in research, education and knowledge-transfer among disparate research areas that use genomic science. The acquisition will also support efforts to increase access to genomic data and the numbers of trained Hispanic minority professionals engaged in research and education. Data from the studies performed with the new sequencer will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and disseminated by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.",
