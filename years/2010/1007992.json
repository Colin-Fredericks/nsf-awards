 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an observational program to obtain precise measurements of various types of binary stars in order to test models of stellar structure.  In general, most theoretical models are calibrated using the properties of the Sun; the models for other stars are therefore extrapolations in stellar mass or composition.  The main goal for this project is to obtain spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data for certain nearby, low-mass stars to improve the empirical mass-radius relation to a precision of a few percent.\r\n\r\nData from this project will lead to improved models of stellar evolution, which can be applied to a variety of problems in stellar astrophysics including the accurate determination of the properties of extrasolar planets.  The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate researchers.",
