 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Olga Griffith of the University of Arizona as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.   Dr. Griffith will work with Prof. Neal Armstrong to investigate the donor-electrode and acceptor electrode interfaces in model materials that mimic those found in solar photovoltaics.  The research will use a variety of electron spectroscopies, in addition to scanning probe microscopies to study these systems.  Additional work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. David Ginley, a scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.   For her plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with students (8-12 grade) and teachers at the Tucson Wildcat School to develop curricular materials which teach science and engineering principles through energy-related projects.  Many of the students served will come from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Griffith is aimed at developing a better understanding of the intricacies of the conversion of solar energy into useful electrical power.  Results from research like that supported here will lead to better, more efficient, devices for the conversion of solar energy.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Griffith are aimed at effectively engaging a diverse group of young people in science and engineering activities that relate to important societal problems.  The hope of activities like these is to encourage talented Americans to pursue careers in science and technology.",
