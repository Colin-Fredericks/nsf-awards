 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the relation between socioeconomic status, access to media, and political information acquisition and participation across four districts with varying levels of development and connectivity before, during, and after the 2011 presidential campaign in Argentina. By comparing communication and participation processes in different locations both at a time of high political activity (the 2011 campaign) and at periods of routine political activity, this study addresses three interrelated issues. First, it analyzes how structural factors (the level of social, political and economic development and the media system in each location) and individual conditions (citizens' motivation and ability) shape information acquisition and participation. Second, it explores whether the diffusion of the media technologies in different locations facilitates political engagement at varying rates. Third, it assesses whether media use in periods of high and low political activity fosters different degrees of engagement across geographic locations and socioeconomic status groups. This study is grounded on a mixed methods research design which combines in-depth interviews, a panel survey, and content analysis of media accounts. The three methods complement each other:  interviews allow exploring respondents' political, social and informational settings, as well as their motives and interpretations, the panel survey complements the interviews through the statistical analysis of multiple and complex relationships, and content analysis provides an unobtrusive assessment of the media environments to which citizens have access in each location. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the interaction between socioeconomic development, access to media technologies, and political participation in various contexts provides insights for scholarship on civic engagement and on digital inequalities. This research project also has practical implications, as it sheds light on which policies might be used to promote effective use of technologies, equal access to information, and democratic participation.",
