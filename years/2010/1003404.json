Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), which has existed in the U.S. for nearly twenty-five years, is an economic model that exemplifies this growing interest in alternatives to capitalism. CSA farms involve their member/share-holders in diverse non-capitalist practices such as non-market pricing (advance payment directly to farmers), volunteer labor arrangements, community land ownership, and work trades that require members to trade a designated amount of farm work in exchange for the produce they receive. \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research identifies the diverse economic practices that begin with CSA and examines the ways in which they are implemented, whether they are modified or expanded, and whether they are being extended by participants into non-agricultural sectors and activities. Are CSAs fostering new possibilities for ethical, sustainable alternatives in the wider economy or is their potential impact being diminished by market pressures, exploitative labor arrangements, and consumer exclusivity? To address these questions, this study (1) inventories and evaluates diverse economic practices typical of CSA; (2) asks CSA farmers, farm workers, and farm members to explore both the positive and negative aspects of their CSA experience; and (3) prompts them to recognize whether and how their participation in CSA has supported their involvement in diverse economic activities beyond CSA. Data collection involves qualitative research methods including in-depth interviews and focus groups with both CSA farmers/workers (producers) and farm members (consumers). On-site participant observation at six CSAs in Western Massachusetts will provide insight into the role of place and space in CSA experience and the social interactions between producers and consumers. Historical research will provide a context for the origins and evolution of CSA as an economic model. Based on an analysis of the data, the research will identify which geographic conditions, economic practices, emotional experiences, and social interactions at CSA have a positive impact on expanding diverse economic alternatives and which have neutral or negative impacts. \r\n \r\nAs a compelling alternative to mainstream agribusiness food production and distribution networks, the popular CSA movement is increasingly in the spotlight. This study will contribute to our knowledge of the wider impacts of CSA and, more generally, to our understanding of how small scale, diverse economic alternatives develop and become integrated (or not) into the larger economic context. The broader impacts of the study include making the actual practices of a diverse economy and pragmatic alternatives to capitalism more visible to policy makers and economic development specialists. The research findings will assist policy makers at the local, regional, national and international levels in developing more diverse development pathways and resilient economic programs, serving a greater range of needs through offering a wider spectrum of options for participants. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will also provide support to enable a promising young scholar to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",

Instead, the economic practices abundant at CSA and CSE prioritize community control and benefit rather than private gain. This study of CSA and CSE documents the successful efforts of citizens to self-organize community economic development projects. When community groups collaborate in these ways, local and regional government is spared the ongoing costs of managing the projects and of owning and managing the properties. Instead, communities gain direct control and autonomy over setting goals and priorities. Therefore, these resea..."
