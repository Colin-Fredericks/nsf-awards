 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing an Alternative Energy Systems Technology (AEST) specialization at Brevard Community College to meet the increasing demand for skilled energy system technicians in Florida.  By partnering with the state's colleges and universities, professional organizations, and industry employers, this project creates a unified and industry verified training curricula at the post-secondary level throughout the state and provides an education/career pathway for incumbent and dislocated workers.  These partnerships also create articulation pathways to four-year institutions offering an Energy Systems Technology option and/or degree and ensure K-12 curricula align to articulate into the Associate in Science or Associate in Applied Science degrees.  Workforce assessments from industry and research partners in the field of renewable energy allow the curricula to evolve with changing technologies. In addition, the AEST specialization utilizes existing industry certification requirements and newly developed resources from the NSF Advanced Technology Environmental and Energy Center (ATEEC).  Outreach via summer camps engages middle and high school students in the field of renewable energy and especially provides an opportunity to connect with females and under-represented minorities, groups which are not traditionally employed within this occupation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  The Energy Systems Technology Technician (EST2) NSF grant, number 1003674, was a $400,000 dollar grant awarded in 2010 for the purpose of establishing a renewable energy technician training program in the state of Florida at the 2 year college level. Three institutions participated in the grant: Eastern Florida State College, Tallahassee Community College and The Florida State College at Jacksonville.\n\n \n\n   Curriculum frameworks and specific courses included in an associate of Science degree have been added to the program repository for the state of Florida.  Also, a College Credit Certificates (CCC) entitled Alternative Energy Systems Specialist is available for those students who want to enter the workforce without investing a full 2 years in training.  The CCC is structured as a subset of the requirements of the A.S. degree; therefore many students attain it while working toward the A.S. degree.  The courses that are taught and the topics in those courses were chosen by examining the job market and consulting with companies in the industry.  Because Florida has a significant solar resource and little wind or hydro, an emphasis was placed on solar thermal (water and swimming pool heating) and solar electric systems.  Energy conservation is also emphasized.\n\n \n\n    The A.S. degree is in the form of a second year option to the state wide Engineering Technology program taught at 14 Florida colleges.   Although the grant ended June 2014 and no more funds are being allocated, the Alternative/Renewable Energy A.S. degree option is continuing to be taught.  As of fall 2014 four college systems in Florida are teaching it.  The participating institutions are: Eastern Florida State College, Broward  College, Florida State College at Jacksonville, and Gulf Coast State College.  Daytona State College will begin offering the program spring 2015.  A one year unfunded extension to the grant resulted in an additional second year option to the Engineering Technology program in Industrial Energy Efficiency.  It is being taught at the Florida State College at Jacksonville.\n\n \n\n   Articulation agreements from Florida high schools into the program and from the A.S. degree into four years schools have been established.  This provides a pathway from high school through four year college for students to attain an education in the field.  It is not necessary for students to attain a four year degree in the field to find employment.  Students are finding employment with the A.S. degree and with the CCC.\n\n \n\n   The degree and the CCC have been aligned to the NABCEP Entry Level certification.  This nation wide certification shows that students have attained a level of knowledge in the field.  Most students acquire certification before graduation. \n\n   Most students working toward the full A.S. degree also acquire the MSSC CPT certification.  This is the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council\u00c6s Certified Production Technician program. The Engineering Technology program provides the training needed to pass this certification. \n\n \n\n   Funds from the grant were used to pay for faculty training, purchase equipment (including trainers for solar electric and solar water heating systems), curriculum development, alternative energy summer camps for high school students, and to market the program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce Hesher"
