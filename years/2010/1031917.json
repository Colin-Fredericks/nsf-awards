Specifically, the project supports travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for financial reasons and organizes a student poster-presentation program that will facilitate one-on-one discussions and other mentoring with the world's leading researchers in machine learning. Students are exposed to state-of-the-art work by other researchers and have the opportunity to attend tutorials on material that is not taught at their home institutions. Participating students receive feedback from senior researchers beyond their institutional and national boundaries. Furthermore, participation in the poster session and conference helps to integrate these students into the research community and represents a natural integration of research and education.",

Moreover, the design of the program insured that students received valuable feedback on their research.  Those of us on the Board of the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS) that organizes the ICML Conference are grateful for the continued support from NSF that has (and continues to) help many young researchers and improve the quality of the annual ICML meeting.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Fern"
