 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decades of extensive biochemistry and biophysics studies reveal that proteins are not rigid but ever-fluctuating entities. This project will examine the possible functional roles of the observed slow protein intramolecular dynamics in the context of cell regulation network dynamics. Cells regulate their dynamics and signaling through interconnected protein interaction networks. A biological network somewhat resembles a complex electric circuit. It processes input signals, makes decisions and functions against noisy environment. This exploratory project aims to identify general dynamic properties and physiological consequences of typical network motifs coupled to slow intramolecular dynamics. These motifs are abstracted from realistic systems with extensive experimental studies available. The researchers will apply the tools and concepts developed in network studies and perform deterministic and stochastic simulations to reveal the physiological functions of protein conformational fluctuations, which can be fully understood only in the context of cell regulation through multi-level coupling between molecular and cellular dynamics.\r\nThis project will bridge researchers in several different fields, and add generate new insights into our understanding of the regulation and efficiency of biological processes. Examples of the latter include biosynthesis of desirable products such as biofuels. The proposed research will train highly needed multi-disciplinary students.",
