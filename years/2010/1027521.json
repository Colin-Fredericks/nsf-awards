 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide Information Assurance and Cybersecurity scholarships and employment opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students who are majoring in a cybersecurity field. The project's focus is on both recruitment and retention of students including student mentoring and a Student Champions outreach program.\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) has received the National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and Center of Academic Excellence in Research designations from the National Security Agency. UTSA offers both a major and a minor in Infrastructure Assurance at the undergraduate level and a concentration at the graduate level. It also offers concentrations in Computer and Information Security at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project reduces the current personnel gap in cyber security for the national information infrastructure and it presents an opportunity for recruiting minority students. UTSA is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) with more than 58 percent of its students coming from groups underrepresented in higher education. With its ties to the large local cybersecurity industry, UTSA can help address the critical shortage of cybersecurity professionals the nation is experiencing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis purpose of this project was to provide scholarships for graduate and undergraduate students with a concentrationion computer or cyber security.  Upon graduation, the students agreed to work for the government (federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial) for one year for every academic year of support they received.  UTSA proposed to recruit 18 students into the program.   We were able to actually recruit 22 individuals due to a couple factors including individuals who only requested one year of support and individuals who were already receiving other federal financial support.  Of the 22 students, 1 student elected upon graduation to pay the government back all of the money he had received so he did not need to go into federal service.  Of the other 21, 4 are in their first year of scholarship funding and are active in the program.  All are scheduled to attend the federal job fair in January, 2017.  Of those who have graduated, 13 are currently employed by the federal government and 1 has a job offer and is waiting on a starting date.  We have 3 students who have delayed their entry into federal service in order to finish an MS degree.  Two of these students have job offers, one student is still in the interview process and currently does not have a pending offer.  Of the 22 students who received scholarships, 10 were from under-represented groups (3 minorities -- all male, and 7 women).  The program has been very successful and the individuals are all very motivated to enter federal service. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory B White"
