 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Alexej Jerschow of New York University will develop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methodology for enhanced visibility and specificity of sodium ions in soft matter systems. In particular, recent findings and algorithms of optimal control theory will be adapted for the optimization of spectroscopic experiments, thus allowing one to probe the ions' local anisotropy and tumbling motion at the boundary between liquids and solids.\r\n\r\nSodium plays an important function in biological systems by binding to macromolecules, maintaining osmotic pressure, and neutralizing charge. Jerschow's studies will provide new measurement capabilities with relevance to the investigation of metal binding to nucleic acids and proteins, tumor detection in tissues, quality control in food and materials sciences, and void-space imaging. In addition to the education of graduate students and post-doctoral coworkers, the research program will also support continued collaborations with Pratt Institute in the field of spectroscopy in arts conservation.",
