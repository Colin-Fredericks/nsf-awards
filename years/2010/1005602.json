State University will host a two-day, invitational planning workshop for individuals from state and federal marine science agencies and institutions of higher education in NC, SC, and GA. A logic model approach to project planning is being used to identify the regional situation of workforce diversity, regional assets, and successful strategies from previous and current initiatives for increasing diversity in the ocean sciences.  The workshop draws on an existing, extensive partnership network across NC, SC and GA developed by COSEE SE.",
