 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project forms an interdisciplinary research team with integrated \r\nexpertise of computer scientists and biomedical scientists to tackle\r\nthe challenging issues in analyzing protein interaction data. Specifically,\r\nthe project develops a novel approach to detecting overlapping clusters on\r\nemerging large volume of protein-protein interaction data and validates\r\nthe computational approaches in yeast. The vast amount of protein-protein\r\ninteraction data provides us with a good opportunity to systematically\r\nanalyze the structure of a large living system and also allows us to\r\nunderstand essential principles like essentiality, genetic interactions,\r\nfunctions, functional modules, protein complexes, and cellular pathways.\r\n\r\nThe identification of functional modules in protein interaction networks is\r\nof great interest because they often reveal unknown functional ties between\r\nproteins and hence predict functions for unknown proteins. A protein may\r\nbe included in one or more functional groups. Therefore, overlapping clusters\r\nneed to be identified in protein interaction data. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a \r\nunique method to integrate domain knowledge with the protein interaction\r\ndata so that the data will be more reliable. It also develops\r\na unique method to support overlapping modularity analysis for\r\nprotein interaction data that intelligently integrates biological\r\ninformation into the modularity analysis process. Another unique\r\naspect of this project is the tight integration of computational methods \r\nwith biological verification. By associating unknown proteins with the \r\nknown proteins within each functional module, we can suggest that \r\nthose proteins positively work for the corresponding functions that \r\nare assigned to the modules. \r\n\r\nThis project can also find broad applications in other areas which \r\nhandle data with the modular network property, such as web network, \r\nsocial networks, and technological networks.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page:\r\nhttp://www.cse.buffalo.edu/DBGROUP/PPI-networks/index.html",
