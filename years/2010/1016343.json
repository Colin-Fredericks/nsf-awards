 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many application domains, such as intelligence, counter-terrorism,\r\nforensics, disease control, often need to cross-match multiple very\r\nlarge datasets, such as watch lists. Because those datasets may \r\ncontain privacy-sensitive or confidential information, the use of efficient\r\nprivacy-preserving protocols for cross-matching different datasets is\r\ncrucial. The problem of privacy-preserving record  matching has been\r\naddressed by the use of Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocols.\r\nUnder these protocols, the data are converted to series of functions\r\nwith private inputs. However a major drawback of SMC-based protocols\r\nis that they involve extensive cryptographic primitives such as\r\nhomomorphic encryption which do not scale to the size of practical\r\nproblems. As a result, SMC-based protocols cannot be used for resource\r\nconstrained data-intensive privacy-preserving record matching approaches \r\ndirectly. This project develops a novel approach based on the observation\r\nthat to apply SMC to practical applications, one needs to bridge the gap \r\nbetween the size of the datasets that can efficiently be matched using \r\nSMC protocols and the size of the datasets seen in practice. The approach \r\ntaken by the project tackles the problem from a novel angle by developing \r\ntechniques to reduce the size of practical problems by employing \r\nprivacy-preserving data sanitization methods. The project  thus solves \r\nthe privacy-preserving data matching problems through the following\r\nsteps. First, to protect the privacy of data subjects, useful statistics \r\nabout data is gathered using differential privacy. Second, differentially \r\nprivate statistics are shared among the parties involved in data matching. \r\nThese parties then identify potential matching pairs where fruitful matching \r\nmay occur. Such a step is referred to as data blocking. Finally, SMC \r\ntechniques are applied to these candidates to accurately cross-match\r\ninformation. In addition to syntactic matching, semantic matching is supported \r\nby which records are compared according to some semantic similarity functions.\r\nThe semantic matching protocols includes techniques for matching and\r\naligning ontologies, as the use of ontologies is crucial for an effective\r\nsemantic matching. This project is the first to use differential privacy for\r\nefficient privacy-preserving record matching that also leverages semantics-based\r\napproach and a privacy-preserving approach to ontology alignment. The techniques\r\ndeveloped in the project are the first to achieve efficient privacy-preserving\r\nmatching of large scale data sets using differential privacy, thus overcoming \r\nthe scalability problems of conventional SMC techniques. The approach developed \r\nin this project expands the opportunities and contexts for data use by enabling \r\nthe cross-match of multiple data archives, possibly owned by different parties, \r\nwithout violating the privacy of the data. Many applications, of interest \r\nfor our society, will benefit by such opportunities.\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bertino/prirelink",
