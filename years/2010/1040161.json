 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to design and develop a real time simulator integrated with distributed renewable energy sources, storage options, self-healing capabilities, cyber security with power distribution and communication networks for investigating the smart grid technologies with actual hardware in the loop. The approach is to develop a test bed which will provide a unique opportunity to validate the understanding and operation of very complex smart grid systems embedded with cyber security. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is found in the interdisciplinary approach to the development of an innovative design methodology for development real time simulator with distributed renewable energy sources and interface to the utility at very high power levels. The proposed research is of transformative nature due to the integration of real time digital simulation with the hardware in the loop for validation of cyber security for smart grid systems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will have a significant impact on the meeting of the Department of Energy goals of 20% wind energy by 2030. The broader impacts are the (i) workforce development and  research training of future engineers/scientists for the design, build and maintain future smart grid systems, (ii) development of modular courses for integration into existing courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, (iii) recruitment of students from underrepresented groups especially for collaborative project-based learning, implementation, and testing of smart renewable energy systems, (iv) dissemination of the knowledge through short courses, web-based tutorials, and journal publications, and (v) outreach activities to community college and high school students.",
