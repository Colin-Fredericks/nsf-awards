This includes researchers involved in developing prediction systems, understanding mechanisms of decadal and forced climate variability, and assessing the needs of potential users.\r\n\r\nThe participants will include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  In this manner, an open and lively exchange of views on climate science will be enabled.",
