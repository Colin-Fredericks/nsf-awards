 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to develop an array of novel spintronic microwave devices.  These devices are based on the principle that the magnetization of the free ferromagnetic electrode in spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) will precess in the presence of microwave, leading to a resistance change.  The sensitivity and dynamic range for detecting microwave power is comparable to current RF diodes.  What distinguishes MTJ sensors from RF diodes is that their capabilities to measure the microwave frequency and phase without using conventional mixers for heterodyne detection.  This greatly simplifies microwave circuitry and offer opportunities for miniaturization.  It is proposed to use spintronic microwave devices in applications like network analyzers, frequency spectrum analyzers, and microwave near field imaging.  The objective of this proposed research is to demonstrate and understand these proposed spintronic microwave devices.  The important device issues such as sensitivity, dynamic range, and spatial resolution will be addressed and related with magnetoresistance ratio, bias voltage, ferromagnetic resonance, and damping.  An education initiative, targeting at enhancing career opportunity for our graduate students, is also integrated into this research.  \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit includes introducing the spin dynamics in spintronic devices to achieve more functionalities, particularly at microwave frequencies.  The device principles are based on the phenomena that are fundamentally different from those introduced from spin torque transfer, spin pumping, and spin diode effect, yet with simplicity that may immediately impact and significantly advance the current microwave techniques.  Several novel designs are based on the facts that (a) a MTJ device is an intrinsically nonlinear which lead to a rectifying effect, (2) a MTJ device responds to microwave magnetic field which leads to interference effect for phase detection and signal enhancement, and (3) both microwave electric and magnetic fields can be used to create passive devices.\r\n     \r\nThe broad impacts include foreseeable and highly likelihood for immediate impacts on the current microwave technology, particularly in products of network analyzer, frequency spectrum analyzer, and other system on a chip (SoC).  This is possible because spintronic microwave devices are small and does not need additional circuitry such as mixers and phase shifter.   These features also make solid-state microwave near field imaging possible.   Besides the traditional education and mentoring, we will initiate an education and outreach project in order to broaden career opportunities for our students and to develop a much needed course of magnetic information storage and microwave magnetics.  Both subjects are critical to maintain the competitive edge of the Unite States of America in current global economy.",

Spintronics devices have wide applications in information storage system, such as hard-disk drives and MRAM, and applications in biodetection, such as the DNA chip, as well as in the microwave engineering, such as the microwave detector and microwave imaging.   In this project, we focus on the novel microwave devices based on the spin dynamics in spintronics devices.  We have developed a series of spintronics microwave devices featuring power, phase and frequency detection. A prototype device serve as a miniaturized microwave sensor or detector is shown in Figure 1.   We have established both active and passive detection schemes and demonstrated on-chip network and spectrum analyzers using spintronics microwave detectors.  \n    \n\n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US ZH-CN X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                         \nBased on the rectification effect of tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) to microwave magnetic field, we have shown that the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) can work as an active microwave detector. Taking the advantage that the MTJ is sensitive to magnetic field, we extend the dynamic range and minimum detectable power by cascading coplanar waveguides (CPW) of different size.  We further developed a simple structure to measure both microwave intensity and phase, making MTJ microwave detector unique with frequency, intensity, and phase detection capability, which are not possible with other existing single device such as rf diodes.  With the phase detection capability, we built a prototype device to demonstrate an on-chip vector network analyzer and spectrum analyzer (Figure 2).  \nWe have also established a passive microwave detector (no dc bias is needed for detection) using a spin valve (SV) of two ferromagnetic layers (FM) separated with a Cu spacer as shown in Figure 3(a).  The magnetization of one FM1 is fixed perpendicular to the other FM2 layer by using an antiferromagnetic layer beneath FM1. A microwave current generates microwave magnetic field that precess the magnetization of FM2.  The magnetization precession leads to an alternating resistance change resistance of the SV, which gives rise to a rectified dc voltage.    \n\n    \n\n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US ZH-CN X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                         \nThe Intellectual Merit is that we have developed novel microwave spintronics devices and novel techniques to further understand the rapidly emerging phenomena that lead to new physics and device concepts.
