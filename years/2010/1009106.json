 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract\r\nAround the world, harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the marine environment are an increasing threat to human health and coastal ecosystems.  This research will examine the choices and effectiveness of policies for mitigating the economic and public health effects of blooms of the harmful alga, Karenia brevis, along Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast.  The project team will develop a modeling framework comprising statistical models of the dynamics of nature and human demographics, environmental exposure-response models, cost-minimization models, and a policy-simulation model that connects these submodels.  An Education Program will be implemented to evaluate education and outreach tools that have been designed to minimize exposure to risks.  The research will focus on the following: (1) modeling the relationship between nutrient loadings and the frequency, spread, intensity, and duration of HABs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico; (2) clarifying the changing patterns of short- and long-term human population distributions along the Florida Gulf Coast; (3) specifying the connection between HABs as marine hazards (exposures) and human respiratory ailments (responses); (4) inputing the economic costs of illnesses associated with respiratory ailments; (5) demonstrating feasible ways of communicating risks to the public and implementing mitigation policies; (6) comparing the costs of implementing combinations of existing and prospective policies; and (7) characterizing the array of coupling phenomena (time lags, thresholds, feedback loops, surprises, etc.) that comprise the dynamic interactions between nature and humans in the HABs context.  The project is expected to yield insights into a form of dynamic coupling between nature and humans that heretofore has not been studied in depth, one in which policy choices must be made about the relative usefulness of attempts to control either nature or human behavior, or both, in order to reduce harm.\r\n\r\nThis research project will enhance our understanding of how the dynamic interactions between natural and human systems influence and inform society's choice of public policies for mitigating the economic and public health effects of marine harmful algal blooms (HABs).  The coupled natural-human system of HABs and increasing coastal populations on the Florida Gulf Coast appear to exhibit many of the classic characteristics of dynamic coupled systems, such as feedbacks, thresholds, surprises, and legacy effects.  A better understanding of these characteristics can potentially lead to public policies that are better organized, more informed, less costly, and more effective.  The knowledge gained will inform researchers studying other coupled natural-human systems, thereby opening up other lines of research into coastal and aquatic regions affected by natural hazards around the world.",

The organism produces a potent class of toxins, known as brevetoxins, which can be released into ocean or estuarine waters or to the atmosphere as an aerosol when the cells lyse after death. Upon exposure to sufficient levels of brevetoxins, humans may contract respiratory, gastro-intestinal, or neurological illnesses, and ecological impacts may occur, such as fishkills or deaths of protected mammals, reptiles, or birds. Further, local commercial shellfish harvesting areas may be closed, and other local coastal businesses, especially those related to tourism, such as hotels and restaurants, may suffer lost sales.</p>\n<p><em>Kb</em> blooms occur naturally, and more than two dozen hypotheses have been suggested concerning the initiation and maintenance of <em>Kb</em> blooms in the Gulf. It has been theorized&mdash;but it remains unresolved&mdash;that human actions such as nutrient pollution can trigger or worsen the blooms. The hazard to humans from <em>Kb</em> blooms has increased chiefly as a consequence of the geometric growth of human coastal populations along the Gulf coast during the last century (Fig. 1). The coupled, nature-human hazard (Fig. 2) swells and contracts with seasonal fluctuations of coastal tourists and part-time residents (&ldquo;snowbirds&rdquo; and &ldquo;sunbirds&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Given the characteristics of <em>Kb</em> blooms and their human impacts, we concluded that policies that improve the public&rsquo;s ability to understand the dynamic physical attributes of blooms, including their spatial and temporal aspects and the likely scale of impacts to health, recreation, and the economy, are to be preferred over physical, chemical, or biological controls. Although we demonstrated how to compare policies on a quantitative, analytical basis, in this case, such a comparison is unnecessary because the infeasibility of many theoretical policy responses implies that the emphasis must be on policies of scientific research, environmental monitoring, public education, and notification.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear that human activities, such as anthropogenic nutrient releases, are always a direct cause of <em>Kb</em> blooms. However, the apparent weakness of the linkage between human-sourced nutrients and <em>Kb</em> blooms should not be used as a reason to avoid nutrient reduction policies, which have significant ancillary benefits. Indeed, it is sensible to implement controls on the releases of anthropogenic nutrients for the resulting benefits from reductions in high-biomass algal blooms, including blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater and in estuarine settings, and hypoxic or anoxic conditions.</p>\n<p>The dynamic characteristics of <em>Kb</em> blooms as a natural hazard imply that timely and frequent public notifications, including those provided by NOAA through its seven-day HAB-OFS forecasts, are a practical form of risk communication. Approaches to disaster risk reduction at international levels, such as those recommended by the World Meteorological Organization, suggest that alerts, watches, and warnings are preferred policies for hazards with short lead times and durations. As hazard lead times and durations increase, preferred policies also may include forecasting and preparedness planning.</p>\n<p>Where feasible, the public should be notified about the timing and locations of blooms so that they can take actions to avoid impacts to personal health and the economic costs of medical treatments. Individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, among others, may be at heightened risk, and they would benefit significantly from advance and continuing notifications of nearby <em>Kb</em> blooms. We showed how environmental exposure-response models can be used to predict the numbers of human illnesses and to estimate the economic costs of hospitalizations associated with <em>Kb</em> blooms of different scales. Conservative estimates of the costs of medical treatments can be in the millions of dollars for an extreme event (a bloom of long duration and with high cell abundance). Consequently, the capitalized costs of medical treatments can rise to the tens of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Several federal and state agencies and academic or research institutions now are involved in providing information about <em>Kb</em> blooms, but this information is distributed across many institutional providers, produced mainly for specific commercial or government audiences, such as shellfishermen or natural resource managers, and often very difficult for members of the public to access or construe. Consequently, these notifications don&rsquo;t fully solve a problem of the miscommunication of risk.</p>\n<p>A common-sense approach would better enable those residents and visitors who derive significant benefits from coastal recreation to make real-time decisions about how to mitigate their own risks. We cited Mote Marine Laboratory&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beach Condition Reporting System&rdquo; as a leading example of this approach. Research and financial resources could be directed usefully at improving the effectiveness of public notifications about <em>Kb</em> blooms even further. In particular, scientific research needs to be funded on a more consistent basis to improve the ability to forecast blooms, in contrast to the historical pattern of only fleeting spikes in funding that follow severe bloom events (Fig. 3).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/16/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Porter&nbsp;Hoagland</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479321091708_Fig.3CNHDynamics-FleetingScienceandPolicyLags--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479321091708_Fig.3CNHDynamics-FleetingScienceandPolicyLags--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CNH Dynamics-Fleeting Science and Policy Lags\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479321091708_Fig.3CNHDynamics-FleetingScienceandPolicyLags--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CNH Dynamics-Fleeting Science and Policy Lags\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 3: Time series of Kb bloom dynamics showing the fleeting behavior of a measure of Kb science (an index of research funding) and the lagging behavior of a measure of policy response (an index of the enactment of local fertilized ordinances)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Porter Hoagland, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Porter&nbsp;Hoagland</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CNH Dynamics-Fleeting Science and Policy Lags</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479319174335_Fig.1PopulationchangealongtheFloridaGulfCoast1930,2012--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479319174335_Fig.1PopulationchangealongtheFloridaGulfCoast1930,2012--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Population change along the Florida Gulf coast 1930, 2012\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1009106/1009106_10050700_1479319174335_Fig.1PopulationchangealongtheFloridaGulfCoast1930,2012--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Population change along the Florida Gulf coast 1930, 2012\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1: Population density (individuals per square mile) in counties along the Florida Gulf Coast in 1930 (black bars) and 2012 (red bars), from the Panhandle to the Keys.
