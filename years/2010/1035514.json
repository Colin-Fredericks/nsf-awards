Over five years, 44 SMART Scholars are being prepared to teach, and 70 freshman or sophomore SMART interns are participating in research or academic service learning experiences to interest them in teaching. High priority is placed on recruiting students that reflect the student populations found at the 16 high needs partnering school districts, and partnering community colleges who, as teachers, will provide good role models for the students at these schools. After graduating, Scholars are mentored by both a STEM educational college faculty member and a teacher mentor through the SMART Scholar Induction Program.",
