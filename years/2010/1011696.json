 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\nThis is a new 18-month Science Master's degree in NanoScience and MicroSystems. The program curriculum is providing students with the knowledge and skill to turn breakthroughs in nanoscience into innovative commercial technology. It uses project-based learning as a method for integrating education, research, and training in nanotechnology.  It targets the needs of employers by preparing graduates for careers in nanotechnology with local and national start-up companies and established firms.  \r\n\r\nThrough a partnership with the Management of Technology program located within University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management, students are learning skills in finance, marketing, communication, and project management needed to bring new technology to the marketplace.  Entrepreneurship is developed through cohort-based participation in the University of New Mexico's Business Plan Competition. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Nanoscience is an important base of support for key industries in the 21st century.  New Mexico is recognized as a center of nanotechnology research and entrepreneurship.  The University of New Mexico is Hispanic-Serving and classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a research university with very high research activity.  Competitively awarded stipends will be available to the first two student cohorts, helping to ensure broad access to this degree. Internships and research experiences will be tied to the needs of local and national industry and government labs. Upon completion of this degree program, students will be prepared for careers and leadership positions in nanotechnology.",
