 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Penn State- G\u00f6ttingen International Summer Schools in Mathematics\" will be held during Summer 2010 at Penn State University, during Summer 2011 at the Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and during Summer 2012 at Penn State University. The summer school will be scheduled for three weeks and will have a different thematic focus each year. The first two weeks will concentrate on educational activities, while during the third week an international research conference will be held on the featured topic. The target audience for the project is undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics who are based in the U.S. and in Germany. The summer schools integrate education and research and offer international experiences in instruction and collaboration for students at an early stage of their mathematical career. During each summer school, faculty from both Penn State and the University of G\u00f6ttingen will conduct lecture courses and supervise student work. Students will work in international teams to accomplish theoretical work, work in a computer lab, and carry out comprehensive projects. The program will also facilitate networking between students and researchers. Students will experience the research atmosphere in the field at the international research conference. Part of the conference program will be an information forum about graduate work and graduate school application procedures and selection criteria.\r\n \r\nThe summer schools will contribute to attracting and retaining talented students to pursue graduate work and mathematical careers in academia, industry, and government, both in the United States and in Germany. They will provide international education and research experiences, promote the exchange of ideas and mutual understanding of different disciplinary cultures, and will enhance the ability of the participating students to engage in international collaborations in their future professional careers.",
