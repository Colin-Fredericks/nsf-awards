 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide three year support for the University of Notre Dame High Energy Physics Group to continue its exploration of the energy frontier with accelerator-based experiments, particularly the D0 experiment at Fermilab and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Besides extensive hardware contributions and detector commissioning and operations, the physics objectives of the Notre Dame program are broad and will exploit the available data to study top physics, electroweak bosons W and Z, QCD processes, and to search for evidence of electroweak symmetry breaking and other new phenomena. The educational objectives are not only to train postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students to be particle physics professionals but, in addition, to make significant efforts to engage non-traditional participants, high school teachers and high school students, in immersive research experiences at the scientific frontier. This award will provide support for innovative outreach activities and allow the Notre Dame group to maintain its leadership in outreach programs. It is one of the four institutions leading the QuarkNet project, hosts one of the Education Leaders in the Interactions In Understanding the Universe (I2U2) project, and provides support for the USCMS Education and Outreach Coordinator.",

In our experiments we study the basic constituents of matter &ndash; the particles &ndash; as well as the forces that govern their behavior.  All of the experimental results over the past few decades are well described by our \"Standard Model\" of particle physics, including the recent discovery at CERN of the Higgs Boson.  But we know that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there must be new particles and perhaps new forces not yet discovered.\n\n\nThis grant supported the research of the University of Notre Dame experimental particle physics group working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory just outside Geneva, Switzerland.
