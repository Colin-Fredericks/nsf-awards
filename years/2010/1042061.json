 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of Washington (UW), entitled \"NUE: Integrating Nanodevice Design, Fabrication, and Analysis into the Mechanical Engineering Curriculum\", under the direction of Dr. Santosh Devasia, is to prepare mechanical engineers to design nanodevices.  Such educational efforts in nanodevices have become important as nanotechnologies move from research laboratories into industries.  Towards this goal, the proposed NUE in Engineering program will leverage the existing strengths of the mechanical engineering (ME) curriculum in analysis, fabrication, and design of (larger-scale) devices by integrating novel developments and unique challenges in nanodevices into the eight courses in the ME curriculum at UW.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program will directly impact nanotechnology-related education of all of the roughly 120 undergraduate students admitted into UW ME every year.  Additionally, all UW students (in the Colleges of Engineering, and Arts and Sciences) will be allowed to take the ME courses (impacted by the proposed NUE program) as part of a new Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering minor.  Thus, the proposed NUE program will advance interdisciplinary undergraduate educational efforts in nanotechnology.",
