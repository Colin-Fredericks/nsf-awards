 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a nine-day International Planning Visit aimed at developing a collaborative bi-national research program on the role of parental engagement and native language literacy in developing cognitive skills in young children.  Four U.S. researchers and two graduate students will travel to M\u00e9rida, Mexico, to work with Dr. Ismael M. May of the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico - M\u00e9rida.  The goal of the planning visit is to develop a research framework related to (a) the role played by mothers and extended family members in young childrens acquisition of their native language, and (b) the potential for native language literacy as a viable vehicle for the development of cognitive skills in K-6 students in diverse communities.  The project will focus on children, families, and schools located in the Yucatan/Campeche region of Mexico where the native language is Yucatec Mayan, an endangered language.  As primary outcomes of the planning visit, the U.S. and Mexican researchers intend to develop a proposal for a workshop to share research and practice on Mayan language integration in public schools, strengthen research initiatives to preserve and document the Yucatec Mayan language, and exchange ideas on new projects and next steps.  This award is being jointly supported by the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",

Topics covered included bilingualism in Spanish/English, as well as in Mayan/Spanish, focusing particularly on the language minority status of the specific second languages.   \n\nBroader impacts of this project connected faculty and students across the two primary institutions (UTEP and UNAM/CEPHCIS) with other educational institutions, such as the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Yucatan (UADY) and to community based organizations, such as the Asociaci&oacute;n Mayab in San Francisco, CA.  In partnership with these additional collaborators, the impacts of the planning project have reached Mayan-speaking immigrants in the U.S. (recent immigrants), as well as their spouses and extended family members who have remained in Mexico.   The enhanced collaboration has led to a series of meetings and planning collaborations and planning for Informal Science education and/or additional projects to be submitted to NSF in coming months.  These projects aim to engage Mayan immigrant children and families (an underrepresented population) in science education, with benefits to the local and regional communities.\n\nThe collaborative planning with colleagues in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula has also led to pursuit of new binational networking, including the development of a border research consortium, and community development projects that will link U.S. faculty members and students at UTEP with colleagues in diverse regions and at diverse IHE's in Mexico, (UNAM, UACJ, UACh, UADY).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Judith Munter"
