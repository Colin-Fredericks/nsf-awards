 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous organizations including government agencies are sitting on \r\nmountains of spreadsheet data that are becoming increasingly common on \r\nthe web, but whose contents remain out of reach via search engines \r\nbecause direct links to the contents of their constituent cells are\r\nrare.  Thus spreadsheet data represent legacy databases, especially\r\nsince many of their underlying schemas are no longer accessible.  The\r\ngoal of this research is to discover the schema according to which the \r\nspreadsheet is constructed.  The focus is on the spatio-textual\r\nspreadsheet which is a spreadsheet where the values of the spatial\r\nattributes are specified textually.  Such spreadsheets support spatial\r\nsearches whose output is visual and whose utility is enhanced by being\r\nable to handle spatial synonyms.  This is done, in part, by devising\r\nmethods to automatically discover the spatial attributes of the\r\nspreadsheet as well as how to distinguish between several instances of\r\nthem which arise due to the presence of a containment hierarchy.  In\r\nparticular, use is made of spatial coherence which is manifested by\r\nobserving that spatial data in the same column are usually of the same\r\nspatial type, while spatial data in the same spreadsheet row usually\r\nexhibit a containment relationship.  Moreover, adjacent or nearby rows\r\nexhibit spreadsheet coherence in that they are usually similar.  The\r\nbroad impact of this research is to make spreadsheet data a first\r\nclass citizen on the web with the same chances of being discovered and\r\naccessed as data found in other documents.  Reports describing\r\nresults of this and related research will be available at\r\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/~hjs/spreadsheets.html",
