  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSilicon is the second most abundant element on Earth.  However, most of it is locked up in sand or innocuous forms that bear no resemblance to the carefully deposited high-purity silicon in the computer that was used to generate this document or the solar panels which fly nearly 300 miles above the earth on the International Space Station.  In order to create these high purity silicon depositions that are part of so many modern technologies, the high tech industry requires lots of silane gas. Silane (SiH4, pronounce SI-lane) is a pyrophoric gas which auto-ignites at room temperature in the presence of oxygen.  It is formed by attaching four hydrogen atoms to a silicon atom.  To use silane for silicon deposition, the hydrogen is stripped off in the desired location leaving pure silicon behind.  Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art process which feeds our ever growing hunger for silane is a very expensive, energy intensive and toxic process which involves, among other things, molten silicon and large amounts boiling chlorine.  Despite all of the associated risks and costs for the industry and general public, the ends currently justify the means.\n\nElectroDynamic Applications, Inc. (EDA), a small Ann Arbor, Michigan based research company, utilized an NSF Phase I SBIR grant to develop and demonstrate the revolutionary Massey-Peterson Process in a laboratory prototype.  The process uses only inexpensive, low-grade silicon, hydrogen gas and electricity.  At the heart of EDA\u00c6s silane production process is the self-contained, desk-sized Mass Reaction Cell (MRC). \n\nLike the Siemens process it is replacing, the Massey-Peterson Process begins with metallurgical grade silicon that is readily available from a number of suppliers.  However, rather than producing silane through a series of toxic and dangerous intermediate steps, the MRC utilizes advanced chemistry, thermodynamics and metallurgy to transform the silicon directly to silane.  This direct-conversion means lower materials cost and no toxic byproducts.  The efficient nature of the chemistry involved in the Massey-Peterson Process reduces consumption of electrical energy and raw materials all while eliminating toxic intermediate steps and byproducts.  The end result is a disruptive technology that could help reduce costs and the environmental footprint of all devices utilizing silicon semiconductors.\n\nThe completed Phase I technical objectives included the synthesis of trace or better amounts of silane in the MRC and the measurement of silane production as a function of the processing parameters.  As the program moved forward, a parametric study was conducted to determine the ideal operating conditions to maximize yield and efficiency.  The outcome of this parametric study allowed for the isolated sensitive parameters to be analyzed and enabled a design iteration of the MRC whose final design, construction and operation will be the focus of the Phase II program. \n\nIt is expected that the initial industrial adoption of the Massey-Peterson Process will work to supplement the current production of the primary producers of silane gas, or to supplement the supply of merchant market gas distributors who serve many end users.  In this way, primary producers will be able to scale production without multi-hundred million dollar expansions to existing production plants, and gas distributors will be able to expand their current catalogue of in-house gas production.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/29/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dean R Massey"
