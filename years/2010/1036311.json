 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowie State University's (BSU) project entitled: Building Excellence in Teaching, Training, Education and Research, will incorporate improvements and enhancements of STEM undergraduate education  based on lessons learned,  an evaluation of the strengths and accomplishments of the existing program, and an assessment of where BSU  needs to go to meet its existing needs. The project will expand outreach, teaching, and mentoring activities through the following three objectives: 1) redesigning gate keeper courses, curricular development, revision and enhancement reform, 2) expanding pathways for undergraduate recruitment, enrichment, retention and research experiences, and 3) strengthening faculty development activities. The goal is to improve all STEM programs at BSU by addressing existing weaknesses and by strengthening the research infrastructure \r\nThe project will establish partnerships with industries and other academic institutions to increase research opportunities for BSU faculty and students.  The project will continue to serve as a beacon to the community, school teachers, students, and industry, putting the spotlight on the acute need for highly qualified STEM graduates. Partnerships with local industries, K-12 teachers, parents, and students, and community agencies will be established, to broaden the participation of minority students in STEM.  The interdisciplinary teaching curriculum and research infrastructure will be improved, which will increase the production of STEM graduates.",
