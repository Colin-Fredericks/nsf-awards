 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) grant provides funding for research that explores the use of probability-based methods to model the behavior of structural systems in fire. The research is motivated by the fact that current methods for modeling structure-fire interaction are unable to account for the high level of uncertainty that exists in the nature of the problem. To overcome this limitation, the proposed research seeks to develop a stochastic approach to account for variability in key model parameters, such as the fire temperature and the strength of materials at elevated temperatures. The project focuses on two methods that are well-established for room temperature applications, specifically, the Monte Carlo method and the stochastic finite element method. The theoretical foundations for each method will be extended to include the effects of fire. In addition, reliability theory will be used to formulate the problem in terms of limit state (or \"failure\") criteria. The end result will be a computational framework that enables stochastic structure-fire simulation, in which uncertainty is accounted for in a rational way and the fire performance of the structural system can be evaluated based on a calculated probability of failure. This quantification of structural reliability is essential for decision-making, as it allows the adequacy of a given design to be evaluated with confidence.\r\n\r\nThis research has the potential to revolutionize the way in which building fires are considered in structural design. While researchers across the globe advocate a need for performance-based structural fire design, the reality is that the engineering profession does not have the analytical tools to realize this shift in design philosophy. The new computational framework that will be developed addresses a critical need in the structure-fire engineering community and can lead to significant improvements in the design of structures for fire. Improved methods of design will inherently result in greater public safety and a more robust civil infrastructure. Educational, outreach, and scholarship activities associated with this project seek to engage a variety of populations in research activities and aim to address central issues that are impeding the advancement of underrepresented groups in engineering.",
