 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Special Projects award funds student support to participate in the first Networking Networking Women (N^2Women) Workshop. The workshop will be co-located with the 16th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2010) and the 11th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2010.  The N^2 Women workshop is scheduled to occur the day before the conferences allowing workshop participants to form connections that can be strengthened during the conferences.  The purpose of the N^2 Women  Workshop is to foster connections among the under-represented women in the communications and networking research fields.  The N^2 Women workshop will be a one day event to provide networking researchers the opportunity to showcase their work and make connections with others.  It will include participants from the industrial, governmental, and academic sectors and offer students an excellent opportunity to learn about emerging research topics and to get connected with others in the networking community. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project resides in the contributions that the student participants will make to the N^2Women Workshop and the two associated conferences as well as the impact on the future scientific progress of the students' research.  The exposure to the research-based technical content will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective fields, with a potential for a long-term benefit of scientific progress for networking research.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project revolve around the development of the under-represented graduate students who are able to participate in the coordinated events through this travel support.  The funds will allow the students to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students.",
