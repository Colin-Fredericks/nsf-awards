Profs. Donahue and Robinson and their students will utilize advanced mass spectrometric techniques to elucidate mixing thermodynamics and kinetics of aerosol suspensions of varying size and composition.  The collaborative team will also explore the role of water in the formation and dynamic nature of aerosols. The results will also provide vital input to a framework for organic-aerosol representation in atmospheric models.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research addresses the impact of aerosols on climate model predictions. This is one of the main uncertainties in current climate models. The study has the potential to transform our understanding of climate processes. It will provide excellent training opportunities to students who wish to train in a cutting edge research field of great societal importance.",
