 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular detection is a pervasive challenge in biology, medicine, and the environmental sciences.  Most often, the detection process is mediated by antibodies or other binding moieties that specifically recognize the target molecules.  Subsequently, the target is imaged or detected by a secondary means such as fluorescence or enzymatic reaction.  Recently, we and others have engineered fluorescence proteins endowed with binding capability that allow facile one-step detection of target ligands as a result of their intrinsic fluorescence properties.  While a suitable substitute for antibodies or other binding scaffolds, the true potential in a fluorescent binding protein would be if the fluorescence generated were a function of the target ligand presence.  In other words, such a ligand-actuated fluorescent protein biosensor would undergo reconstitution or changes in the chromophore upon binding to cognate ligand yielding a fluorescence readout. Here we endeavor to create an ideal ligand-actuated fluorescence protein platform that is compatible with broad library-based identification approaches, analogous to those used in antibody engineering, capable of yielding ligand-actuated fluorescent proteins against a wide range of molecular targets.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the research objectives, this proposal possesses significant broader impact.  First, it provides a new conceptual framework and toolkit for the creation of ligand-responsive biosensors.  In addition, ligand-responsive biosensors could revolutionize the study of processes in living cells and the facile detection of contaminants or toxic materials.  Next, the project is designed to train a graduate student and several undergraduate students in the protein engineering field to prepare them for careers in industry and academia.  To date, the PI has trained 33 undergraduate and graduate students, several of whom are from underrepresented backgrounds.  Research results will be integrated into courses that the PI regularly teaches as protein engineering modules in his \"Design of Biological Molecules\" graduate course and as coupled transport-reaction problems in his undergraduate mass transfer course.  Finally, research results will also be disseminated to high school students in the form of the Wisconsin High School State Science Olympiad, through an \"Applied Protein Modeling for Medical Uses\" symposium that the PI organizes and hosts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project was focused on engineering intrinsically fluorescent proteins so that they could report binding events with various target ligands.  Such fluorescent proteins could have utility in sensing the presence of water contaminants or indicating the presence of toxins, among many other applications.  Technical Merit outcomes of the project included the evaluation of design principles for creation of a fluorescent protein that would only fluoresce upon binding a particular target ligand.  To this end, a fluorescent protein endowed with binding capability was evaluated for its capacity to give a change in fluorescent signal upon binding.  This fluorescent protein scaffold was then further engineered in an attempt to achieve ligand-actuated fluorescence.  It was concluded that while the fluorescent binding proteins were stable and capable of binding target ligands, the fluorescent properties of the protein were incompatible with ligand-actuated fluorescence sensing.  Accompanied by detailed publications in stability and binding engineering of proteins, these outcomes promise to have broad applicability across the engineering field.  Broader Impact outcomes include the training of one postdoctoral researcher, two graduate researchers, and two undergraduate researchers that now have positions in the biotechnology industry or are in advance positions within academia.  The work was also broadly disseminated both through protein engineering courses taught by the Principle Investigator and through the Wisconsin High School State Science Olympiad.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric V Shusta"
