Ching, Stephen H. Loomis, T. Page Owen, Jr., Joseph Schroeder and Peter A. Siver will acquire a flame atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer to advance research and research training activities in chemistry and the life sciences at Connecticut College.  The following research will be carried out: (1) determining elemental compositions of microporous and nanostructured manganese oxides to correlate the influence on particle growth, catalytic activity, and electrochemical performance; (2) establishing relationships between concentrations of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) and the presence of specific species of chrysophyte and diatom algae in freshwater lakes along the North American east coast; (3) determining intracellular volumes in freshwater sponge gemmules by Li+ analysis; (4) analyzing Pb levels in blood and brain tissue of rats to study neuroprotective effects of chemical treatments for Pb poisoning; and (5) measuring soluble metal concentrations in digestive fluids and epidermal peels of carnivorous pitcher plants to study ion transport and salt tolerance in plants.\r\n\r\nFlame Atomic Absorption spectroscopy enables researchers to perform elemental analysis of a sample particularly its metal content.  A flame atomizes the sample that is probed by a light source.  Since atoms and ions absorb light at characteristic wavelengths, identification and quantification of them from their spectral characteristics are realized.  The instrument will be used in research and undergraduate laboratory classes by students at Connecticut College and the nearby U.S. Coast Guard Academy.",
