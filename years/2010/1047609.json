In this proposal PIs seek to address these six key central scientific questions, which have significant intellectual merit:\r\n1) What is the preservation potential of different types of paleosols in the geologic record?\r\n2) What is the fidelity of time and event preservation recorded in paleosols?\r\n3) Where do paleosols \"fit\" in sequence-stratigraphy?\r\n4) Is the current paleoclimate \"toolkit\" comprised of field morphological and geochemical proxies as advanced as it can likely become?\r\n5) To what extent can standard USDA soil physical and chemical characterization techniques be used for establishing colloidal properties of paleosols?\r\n6) Is paleosol research adequately represented within the US National Research Council-National Science Foundation \"Critical Zone\"?",
