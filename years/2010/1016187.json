The R/V Langseth provides t the U.S. academic community seismic imaging that can operate in both 2D and 3D modes.

The research programs operated off the Langseth seek a better understanding of various Earth Science questions such as climactic variability, eustatic records of global sea level change, crustal structure, magma migration, anthropogenic sound and marine mammals, CO2 saturation levels in the Earth\u00c6s oceans and dynamics of a tectonic plate collision.  The Langseth also maintains a general-purpose capability affording researchers the opportunity to utilize the ship for programs involving biological, chemical and physical oceanographic research. \n  \n The Langseth presents a singular opportunity for researchers from across the country and around the world to investigate a range of questions regarding the marine sciences. When operating in 3D mode and towing a 4x 6km  array of hydrophones called streamers and 4 sound source strings, the Langseth enables scientists to develop detailed images of the earth\u00c6s structure, gaining a better understanding of processes that can affect society such as tsunami-generating and otherwise damaging earthquakes.\n\nAnother Langseth contribution is to the  education of students pursuing degrees in the ocean sciences. Participants in these programs include undergraduates, graduates and post-docs. In all cases, the students participate as integral members of a research team, obtaining firsthand experience in \"at-sea\" research.\n\nPublic outreach regarding the Langseth is ongoing throughout any given year. The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory website (http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/research/office-of-marine-operations) provides access for the public to learn about the Langseth\u00c6s capabilities and serves as a window into the world of marine research.\n\n \n\n Impact of 2010 Instrumentation Award Equipment:\n\n The 2010 Instrumentation award provided critical equipment improvements and upgrades for the Langseth in 2010 and 2011. \n\nWith these funds, various areas of technical needs were addressed:\n\nNew computer servers with expanded capabilities are now installed on the Langseth that provide necessary improvements for multi-channel data recording. \n\n\nA new wiring scheme to improve the rigging and simplify the trouble-shooting tasks for the source arrays was devised by Langseth technical staff.  Essential to this improvement was the purchase of new electrical jumpers &ndash; all of which were purchased using this award funds.  \n\n\n3 streamer tow leaders (lead-ins) were re-terminated in order to keep the units not only active but also keep the Langseth capable of meeting the specification for towing 4 streamers in 3D mode.  This award covered costs for the required equipment and technical assistance to complete these tasks.  \n\n\nThe Langseth utilizes streamer recovery devices (SRDs) during all streamer operations.  These units are an insurance factor against losing the streamer(s) completely if a passing vessel (for instance) cut the streamers or streamer control was lost due to loss of propulsion on the Langseth.  These SRDs are self-inflating devices attached to the streamer(s) are set intervals that are rigged to \"go off\" if the streamer reaches a certain depth.  The Langseth\u00c6s complement of these devices was not sufficient for operatio..."
