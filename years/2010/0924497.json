 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit: MicroRNAs are small regulatory molecules encoded in plant and animal genomes that control genes as organisms develop to maturity. By investigating microRNAs one will gain a deeper understanding of how development proceeds from genetic information - an understanding that is relevant to growth and health of diverse animals, including humans, livestock, and wild species. The larval development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an exceptional model system for the study of microRNA function. At least five microRNAs and twelve proteins act together to control a succession of developmental events in the C. elegans larva. LIN-28 is one of these proteins and its molecular mechanism is not known. Many diverse animals possess a gene for LIN-28 which is believed to have many important developmental roles. A combination of molecular and genetic approaches will be employed to answer these specific questions: (1) Does C. elegans LIN-28 bind to and inhibit specific microRNA precursors? (2) Does LIN-28 act via these specific microRNAs to regulate development? (3) Are regulatory feedback circuits involving microRNAs part of a larval development control mechanism? The outcome of this work will be a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these regulators, which will be relevant to other investigators in medical, veterinary, and ecological sciences.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The research will be performed by high school students, undergraduates, and doctoral candidates. Undergraduate students will be recruited from around the Philadelphia/Camden region to participate the research. High school students will spend afternoons working on independent aspects of the project in preparation for science fairs. The PI is committed to reaching underserved and underprivileged individuals for these opportunities. Doctoral candidates will present their findings at international scientific conferences. All strains and reagents generated will be shared freely with other investigators.",
