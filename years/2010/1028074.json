The primary goal of this symposium is the promotion of science by providing a forum for the outstanding exchange of technical knowledge among scientists, engineers, academia and industry leading to solutions in the workplace and in society. Attendees represented industry, academia and government, with a variety of technical interests. The symposium focused on failures in small scale structures (flexible and semiconductor electronic systems, actuators, resonating cantilever, biological systems, fuel cells, MEMS devices, etc) and considered combinations of possible failure mechanisms. Topics included: fracture and deformation of small-scale biological systems, nano-wires/nano-tubes, thin films and film structures, microelectronics, MEMS and micro-pillars.",
