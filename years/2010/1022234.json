 "awd_abstract_narration": "In democratic settings ranging from Italy to Indonesia, we observe the coexistence of free and fair elections with a large number of allegedly criminal legislators.  At the same time, there is a growing concern in many developing democracies that the electoral sphere is increasingly being restricted to a narrow cadre of politicians who boast significant personal wealth.  This study considers the interactive effects between money and \"muscle\" in democratic politics.  The project is motivated by the simple puzzle: why are politicians in democracies often rewarded, rather than punished, for their criminal connections.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a unique source of data, the investigators study the conditions under which candidates accused of criminal misconduct succeed in democratic societies through an examination of India, the world's largest democracy.  The study attempts to address four overarching questions.  First, why do political parties recruit candidates for office who possess serious criminal indictments, and what role does money play?  Second, what impact does alleged criminality have on electoral performance?  Third, what explains the motivations of voters in supporting suspected criminal candidates?  And finally, what are the consequences of money and \"muscle\" for the effective functioning of democratic accountability?\r\n\r\nThe research aims to contribute to our understanding of the relationship between criminals and electoral that is applicable to a diverse range of democratic settings.  First, this study provides a unique method of measuring criminality and political corruption that is broadly applicable to a wide range of democratic settings.  Second, a better understanding of the role of money in candidate selection adds a previously under-theorized dimension to the literature on political selection.  Third, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of the causes and consequences of criminal politicians, namely the underexplored motivations of voters.  Indentifying and explaining these motivations can also help policymakers develop policies that could improve the rule of law and democratic effectiveness in India and other electoral democracies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project, \"The Merits of Money and \u00e6Muscle\u00c6: How Serious Criminality Impacts Democracy in India,\" contributes to our understanding of how democratic elections can coexist with a significant number of politicians implicated in criminal wrongdoing. Specifically, it provides answers to three questions.  Why do parties nominate candidates with criminal backgrounds?  Why do voters vote for them?  And what does their proliferation mean for democratic accountability? \n\nTo address these questions, we draw on a wide body of quantitative and qualitative evidence from India, the world\u00c6s largest democracy.  We argue that parties are attracted to criminal politicians because they have access to financial resources that allow them to function as self-financing candidates.  Whereas the prevailing consensus in political economy suggests that voters support \"bad politicians\" because they lack adequate information on candidate quality, we develop an alternate theory that suggests well-informed voters can display rational behavior by voting for such candidates. \n\nSpecifically, in contexts where social divisions are highly salient, voters often desire a representative who they perceive can protect group-based interests most credibly.  In such settings, criminality can serve as a useful signal of a candidate\u00c6s credibility.  As a result, parties selectively field criminal candidates in those areas where social divisions are most pronounced.  The implications of this study are far reaching because they suggest that information about a candidate\u00c6s criminality is not only available, but actually is central to understanding the viability of his candidacy.  Thus, there are circumstances in which \"bad politicians\" can in fact be compatible with democratic accountability. \n\nWith NSF support, this project has made several important intellectual contributions.
