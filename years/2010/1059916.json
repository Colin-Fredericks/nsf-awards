 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mobile-Tensaw Delta in Alabama represents a sensitive, integrated ecosystem where terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal communities converge to create a transition zone, characterized by high productivity and biological diversity, making it ecologically, economically, and recreationally important to the Gulf region. This project investigates the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure on native aquatic plant communities in this biodiversity hotspot. The investigators have 9 years of data on plant community structure in hand, and they will use these data in a Before-After-Control-Impact design to determine how plant productivity and survivorship are influenced by the anticipated gradient of exposure to PAHs; differences in early successional patterns and community resilience across this gradient; and the presence of thresholds in exposure beyond which plant communities fail to recover. The resulting data will be used to predict how large-scale anthropogenic insults and natural environmental variation affect aquatic plant communities over varying spatial and temporal scales. \r\n\r\nThe results of this project will provide fundamental insight into the broader impacts of environmental degradation and habitat loss, serving as the foundation for later work concerning both basic and applied aspects of the plant community response, and the underlying mechanisms of resilience and susceptibility to stress. Over the course of this one-year project, one graduate and one undergraduate student will receive training in plant taxonomy, physiology, community ecology, and the application of multivariate statistics. Finally, data generated from this research will be an important contribution to plant community conservation and land management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlabama is home to more species of animals and plants than any other state east of the Mississippi River.  Unfortunately, states with high overall numbers of species and a high degree of endemism (organisms that are found nowhere else in the world) tend to boast fragile ecosystems with at-risk flora and fauna, intense human impact, and high numbers of extinctions.  The Mobile-Tensaw Delta (MTD) is one such \"diversity hotspot\" that defines a transition zone between freshwater and saltwater habitats, and is subject to considerable disturbance.  Aside from its ecological importance as a seat of high biological productivity and diversity, this watershed provides critical services (filtration, sediment trapping, mitigation of storm surge) and economic resources (recreational and commercial fishing, shipping, tourism) to residents of the Gulf Coast.  The goal for this ongoing project is to document how human activities (nutrient input, development, and industrial pollution &ndash; including the monumental Deep-Water Horizon oil spill) and natural events (flooding, tropical storms, and drought) affect the unique plant communities of the MTD and the services they provide through time.  For example, can plant community structure be maintained upon exposure to stress?  If not, and the community shifts to a different species assemblage, how does the \"replacement community\" function relative to its predecessor?  Thus far, nearly two years of continuous data have been collected from 16 sampling sites throughout the MTD.  Four sites, two unexposed and two exposed to oil spill contaminants in Weeks Bay and Grand Bay, respectively, were established in 2010.  A plant list was compiled that includes 167 species from 74 families.  Vegetation patterns indicate that few species (e.g., roundleaf greenbrier) are members of plant communities across a wide range of habitats. Rather, species occurrences are predictable according to habitat characteristics that include salinity and temperature.  Moreover, plant distribution varies among four sub-regions of the Delta (Upper, Upper Middle, Lower Middle, and Lower).  Species number varied with season across all regions, but was greatest in the Upper and Middle Delta, with overall plant diversity being greatest in the Upper Delta.  These data provide a baseline for future floristic studies and investigations into the processes that govern environmental health and, hence, determine the quality of life and well-being of Gulf Coast residents. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kelly M Major"
