The program under development will provide mentored, inquiry- and place-based research experiences for participating students that center on processes occurring within the Prospect Park Lake vicinity.  The planning phase of this project includes two planning workshops and a 1-week field research experience demonstration for a sampling of students.  This 1-week demonstration will provide immediate feedback to the planning group regarding the efficacy of proposed strategies that might be incorporated into a fully-implemented program.  Project content is being aligned to New York State Regents exams, increasingly the likelihood of more widespread adoption.  This project expects to specifically recruit among Brooklyn's diverse population in order to broaden participation of underrepresented students in the geosciences.",
