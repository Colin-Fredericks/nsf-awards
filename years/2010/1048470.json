 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2011 to be held March 24-26, 2011 at the University of California, Irvine. These seminars have been held annually since 1981; they have become the most important regular conference series for probabilists in North America. They bring together a diverse group of accomplished researchers and young investigators in probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere. \r\nModeled after P.A. Meyers Seminaire de Probabilite, which propelled the French probability school to the forefront of research in the seventies, the Seminar on Stochastic Processes was created in the eighties by Chung, Cinlar, and Getoor to have the same boosting effect on this side of the Atlantic. This initiative had a tremendous impact on the probability community, reaching far beyond the limits of the North American continent. Researchers from all over the world strive for an invitation as peer recognition of their international standing. The list of past invited speakers is a Who's Who in the world of probability. The scientific committee strives to include successful young researchers, minorities and women in the list of speakers. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.\r\n \r\nThe Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings.",
