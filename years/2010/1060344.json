 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to leverage GENI's deeply programmable core and wireless edge networks to implement and evaluate recently proposed approaches for delivering predictable end-to-end performance to mobile devices. These approaches involve techniques such as inter-flow and intra-flow network coding, multipath routing, available bandwidth estimation, and spare bandwidth exploitation. While these techniques have been studied using simulations, it has never been possible to validate their models and their limits on an operational network without GENI's fine-grained measurement and control capabilities. \r\n\r\nTrue ubiquitous broadband networking cannot be realized without overcoming the bandwidth bottleneck and mobility overheads of future Internet, both at the core and at the wireless edge. Early wireless access deployments in many instances resulted in only marginal improvements in end-to-end data rates to mobile users. Outcomes from this research may influence the ongoing broadband initiatives in the United States.",
