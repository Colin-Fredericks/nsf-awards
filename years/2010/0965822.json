 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  The College is providing scholarships of between $6,000 and $7,200 to 20 qualified STEM majors for each of four years. Disciplines include Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering Science, Physics, Mathematics, and Geosciences (Earth Science/ Geology/ Oceanography/ Astronomy/ Meteorology/ Geography).  The multi-disciplinary team of faculty is strong, and there are extensive support structures for the students. The target is 95% graduation and/or transfer rate among STEM Scholars. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The project is implementing a pro-active recruiting program with area high school STEM faculty and administrators to encourage students toward STEM careers. Students are recruited from the 22 high schools served by the college, and from among current students. New and returning STEM Scholars each year form a cohort/learning community nurtured by faculty mentors, counselors and the PI. Selection criteria include high grades in high school STEM courses, high overall GPA, recommendations from faculty and personal essays. STEM scholars have bi-weekly meetings with faculty mentors, group enrollment in some courses, participation in group study and field trips, and meetings with visiting speakers from education and industry. Career/transfer counseling is provided throughout the program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe S-STEM grant to Waubonsee Community College provided training and resources to 84 future STEM professionals whose new-found confidence and training will ensure their success.  Several have already begun their careers and advanced training, and attributed their success to this program.   Disciplines included: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering Science, Physics, Mathematics, and the Geosciences (Earth Science/Geology/Oceanography/Astronomy/Meteorology/Geography).  The synergistic combination of mentoring, cohort development, experience broadening components, presentations, and research opportunities has developed in these future STEM professionals a skill-set that will lead them to a successful career as a STEM professional.  A total of 68 STEM scholars received a total of $516,421 from 2011 to 2017.  An additional 16 STEM scholars were admitted into the program without financial support, as they demonstrated significant promise, but without financial need.  We were able to retain 86% of our funded STEM scholars in the program to the completion of their studies at Waubonsee.  Of the funded STEM scholars who completed their studies at Waubonsee while a STEM scholar (n=54), 94% transferred to a 4YC/U.  Of all of the STEM Scholars, 66% were male, 34% female, 70% white and 18% Hispanic / Latino.  Most of the disciplines of the STEM scholars were concentrated in either multiple engineering (32%) or computer related fields (23%). \n\n \n\nThere are several ways the success of the program can be demonstrated, such as the end-of-semester surveys and comments by the STEM scholars, including, the \"NSF STEM scholarship transformed my self-consciousness into self-confidence\" and \"STEM has really changed my life.  I feel like I am really a scientist, I feel like I am worth something and I feel like I can make a difference\".  The most successful parts of the scholarship program were the faculty mentoring and experience broadening components.  Each STEM scholar was assigned a faculty mentor in their STEM field, who guided and counseled them while at Waubonsee Community College.  This student-faculty relationship was key to inspiring students to levels of success they did not consider, and to provide information and resources for their future STEM careers.  These resources included advice on preparation for transfer to a Four-Year College or University, research projects, a specialized curriculum, as well as personal counseling.  In addition, faculty mentors had a significant role in focusing the interests and energies of their STEM scholar, as well as aiding their success.  The grant sponsored 14 research projects that were designed and completed by 21 of the STEM scholars.  These research experiences were consistently evaluated as the most enjoyable and beneficial activity of the program, and was integral in the later success of those STEM scholars at their Four-Year College or University.  The research experiences were concluded with a presentation at a regional Two-Year College STEM poster competition, where most of the STEM scholars placed in the top three of their respective STEM divisions in the competition. \n\n \n\nExperience broadening activities included an annual presentation to fellow scholars on a STEM subject they are passionate about.  This presentation was in the format of a conference of a professional society, and was evaluated by their fellow STEM scholars. It was during these presentations that many STEM scholars pointed out that they learned about STEM disciplines other than their own, and gained professional confidence and satisfaction in seeing their knowledge being absorbed by others. The highest peer-evaluated presenter was entitled to attend a national conference in their STEM discipline. \n\n \n\nThe S-STEM grant to Waubonsee Community College has not only provided invaluable resources to the STEM scholars selected for the program, but it has also provided leverage to increase STEM awareness across the campus.  During the S-STEM grant to Waubonsee Community College, three very popular STEM-related student clubs have formed (STEM, Math and Engineering and Software and Technology), as well as an annual Women-In-STEM event on our main campus.  It is anticipated that these programs will continue and grow, using lessons learned from the S-STEM grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/15/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Voorhees"
