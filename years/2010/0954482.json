With this vision, this proposal makes a systematic effort to highlight this timely opportunity to revolutionize cell microscopy by making it free of any lenses, lasers or other bulky optical components with a much simpler, compact and cost-effective imaging architecture especially suitable for telemedicine needs and requirements. Through incoherent lensfree cell holography & on-chip microscopy platform of this proposal (i.e., LUCAS), the PI proposes to compensate in the digital domain for the lack of complexity of optical components by recording individual phase & amplitude holograms of various cell types. These cell holograms also yield accurate reconstruction of microscopic images featuring sub-cellular resolution over a very large field of view (FOV) even at cell densities reaching up to ~0.4 Million cells/\u00ecL. Merging cost-effective and compact LUCAS imagers with the state-of-the-art cell-phone technology will create numerous opportunities for telemedicine to improve health care especially in the developing world where medical facilities and infrastructure are extremely limited.",
