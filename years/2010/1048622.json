Working together, the researchers hope to solve major scientific barriers to commercializing thermoelectric waste heat recovery technology.  The goal of project is the creation of a viable system to convert automotive waste heat into usable electrical power using thermoelectric (TE) devices.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research proposed here will advance work in TE by focusing on five key elements. Materials research (led by OSU and NU) will develop advanced TE materials made from earth-abundant, geographically dispersed elements and compounds, specifically PbSe and Mg2Si-Mg2Sn. Thermal management system design (led by BSST) will create new thermal designs to minimize losses by minimizing the number of interfaces, minimizing the amount of TE material used; these designs will maximize the durability of the product. Work on interfaces, led by VPI&SU and ZTPlus, will focus on the metallization of the TE materials and device interconnection and the flexible bonding of the metallized elements to the heat spreaders to increase durability and reduce device level performance losses. The team will expand capabilities in metrology to measure electrical and thermal contact resistances, and develop a comprehensive and redundant measurement loop system with self-consistent error checking. Durability will be the inherent design criterion in every invention.\r\n\r\nThis project has the potential to transform progress in TE materials. We will improve the fundamental understanding of the effect of resonant levels on the transport properties of solids, and make it applicable to large classes of semiconductors. The development of matrix encapsulation techniques for Mg2X will expand the repertoire of creative solid-state chemistry approaches in creating nanostructured thermoelectrics. New strong and flexible high-temperature bonding techniques will impact the assembly of semiconductor die. The project will advance understanding on the efficiency of TE generators, TE material durability at high temperatures, and cycle life durability of TE materials, all of which are critical to successful commercialization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will create potentially transformative research that promises to save up to 800,000 barrels of oil daily and reduce carbon emissions. Results of the research will be incorporated into classes taught by project investigators in the physics of transport phenomena, materials synthesis and electronic component assembly. The academic PI's will also integrate this research into participation in multidisciplinary collaborative groups. The significance of energy efficiency and usage that this research addresses will be integrated into the well established outreach programs at all three universities. Involvement of corporate partners ensures large scale commercialization, as BSST is the world leader in commercial applications of TE's in automotive and other key industries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver 90% of the energy humanity uses comes from thermal processes,[i] which produce most of the electricity in power plants, and power airplanes and most of our cars. Heat engines exist since the early 18th century, drove the industrial revolution and gave rise to the science of thermodynamics.  Thermoelectricity was discovered a century later[ii] and is based on the same principles, except that thermoelectric power generators use electrons as the working fluid rather than steam or air. Testimony to the importance of these fields is the fact that progress in the thermal sciences has been unrelenting, and the last 15 years have seen an increase in the efficiency of thermoelectric power generators by over a factor of two,[iii]  to two and a half,[iv] as reported in a steady stream of articles in the most prestigious research journals.  \n\nThermodynamics dictates that to deliver work, heat engines must operate between a source of heat at a hot-side temperature THOT and a heat sink at TCOLD.[v]    The Carnot efficiency5 is the upper bound for the efficiency h of a heat engine (h is defined as the ratio between the amount of work it does and the amount of heat it uses).  A thermoelectric generator works as shown in Fig. 1.[vi]  A temperature gradient &Delta;T across a thermoelectric material, a semiconductor in which the majority charge carrier are either electrons (n-type) or holes (p-type), creates an electric voltage V .   The Seebeck coefficient is the ratio S=V/ &Delta;T, negative in the n-type material and positive in the p-type.    Callen5 demonstrates that a is the entropy of the electron divided by its charge.  The two materials complete a cycle (Fig. 1) that converts the heat supplied at THOT into electrical power: if this cycle were reversible, and when a is temperature-independent, it would have the Carnot efficiency.  Thermodynamically irreversible processes, heat conduction through the lattice of atoms that constitute the solids, and Joule heating when the cycle delivers a current, limit the efficiency to a value much lower than hMAX.  The fraction of the Carnot efficiency of a thermoelectric cycle is quantified by the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT=S2 T/ (rk) (r is the electrical resistivity, k the thermal conductivity).   Most of the heat in thermoelectric materials is carried by phonons (kL), vibrations of the atoms in the crystal lattice that also carry sound. The goal of thermoelectric research is to discover new materials with maximum ZT, by maximizing the ratio S2/r and minimizing kL without increasing r.  Nanotechnology and quantum theory are applied to this problem: ZT doubled in the last 15 years3 from 1 to 2, up to the value of 2.6 reached just a few weeks ago,4 following a steady improvement shown in Fig. 2.   Band structure engineering,3such as quantum confinement[vii] and resonances[viii],[ix] between the wavefunctions of impurities and of free electrons, is used to enhance a2/r; phonon engineering,5 such as designing solids with nanostructures,[x]  rattling phonon modes, or selective anharmonicity[xi] is used to decrease kL.  The record ZT\u00c6s for materials suitable for thermoelectric power generation are held by alloys based on PbTe,8, 10 a rocksalt semiconductor with a long history in technology, or materials closely related to it, eg. SnSe.4\n\nThis research focused on developing high-ZT thermoelectric materials that contain only earth-abundant elements (unlike Te), and can be prepared reproducibly.  Emphasis lies on materials that are not toxic, though PbTe, PbSe, PbS are naturally occuring ores from which Pb is mined, and had they been toxic life would have been poisened.   The toxicity of a chemical compound is not directly related of the of its constituent elements.  Because the European Union has regulations against PbTe, emphasis is on developing first PbSe, and then Mg2Sn1-xSix.\n\nThe use of PbSe was successful, and ZT values only slightly inferior to those in PbTe.  We optimized the material f..."
