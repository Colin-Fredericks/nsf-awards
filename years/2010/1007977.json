 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a theoretical effort to explore uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates in models of nova outbursts and the structure pre-supernova stars.  The principal goal will be to construct a new reaction rate library for calculations of stellar evolution.  This will, for the first time, provide the ability to assign rigorous errors to the results.  The calculations will explore 66 nuclear reactions on target nuclei from carbon through calcium, for which reaction rate rates are now available, as a backbone for construction of a next-generation library of thermonuclear reaction rates.  The project will also employ the new reaction rate library for simulating the evolution of massive stars and classical novae.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to workforce development and will include the distribution of research products to the astronomical community.  The input models and data and the progenitor models for studies of supernovae and novae will be made available on a website for use by advanced students and other scientists for use in their own studies.  Graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will receive training in modern experimental and theoretical techniques, lead development of a state of the art reaction rate library, use high performance computing resources, and manage large, complex data sets.",
