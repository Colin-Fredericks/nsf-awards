 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vainchtein\r\nDMS-1007908\r\n\r\n     This project focuses on development and analysis of\r\nphysically-motivated models of materials undergoing martensitic\r\nphase transition, a diffusionless deformation of a crystal\r\nlattice from the high-symmetry parent austenite phase to the\r\nlow-symmetry martensite phase, which can exist in several\r\nsymmetry-related twin variants.  Under mechanical or thermal\r\nloading, these materials form finely layered twinning\r\nmicrostructures.  The unique properties of martensites, such as\r\ntheir ability to accommodate large deformations and the marked\r\nhysteresis they exhibit under cyclic loading, are determined by\r\nthe kinetics of phase and twin boundaries.  Understanding how\r\ndynamics of the interfaces depends on their orientation,\r\nmicrostructural configuration, and properties of the crystal\r\nlattice involves challenging open problems in modeling of\r\nmartensites.  The project seeks to advance the understanding of\r\nthese phenomena from the perspective of mesoscopic lattice\r\nmodels.  Building on her prior work, the investigator focuses on\r\nseveral prototypical discrete models with the goal of capturing\r\nthe essential features of interface kinetics and microstructure\r\nevolution and an emphasis on higher-dimensional phenomena and\r\nrate effects.  The main ingredients of the models are nonconvex\r\ninteractions between nearest neighbors allowing for the existence\r\nof two stable homogeneous states and the long-range interactions. \r\nAmong the outcomes of this project are prediction of nucleated\r\nmicrostructural patterns and derivation of interfacial kinetic\r\nlaws that can be used to solve problems involving temporal and\r\nspatial inhomogeneities.  The results are compared to\r\nexperimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations. \r\n\r\n     By focusing on the interface kinetics, this project helps\r\ndetermine how the dissipative properties of martensites and\r\nrelated active materials depend on the material structure and the\r\nloading conditions.  This is important in emerging civil,\r\naerospace and industrial applications that require significant\r\npassive damping, such as damage and vibration control in\r\ncomposite structures and attenuation of earthquake- and\r\nwind-induced vibrations in buildings and bridges.  Results of\r\nthis project may also help design new materials with desired\r\nproperties.  Mathematical methods developed during the project\r\ncan be used to solve similar problems encountered in dislocation\r\ntheory, fracture mechanics, DNA modeling, image recognition, and\r\nnumerical analysis.  The broader impacts of this program are also\r\nachieved through training of graduate and undergraduate students\r\nin an interdisciplinary research program, as well as educational\r\nand high-school outreach activities.",
