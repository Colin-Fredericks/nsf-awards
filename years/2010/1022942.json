The videos are being used in mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers and are specifically designed to be integrated with \"Connecting Mathematics for Elementary Teachers (CMET),\" a textbook authored by three of the principal investigators on this project.  The videos of children are helping prospective elementary teachers better understand children's mathematical thinking, thereby supporting better instructional choices on the part of teachers and improved learning of mathematics by children in their classes.  The videos are illustrating aspects of research on children's learning of mathematics that are described in the CMET textbook.  Results related to this project are being disseminated through conference presentations and workshops for faculty who teach mathematics for elementary teachers.  The videos are being made available on the web.\r\n\r\nThe videos produced in this project are significantly impacting the mathematical understanding and teaching of prospective elementary teachers by providing them with in-depth knowledge of how the subject matter they will be teaching is connected to children's mathematical thinking.  This project has the potential to fundamentally change the way mathematics educators prepare elementary pre-service teachers to teach mathematics to children.",

These videos are free and available on our web site:  www.cmlvidoes.com.  The videos are password protected and are designed to be used for educational purposes.  Please contact the project director: Dr.David Feikes at dfeikes@pnc.edu if you would like to view or use the videos for educational purposes.\n\n   \n\nOne unique feature of the videos is that they typically show 3-4 students solving the same problem in different ways (sometimes correctly, and sometimes incorrectly).  The videos dispel the assumption that all children solve problems the same way. When preparing to teach children mathematics, it is important for preservice teachers to understand that\nthere are multiple ways to solve problems and that children think about mathematics differently.\n\n\n\nA second unique feature of the videos is the narration embedded in each video.  Typically there is narration to introduce the videos, after each student solves the problem, and at the conclusion of each video.  The narration is designed to focus the viewers\u00c6 attention on important aspects of how children learn mathematics.\n\n   \n\nThe videos were primarily designed to be used with preservice teachers in mathematics content courses for elementary teachers but they have also been used with teachers in graduate courses, in mathematics methods courses for elementary teachers, in professional development for elementary teachers, and with parents to help them learn how to help their children understand mathematics.\n\n   \n\nResults from our analysis of these different cohorts indicated the following: \n\nThe videos were helpful in understanding how children solve math problems.\n\n\n \n\nThe videos were helpful\nproviding ideas about how to teach children mathematics.\n\n    \nWatching the video helped viewers better relate to how children learn mathematics.\n\n    \nParents were able to relate the videos to how their own children learn mathematics.\n\n    \nIn contrast to preservice teachers, practicing teachers were more focused on using manipulatives to teach mathematics as demonstrated in several of the videos. \n\n    \nTeachers focused more on developing children\u00c6s thinking and preservice teachers focused more on the fact that children solve problems in different ways.\n\n        \n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe CMET II Project disseminated knowledge on how to help preservice elementary teaches understand how children think about mathematics and subsequently improve their own understanding of mathematics. Understanding how children think about mathematics and their enhanced understanding of mathematics is intended to enhance teaching of mathematics to children.  CMET II conducted salient research on the role that knowledge of children\u00c6s mathematical thinking plays in the learning of mathematics and the preparation of teachers.  This project also examined the translation and implementation of research findings for practice.  In the field of mathematics education, the CMET II project attempted to contribute toward understanding of what constitutes \"knowledge necessary for teaching mathematics.\"\n\nBroader Impacts \n   \n\nThis CMET II Project\u00c6s goal was to impact the mathematical understanding and teaching of prospective elementary teachers by providing them with in-depth knowledge of how the subject matter they will be teaching is connected to children\u00c6s mathematical thinking.  Using knowledge of children\u00c6s thinking in the teaching of subject matter for preservice teachers has broader implications for many areas including the teaching of science. \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 1..."
