The main goals of this work are: (1) to provide\r\nclasses of rational models -- particularly in the case of\r\ntwo-phase lipid bilayer vesicles -- for understanding the often\r\nexotic behavior of such structures under loadings; (2) to\r\nsystematically find their equilibria corresponding to local\r\nminima of the total potential energy (meta-stable solutions); (3)\r\nto obtain the existence of global energy minima as weak\r\nequilibrium solutions of those models and study their structure\r\nin the asymptotic limit as the small parameter approaches zero. \r\nGoals (2) and (3) are inextricably linked to (1).  We employ\r\nrational continuum models, characterized by general constitutive\r\nfunctions, and study thresholds of bifurcation and the structure\r\nof global energy minimizers to compare with experiment.  The\r\nproposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and\r\nperspectives from several fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and\r\npartial differential equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of\r\nvariations, nonlinear continuum mechanics, computational methods,\r\nsymmetry ideas, biophysics, and materials science. \r\n\r\n     The project focuses on fundamental modeling and predictive\r\nmathematical analysis for the quantitative characterization of\r\nshape and deformation patterns of certain micron-scale structures\r\nunder applied loading, namely, lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,\r\nshape-memory alloys, and thin films.  Each of these has direct\r\nand important connections to basic science and technology -- in\r\nparticular, to problems associated with bio-molecular structures\r\nand advanced materials.  For example, lipid-bilayer membranes are\r\nubiquitous in bio-molecular systems; understanding and predicting\r\ntheir mechanical behavior is crucial for understanding cell\r\nfunction.  The project focuses on understanding the behavior of\r\npure, man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic\r\npressure, temperature, or composition.  The future promise of\r\nliposome vesicles (closed membranes) as vehicles for drug\r\ndelivery demands a fundamental understanding of their multi-phase\r\nmechanical behavior under loading.  Likewise for phase\r\ntransitions in shape-memory alloys and wrinkling of thin films --\r\na fundamental understanding and mathematical prediction of their\r\nbehavior are important for characterizing the mechanical\r\nproperties of novel materials and for potential sensing and\r\nactuation at the micron scale.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nMechanical experiments on real structures and materials typically begin with a nominally homogeneous or perfect specimen that progressively exhibits complex patterns or microstructure under steady, quasi-static changes in loading.  In particular, the identification and measurement of such thresholds of instability - going from the perfect homogeneous state to the more exotic state -  is a key component of most experiments.  In this project we build and analyze rational mathematical models for extremely thin structures to predict their mechanical response (deformation, force, stress, energy, etc.) under loadings.
