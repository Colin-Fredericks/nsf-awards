In the context of American politics, scholars have suggested that the most active citizens?active partisans?may differ in fundamental ways from those who participate in the political process less frequently.  Given the recent and rapid increase in income inequality, these questions are becoming ever more pressing. This dissertation examines long-term trends in one important but under-studied type of political participation: individual contributions to political campaigns. Using an original dataset I will build from Federal Election Commission records, this study will document basic descriptive evidence about the individual donor pool (i.e. who contributes and in what amounts, with what frequency?). The research project will also be the first to systematically examine the small but important core of repeat donors, who represent an ever-growing share of contributions from individuals?the ?national resource constituency?.  Following work on the impact of changing electoral coalitions on the party system, the project will also seek to uncover realignments in the social bases of support of the donor pool\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  The findings of this study will provide crucial, policy relevant knowledge about the likely effects of deepening economic inequalities on the representation of the American public.  A further contribution of this project will be to create and disseminate a unique, previously unavailable dataset of individual contributors to federal campaigns from 1980 to present. Since the Federal Election Commission?s data, available on its website, itemizes individual contributions rather than individual contributors, past scholarly efforts have been unable to accurately track donors over time or, likewise, the concentration of the donor base.  This project will be the first to do so and will, upon completion, provide a valuable catalog of elite political participation to the broader community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo shed light on elite political donors, I constructed an original longitudinal dataset from Federal Election Commission Contribution (FEC) records.  Although the FEC catalogs all contributions over two hundred dollars, these disclosure filings are not aggregated by unique contributor.  The data are also not easily restructured to reflect individual contributors; a daunting number of missing values, spelling inconsistencies, and non-informative responses make tracking donors over time exceptionally difficult.  After an extensive cleaning process, I utilized a record-matching algorithm to link the over fifteen million contribution filings to represent unique contributors.  The algorithm permitted identification of the nation\u00c6s largest and most frequent donors to federal elections, even in the face of numerous data limitations.  The full database&mdash;the first of its kind, which I call the Matched Individual Donor Database (MIDD)&mdash;includes all of the contributions for the years 1980 through 2008.  The MIDD simultaneously permits long-term analyses of political influence and opens up opportunities to uncover the preferences of these hard-to-reach elites.  The database will also be released to the community for further analysis, and I anticipate sharing the findings of the project with the public.\n\nTo date, I have worked extensively on two related sections of the larger project.  In the first section of the project, I have mapped the donation strategies of repeat donors&mdash;in comparison to smaller, one-time or occasional donors&mdash;across election cycles, and over time.  I ask if there is evidence to suggest that repeat donors have become more pivotal in funding the election campaigns of candidates, and, if so, in what types of races.  This piece of the project analyzes variation in the donation strategies of large, repeat contributors by a number of crucial variables including race competitiveness, primary versus general election, and incumbency status of the candidate. \n\nEarly results demonstrate the potential of the MIDD and hint at the magnitude of long-term trends in this form of participation.  For one, initial analyses have uncovered a substantial subset of donors who are both repeat or frequent donors, and who give large amounts of money in each election cycle.  There are, in fact, very few repeat donors who give only small amounts of money in each election cycle&mdash;the modal contribution amount for this group is in excess of three thousand dollars.  Second, the gap in the size of monetary contributions and in the number of contributions given by repeat donors, as compared to one-time or occasional donors, has dramatically widened over the past twenty years.  Figure 1 below shows the average number of contributions that repeat, one-time, and occasional donors gave in each election cycle.  The Figure shows that the numbers of contributions that repeat donors send to candidates, political committees, and PACs has nearly doubled since the early 1980\u00c6s.  Meanwhile, the number contributed by less frequent donors is entirely flat, except for a modest uptick during the most recent presidential election cycle.\n\nIn the next section of the project, I have mapped the partisanship of donor groups, and applied statistical techniques to investigate the evolution of partisanship among large, repeat donors.  Past work has suggested that the large majority of political action committees (PACs) pursue a pragmatic contribution strategy of donating to both parties to secure access to members of Congress.  Individual contributors, on the other hand, may be more likely to pursue strictly partisan or ideological strategies to affect electoral outcomes, and influence policy platforms.  Thus, I pursue two strategies to unpack trends in the MIDD.  In the first, I make comparisons between one-time, occasional, and repeat donors.  In keeping with past work, I hypothesize that repeat donors are more partisan and ideological.  Quite to ..."
