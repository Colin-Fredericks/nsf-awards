The 2010 ITW is hosted by Claude Shannon Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Coding, Cryptography, and Information Security and the University of Dublin, Ireland. The University and the Institute assembled one of several most active research groups in Coding and Information Theory in the world, on a par with University of California at San Diego, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Israel Institute of Technology (Technion), and Nanyang University in Singapore. The ITWs enjoy technical sponsorship of the IEEE through its information theory society and access to the IEEE advertising and publication infrastructure. The 2010 Dublin ITW facilitates collaboration and the exchange of ideas between US students and researchers and experts from Europe and Asia whose participation is expected to rise because of the selection of plenary speakers and the invited sessions.",
