 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Mexico S-STEM program is supporting cohorts of 27 computer science and engineering students annually.   Student recruitment, at both the high school and community college levels, is being conducted by Engineering Support Services.  Students selected to participate in the program must join at least one of four learning communities in bioengineering, green/renewable energy, high-tech materials or aerospace engineering.  As they foster student growth and interest in a student's field of study, tutoring, mentoring and professional career development are integral parts of the program.  Additional program elements include: 1) guest speakers on topics associated with the learning communities, 2) financial aid guidance, and 3) a \"family focused\" annual banquet.\r\n",
