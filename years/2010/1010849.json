 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptation is the basis of biodiversity and is an important mechanism that allows species to exploit novel environmental conditions. This study will generate a detailed analysis of the ecological and evolutionary factors that cause and limit adaptation for a group of fishes. The project will measure the relative performance of many shape and size variants from three closely related species of pupfish and their hybrids, following the growth and survival of these fish in pens in their natural environment. Because the species are closely related, they can be readily hybridized to generate a wide variety of shapes and sizes in their offspring that are not found in the wild. These hybrid offspring allow measuring the complete adaptive performance profile for these fish in their natural environment. \r\n\r\n\tUnderstanding of the ecological and evolutionary basis of variation in performance in nature supports prediction of such significant societal issues as which environments are more vulnerable to invasive species, which species are more likely to become invasive, and which species are likely to readily accommodate to environmental changes.  The project includes research-based training opportunities for undergraduates and diverse public outreach.",
