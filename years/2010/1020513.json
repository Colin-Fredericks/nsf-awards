However, the receptivity to and use of these new tools differs radically among the various scientific disciplines.  This project will initiate planning for an international symposium to advance a very unique and promising set of research discussions on these issues begun in a workshop titled \"New Models for Scholarly Communication in Chemistry\", held in Washington DC in October 2008 (http://hdl.handle.net/1813/14150).  The international symposium envisioned will address complex issues associated with academic scholarly communication practices and emergent technologies and the ways in which web-based intellectual content is created, managed and used to advance research productivity.  A goal will be to determine the interdependence of these processes and points of beneficial intervention.  To begin the planning process for the symposium, this award will support the formation of a small international steering committee to develop the agenda for the larger symposium and identify necessary participants and potential sources of financial support.  Community input will be actively solicited in all stages of the planning process.",
