 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and co-funding from the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Profs. Rudolf Seitz and Roy Planalp from the University of New Hampshire, in collaboration with Prof. Shawn Burdette from the University of Connecticut, are developing and characterizing a new approach to preparing co-polymer based ratiometric fluorimetric indicators for metal ions. The approach separates complexation from fluorescence, thereby allowing preparation of ratiometric indicators for important metal ions like Cu(II), Pb(II), Fe(III), etc., which normally quench fluorescence.  \r\n\r\nThis project will provide a new approach to measuring levels of toxic metals in municipal waters and will have a rapid and positive impact on public safety because of an established relationship with Envirosystems, Inc., a Womens Business Enterprise-certified company that can rapidly develop laboratory research for practical applications. The project will involve participants and trainees at many levels including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral, and will involve underrepresented groups and women. New students beginning on this project will be assigned a senior graduate student or postdoctoral mentor, who will share mentoring duties with the PI.",
