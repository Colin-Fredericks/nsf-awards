 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued funding for the UW-Madison group's scientific analysis of data collected with the South Pole IceCube neutrino observatory. IceCube will reach a total exposure of a km-squared-year of data within one year, a target neutrino astronomy has aspired to since the nineteen seventies. If typical estimates of their flux are valid, they will reach the sensitivity to observe the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos produced by the interactions of cosmic rays with microwave photons. If gamma ray bursts accelerate the observed extragalactic cosmic rays, they will detect the neutrinos produced when the protons and photons coexist in the fireball. \r\n\r\nThe group participates in all major scientific analyses; in this project they emphasize that their goal is to not only increase statistics and better understand the systematics of the detector, but to focus on improvements of the analysis methods made possible by a larger and better instrument. UW-Madison scientists contribute on average half of their time to service tasks required to maintain and operate the detector. IceCube will undoubtedly enter a phase of modifications and enhancements of capabilities resulting from experience operating the detector and from new science opportunities. The group actively participates in the R&D program that capitalizes on the current IceCube scientific program. The radio detection of ultra high-energy neutrinos is the main focus at this time.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The mystique of the South Pole environment and the compelling science are an alluring mix. The results of IceCube science will enhance scientific and technological understanding on many levels through broad dissemination of the results and experiences. IceCube is in a unique class of projects that inspire the innovative capacity of a new generation of American scientists and engineers.",
