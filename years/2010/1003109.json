The Center replaces company specific in-house training by providing comprehensive educational programs targeted at technicians involved in production, research and development, quality control, and related compliance management issues.  In the planning project, the partners collect and analyze market research to document industry and student needs; expand partnerships with other community colleges and industry associations; develop center strategies and action plans to meet them; and develop evaluation, management and sustainability plans.  The Center establishes a national network for delivering and continuously improving MDIEC curricula through partnerships with industry.  Nationally consistent professional development programs for faculty and assessment programs are developed to ensure that graduates achieve prescribed proficiency levels.",
