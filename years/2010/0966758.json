 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Terrain-influenced Monsoon Rainfall Experiment (TiMREX), centered on Taiwan in the summer of 2008, collected special observations to improve understanding of the physical process associated with terrain-influenced heavy precipitation systems over this mountainous island and the monsoonal environment in which they are embedded.  This award will allow researchers to implement quality control checks on potentially problematic rawinsonde data, combine these corrected data with other observations to create a more comprehensive gridded analysis, and then apply these data to investigate processes leading to heavy rainfall over and surrounding Taiwan.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this research includes focus on analysis of special rawinsonde intercomparison launches with an eye toward sonde-dependent biases and ancillary satellite and ground-based remote , satellite and ground based remote sensing, and prior knowledge of sonde biases to reduce biases in moisture measurements taken by the several different atmospheric sounding systems used during the TiMREX campaign.  The researchers will then conduct diagnostic studies of processes related to the production of heavy rainfall, including investigation of rainfall patterns upstream of and over Taiwan in relation to flow blocking, investigation of atmospheric boundary layer structure in the TiMREX region and its connection with aforementioned precipitation patterns, and use of the sounding network to diagnose properties of convection during the field experiment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the research will accrue through improved understanding of mechanisms (and ultimately prediction) of heavy rainfall, both specifically during the East Asian monsoon season and more generally in mountainous tropical and subtropical environments including those found in the Americas.  A quality-controlled version of the TiMREX meteorological dataset will be disseminated for access and exploitation by the broader scientific community, and graduate student education will be supported.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn international research field campaign &ndash; Southwest Monsoon Experiment (SoWMEX)/Terrain-influenced Monsoon Rainfall Experiment (TiMREX) &ndash; was conducted in May and June 2008 to investigate the mechanisms associated with heavy rainfall and flooding in Taiwan during the early summer monsoon season.  The island of Taiwan is exposed to numerous factors that contribute to extreme rainfall, among which are warm, moist airflow from the South China Sea; storms that enter the region from mainland China; and steep topography.   Special instrumentation deployed during SoWMEX/TiMREX to study heavy rainfall mechanisms included ships, aircraft, research radars, atmospheric soundings, surface weather stations, and rain gauges.\n\n \n\nHeavy rainfall and flooding occurred on a number of occasions throughout the experiment.  For one of the rainy periods in mid-June, it was found that the sea surface temperature upstream of Taiwan over the northern South China Sea played a role in enhancing the heavy rainfall over the island.  In particular, a gradient in sea surface temperature resided offshore, characterized by colder water to the north off the south coast of China and warmer water to the south.  This gradient acted to increase the convergence of low-level moisture upstream of Taiwan, which in turn enhanced the rainfall over the southwest part of the island.  The sea surface temperature gradient over the northern South China Sea exists every year in the early monsoon season, but is stronger in some years than others.  Knowledge of the strength of the gradient in early spring can potentially assist the seasonal forecast of rainfall over Taiwan.\n\n \n\nIn addition, as a result of SoWMEX/TiMREX observations, the characteristics of the flow over and around Taiwan, as well as its diurnal variation, have been determined in a detail heretofore not possible.  Rainfall over the island was a maximum in the late afternoon not only on undisturbed days with strong solar heating, but also on disturbed days with strong southwesterly monsoon flow and considerable cloud shading over the island.  However, on the disturbed days, the rainfall maximum tended to be shifted to higher elevations over the interior mountain range than on days with undisturbed, light-wind conditions.\n\n \n\nThe SoWMEX/TiMREX field campaign has provided unprecedented observations of the atmospheric and oceanic conditions associated with heavy rainfall over Taiwan.  The findings of our research have shed insight into processes that produce the heavy rainfall and are expected to ultimately contribute to improved prediction of extreme precipitation and flooding in Taiwan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard H Johnson"
