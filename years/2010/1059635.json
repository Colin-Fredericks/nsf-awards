This award will support participation by ten US-based researchers in three workshops, as part of the eSI Research themes on data-intensive research to be held in Edinburgh, UK. \r\n\r\nWorkshops associated with the eSI Research Theme will be organized along the following three tracks: (i) Abstractions for distributed and dynamic data-intensive applications, (ii) Understanding the issues to enable Relational technology to be widely and effectively used in the support of data-intensive methods at extreme scales, and (iii) Algorithms, Software and Cyberinfrastructure for data-intensive research",
