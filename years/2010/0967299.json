 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum field theory is the major framework for the study of the interactions of elementary particles.  Professor Daniel Freedman from MIT proposes to utilize new techniques for the computation of scattering amplitudes between these particles --- techniques which have supplanted the traditional approach via Feynman diagrams. He plans to focus on the properties of superamplitudes, which compactly package information concerning many different particle processes in a single expression. The initial goal, which has already met with success, is to use superamplitudes to explore properties of the N=8 supergravity theory. These properties are relevant to the conjecture that N=8 supergravity is the first consistent field theory of gravity at the quantum level.  Numerous other applications of and extensions to this technology are envisioned.\r\n\r\nThere are several broader impacts associated with this work.  At a scientific level, any increase in our ability to evaluate on-shell amplitudes is extremely valuable, for such amplitudes have been applied to subjects as diverse as the computation of background QCD events for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the search for an ultraviolet-finite field theory of quantum gravity.  Furthermore, this subject matter is an excellent area for the advanced education and training of young researchers. Indeed, Freedman's recent mentees include Henriette Elvang, who recently began an Assistant Professorship at the University of Michigan and is the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award.",
