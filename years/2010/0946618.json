 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil are considered one of the World's biodiversity \"hotspots\"; nearly half of the plant species in the Atlantic forests are unique to this region. Within these coastal forests, those in northeastern Brazil (from Bahia to Rio Grande do Norte) are the most biodiverse and the most critically endangered. Nevertheless, the distributions of the plant species in this region and their relationship to species in adjacent regions are not known. The goal of this project is to study the vegetation of these northeastern forests and demonstrate that the forests of the southern portion (Bahia) and those of the northern portion (Pernambuco) are not as distinct as previously hypothesized. This will be accomplished by collecting and identifying plant specimens in targeted forest fragments throughout the region which will make it possible to map and predict the distribution of plant species. \r\n\r\nDiscovering new species and clarifying the distribution of forest plants in northeastern Brazil will enhance our understanding of the history of this unique region and its flora. In addition, data on species and their distributions will be provided to appropriate government bodies and local organizations so that decisions about conservation priorities can be made wisely. The PI and Co-PI will provide training in botany, ecology and conservation to student both in the U.S. and in Brazil.",
