 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nTwo of the current goals in supramolecular chemistry are the development of new synthetic strategies to supramolecular assemblies and the creation of assemblies with unique and controllable properties.  The PI and his group are using multi-cationic and multi-anionic molecules to prepare supramolecular network materials via electrostatic interactions. The PI proposes a detailed mechanistic study to characterize and understand the underlying supramolecular chemistry principles at work.  Specifically, he and his group will synthesize new dicationic phosphoniums, prepare supramolecular ionic networks by mixing the dicationic phosphoniums with various small molecule and macromolecular anions, characterize the rheological properties of these ionic networks, and subsequently model the rheological properties with the financial support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation.  These studies address the hypothesis that this approach to supramolecular materials will result in unique compositions and properties.  The results of this research will have a significant impact by affording a detailed mechanistic understanding of this type of supramolecular assembly along with collection of robust data for analysis, discussion, and further hypothesis generation.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nThe creation of new materials is fundamental to the advancement of science as this research leads to new ideas, unique properties, and new applications.  With the financial support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, this research project will investigate a new approach to materials that are \"salts\" but not crystalline materials like table salt, NaCl.  Instead these materials behave like polymers or plastics.  On the education front, the two educational impacts from this funding are: 1) the participation of undergraduates in the research program so they can gain experience; and 2) the participation of graduate students in the Boston Urban Fellow NSF GK12 outreach program which provides co-instructors for high school science courses in those Boston Public School systems where a majority of the students are underrepresented minorities or economically disadvantaged.",
