 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robots today can assist surgeons and explore space; however, they cannot be trusted to drive autonomously in a real city. Robots either perform simple or hard-coded tasks fully autonomously or they operate with close human supervision. While most of the sensing and actuation technology exists, what is lacking is the ability to provide guarantees for safety and correctness of a robot's high-level, autonomous behavior.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop mathematical formalisms and algorithms that will provide guarantees for the success of a high-level task, specified by a human using temporal logic and performed by a robot operating in an uncertain world.   These techniques will pave the way towards creating truly correct autonomous robots thus making a significant impact in our community.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the PI is developing mathematical theory, algorithms and open-source tools to address the following challenges: \r\n(i) When a robot task is infeasible determine and communicate why it cannot be achieved;\r\n(ii) Given known bounds on sensor and action uncertainties, provide offline guarantees for task success; \r\n(iii) Provide online guarantees and task progress as new information regarding the workspace is gathered.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the project include: (i) building  a community of researchers interested in formal methods for robotics and automation, and (ii) increasing the number of women pursuing an engineering career.  For the former, undergraduate and graduate students are mentored, two courses taught by the PI are enhances and workshops are organized.  For the latter, the PI is designing and supervising a robotics-based project for female high school students during a summer program, and is working to recruit women through recruiting weekends and a series of talks at other institutions.",

These objectives are critical pieces for the larger theme of creating \"formal methods for robotics\"; a collection of theories and tools that will enable people to create and program robots that behave in a predictable and safe manner. \n\n \n\nTowards these objectives we achieved the following:\n\nExplaining why tasks cannot be done: If a robot is given high-level instructions (here, in the form of temporal logic formulas) that are unsynthesizable (cannot be transformed into robot control) it is unclear what the problem is; the specification can either be unsatisfiable, meaning that the task cannot be performed (for example, \"go there and stay here\") OR unrealizable, meaning that the environment can prevent the robot from satisfying its goals (for example, \"go to my office\" but the door to the office is closed and the robot cannot open it). Leveraging SAT solvers and the notion of `unsatisfiable cores\u00c6, a minimal set of formulas that would cause a larger Boolean formula to be unsatisfiable, together with realizability checking, we are able to provide the user with a minimal subset of their specification that causes the problem. Furthermore, we have implemented a game that allows the user to try and control the robot in simulation to achieve the task and observe how the environment can make the robot fail. \nTiming semantics for execution: We defined three different timing semantics for the synthesized controllers that adhere to different assumptions on the timing of the robot actions. In our framework, the robot synthesized a correct-by-construction discrete controller (a finite state machine) that then needs to be implemented continuously; since robot action, especially motion, is not instantaneous, different timing semantics result in significantly different behaviors.\nUnknown workspaces: We have shown how to relax the assumption of a known workspace by allowing the robot to explore new regions and resynthesize the controller in an intelligent way while preserving task progress.\nReasonable behaviors: We have shown how to create \"reasonable\" behaviors. In the past, we could create behaviors that were correct with respect to the specification but that would sometime exhibit unintuitive characteristics such as taking the long route between areas. We have defined a novel, two dimensional cost metric that allows the user to optimize the robot\u00c6s behavior; either minimize a continuous metric, or minimize the robot\u00c6s reliance on the environment behavior (for example, if it has to wait for a door to open).\nNatural language instructions: We explored the use of natural language to specify robot behaviors.

After the challenge we demonstrated the use of abstractions of software components, hardware components and synthesis techniques for generating correct-by-construction control for the Atlas humanoid robot.\nOpen-source software toolbox: We have developed the Linear Temporal Logic MissiOn Planner (LTLMoP), an open-source toolbox that allows people to write instructions in structured English and transform them automatically into robot cont..."
