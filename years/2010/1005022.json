 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teachers and students will participate in interdisciplinary research and educational projects that seek to understand and apply design strategies in nature to the development novel biomaterials. A fundamental understanding of how living systems self-organize and build structures could lead to improved and low-cost medical devices, as well as more efficient paradigms for energy conversion and manufacturing. As part of the summer program, teachers and students will participate in professional development workshops, including building skills in oral and written communication, ethics and professional conduct, and how to conduct research. Students and teachers will also create a short video designed to engage the public in their research, as well as a final technical presentation. The program also focuses on recruiting veterans, students without prior research experience, and students traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing fundamental understanding of how biomaterials form and perform in nature and using these insights to design novel engineered biomaterials. Participants will contribute to ongoing research projects that combine experiment with theory and simulation, in the study and design of self- and directed molecular assemblies, interfaces between cells and surfaces, gels and networks, drug delivery systems, tissue culture scaffolds, mineralization, and multi-functional biomaterials such as photonic and electronic biomaterials. Projects are organized around 3 central themes: (1) nano- and microscale structures for biology and medicine (2) tools for creating novel biomaterials, and (3) self-assembling and self-organizing structures.\r\n\r\nThis REU site is co-funded by the NSF Divisions of Materials Science (DMR) and Engineering Education and Centers (ENG/EEC), and by the Department of Defense (DOD).",
