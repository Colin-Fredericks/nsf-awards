 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis project will modernize the 10000 cleanroom facility in the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE) core laboratory complex. This 1635 square foot cleanroom facility has been in continuous service since 2003. At present many faculty members and students are working on different research projects using this cleanroom facility including studies on solar energy conversion from electron field emission, thermal transport in carbon nanotubes, biosensor synthesis requiring e-beam lithography, and metal-insulator transitions that are modulated by optics. For the continued safe use of this cleanroom facility, it is in need of replacement of the following two essential components: 1) Toxic Gas Monitoring System (TGMS); and 2) HEPA filter fan units (FFU). This proposal is to replace the old TGMS unit with a new one, and make the cleanroom compatible to the current standards. The new TGMS unit is expected to detect all of the gases used or generated in a Semiconductor manufacturing facility. \r\n\r\nTeaching, training and educational activities using the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE) core laboratory complex are well defined and detailed in the proposal, and cleanroom facilities play a key role in these activities. In addition, the NSF supported IGERT program at Vanderbilt University with Fisk University provides opportunity for underrepresented minority students to be trained and educated using the VINSE Core Laboratory facilities. These facilities are also used by students and faculty members from Delaware State University for their education and research activities. Other outreach activities included nanoscience and nanotechnology programs for high school students through Vanderbilt Summer Academy.",
