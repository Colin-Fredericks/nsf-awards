 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support to students to attend the 2010 SIAM Data Mining (SDM 2010) Conference, and to enable them to participate in a Ph.D. student forum to be held as part of SDM 2010. This conference will be held in Columbus (OH), USA from April 29 to May 1st, 2010 (http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm10/).\r\n\r\nJointly organized by computer scientists and statisticians, SDM 2010 is a premiere conference for presenting new research results in the area of data mining, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Selection of award recipients will be based on the quality of their research as well as their potential to benefit from attending this meeting. Special emphasis will be given to minority students not traditionally well represented at SDM conferences.\r\n\r\nParticipation in premier research conferences such as SDM is an integral component of the training of Ph.D. students in data mining. The SDM 2010 Ph.D. Student Forum will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. candidates to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers in data mining. Such feedback and mentoring is expected to improve the quality of the students thesis research. Similarly, students recipient of a travel award will be able to attend technical sessions, plenary talks, panels, tutorials and workshops. They will interact with peers who share similar interests from other universities, as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. This experience will be extremely formative and fruitful towards the shaping of their future research endeavors. \r\n\r\nData mining is playing an increasingly important role in many emerging data-rich sciences and application domains, such as bioinformatics, computational biology, link analysis, counter-terrorism, and security. The SDM 2010 Ph.D. student forum will enrich the education and training of student researchers at early stages in their careers. The attendance of SDM 2010 will expose students to cutting-edge research and to relevant applications in a variety of domains. Both the student forum and travel awards will also help broaden the representation of women and members of underrepresented minority groups within the Data Mining research community.",
