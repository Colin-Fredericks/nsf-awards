 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to purchase a Phantom ROV (remotely operated vehicle) capable of being deployed in shallow water from a relatively small boat or in water to 600m depth for survey and experimental work on the Oregon continental shelf. The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) faculty would make use of the proposed equipment for studies of recruitment dynamics, marine snow, reproductive biology, larval transport, developmental biology and marine reserve science. The ROV would be readily available to visiting investigators and visiting student groups. Several courses at OIMB would make use of ROV technology for visualizing marine habitats and for collecting specimens needed for courses. The ROV would open new possibilities for research and teaching at all levels and will be an additional draw for visiting investigators to the Oregon coast. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe OIMB has an excellent track record of teaching and outreach productivity on site (including extramural COSEE and MIMSUP support). Training students to use an ROV is relevant to current growing needs in the field. Making exploratory videos available to the public was seen as a positive approach to increasing public awareness of coastal areas and environmental issues.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith support from this NSF award, the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (marine laboratory of the University of Oregon) purchased and modified a Phantom Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for use in the coastal waters of southern Oregon.  In this region, underwater research using SCUBA is difficult because of dangerous ocean conditions.  The ROV purchased was a used model with 600m depth capability that can reach much of the Oregon shelf as well as the bottoms of local bays and estuaries.  With this grant, the ROV was purchased with tracking hardware and an electric winch that manages the  cable.  The winch is permanently installed on the University's 43 foot research vessel.  A new collection mechanism was designed and constructed, consisting of an electrical manipulator arm and a collection drawer for specimens.  The ROV is used for research on subtidal ecology in a region that is poorly explored within and beyond the Oregon Territorial Sea.  In addition, students and postdoctoral fellows are trained in the use of undersea technology by learning to maintain and pilot this vehicle.  Outreach to the general public is accomplished by making the maintenance workshop and ROV visible to visitors at a new museum/aquarium on the OIMB campus, adjacent to a display where undersea images from the ROV are highlighted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig M Young"
