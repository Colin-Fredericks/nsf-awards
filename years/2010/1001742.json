 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nObjectives: In this proposal we will provide the enabling science and technical underpinnings that will move sensing with N/MEMS beyond the realm of a scientific curiosity. We will investigate the dissipation of diverse resonant N/MEMS operating in air, leading to optimized performance in air, the carrier gas from which analytes will be sensed. We will also enable and demonstrate sensing of volatile organics.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit rests on our three pronged approach: 1. To reduce radiated sound energy that damps the motion of resonators in air, making the resonant frequency shift a more sensitive transduction mechanism. 2. To investigate tensile stress to increase the Q in polysilicon and other low loss materials and also expose the origin of the enhancement of Q by stress. 3. To explore stress-based sensing where an analyte in the air induces a change in stress in a functionalizing coating on a surface \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts for the proposed research extend to high Q systems under investigation for quantum computation as mechanical qubits (the Q providing a high fidelity). Our research will enable diverse sensing functions for security and threat recognition from chemical and biological agents. Other benefits will flow from our planned REU and K-12 initiatives. The integration of undergraduates in aspects of the research and links to applications will benefit a broad spectrum of junior scientists, and equip them with practical problem-solving knowledge that extends beyond the classroom or laboratory environment.",
