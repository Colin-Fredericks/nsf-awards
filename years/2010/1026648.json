The conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE)\r\nfermentation has low butanol yield (<25%), butanol concentration (<16 g/L), and reactor productivity (<0.5 g/L?h) due to a strong butanol inhibition, and the fermentation process is difficult to improve due to the complicated metabolic pathways and gene regulation involved in the production microorganisms, mainly Clostridium acetobutylicum.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of the project is to produce butanol as a biofuel from sugars derived from starchy and lignocellulosic biomass.  Biobutanol has great value as an alternative transportation fuel.  There is a huge potential commercial and societal impact in improving yields and reducing costs of butanol production. The research and other activity proposed could lead directly to a marketable product and process and leads to several enabling technologies, including better manipulation of C. tyrobutylicum, further demonstration of strain improvements using the FBB, and others.",
