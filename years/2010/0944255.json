Students participating in the CReSIS REU site will be assigned to research teams within the CReSIS Science and Technology Center. The project will engage 20 students annually in both center-based research training and professional development activities.  Follow-up activities begin after the 8-week internship when participants will be involved virtually in CReSIS lectures, seminars, training, and All Hands events.  The program will provide summer educational opportunities, for undergraduate students, in the area of cyberinfrastructure and polar science and will attract a diversified pool of talented students into careers in science, and engineering, including teaching and research related to polar science and cyberinfrastructure.  The intellectual merit of the CReSIS-REU site is that it will be interdisciplinary and educational in focus and make innovative cost effective use of cyberinfrastructure. The project builds upon novel partnerships across the discipline areas of radars, engineering, modeling of ice sheets, and cyber-infrastructure.  The broader impacts of this REU Site are that it will support activities in science, education, diversity and outreach and will train the next generation of scientists, engineers and educators interested in polar science and cyberinfrastructure. The vision for this project is driven by the compelling need to draw on integration of research and education to attract a diverse pool of talented students into engineering, polar science and cyberinfrastructure related careers including teaching and educational research. The project will involve 60 undergraduate students over the three-year period.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
