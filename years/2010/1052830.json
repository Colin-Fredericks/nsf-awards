Despite considerable activity over the past fifteen years, very little research has concentrated on obtaining an understanding of the processes that underlie their successful operation.  In particular, the role of thermal radiation in determining the thermal environment and modifying the combustion processes has received only modest attention.  The relatively large thickness of the combustion zone at any fuel-oxidizer interface enhances the role of radiation. Moreover, the interaction of fluctuations in temperature, radiation, and velocity fields in a hot, nearly uniform environment characteristic of a furnace operating in a flameless combustion environment has been ignored. This proposal focuses on both these phenomena, using a unique approach involving a new formulation of both problems. The aim is to develop and apply a mathematical, computationally tractable theory to study these processes with a view to producing relatively simple procedures to determine how intense radiation modifies classical ideas of combustion heat release and thermal and velocity fluctuations in a flameless combustion environment.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Existing theories of combustion heat release rely heavily on the notion of a thin flame. Velocity fluctuations in the hot, nearly uniform environment associated with furnace configurations are typically assumed to be caused by turbulence induced by fuel and oxidized jets.  This work will present results that do not rely on the thin flame assumption to determine combustion energy release.  It will also show how velocity fluctuations can arise in large heated volumes without the need for turbulent flow, due to the influence of thermal radiation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This work will furnish the beginnings of the knowledge required to develop good design tools for efficient, low pollution furnaces and related combustion devices.  Furnace design has been aided by the use of computer simulation techniques, particularly those implemented in computational fluid dynamics codes.  However, such codes are no better than the physical models upon which they are based. Since turbulent flow models are always incorporated in such codes, there is necessarily a large amount of empiricism in them. Thus, it is not possible to gain a fundamental understanding of the basic principles underlying good flameless furnace design in the absence of knowledge of the phenomena themselves that will be developed by this project.",
