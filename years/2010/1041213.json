 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support researchers based at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories.  The overall focus of the project is to determine how ocean acidification affects the integrity of biomaterials and how these effects in turn alter interactions among members of marine communities. The research plan emphasizes an ecomaterial approach; a team of biomaterials and ecomechanics experts will apply their unique perspective to detail how different combinations of environmental conditions affect the structural integrity and ecological performance of organisms.  The study targets a diversity of ecologically important taxa, including bivalves, snails, crustaceans, and seaweeds, thereby providing insight into the range of possible biological responses to future changes in climate conditions.  The proposal will enhance our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate change, a significant societal problem.\r\n\r\nEach of the study systems has broader impacts in fields beyond ecomechanics.  Engineers are particularly interested in biomaterials and in each system there are materials with commercial potential. The project will integrate research and education by supporting doctoral student dissertation research, providing undergraduate research opportunities via three training programs at FHL, and summer internships for talented high school students, recruited from the FHL Science Outreach Program.  The participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened by actively recruiting URM and female students. Results will be disseminated in a variety of forums, including peer-reviewed scientific publications, undergraduate and graduate course material, service learning activities in K-8 classrooms, demonstrations at FHL's annual Open House, and columns for a popular science magazine.",

What happens to coastal marine communities when changing environmental conditions, such as ocean acidification (OA) or warming, alter how key biomaterials are manufactured and maintained?

The mesocosms have been used widely by other researchers, from the University of Washington and several other institutions.     \n\n \n\nMussels lose their grip\n\nWhile the oyster has become the \"poster child\" for the harmful effects OA on shellfish, there is growing concern that mussels are at risk as well. OA is well known to slow growth and erode shells, but our recent work shows OA targets a non-calcified structure that is literally a mussel\u00c6s lifeline, the byssal thread. \n\nA mussel uses its foot to mold each stretchy byssal thread one at a time to form a strong tether to culture ropes, neighboring mussels and whatever else it can reach.

We recently deployed in mussel rafts two sensor arrays that record temperature, pH, chl a, oxygen and salinity and post real-time to NANOOS (http://nvs.nanoos.org/Explorer, see \"Penn Cove\"). Our preliminary observations suggest mussels at depth (7 m) experience low pH conditions routinely, but the risk to mussels at the surface (1 m) is more likely high temperature coupled with low salinity and low food. We are now expanding our observations to other locations in the Salish Sea and the Olympic Peninsula.\n\n \n\nCalcified seaweeds in high CO2?\n\nWe have also worked extensively on the effects of OA on calcified seaweed..."
