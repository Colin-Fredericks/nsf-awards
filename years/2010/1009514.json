 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends recent work by the PI and collaborator on the nature and spatial extent of dust around galaxies at cosmological distances. The team, by correlating the colors of quasars with the density of foreground galaxies, has established that these galaxies (on average) have dust halos extending out to on the order of 10 megaparsecs. In this project they will greatly increase the depth and wavelength coverage of the analysis, applying their existing techniques and making use of the newest archival data releases from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Deep Lens Survey, and the deep sample of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (optical), the GALEX satellite (ultraviolet), and the FIRST survey (radio). They will study the dependence of the dust extent and absorption properties on galaxy luminosity, morphological type, and redshift; constrain the physical nature of the dust and possible scenarios for the enrichment of galaxy halos; and assess the impact that extended dust will have on future measurements of the expansion and acceleration of the universe. A software package developed by the PI for analyzing multiwavelength data from disparate sources (STOMP) will be made available to the community. The PI, as one of the developers of Google Sky, will explore the development of an \"astronomical wiki,\" through which research results can be shared with the community and the public. A graduate student will be trained through participation in the research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined the evolution of extragalactic dust and gas over the course of the last several billion years of our universe's history.  Although this material makes up only a tiny fraction of the total mass in the universe, it holds a record of the history of star formation that served to create the building blocks of life here on Earth.  From an observational standpoint, it is also important to understand how the density of dust changes as we look at more and more distant galaxies.  Those galaxies' light is absorbed by this intervening dust and for measurements like high redshift supernovae, where we depend on knowing the luminosity of the objects to infer their distance, this dimming can act as a source of systematic error if we do not correctly account for it.\n\nTo measure the extent and nature of this dust, the original proposed work involved extending previous measurements made using gravitationally lensed quasars.  These objects have an intrinsic color and by correlating their color with the density of foreground galaxies, we find that light from quasars that has likely passed through the dust halo of a foreground galaxy is systematically redder than the average.  To extend this measurement to higher redshifts, we considered a deeper population of objects, Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) using the Deep Lens Survey (LBGs typically have a redshift of z ~ 4, whereas quasars peak at about z ~ 2).\n\nFor our foreground galaxies, we made 6 photometrically selected samples from the DLS and attempted to measure the reddening of the LBGs due to these foreground (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.1) galaxies.  We were able to detect a variation in the density of the LBGs due to gravitational lensing of the LBGs by the foreground galaxies, making the first ever tomographic measurements of magnification lensing.  This is a technique that will play a central role in upcoming cosmological surveys like the LSST and DES, so demonstrating it in action was a significant step.  However, despite some promising results, we were unable to convincingly demonstrate that we had observed the same sort of extinction in the LBG population as we had seen in the earlier work with quasars.  Having exhausted that avenue, we turned to a new approach that was not anticipated in the original proposal.\n\nOne of the central problems in cosmological analyses is determining the distance to a given sample of galaxies.  Spectroscopic measurements can be done, but these are considerably more time consuming than photometric observations.  Multi-band photmetry can be used as a crude proxy for spectroscopy, yielding photometric redshifts (like those we used in our DLS reults) but there are often bedeviling problems with degeneracies between intrinsic galaxy color and redshift.  A new approach to this problem as been to cross-correlate a sample with known redshifts with an unknown sample and use their mutual gravitational clustering to infer the redshift distribution of the latter.\n\nWe developed an extension of earlier methods using this technique that pushed into the non-linear clustering regime.  This method has the benefit of considerably higher signal-to-noise compared to standard techniques, albeit at the expense of greater sensitivity to evolution in the bias of the spectroscopic sample for broad redshift distributions.  Using our estimator, we were able to use quasar redshifts to recover the redshift distribution of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) radiation present in the Planck satellite's High Frequency Instrument maps.  The CIB is generated by dust emission in galaxies during periods of intense star formation; the dense, dusty clouds where stars are born absorb the optical and UV light from new stars and the re-radiate it in the infrared.  This gave us a completely new means by which to meaure star formation over time and a new probe into the distribution of dust in the universe.\n\nBy measuring the distribution of this light as a function of redshift, we were able to..."
