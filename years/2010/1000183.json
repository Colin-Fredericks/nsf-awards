 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop a framework to study crucial issues of risk management problems in supply chains subject to dependent disruptions. It develops a multivariate Markov chain model for uncertain production capacities to capture temporal and spatial effects of disruptions.  In the context of two-echelon supply chains with either the multi-source or assembly structure, this  research investigates the effect of the supply chain structure and the dependent disruptions on supply chain performance.  In addition to the commonly used tools in the study of two echelon supply chains, this research also utilizes  innovative methodologies from several active/new research areas, including multivariate dependence theory, copula and vine copula to study the qualitative behavior and quantitative properties of supply chains with dependent disruptions. Deliverables include new supply chain models with correlated disruptions/random yields, performance bounds and efficient computational/simulation methods to evaluate system performances and optimal ordering strategies. This research is among the first ones to address dependent stochastic disruption problems in supply chains using cupola and vine copula methods.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the result of this research will lead to optimal design and control of supply chains incorporating stochastic dependence in disruptions. The novelty of the proposed research lies in: (1)at the strategic level, firms can analyze the stochastic dependence of the supply nodes operating in different geographical locations and their impact on the demand nodes, and (2) at the operational level, it will help firms in determining optimal inventory policies, costs and customer service levels.  Research efforts and results will be disseminated through publications and web sites.  Graduate and undergraduate business and engineering students will benefit through classroom instruction and involvement in the research.  A software package enabling users to solve dependent supply chain disruption problems will be developed.",

A significant source of supply chain risk that should be considered in the design and control of supply chains is disruptions and random effect of supplies. Many real- world examples in which a single catastrophic event has significantly degraded the capabilities of several suppliers leading to considerable erosion of profits and goodwill for a company exist. It is therefore essential to consider time based dependence among disruptions in supply chain risk management. The dependence of disruptions may have either adverse or favorable impact on the cost and service level of the supply chain depending on the structure of the supply chain.

This forms the central thesis of the research presented. We focus on modeling and analysis of supply chains with time dependent disruptions and their impact on the design, control, and performance evaluation of supply chains. We first consider an <em>m</em>-manufacturer, 1-retailer, newsvendor inventory system with stochastically dependent manufacturing capacities, caused by random disruptions that may simultaneously inflict damages to the capacities of the manufacturers. We develop the structural/analytical properties of key performance measures and optimal inventory policies for the multi-source and assembly inventory systems. We show that stochastic dependence in disruptions can have opposite effects on system performance in the multi-source and assembly systems. While risk diversification is preferred in the multi-source system, risk concentration is preferred in the assembly system.
