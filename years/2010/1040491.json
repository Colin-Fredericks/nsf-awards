 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Igor Rubtsov from Tulane University will develop a robust, user-friendly, fully-automated two-dimensional (2-D) infrared spectrometer that can be used by non-specialists. The PI has a number of collaborators who are interested in using 2D-IR spectroscopy to study the vibrational spectra of medium to large molecules. The instrument will use short infrared pulses to access various vibrational transitions in a given molecule to measure couplings of the vibrational modes, angles between the transition dipoles, and correlate vibrational frequency distributions.\r\n\r\nThe academic research enterprise relies on new generations of sophisticated research instruments. The instrument will generate vibrational data which are important to understand physical and spectroscopic properties of molecules. In addition, the instrument will serve as prototype for others that will be useful for universities, government laboratories and companies. Student participation will promote formation of the new generation of instrument builders.",
