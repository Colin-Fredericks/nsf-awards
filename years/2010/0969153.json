The LLC students enrich their research skills by working in multicultural teams on scientific projects that include cross-disciplinary laboratory experiences.  Students begin with a one-week Freshman Accelerated Research Methods summer program prior to the start of their first academic sessions, followed by a year residing in the CASAR LLC.  At the end of the first year, interested CASAR students participate in a summer undergraduate research program on campus, mentored by the faculty.  During the second year, the students have the option of continuing in the CASAR-Science LLC.  In their junior and senior years, students are encouraged to participate in other existing summer undergraduate research projects both locally and at off-campus sites, and serve as mentors to incoming freshmen and sophomore LLC participants. Faculty are intimately involved at all stages of the program along with support staff, such as academic advisors, residence life personnel, counselors, tutors, and the Office of Graduate Fellowships.  As a Hispanic Serving Institution SEU is attracting and retaining traditionally underrepresented students into STEM careers.",

Of the 76 women in Cohorts 1-5, 43 of them completed/will complete a STEM degree, a 57% success rate.  All but three of Cohort 1-4 students completed their degree in four years or less.  From the HERI report on completion rates for freshman STEM aspirants matriculating in 2004: \"White and Asian American students who started as STEM majors have four-year STEM degree completion rates of 24.5% and 32.4% respectively. In comparison, Latino, Black, and Native American students who initially began college as a STEM major had four-year STEM degree completion rates of 15.9%, 13.2%, and 14.0%, respectively. \"\n\nEleven students from Austin Community College participated in 6-week summer research projects in Summer 2016.  This supplemental project was a pilot to determine if a STEM transfer pipeline could be initiated.   All 11 students reported a very satisfying experience, however, the tuition differential between the state community college and the private college was too great for the students to enroll, even with financial support.  Only one of these students plans to transfer to SEU.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard L Kopec"
