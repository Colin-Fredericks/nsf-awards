 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given  a  graph, such as a social/computer network, or the blogo-\r\nsphere, how will a virus (or rumor or new product)  propagate  in\r\nit?   Will  it take over, creating a pandemic?  How to select the\r\n'k' best nodes/edges for immunization, or, conversely,  the  best\r\n'k'  blogs  for the fastest dissemination of a new idea?  The an-\r\nswer to such questions is vital, for public health,  for  network\r\nsecurity,  for  market  penetration, for blog monitoring and many\r\nmore applications.\r\n\r\nIn the PI's past work, they studied arbitrary graphs, and  showed\r\nthat  propagation  depends  on a single number, namely, the first\r\neigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network.  Specifically,\r\nthey  studied  the  so-called  'epidemic  threshold' for flu-like\r\npropagation (``SIS'' model = susceptible-infectious-susceptible),\r\non  un-directed, un-weighted static graphs.  All earlier work fo-\r\ncused on full cliques, or homogeneous graphs, or  specific  cases\r\nof  power-law  graphs  -  *all* of which are special cases of the\r\nPI's eigenvalue result.\r\n\r\nThe major thrusts of the current proposal are two. The  first  is\r\n*theory*: For a mumps-like model (``SIR'' = susceptible - infect-\r\ned - recovered), and for additional models, when will a virus re-\r\nsult in a pandemic?  What can we say about weighted graphs? About\r\ntime-evolving graphs, like an  ad-hoc  network  of  mobile  phone\r\nusers?   The  second  thrust is on *algorithms*: Given a graph, a\r\nvirus  model  (SIS,  SIR,  etc),  and  a  fixed  budget  of   'k'\r\nnodes/edges  to  immunize, how can we quickly find an  optimal or\r\nnear-optimal solution, to best contain the  virus?   How  can  we\r\nmodify  the algorithm, when the network changes over time?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe TECHNICAL MERIT of the work is  that it is the first to focus\r\non *arbitrary* graphs, thus including real  ones.   In  contrast,\r\nthe  vast majority of past  analytical work makes unrealistic as-\r\nsumptions about the graph topology (cliques,  homogeneous  graphs\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nThe BROADER IMPACT is high, as dynamics of large-scale graphs ap-\r\npear in numerous settings: cascades on blogs; product penetration\r\nand  viral marketing; rumor/information propagation; immunization\r\npolicies; advertisement policies etc.\r\n\r\nFor  further  information  see  the  project   web   page:   URL:\r\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/NSF-PROJECTS/Immunization/",
