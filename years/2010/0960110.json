It will enable faculty and students to characterize flexibly and efficiently the detailed structure, composition, morphology and many properties of nanoscale materials and devices, including interfaces and important imperfections at near-atomic scale. This key enhancement will expand the ability of researchers to visualize their particles, thin films, patterned surfaces, wires and devices in ways that they need, but do not yet have access to in Nebraska or nearby.\r\n\r\nThe initial scientific goals of research include materials research on:  quantum electronic, spintronic and magnetic phenomena and device applications; chiral nanostructured hybrid materials; novel low-work-function and semiconducting materials; and nanoscale hard-magnet materials destined to provide more energy-efficient motors. \r\n\r\nThe related research and training activities include greater emphasis on outreach and research collaboration across the Nebraska and beyond, with the aid of the integrated telemicroscopy facility of the FE(S)TEM. The FE(S)TEM will enable enhanced recruitment of, and research productivity by, more graduate students, and will enable the investigators to expand recruiting and work with students from under-represented groups beyond present levels. The FE(S)TEM will be featured in upper-level and graduate courses, and in materials research science and engineering education.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYMAN ABSTRACT: \r\nThe operation and performance of each generation of the new materials and technology that we quickly take for granted in the work place, in travel, in communication, in entertainment and in personal life depends on the structure and properties of the key constituents at the level of individual atoms and molecules. Advanced electron microscopes, especially the field-emission (scanning) transmission-electron microscope (FE(S)TEM) that will be acquired in this project, provide researchers with the analysis tools they need to understand the performance of their latest materials and devices and to conduct research that enables the next generations of new materials and technologies. Installed in our custom-created electron microscope environment, the FE (S)TEM will provide for research use, research-training, and related education and will expand the ability of researchers to visualize their particles, thin films, patterned surfaces, wires and devices in ways that they need, but do not yet have access to in Nebraska or nearby. The materials and technology applications include: alternative and renewable energy capture, storage and supply; faster, smaller and more secure communications and information technologies that also demand less energy; detectors for use in national security, medicine, science and space; and light, strong magnets for energy-efficient cars and transportation.\r\n\r\nThe project's research and training activities include added emphasis on outreach and research collaboration across the Nebraska and beyond, aided by the integrated telemicroscopy facility of the FE(S)TEM. The FE(S)TEM will help in recruiting, educating and training a more diverse range of students for the U.S. and Nebraskan workforce. The FE(S)TEM will enhance advanced-undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as all materials research science and engineering education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main outcome of this grant has been to upgrade the Nebraska Center for Materials and Nanoscience (NCMN) Central Facility for Electron Microscopy to a high level of performance.  This comes from the purchase and installation of a state-of-the-art, high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (HRSTEM), the FEI-Technai Osiris model.  The HRSTEM instrument is  operated by NCMN as part of a user facility for some 80 faculty members and their groups in nine departments.  Specific examples of nanostructures studied in detail include Co-W, Co-Mo and Fe-Au nanoclusters of dimensions in the range 5-10 nm.  New structures and phases such as L10-structure FeAu, and Cu3Au-structure Fe3Au and Au3Fe have been created and determined for the first time.  These structural results were confirmed by fast Fourier transformation of high-resolution images of individual nanoclusters and were corroborated by selected-area diffraction.  Additional examples include metastable nanoparticles and phases such as HfCo7 and Zr2Co11.  Nanocomposite structures of high magnetic anisotropy Zr2Co11 with high magnetization Fe65Co35 have high potential as new permanent-magnet materials with no expensive, critical or rare-earth elements, but with high energy products. \n\nBroader impacts of this grant include the education of many graduate students in materials and nanoscience for the next one-to-two decades.  The research performed by these students and their advisors will have important applications in new nanomaterials for energy, nanoscale electronics, and sensors for national security.  The research enabled by the MRI grant also will have significant impact on neighboring universities and colleges, whose students and postdoctoral researchers will use the instrument.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Sellmyer"
