VUU reports to have several STEM departments with low enrollment, to suffer from poor retention, and to have below average scores by its students on Major Field Achievement tests. The planning project has the objectives to: 1) develop plans to improve enrollment; 2) develop plans to improve retention;  3) analyze the STEM infrastructure and develop plans to align it with contemporary standards; and 4) formulate an effective implementation strategy. Findings generated by the various planning activities will be evaluated in the context of published STEM education research, and an effective strategy, tailored to the specific needs of VUU, will be presented in a comprehensive implementation plan.",
