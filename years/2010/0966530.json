 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award supports student engagement in tropical plant pathology research in Costa Rica.  A diverse group of U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will conduct research on late blight of potato caused by Phytophthora infestans, black pod of cacao caused by Phytophthora species, and black Sigatoka disease of banana caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis.  Specifically, students will conduct microsatellite analysis of Phytophthora samples, calculate Phytophthora species abundance and diversity, and assess the production of light-activated toxins by M. fijiensis.  Graduate and undergraduate students will work in pairs with plant pathologists at the Universidad de Costa Rica, including Dr. Felipe Arauz, Dr. Monica Blanco, and Dr. Luis Gomez.  Students will also be mentored by researchers at Dole's Rio Frio Farm and CATIE -Tropical Agriculture Research and Higher Education Center.   Prior to the research experience, students will take a course in Tropical Plant Pathology that includes field-based learning experiences in cacao, banana, pineapple, tropical root crops, floriculture, and sugarcane fields.  \r\n\r\nThis five-week summer research experience will allow students to solve real-world problems connected to economically important diseases of tropical crops.  Students will have the opportunity to present their data to a broad community that includes the Universidad de Costa Rica, a Master's student symposium at NC State, the Oomycete Molecular Genetics Network, and major industry groups including the World Cocoa Foundation and Dole Foods.  Students will also have the opportunity to continue their research through independent studies in the fall semester.",
