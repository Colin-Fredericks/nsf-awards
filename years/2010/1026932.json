 "awd_abstract_narration": "In critical areas such as health care, energy, and environment, organizations can get stuck in undesirable patterns of action.  Some barriers to change are rooted in individual habits and beliefs, but in many situations, the problem is organizational, as patterns of action become routinized. \"Path dependence\" refers to the tendency for current actions to influence future actions. It is widely assumed that path dependence causes repetitive patterns of action to become \"locked in\" and resistant to change, like organizational habits.  However, this research team has conducted preliminary research that has identified conditions under which path dependence can lead to continuous change and learning.  \r\n\r\nThis project will use data from workflow management systems and computer simulations to build a more refined theory of when patterns of action get locked in, when they remain open to change and the factors that make innovation and change possible.  The work will consider the inherent structure and variability of patterns, as well as effects of social networks and automation. The results will provide insight into fundamental issues of stability and change in organizations.  In addition to scholarly publications and presentations, the proposed work will result in analytical software tools that other researchers can use to investigate changes in patterns of action over time.  The project includes a collaboration with the BI Norwegian School of Management, in Oslo, Norway.",

Some barriers to change are rooted in individual habits and beliefs, but in many situations, the problem is organizational, as patterns of action become routinized and \"path dependent.\" Path dependence refers to the tendency for current actions to influence future actions. It is widely assumed that repetition within a routine contributes to path dependence, whereby the pattern of action gets \"locked in\" and becomes resistant to change.  At the same time, empirical research and practical experience both suggest that patterns of action often change or drift, even when we want them to remain constant.  Therefore, the goal of this project has been to better understand the role of path dependence in repetitive patterns of action.\n\nThis project has contributed to knowledge on this problem in three ways.  First, we developed and demonstrated software tools for detecting and analyzing changes in repetitive patterns of action.  These tools allow researchers to identify and study these phenomena even when participants may be unaware of changes.  Second, we identified factors that promote or inhibit change in repetitive patterns of action, including the complexity of the existing patterns.  Explaining the central role of complexity stands as a key contribution of this project, since it had not been identified in prior research. Third, we proposed a new theory that explains occasional periods of dramatic change in patterns of action that seem to defy the constraints of path dependence entirely. \n\nThese project outcomes are significant because they contribute to our understanding of stability and change in organizational processes and routines.  The dynamics of routines has practical implications in business, healthcare, government, and any sector where organizations strive to be more innovative and efficient.   We have promoted and disseminated these outcomes through publications in scholarly journals, conference and the Internet. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/22/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian T Pentland"
