 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing curricula modules to prepare manufacturing technology practitioners for the aerospace industry and increase the number of interested candidates for aerospace manufacturing jobs. The project identifies and addresses the changing skill sets required to meet the needs of the aerospace industry for advanced manufacturing technicians through the appropriate knowledge and skill sets coupled with aerospace centric examples and context. Curricula modules are being developed and used by two-year colleges for student education and by industry for in-house training of employees. The project results are being disseminated through a broad set of venues such as the Aerospace Automation Consortium, publications, conferences, and expositions of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, and presented through academic journals and conference proceedings.",

Modules consist of PowerPoint presentations, audio-visual materials, instructor notes, pre- and post-tests, suggested student activities and student reference materials. This approach  was used  to address the fact that developing and seeking approval for new curriculum at the community college level can be a very cumbersome and costly process, from inception to delivery sometimes taking as long as three semesters. Rather than bogging faculty down by following course and curriculum approval processes, the modules are designed to be integrated into existing related courses.\nThe modules are ava..."
