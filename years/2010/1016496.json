 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Surya is a scientific experiment aimed at quantifying the radiative forcing due to black carbon (BC) from biomass-fueled cooking and heating fires. Roughly 2.5 billion people depend on biomass burning for cooking and heating which contributes about 25% of the global BC emissions. Absorption of solar radiation by BC is estimated to contribute as much as 20% to 55% of the CO2 to global warming. \r\n\r\nThe study will encompass a detailed analysis of the results of efforts to reduce BC emissions from 350 rural households in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) region of Northern India. The reductions would be achieved by replacing traditional village cooking stoves with poor combustion efficiencies to modern stoves with higher efficiencies. The fundamental goal of the year-long study will be to collect and analyze observational data to test whether the effects of conversion to \"clean\" cooking on radiative forcing are discernable, and whether the net result warms or cools.  The change in net radiative forcing will warm if the reduction in reflecting aerosol is greater than the reduction in absorbing aerosol, and vise versa.  The hypothesis is that the net reduction will result in cooling. This is what will be tested in this proof-of-concept study.  The principal investigator (PI) estimates a ratio significantly greater than one, of reduced absorbing aerosol to reflecting aerosol, which means that a massive conversion to clean cooking would have a significant negative feedback (cooling) to CO2-forced warming.  His estimate must be tested with observations.  This EAGER award will enable that test.  If he is right, the science and applications will be transformative.  The project is  risky for several reasons, among them are the robustness of the measurement of the ratio, the difficulties of upscaling information to much larger, more heterogeneous regions in India, and the new IT data collection techniques developed for working in an environment like an Indian village.  If successful, the payoff could be globally significant.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Project Surya could lead to the rapid reduction of warming aerosol and gases. With indoor pollution killing over a million people a year, global action to cut soot emissions could be of major and immediate benefit for both public health and the climate.",

Our results demonstrate that cooking drives local outdoor BC concentrations. BC concentrations exhibit a strong diurnal pattern, with peaks during morning and evening cooking hours at magnitudes five times higher than mid-day and nighttime concentrations. \nForced draft stoves are best from a BC mitigation perspective [Kar et al., 2012(P5)]. We found that certain forced draft technologies (which employ an external fan to drive airflow into the combustion chamber) clearly outperform natural draft technologies (which passively enhance airflow) in terms of BC reduction. These results were extended and corroborated by our pilot health impacts study across 9 villages in 2 states, which found that forced draft stoves provided superior reductions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO).\nWe have developed low-cost cellphone technologies that make it possible to measure BC on the ground with unprecedented spatial resolution for the first time [Ramanthan et al., 2011(P6)]. We successfully developed and field-tested this new instrument. This sensor technology cuts measurement costs by a factor of 10, enabling BC sampling over large, heterogeneous areas..\n\n\n Publications supported fu..."
