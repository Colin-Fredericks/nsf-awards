In this study, Latin American countries' different responses to the efforts by international financial institutions are investigated including identifying the factors that explain the variation in responses. Interviews will be conducted with key informants and a content analysis will be carried out on policy documents to examine how different levels of state capacity and autonomy shaped health reform in three countries: Peru, Costa Rica and Argentina.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis project will be of interest to political and medical sociologists, public health scholars, policy researchers, and Latin Americanists as it extends sociological theories and examines the process of health sector reform in a new context. The results should be of interest to policy makers who may find this information valuable in the construction of future plans, agreements and reforms.",
