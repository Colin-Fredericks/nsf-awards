 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are exploring computer system archiectures that will enable extremely high quality interactive computer graphics. Current commercial graphics processing units (GPUs) are capable of rendering a large number of triangles at interactive rates, but consume a tremendous amout of power in order to do so. The goal of the proposed research is to develop new architectures for high-performance graphics processing that will significantly enhance the ability to render visually realistic scenes, and to do so in a manner that consumes less power than current GPU power growth trends. This involves the development of novel chip microarchitecture, memory systems, and graphics algorithms. We are primarily targeting ray tracing as a rendering algorithm because of its ability to support high-quality composite lighting effects such as shadows, transparency, reflections, refractions, and indirect illumination.\r\n \r\nThe human computer interface has been significantly enhanced by improved graphics systems. We believe that increasing visual realism will enhance commodity system support of virtual realistic interfaces. Energy efficiency is a national priority and reduced energy consumption is critical to reducing the cost of computing systems. Cheap, yet high quality graphics will enable a broader user spectrum to efficiently interact with the information infrastructure.",
