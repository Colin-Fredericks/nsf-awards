 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work will facilitate the synthesis and integration of research carried out under MARGINS source-to-sink initiative through an inclusive international conference and the creation of a digital text and educational resources. Knowledge gained in a wet tropical setting (New Guinea and the Gulf of Papua) will be contrasted with that completed in a temperate setting (New Zealand and its adjacent continental margin) in order to resolve fundamental differences in the operation of processes that transfer mass (particulate and dissolved) across the Earth surface. The general goal of the meeting is to articulate the ideas that are the foundation for a holistic understanding of sediment dispersal from land origins to marine accumulation, and to explore the theoretical and observational studies that support them. \r\n\r\nA synthesis of the S2S science in itself would be an important resource for the broader Earth science community. Other broader impacts include participation of graduate students and young investigators in the conference, production of digital text for advanced college courses and mini lessons for introductory courses, and inclusion of applied scientists, geoscience educators and others who study the stratigraphic record.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMaterials that flow from the land to the ocean have great value to both places.  The solid particles are especially important, because the resulting sedimentation builds surfaces in places where we want growth (e.g., the shoreline) and in places where we do not want growth (e.g., harbor siltation).  Many geochemical species are preferentially carried on the surfaces of sediment particles, and these can also be good (e.g., carbon that has created fossil fuels) and bad (e.g., many pollutants).  Understanding the pathways and fates of sediment is important for minimizing negative impacts, especially during periods of changing environmental conditions.\n\n \n\nIn the past, segments of sediment dispersal systems were investigated alone.  Rivers or deltas or continental shelves were studied separately to understand the processes driving the movement and accumulation of sediment (e.g., river hydrography, tidal currents, surface waves).  In this manner, scientists learned about the segments in an isolated condition.  A decade ago, Ocean Sciences at NSF sponsored the Source-to-Sink (S2S) research program (through MARGINS).  This program began investigations that focused on the linkages between the various segments of sediment dispersal systems.\n\n \n\nMany lessons have been learned, and they continue to be learned &ndash; as much S2S-inspired research has continued around the world.  For one example, the timing of river discharge relative to ocean energetics is now understood to be a critical factor affecting the proximal deposition or distal displacement of particles discharged from a river mouth.  This in turn is dependent on many factors: the length of the river, the proximity of mountainous source areas, the latitudinal setting, the width of the continental shelf, the morphology of the continental margin.  Our understanding of these and other linkages has greatly improved, and continues to provide discoveries as a result of S2S research.\n\n \n\nThis research grant allowed the new knowledge to be presented, discussed and disseminated among a wide range of scientists.  In addition to senior investigators leading the studies, many new and young scientists were exposed to S2S research.  This occurred through an AGU Chapman conference in 2011, which allowed &gt;100 international participants to introduce each other to their most recent S2S results.  It continued with a special session at the 2013 AGU Fall meeting, where more opportunity was provided for exchange of ideas.  And, the final vehicle for dissemination is a special issue of the journal Earth-Science Reviews, which will be published in 2015.\n\n \n\nWith S2S, NSF provided an opportunity to seed innovative research, which expanded our conceptualization of sediment dispersal from land sources to ocean sinks.  And then NSF provided a mechanism, through this grant, to integrate the discoveries and design future studies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/27/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles A Nittrouer"
