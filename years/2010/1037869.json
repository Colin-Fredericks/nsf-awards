ISCRA is a biannual event that attracts a large number of young scientists and has proven to be the most respected summer school for high energy astrophysics. The title of this year's school is \"Astro and Particle Physics: from underground to outer space.\"\r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, the School will address the field of very high energy cosmic ray phenomena and is aimed at advanced graduate students and young postdoctoral associates. The Proceedings of the school will be published so that others can take advantage of the lectures.",
