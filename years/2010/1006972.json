 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question of confinement and surface effects on material behavior at the nanoscale, and in particular the glass transition (Tg) and related dynamics, will be addressed using a model thermosetting material confined to various nanoconfining geometries, including freely-standing and supported thin films, rods, and spheres.  The relative contributions of surface and intrinsic size effects will be systematically varied since the scaling of the surface area to volume as a function of nanoconfinement length scale differs for different geometries.  Model polycyanurate materials will be used in the study because they allow annealing of residual stresses without dewetting or hole growth problems and allow facile synthesis of both freely-standing, as well as supported structures.  The effect of crosslink density on the Tg depression will be examined in order to test recent suggestions that molecular stiffness and size of the cooperatively rearranging regions are important factors for determining the magnitude of the Tg changes.  The glass transition temperature will be measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as a function of cooling rate, and dynamics will be measured using a new method for measuring the linear dynamic specific heat using quasi-isothermal DSC.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nThe properties of polymers in thin films and other special geometries are going to be studied in the solid state by a variety of experimental techniques. The results of the research are important for a fundamental understanding of nanoscale behavior and to test recent hypotheses for this behavior.  In addition, the results are important to electronic and aerospace industries since they will facilitate optimization of polymer properties in nanoelectronic, nanolithographic, and nanocomposite applications.  The proposed work includes the training of two graduate students and an undergraduate researcher in cutting edge research involving polymer chemistry and physics at the nanoscale and calorimetry.  Ethics training will be incorporated into the training of the students.  The PI has a strong track record working with minority and female students, and a strong effort will similarly be made to include underrepresented students in this project.  Outreach will include development of a one-week long polymer module for the TTU program, \"Science - It's a Girl Thing,\" for girls in high school, and the development of four two-hour modules for the TTU Super Saturdays science program for 4th to 6th graders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this research project was to understand changes in the glass transition temperature (Tg) and associated dynamics in nanoconfined polymers; such understanding is becoming increasingly important as size scales decrease in nanoelectronic and nanocomposite applications.  As part of this work, we developed protocols for chip calorimetry to investigate the Tg and enthalpy recovery for samples with one or more dimensions in the nanometer range.  This technique extends the measurement time to much shorter times and higher rates compared with conventional calorimetry, allowing us to measure Tg at cooling rates of 1000 K/s and enthalpy recovery for times as short as 0.01 s.  Using this technique, we demonstrated that the Tg depression in supported polystyrene ultrathin films depends on cooling rate and substrate, thereby reconciling a number of seemingly discrepant results in the literature.  More importantly, we showed that high-temperature annealing resulted in film thickening, resulting in a full recovery of the depressed Tg back to the bulk value.  This experiment conclusively proved that the Tg depression at the nanoscale is not an artifact of sample preparation, as had been suggested by some researchers.  In addition, we demonstrated, for the first time, the three signatures of structural recovery in enthalpy space for a single polystyrene sample over the entire response range; this important outcome is expected to allow future researchers to test models of structural recovery and glassy behavior with both enthalpy and volumetric data, thereby facilitating refinement of models. \n\nIn parallel work, we examined the Tg depression for three cyanurate materials and found that the Tg depression in nanopore confinement increased with increasing molecular weight and nominal Tg, and in contrast to a suggestion in the literature, the depression did not correlate with the fragility of the glass-former.  We also found for these materials that the origin of the enhancement of reactivity at the nanoscale was unrelated to the origin of the Tg depression: the enhancement of reactivity appears to arise from surface packing, whereby the concentration of functional groups is higher at the nanoscale than in the bulk due to layering at the surface, whereas the Tg depression seems to arise from an intrinsic size effect.  Preliminary work comparing the Tg depression in nanopores and in ultrathin film geometries also appears to suggest that both an intrinsic size and surface effects may be important for determining the magnitude of the Tg reduction, and ongoing work is anticipated to more clearly resolve this issue.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sindee L Simon"
