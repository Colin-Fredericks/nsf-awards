 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future networks will be heterogeneous and they will need to be scalable, highly controllable, and secure. These future heterogeneous networks will have multiple modalities (wired, wireless, satellite) and range from low (100?s of b/s) to ultra-high user data rates (over 100 Gb/s). Major challenges facing the deployment of such networks include; the coordination of the widely different data rates offered by different subnets to the users, efficient support of heterogeneous voice, video and data services with several orders spread in transaction sizes and rates, and the development of a common set of protocols that works across disparate networks with very different physical layer attributes. This workshop brings together investigators to discuss the research and development activities needed to enable the end-to-end, scalable, highly controllable, secure heterogeneous networks of the future. This activity is of interest to the Large Scale Networking Coordinating Group (LSN) of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) interagency community.",

The current layer partitioning may not be the best for investigating radically different and better network architectures. Indeed, recent developments in the physical layer of communication systems lead to functions and behaviors that do not fit current network architecture assumptions regarding physical layer properties. Some examples are:\n\n \n&bull; wireless nodes with multiple antennae supporting higher-layer control of bandwidth, antenna beam patterning and power allocations;\n\n \n&bull; optical networks capable of dynamically establishing and modifying high-bandwidth end-to-end transparent light-paths; and\n\n \n&bull; communication satellites incorporating packet switching in which the combination of high latency and inherent multicast lead to routing behaviors fundamentally different from terrestrial wireline routers.\n\n \nFew upper layer network architectures in recent years have taken advantage of the new space of possibilities at the physical layer. Substantial network performance improvements can be achieved if future network research emphasizes and exploits the interplay of the physical layer and the higher network layers including applications. Hitherto network management and control has not demanded focused investigation. Sessions were short and have small to moderate sizes, enabling fluctuations to be smoothed by data plane statistical multiplexing. This limited the required response rate of the control plane. In the future this approach will no longer be sufficient, due to new behaviors such as \"elephant sessions\" that occupy an entire optical network wavelength for durations as short as seconds, and broadband wireless sessions bursting at multi-gigabits per second. Effects like these will reduce the required speed of control plane adaptation from minutes to seconds and sub-seconds. With changes of such magnitude, network management scalability and network state sensing and propagation are big concerns. This is more than an isolated problem in the control plane. The phy..."
