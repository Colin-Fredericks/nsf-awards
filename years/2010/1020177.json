 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developers and researchers at North Carolina State University and Horizon Research, Inc. are adapting and studying successful discourse strategies used during language arts instruction to help teachers promote mathematically-rich classroom discourse. Of special interest to the project is the use of models to promote mathematics communication that includes English language learners (ELL) in mathematics discourse.\r\n  \r\nThe project is conceived as a design experiment that includes successive instructional engineering cycles in which the R&D team designs professional learning tasks, implements the tasks with teachers, and revises the tasks and their sequencing to better support the desired learning outcomes. The members of the project team then examine the effects of the PD on teachers' instruction and the possibilities for scaling up the materials across PD facilitators, grade levels, and curriculum materials. The overarching research questions guiding the research and development effort proposed in this project are: How do generalist elementary teachers learn to promote high quality mathematics discourse that includes all students in their classrooms and engages those students in meaningful mathematics learning opportunities? How do we scale up an intervention designed to support elementary teacher learning of ways to promote high quality mathematics discourse in their classrooms?\r\n\r\nThe project will result in a full 40-hour professional development module to support mathematics discourse for Grade 2 teachers, with an emphasis on place value, multidigit addition and subtraction, and linear measurement. The main professional learning tasks of the program will have been piloted and studied in a series of sessions with mathematics coaches and teachers.",

Between 2011-2015 Project AIM trained and supported PD providers in facilitating the program for about 200 first and second grade teachers in a large school district serving approximately 5 percent of English Learners. The project showed that participating teachers improved their mathematics knowledge for teaching, perceptions of preparedness to facilitate discourse rich instruction, attention to aspects of lesson planning, and frequency of using strategies to promote discourse increased following their engagement in the program.\nIntellectual Merit\nThrough the research and development of Project AIM PD materials, as well as the support materials and training for PD providers, this project demonstrated that a highly-specified program can be successfully implemented by facilitators who were not part of the program design. It also showed that a program focused on discourse strategies can be implemented with teachers who are using different curriculum materials--although teachers repeatedly mentioned the alignment between district and program goals as important for the success of the PD. The study examined how PD providers interpreted and used the program with elementary grades teachers, attending particularly to facilitation moves and the norms established in the PD.\nBroader Impacts\n\nProject AIM generated frameworks, discourse strategies, and tools for elementary grades teachers to use as they analyze, plan for, enact, and reflect on lessons aimed at promoting high quality discourse for each and every student, in particular English Learners and other students who are learning how to effectively communicate about mathematics. These frameworks, strategies, and tools can continue to support teachers and learners across the nation as Project AIM is scaled up and used in other school districts. Project publications and presentations support teachers? understanding of how to promote high-quality discourse for mathematics learning; illustrate ways that Project AIM discourse strategies can be implemented effectively in the classroom; and examine how the PD materials supported teachers? professional learning experiences, including study of discussions about their own instruction versus the instruction of others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paola Sztajn"
