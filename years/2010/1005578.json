 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project supported by this award is to create new computer programs to calculate the interactions and properties of systems of three nucleons (atomic number A=3) using the most general form of interactions allowed by the physical laws of nature.  These new computer programs will be made publicly available, thereby allowing other researchers to explore different parameters of the interaction or different interactions without the need to write the intricate computer programs needed to explore a three-nucleon system.  A main motivation for this study is to understand the complex interactions between protons and neutrons in the nucleus; however the computational techniques used can also be applied to other areas of physics where three-body interactions are present, such as atomic physics (research with cold atoms) and particle physics (quark interactions inside the proton).\r\n\r\nThe method of predicting the behavior of three or more interacting bodies is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. While the interactions of two particles are fairly easy to calculate, the so-called three-body problem is much more difficult to solve.  A method attributed to Faddeev is now widely used, but the implementation of the Faddeev equations requires long and involved calculations that are best suited for powerful computers. The traditional approach to calculating the Faddeev equations uses a mathematical technique called partial-wave expansion.  However, as the energy increases in the three-body system, this mathematical technique becomes inefficient.  The current project utilizes a novel mathematical approach of taking spin traces, which allows the three-body problem to be solved at much higher energies, and generally increases the flexibility of implementing a wider class of inter-particle forces.  Hence, this project will provide a better theoretical framework for the investigation of the three-body problem than is presently feasible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThough Einstein's theory of special relativity was formulated over 100\nyears ago, there are still unsolved issues when considering systems\nthat contain more than two particles, since in such a system pairs can\nbe influenced by the presence and motion of other particles. The\nsimplest system for which the role of the force between a pair of\nnucleons (neutron or protons) in the presence of another nucleon can\nbe quantitatively investigated is the three nucleon system. Since the\nthree-nucleon problem can be numerically solved with controlled\nerrors, it provides an ideal theoretical laboratory for investigating\nthe effects of special relativity in a few-nucleon environment.  Over\nthe years, computational advances have extended the range of energies\nfor which the three-nucleon problem can be (numerically) solved\nexactly.  However, including the effects of special relativity in a\nquantum mechanical description of the three-body problem is remains a\nchallenge.  Integrating new theoretical and computational capabilities\nto understand relativistic effects in the three-nucleon system was one\nof the goals of this project.  Our calculations of the bound state of\nthree nucleons (e.g. Helium-3) resulted in a detailed understanding of\nthe of the role of relativistic effects and the first explicit\ncomparison between non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions,\nwhich describe the velocity distribution between a nucleon pair and\nthe spectator nucleon.  We identified four different types of\nrelativistic corrections and show that those must all be treated\nconsistently in order to get an accurate determination of the effects\nof relativity.  Accurate relativistic wave functions for Helium-3 and\nTritium nuclei will be needed as input to compute the distribution of\ncharge and currents in these nuclei, which will be measured in the\nMARATHON experiment, which is an approved experiment for the 12-GeV\nupgrade Jefferson National Laboratory.  The work carried out within\nthis project also paves the way for extending the the three-nucleon\nbound-state calculations to treat high-energy collisions of two and\nthree nucleon systems. Collisions of a proton with a Deuterium target\nat moderately high energies (around 250 MeV) indicates that our\ncurrent understanding of the nuclear forces between two and\nthree-nucleons is insufficient and some new short-distance physics may\ncome into play.  For such considerations it is crucial to be able to\ncarry out calculations that treat relativistic effects consistently.\n\nWhile three-body models are an important tool to investigate questions\nrelevant what governs the to the underlying physics of the system, the\nnumerical codes to carry out realistic and precise three-body\ncalculations require a significant development and testing\neffort.
