In each of these three areas mathematicians use similar algebro-geometric, representation theoretic, and analytic methods. By bringing researchers in these three areas together, the conference will create new collaborations and strengthen ongoing collaborations between US and European mathematicians. It will expose a number of young researchers and graduate students from the US to fundamental research by leading mathematicians. Informal sessions will provide ample opportunities for junior researchers and graduate students to interact with experts in the fields. The conference will also provide a valuable opportunity for the US graduate students to exchange ideas and education experience with their European peers. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
