 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is tracing future teachers understanding of foundational big ideas (those that span all science disciplines) as the teachers engage in the phenomena and practice of science within the context of specific topics in life, earth, and physical science in the K-8 science curriculum. Based on the analysis of students learning progressions, three on-line learning modules are being developed for use in a range of pre-service courses.  The foundational big ideas are conservation of matter and energy and the causative role of energy in changing matter. The modules focus on specific topics in life science (photosynthesis), earth science (weathering), and physical science (combustion) that are essential to an elementary teachers understanding and provide an opportunity to apply the big ideas within and across disciplines.\r\n\r\nEach learning module includes three components. An introductory knowledge component includes a sequenced framework of disciplinary big ideas tied to the foundational big ideas along with common misconceptions. The second component is a system of assessments that allows for eliciting misconceptions and gaps in understanding at multiple time points in students learning progressions. A third component consists of a set of evidence-based teaching strategies developed from assessment data, misconceptions, and big ideas. These teaching strategies provide faculty with a range of responses at specific points in students learning progressions.  The learning modules are based on following the learning progressions of 450 pre-service elementary teachers and using that assessment data to develop evidence-based teaching strategies and learning materials. Continual assessment is being used to track individuals learning progressions toward understanding the big ideas in a broad range of disciplinary phenomena. Clinical interviews and focus groups are being used to provide a deeper exploration of student understanding and of the teaching strategies and learning materials that promote understanding in individual students. An iterative process of assessment and analysis of student understanding is being used to inform subsequent design and implementation of teaching strategies. This design-based approach ultimately will lead to the development of the learning modules for use by other institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            One of the most important fundamental ideas in K-12 science education is the principle of matter conservation.  In simple words, matter is made of tiny particles called atoms that come together to form groups called molecules.  While molecules can form and be destroyed and new molecules form from the original atoms, the atoms themselves are permanent.  Atoms last forever in physical or chemical changes.  A second, parallel principle, of similar importance, is the principle of energy conservation.  Again, in simple words, energy exists in many forms and comes in units that can be counted (think your electric bill, or the calorie count of your favorite food).  While energy can change from one form to another, the total number of energy units is constant.  In other words, energy units are forever.  These two principles are the foundation for understanding all physical and chemical changes that occur in our daily lives, such as how materials are recycled, or how babies grow, or how burning gasoline leads to climate change.  While the context can vary between Earth science and life science, the principle remains the same: atoms and energy units are forever.\n\n            However, many people of all ages and education levels confuse these two separate principles, thinking that matter can turn into energy (such as when a fuel burns) and that energy can turn into matter (such as when light energy is used by plants to make sugar).  This confusion makes it difficult for people to understand and make decisions about important personal issues (such as weight gain) and societal issues (environmental pollutants entering the food chain).    \n\n            We developed an instructional model to help college students in an elementary education program develop principle-based reasoning skills.   These undergraduates were not science majors and had only two college science courses.  Thus, in many ways, their science background was similar to that of the general adult population of the United States, even though these college students would be teaching science in two years. \n\n            We developed physical models to illustrate the principles of conservation of matter and energy.  For our model of matter, we use paper clips, with each paper clip representing one atom, and different colors of paper clips representing atoms of different elements.  When the paper clips are connected together they paper clip group represents a molecule.  To illustrate that atoms are forever, we use pocket scales to mass the paper clips.  The mass of a group of unattached paper clips (single atoms) is identical to the mass of the same paper clips connected together (a molecule).  Similarly, the mass of several groups of paper clips (several molecules) is identical to the mass of different molecules made from the original atoms.  Both of these examples illustrate that an object\u00c6s mass comes from the total mass of individual \"atoms\" and that atoms are forever.\n\n            For our energy model, we use paper strips, with each square-inch strip representing one unit of energy and different colors of strips representing different forms of energy.  We put paper strips on a paper template of a mathematical equation.  Using the math equation shows that the number of energy units is forever, even if the form of energy changes.   \n\n            We use this \"clips and strips\" model to illustrate conservation of matter and energy during physical and chemical changes, whether the context is life science (germinating bean seeds), Earth science (mining and recycling of Earth materials), or physical science (combustion of fuels).  Our online learning modules use a virtual \"clips &amp; strips\" model that high school and college students can manipulate as they work through problems in life, Earth, and physical science.\n\n            We found that college students who were not science majors could understand and use these principles when asked about new scenarios that had not..."
