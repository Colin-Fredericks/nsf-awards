The funding opportunity will be broadly announced, affording students ample notice and time to apply.  Applications will be reviewed by committee, and $400 in support will be provided to the winning students.\r\n\r\nThe students will have an opportunity to present their research at the conferences and to see over 500 papers and 40 posters, which will be presented at the conferences.  They will have a chance to interact with other students and faculty from their field, and to gain valuable insights for the start of their careers.  This will help to improve America's supply of manufacturing engineers.",
