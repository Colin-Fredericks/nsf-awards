 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reliability is extremely important for some software and hardware\r\napplications. One approach is to use a programming language with a\r\nmechanized logic---a so-called theorem-prover---to prove theorems that\r\nestablish some critical behavioral characteristics. Among theorem-provers,\r\nACL2 has found use with several industrial suppliers of high assurance\r\nsoftware and hardware. ACL2 does not support component-oriented software\r\ndevelopment, however, making it difficult to use with large and complex\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nThis research project has three goals: to add a pragmatic module system to\r\nACL2; to equip it with a hygienic macro system; and to investigate a type\r\nsystem that accommodates ACL2's programming idioms.  The project team\r\nemploys a cyclic, three-step exploration method. The first step is to\r\nadapt constructs from existing, similar languages to ACL2, especially a\r\nlogical meaning consistent with the theorem prover of ACL2. The second\r\nstep is to explore the pragmatics of the design with a wide range of\r\nexamples. The third step is to add implementations to a pedagogic,\r\ninteractive development environment for ACL2 and to evaluate their\r\nusefulness in software engineering courses. The results of this last step\r\nare used to re-start the cycle.\r\n\r\nThe work will contribute to the dissemination of theorem provers in\r\nclassrooms and industry. The research team expects to expose college\r\nstudents to the use of theorem proving in the design and development of\r\ncomplex systems with dozens, and possibly hundreds, of reliable\r\ncomponents. The team also hopes to improve the ability of industrial ACL2\r\nprogrammers to tackle complex component-oriented systems.",
