These include (i) Replacement of air usage with compressed Nitrogen gas for bump, scour, and airlift. (ii) Elimination of nuisance biological growth on weir walls by dosing carbon right over the filter bed using Venturi eductor principles. (iii) Inclusion of alkalinity buffering rock materials in bed media.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project will be more efficient treatment of municipal wastewater in order to reduce total nitrogen concentrations entering the nation's waters.  A secondary benefit is reduction in the use of methanol that is currently used as a carbon source in the filtration process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLoss of fish populations, green algae blooms and foul odors in and around water bodies are known to be caused by high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous.  Under controlled conditions, these elements are a necessity for plant growth and human existence, but in excess, they can harm the environment.  One of the primary sources of excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the environment comes from the processing facilities that treat sewer and other wastewaters.  These facilities use a number of technologies to remove solids, dissolved materials, phosphorous and nitrogen from the wastewater and then release the water to the environment.  One of the technologies often used to reduce the nitrogen to very low levels is call a \"denitrifying sand filter\".  These filters use natural biological processes (i.e., microorganisms) to turn nitrate into nitrogen gas.  These filters can be operated with the water flowing down through the sand or water flowing up through the sand.  The nitrogen gas produced in the denitrification process enters the atmosphere and combines with the nitrogen gas already present in the air we breathe (air is almost 80% nitrogen).  In order to remove the nitrate, a soluble organic (i.e., carbon-containing) compound must be added in small quantities to the filter to feed the microorganisms.  Unfortunately, most wastewater treatment facilities have historically used methanol for this purpose because methanol is a compound with a simple chemical structure.  Methanol is produced from natural gas, and is made almost exclusively outside the United States.  There are operational challenges associated with using more complex chemicals due to the manner in which the microorganisms use the chemical for growth.  The objective of this SBIR project was to investigate and develop operating strategies for denitrifying sand filters that would allow for the use of more complex, but also more environmentally friendly (i.e., non-flammable) and sustainable, materials such as sugars and glycerin derived from U.S. agricultural supplies.\n\nCompressed air is typically used to periodically clean the sand and thus maintain denitrifying filters in good working order.  However, the microorganisms within these filters that convert nitrate to nitrogen gas (called \"denitrifiers\") also consume the dissolved oxygen in the water, and must consume the oxygen first before they can remove the nitrate.  While necessary for filter cleaning, the introduction of air raises dissolved oxygen levels, thereby reducing the treatment ability of the filter.  This is especially pronounced when feeding more complex molecules to the microorganisms for food (such as sugars and glycerin).   A reduction in pH is also often observed when feeding these complex molecules, because of higher amounts of carbon dioxide production, which does not occur when feeding methanol.   Lower filter pH is known to reduce the efficiency of nitrate transformation to nitrogen gas.  Finally, for down-flow filter systems, the challenges associated with evenly distributing a chemical directly above the sand bed have led to a dosing method of adding the material to the water in the feed pipe leading to the filter. This method has led to nuisance biological growth on the influent walls of the filter, which can lead to operational problems that are again more pronounced when using more complex molecules compared to methanol.\n\nHence modifications to denitrifying sand filter operations that would (1) lower oxygen addition; (2) allow for good pH control; and (3) reduce biological grown on influent walls, would be advantageous when more complex molecules derived from renewable (i.e., non-petroleum) sources are used as food for the denitrifying microorganisms.  As such, this SBIR project investigated the replacement of air with compressed nitrogen gas for filter maintenance and also investigated whether filter performance could be stabilized or improved by adding a solid pH-control material to the sand.
