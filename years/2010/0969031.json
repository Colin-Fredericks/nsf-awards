Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the University of North Texas (UNT) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with CSM as the lead institution.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center aims to establish the industrial support, operational mechanisms, and a prospective research portfolio for a viable research Center that will conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced non-ferrous structural alloys.  The PIs are proposing the following topical areas: solidification and casting, lightweight alloys (Al, Mg and Ti), high performance alloys (superalloys), and high production alloys.  The PIs will insure that students have the opportunity to work on state-of-the-art projects and be mentored by both experimental and modeling experts.  CSM and UNT plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest relevance. \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing by developing advanced non-ferrous alloys that could reduce energy consumption and pollution in the manufacturing of these alloys.  The research would also improve the competitiveness of US manufacturers.  The PIs will insure that both undergraduate and graduate students receive appropriate education and training to become well grounded in the fundamental principles of physical metallurgy. The Center plans to provide research opportunities to qualified students from underrepresented groups, and to hiring researchers (from the minority groups) at the faculty level that might expand the Center activities.  The proposed Center will showcase its activities and invite high school students from the local community to emphasize to them the role of structural materials in the world around them.",

The support was used to advertise and eventually hold a 1.5 day meeting in October 2010 in which the attending faculty presented several possible initial project ideas to the industrial participants.  The attending companies were then asked to provide feedback as to which projects they were most supportive of &ndash; this input was used to identify the top ten projects of interest and these were then incorporated into the full center proposal, which was eventually supported.  The emphasis of this new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) is on conducting state-of-the-art research related to non?ferrous structural alloys.  This is a joint center between the Colorado School of Mines and the University of North Texas and is focused on combining computational modeling (various length and time scales) and experimental approaches (alloying, processing and microstructure/property characterization) in order to advance industrially-relevant projects in an efficient and effective manner.  The topics are subdivided into three areas &ndash; (1) Lightweight Alloys (Al and Mg), (2) High Performance Alloys (Ti alloys and Ni-base superalloys) and (3) Advanced Alloys and Processes (e.g., shape memory alloys, advanced processing strategies, etc.) and the focus is on industries that develop, manufacture and use these alloys and processes.
