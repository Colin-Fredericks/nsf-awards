 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theories of dynamic representation (that is, the linkage between changes in aggregate public opinion and government response over time) are well established.  But they are based upon global measures of both public opinion and policy responsiveness.  Recent studies have shown the value of considering policy responsiveness separately in specific issue-domains.  This study tests more broadly theories of dynamic representation on a number of individual policy areas.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will produce an innovative database allowing the systematic integration of public opinion measures with existing measures of public policy priorities.  The project allows for the first time the large-scale integration of public opinion and public policy measures across a multitude of policy domains.  \r\n\r\nFew questions are as central to the notion of representative democracy as the linkage between public opinion and public policy response, so this project will have important contributions to make on a core issue of American government.  It also contributes to the infrastructure available to all scholars.  In addition, the project provides training for graduate and undergraduate students and provides the integrations of the new data resources into teaching a number of different levels.",
