 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this GOALI project is to initiate integrated research in the related fields of optical design and testing to support a transformational technology - Optical surface finishing based on slurry with magnetic properties. This GOALI will specifically transform the field by moving well beyond the near term goals to research and then apply key new technologies to the U.S.-based manufacture of optics that are not rotationally symmetric, including fully freeform surfaces.  These types of surfaces have yet to be economically manufactured with precision for use with emerging Gigapixel detectors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: There are a number of fronts available to advance science.  First, there are the new surface definitions proposed by QED to provide a valid mathematical basis for developing manufacturing tolerances on the complex surface parameters.  Second, there is the ongoing work at the University of Rochester to develop and disseminate the technology surrounding Nodal Aberration Theory that provides revolutionary insight into the fundamental theory of optical systems without symmetry. In addition, there is ongoing active research in finding novel, in-situ testing methods for these new surfaces.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The footprint of this program is substantial.  It covers advancing simultaneously the industries that enable higher performance optical systems in support of other advancing technologies, for example high-definition video, remote sensing with Gigapixel sensors, and optical lithography for making computers faster and smaller. Expanding beyond the opportunity to influence the lives of graduate students, the program will also incorporate research experiences for undergraduates, aimed specifically at underrepresented minorities.",
