Equipment that will be acquired includes a laser diffraction particle size analyzer, stereomicroscope,  purified water system, microbalance, benchtop centrifuge, laboratory oven, sample microsplitter and vortex mixer.  Characterization of grain size, shape, particle distribution, and mineralogy will aid in determination of sediment provenance and the hydrodynamic conditions of deposition for studies of barrier beach evolution and dynamics, coastal sediment transport processes and studies of sea level history as recorded in coastal sediments.   Particle size analysis will also aid studies in benthic ecology, environmental water quality and geoarchaeology.  The equipment will support faculty and student research and research training including two early career PIs.  CCU boasts the largest undergraduate Marine Science program on the east coast and has recently developed and interdisciplinary Masters graduate program in Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies.  The equipment will support student training in modern sedimentary analysis methods.\r\n\r\n***",

This award provided funds for a suite of instrumentation to improve the sedimentary analysis laboratory at Coastal Carolina University (CCU), which has enhanced research and teaching capabilities across the sciences.  The centerpiece of the facility is a laser diffraction particle size analyzer, used to provide high-resolution grain size of small samples quickly and efficiently.  This instrument is the workhorse of the sediment analysis laboratory, used by a number of researchers and students from various departments and is integrated into the Marine Science undergraduate and graduate curricula.  A stereomicroscope, with a camera attachment for classroom use, enables faculty to present hands-on lessons in sediment grain shape, texture and composition.  Several other components, including a purified water system, microbalance, benchtop centrifuge, laboratory oven, sample microsplitter and vortex mixer, aid in sample preparation and provide training for students in standard laboratory procedures.\n\nThe improved facilities provide an enhanced platform for integrated research and teaching capabilities across the sciences at CCU, and have been rapidly incorporated into a number of ongoing projects at the Burroughs &amp; Chapin Center for Marine and Wetland Studies and the Department of Marine Science, which have developed a research strength in geological, geophysical and hydrodynamic investigations of coastal regions.  Research projects that have benefitted from the instrumentation include investigations of beach morphology, coastal sediment distribution and transport, long-term coastal landscape evolution, recent sea level rise, the effectiveness of living shorelines (artificial oyster reefs) in beach stabilization, sediment impact on the development of hypoxia (low-oxygen \"dead zones\") in coastal environments, and the effects of geologic framework and land-use on groundwater discharge along the coastal zone.  Results of these projects will advance the understanding of coastal systems, help refine climatic and sea level change histories, and facilitate better regional coastal management.\n\nThis equipment has also benefitted a large number of undergraduate and graduate students at CCU.  With the largest undergraduate Marine Science program on the east coast, CCU strives to develop interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers and follows the teacher-scholar model, which integrates teaching and research to provide hands-on training in research-related laboratory and field-based investigations for many students each year. The newly developed, interdisciplinary Masters graduate program in Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies is continuing to grow, and the geosciences have been identified as a particular area of interest for recruiting students.  Core classes in the Marine Science curriculum using the requested equipment include Marine Geology and Sedimentary Geology, as well as upper-level undergraduate courses, including Long Term Climate and Landscape Change, as well as graduate courses such as Coastal, Marine and Wetland Studies.  These courses expose students to laboratory techniques in sediment analyses, provide opportunities for independent research projects and serve as a training mechanism for further student research opportunities.  The improvements provided by the awarded instrumentation ensure that the sediment analysis laboratory will continue to play an active role in research and teaching of the next generation of geoscientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jenna C Hill"
