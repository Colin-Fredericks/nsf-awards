 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a combined observational and modeling study of eddy formation, growth, and export in the northwest corner region of the North Atlantic Current. The work will test the theory that eddy formation, growth, and capping is controlled by large heat fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The transition between the narrow boundary current and the broad eastward flow, often known as the Northwest Corner (NWC), provides a natural laboratory to study eddy dynamics because the process of eddy production is geographically localized, and highly repetitive. There is good reason to suspect that this process of eddy production and submergence may be a common and natural consequence of rapid heat loss along meandering sub-polar fronts. Indirect evidence for this may be seen in the high population of eddies in the ocean. Since these are known to continue to rotate and last for several years, it begs the question whether at least some of them could have originated from outcropping frontal regions of which there are many throughout the sub-polar oceans.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The work has the potential to transform the understanding of the ocean dynamics which are relevant to ocean-atmosphere exchanges in the North Atlantic. Climate ocean models typically do not represent well the northwest corner eddy region. If it turns out to be important for air-sea heat fluxes, it will highlight the need to improve these models, and may provide the dynamical understanding necessary to do so. With the assistance of the Office of Marine Programs through their ARMADA Project, a teacher will participate on each of the expeditions to gain research experience. The teachers will communicate this experience to both students at their school during the expedition and afterwards, in addition to mentoring a junior teacher on this research topic. This project will also provide training for one graduate student and enhance an international collaboration with Canadian scientists at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography who have research interests in this region.",
