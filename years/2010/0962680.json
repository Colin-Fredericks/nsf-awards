 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this EAGER project, supported by the Chemcial Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program, Dr. Joel H. Parks of the Rowland Institute at Harvard University and his research group will investigate questions related to conformations of gas phase biomolecular ions: 1) How does the conformation and conformational fluctuations relate to the interactions and kinetics of molecular adsorption, and 2) Can fluorescence lifetime measurements identify differences in conformation between unsolvated biomolecular ions and ions supporting adsorbed molecules.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated in solution studies that vicinal water makes important contributions to the structure and energy of proteins; and that the coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. The hydration of biomolecules in gas phase offers the possibility to study conformational dynamics in the absence of bulk water background. The primary challenge of this research project is to apply fluorescence methods developed in our laboratory to probe the conformations of biomolecular ions in gas phase to similar measurements for hydrated ions. The research conducted in this project may provide a deeper understanding of the role of water in biomolecule dynamics and also lead to new applications and experimental tools.\r\n\r\nThe combination of different experimental and theoretical methods (high vacuum technology, nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence, electrospray technology, molecular dynamics simulations) and fundamental processes (ion-molecule interactions, conformational dynamics, radiative interactions) involved in this project will provide broad training for students and post-docs. The collaboration with senior colleagues and visits by their graduate students will allow them to contribute to a variety of research activities and technologies not available in a single laboratory. Additionally, Dr. Parks will actively recruit undergraduate students to participate in this program.",
