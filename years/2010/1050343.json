 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EAGER proposal is to develop Adaptive Regression Testing (ART) Strategies: strategies that can guide software test engineers in selecting appropriate regression testing techniques to use on new versions of their software systems as those systems evolve.  As an initial approach to creating ART strategies, the research will investigate Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods while implementing a prototype tool to support the process.  Controlled experiment to evaluate the use of their ART strategies will be conducted.  The work is advancing knowledge and understanding by providing new strategies for regression testing software systems over their lifetimes, empirical data about those strategies, and empirical approaches that can be used by other researchers to make further progress in this area.
