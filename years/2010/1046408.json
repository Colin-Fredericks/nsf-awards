 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predicting the consequences of rapid climate change for biodiversity loss and ecosystem function is an urgent scientific challenge. This project will experimentally quantify mechanisms of species and ecosystem sensitivity to warming and increased variation in precipitation, using small streams in the Colorado Rockies and the Ecuadoran Andes as study systems. Theory predicts tropical stream species (aquatic insects and frogs) will be more physiologically sensitive to warming or greater variability in stream discharge than temperate species, and sensitivity should increase for species living in high elevations (alpine zones) versus lowland streams (foothills). High elevation species are also hypothesized to be at greater risk to reduced dissolved oxygen, which will accompany stream warming. These predictions will be tested by experimental manipulation of flow in alpine streams and measurement of the physiological tolerance of species to warming and reduced oxygen. The project will also discover new species using advanced genetic techniques, and assess the ability of species to move between streams as climate changes. This study will provide a novel, integrative model for predicting species and stream ecosystem responses to climate shifts.\r\n\r\nThis work will advance fundamental knowledge of tropical stream diversity required to understand vulnerability of these systems to rapid climate change, providing important information for resource managers. The project will provide training for several undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. International collaborations will be strengthened through exchanges between international and US students, including students from underrepresented groups. This project combines both useful information for environmental policy and training of the next generation of the biodiversity workforce.",

We confirmed our overarching hypothesis that historically more stable thermal conditions of the tropics, where biodiversity is highest, has favored the evolution of narrow thermal tolerances, of reduced dispersal, and of smaller geographic ranges of species (<em>Climate Variability Hypothesis</em>: CVH). As a consequence, tropical species are likely to be more vulnerable than temperate species to a unit increase in temperature. This in turn will have consequences for responses of aquatic communities and associated ecosystem functions to changing environments.</p>\n<p>We have now completed the final year of this grant, and have achieved the four goals we set out for this project: (1) uncover cryptic species diversity in tropical and temperate streams, (2) characterize the physiological, dispersal, and ecological traits of those species, (3) characterize the ecosystem context and species/community responses to climate change, and (4) Test the CVH in temperate (Colorado) and tropical (Ecuador) regions. We found that cryptic diversity is highest in the tropics for the three insect orders we examined (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). In addition, we found that aquatic insects in the temperate streams have higher physiological breadth (a larger tolerance to broad temperature ranges) than species in the tropics (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) and that in Colorado high elevation insect populations are more vulnerable to warming than lower elevation populations, whereas in Ecuador low elevation populations are more vulnerable to warming than high elevation populations. For a subset of those species we sequenced a large part of their genomes, and found that species in temperate streams have higher dispersal across their elevational ranges compared to tropical streams, as evidenced by more genetic mixing among populations inhabiting different streams (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). We characterized the ecosystem context and species responses to changing temperatures and found that growth rates (a measure of fitness and ability to persist) of temperate mayfly species tend to vary directly with thermal conditions, growing more slowly under cooler temperatures compared to tropical species, which experience reduced growth when temperatures are altered (either increased or decreased) from their home environment (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). Finally, by integrating these different sources of data, we showed that the predictions of the CVH hold in this system, and that the historical context in which organisms evolve shapes their traits (specifically their physiology and dispersal) and has consequences for their rates of cryptic diversification and speciation over longer time periods (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>).</p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific results, our project also contributed to education and outreach, through direct training of undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs, as well as presentations at universities, national meetings, and reports to media about scientific findings. Our collections of insect specimens during the first year of this project resulted in the discovery of many new species, some of which we described and others that are under evaluation.
