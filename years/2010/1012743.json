 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Stanton of the University of Texas Austin is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop new computational and theoretical approaches based on coupled-cluster theory that are aimed at specific applications. The award is co-funded by a pilot program in OCI promoting the reuse of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) elements.  The Stanton group is developing methods to treat radicals and biradicals, developing (quasi)diabatic representations for interacting systems, improving the implementation of other high-accuracy coupled-cluster techniques and extending their ability to describe the spectra of strongly interacting systems to include molecules for which a low-order polynomial representation of the potential is inadequate. Applications include spectroscopically interesting problems such as the nitrate radical and high-resolution electronic and photoelectron spectra of radicals and transient intermediates. An additional application is a project aimed at determining molecular mechanisms of thermal degradation of prototype biomass molecules. Much of the application work is done in collaboration with leading experimental groups in the United States.\r\n \r\nThe theoretical method development performed by the Stanton group is ultimately included in the computational package cfour1 which is distributed free of charge.  The tools that the Stanton group  develops for analyzing molecular spectra are aimed at a broad group of researchers, particularly experimentalists who are not experts in computational chemistry. The research funded under this program is extending the usefulness of these codes to a wider group of scientists. Undergraduates are very involved in this research program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the 1920s, the subfield of physics known as quantum mechanics was brought to relative maturity.   At that time, one of the leaders in the development of the field, P.A.M. Dirac, wryly noted that \"all of chemistry\" was embedded in the equations of quantum mechanics.   That is, one could calculate the results of any chemical experiment or the properties of any atom or molecule.   \n\nWhile true, Dirac's observation conflicts with the complexity of the equations and now, nearly a century later, one can only perform calcualtions approximately.   Now, quantum calculations are generally used to guide, and aid in the interpretation of, experiments, but they are not yet a substitute for the experiments.    Nor, realistically, will that day every dawn.\n\nOur work deals with the very high-accuracy calculation of molecular properties and spectra (the process by which material objects interact with electromagnetic waves), focusing on both the development of ways of solving the equations that Dirac spoke of, as well as applying them to interesting systems.   Under the terms of this grant, we were able to begin work on implementing one of the most accurate methods for solving the central equation of quantum mechanics (the so-called Schroedinger equation) in a way that is suitable for modern supercomputers.    This work, which is currently being continued under a renewal grant, promises to allow investigators to make calculations of spectra and chemical reaction propensities with unprecedented accuracy.     \n\nIn addition to our work in methods development, NSF funding during the previous grant period allowed us to make a detailed investigation of the nitrate radical NO3.   While NO3 is important in the atmosphere, it is also a singularly difficult molecule to understand insofar as how it obeys the laws of quantum mechanics.   Central to chemistry is something known as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, a construct so deeply rooted in the minds of most chemists that its ``reality\" (the assumptions invoked by the model) are often thought to represent the true physical nature of molecules.   In NO3, this approximation breaks down quite vividly, and one must try to achieve understanding through alternative perspectives.    \n\nQuantum mechanics indeed provides the fundamental basis for the entirety of chemistry.    However, this statement is hollow in the sense that the equations are too complicated to solve exactly, and the truly complicated nature of atomic and molecular behavior is obscured behind the approximations that chemists make in dealing with the fundamental equations.    Work along both frontiers - towards better and better solutions to the equations (that is, making fewer and few approximations) and understanding the true nature of molecules - is a central part of theoretical chemistry, and this has been the focus of our efforts for the last two decades.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John F Stanton"
