It is centered around  an edited book;  a tribute to  Judea Pearl   that includes 30 articles in the three areas. The book is co-edited by Pearl's past students and colleagues: Rina Dechter, Hector Geffner and Joe Halpern who also organize  the workshop. \r\n\r\nDuring the workshop day  about about 20 scholars, whose work appear in the book, will present their work. The workshop is open to the public. In addition to about 30 visitors from around the world, it will be attended by faculty and students at UCLA, and in California, and by community members.\r\n\r\nThis event coincides with the 25th anniversary of the first paper by Judea in which he introduced \"Bayesian networks\" in 1985. In this context, a unique book exhibit will be on display, featuring rare first-editions of several milestones in the history of causal and probabilistic reasoning, from Huygens (1657) and Bernoulli (1713) to Bayes (1763) and Laplace (1812), from Hume (1739) and Mill (1843) to Boole (1847), Galton (1895) and Turing (1953).\r\n\r\nThe workshop facilitates disseminating the ideas developed in the past few decades in the three fields,  featuring leading scholars and  the edited book that include state of the art articles as well as historical perspectives of the three fields. The workshop presentations and book will draw additional researchers into the three fields.",
