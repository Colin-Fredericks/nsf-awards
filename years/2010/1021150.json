It is possible that a large amount of carbon dioxide does not diffuse directly into the atmosphere after it is released from respiration, but instead dissolves in xylem sap and is transported internally within trees, moving upward into the stem with the transpirational demand for water.  The investigators will test this hypothesis by using ecophysiological approaches to measure the quantity of carbon dioxide released by root respiration and estimate total below ground respiration over the course of a year in a stand of Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoides).  The researchers will then determine the quantity of below ground-derived carbon dioxide that diffuses from above ground tissues into the atmosphere and will measure the amount of the carbon dioxide that is re-fixed by photosynthesis in above ground tissues.  If a significant amount of carbon dioxide moves internally from the root system in the transpiration stream, the process will change our current understanding of tree and forest carbon cycles.  In addition, re-fixation of the transported carbon dioxide will provide evidence of a carbon recycling mechanism in trees.  The investigators will use this project as a platform to teach K-12 students about the carbon cycle and to train environmental educators.  The project will also involve undergraduate and graduate students in the experiments to improve their understanding of science, forest biology and the environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRespiration is the fundamental process by which living cells create useable energy to sustain all growth and maintenance processes.  This project focused on the respiration of tree roots.  A defined amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) is released in the process of respiration, and since CO2 can be easily measured in the laboratory or field, the quantity of CO2 diffusing from plant tissues into the air has been the standard way that respiration has been measured in plants over the past 60 years.  In this project, we examined the accuracy of that approach, by determining how much of the CO2 released from root cells does not diffuse out into the atmosphere, but instead, is absorbed in the xylem sap (mostly water that moves from the roots through the shoot and leaves).  We discovered that over the course of the growing season, 35% of the CO2 released from root respiration moved into the xylem and was transported into the shoot and leaves.  At times, this amount was greater than 50% of the total CO2 released from respiring roots.  This was first significant outcome from this project: the discovery that a large quantity of root-respired CO2 remains within the tree, and therefore root respiration has been greatly underestimated in trees.  This is important for our fundamental understanding of how plants function, but additionally, it is important for understanding the CO2 flux from forests to the atmosphere.  The second significant outcome was that we identified the fate of the xylem-transported CO2.  We discovered that part of the CO2 is fixed into carbohydrates by photosynthetic cells in stems, branches and leaves.  In other words, the CO2 is recycled within the trees.  This is an efficient process that allows plants to reuse CO2 that they have captured from the atmosphere.  However, the remainder of the CO2 diffuses out of the stem and branches of trees.  This means that most of the measurements of respiration made aboveground on stem and branch tissues have been overestimated because of the addition of the root-derived CO2 to the locally-produced CO2 from respiring cells aboveground. These results have expanded our knowledge of the basic biology of trees, and will help contribute to better models of plant growth and a better understanding of the forest carbon cycle.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert O Teskey"
