 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California, San Diego (UCSD), are analyzing seismograms from the USArray project (part of NSF's Earthscope program) from earthquakes and explosions recorded at regional distances (200 to 2000 km).  These data provide new constraints on crust and upper-mantle structure in the western United States.  In particular, researchers are studying the upper-mantle seismic phases Pn and Sn and the crustal phases Pg and Lg.  The project involves performing Pn tomography using USArray phase picks, producing maps of crustal thickness and both isotropic and anisotropic variations in uppermost mantle P velocity that agree with previous results in their large-scale features but show more detail in many regions.   Preliminary results suggest that Sn data in USArray are of comparable quality, enabling joint Pn/Sn inversions to constrain uppermost mantle structure and anisotropy.  In many cases, crustal phases such as Lg can be observed to long distances in the USArray dataset, making possible a comprehensive analysis of Pg and Lg times and amplitudes to resolve lower crustal velocities and attenuation.  These results complement shear-wave splitting and surface- and body-wave tomography studies by providing superior resolution for structures at lower crustal and uppermost mantle depths.  This research will lead to improved models of crust and upper-mantle structure in the western United States, which will be of interest to the geology, tectonics, and geodynamics communities. The project supports the educational program at SIO and UCSD by providing funds for a graduate student. Results will be widely disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and material provided to SIO's education and outreach programs.",
