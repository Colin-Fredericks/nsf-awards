 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an abundance of challenging problems in physics and engineering, such \r\nas fluid flow in industrial foams and vuggy reservoirs, which are \r\ncharacterized by high porosity and complex material structure. Traditionally, \r\nthese flows are modeled by Darcy's law relating the macroscopic pressure \r\ngradient to the macroscopic fluid velocity. For highly permeable media a more \r\nsuitable model is given by Brinkman's equations, considered in this project. \r\nThe internal structure  involves multiple spatial scales and permeabilities \r\nvarying over many orders of magnitude (high contrast). Thus, the development \r\nof numerical methods for Brinkman's equations that are robust with respect to \r\nthe contrast and accurately capture the fine scales is a difficult theoretical \r\nproblem with important applications to engineering and geosciences. There are \r\nnumerous methods for efficiently computing multi-scale porous media flows \r\ngoverned by Darcy's law. These include in particular multi-scale finite \r\nelement methods, subgrid approximation, multi-grid, and domain decomposition \r\nmethods. Developing an efficient multi-scale approximation for Brinkman is a \r\nchallenging task, which cannot be addressed using methods available in the \r\nDarcy case. The first objective of this project is a development and study of \r\nnumerical subgrid method for Brinkman's system. The second goal is to \r\nrepresent accurately the fine features of the solution, which cannot be \r\ncaptured by the numerical subgrid approach alone. An extension of the \r\nalgorithm by alternating Schwarz iterations in order to resolve these features \r\nwill be developed, theoretically justified and practically tested. The third \r\nmain objective is to utilize a multi-scale finite element space and an \r\nenrichment of the coarse space by adding basis functions resulting from the \r\napproximate solution of certain small local generalized eigenvalue problems. \r\nThis will allow to devise an iterative method that converges independently of \r\nthe contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhenomena in engineering such as heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, and \r\nmaterials, are routinely modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). The \r\nsolutions of the PDEs are subsequently used to design and develop new \r\nmaterials or new technologies with wide range of applications. These \r\napplications require complex models with multiple space scales, which in turn \r\nmake the solution task challenging and computationally very intensive. The \r\nproposed  work is motivated by the needs for design and manufacturing of new \r\nmaterials and/or more accurate description of oil reservoirs or aquifers. \r\nHowever, developing efficient and robust solution techniques for computing \r\nflows in media with complex internal structures will significantly broaden the \r\nareas of application for which the numerical simulation is feasible. Since \r\nnumerical simulations are key to better understand, control, and optimize the \r\nmodeled processes the proposed research will eventually benefit other areas in \r\nscience and engineering.",
