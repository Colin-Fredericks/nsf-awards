(NSF 0948029)\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nClimate change is one of the most pressing issues facing Alaska today. This new GK-12 program will partner University of Alaska Fairbanks graduate students with teachers in three Alaska school districts to advance understanding of scientific concepts related to climate change and its impacts. A central component of the program will be a two?week, intensive summer workshop in which graduate fellows and K-12 teachers will partner with museum professionals to develop themes and teaching activities directly related to graduate student research. Graduate fellows will develop hands-on activities, podcasts, and ?kits? that will be permanently available through a check-out system and website housed at the University of Alaska Museum of the North. CASE graduate fellows will also receive training in pedagogy, science communication, and cultural relevancy. The Intellectual Merit of the project derives from current research in science education that suggests that students learn best with 1) inquiry-based, real-world experiences, and 2) culturally relevant lessons and concepts.\r\n\r\nBroader significance\r\nProject participants will benefit in myriad ways. K-12 students will become excited about STEM subjects through participation in inquiry- and research-based investigations. Graduate fellows will gain teaching and communication skills that will help them throughout their careers. K-12 teachers will benefit from increased content knowledge and professional development opportunities. UAF and its faculty will benefit from enhanced K-12 outreach capacity and an increased pipeline of underserved students into STEM careers.  \r\n\r\n",
