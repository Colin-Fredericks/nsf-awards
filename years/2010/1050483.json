 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a doctoral symposium at the 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2010) to be held in Barcelona, Spain, September 26-30, 2010. RecSys is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice on recommender systems. The doctoral symposium will help students refine their dissertation projects so that they can make stronger contributions to the solution of critical intellectual challenges in recommender systems. \r\n\r\nNearly all of the leading E-Commerce sites world-wide use recommender systems, to help their customers find the products and services they will most value from the millions of alternatives available.  Creating effective recommender systems is a difficult challenge.  The proposed doctoral symposium will help in training a generation of scientists who will become leaders in developing this important field of research, and in applying the research results in practical applications. One particular strength of the RecSys conference, from its inception to the present day, is the rich participation of industry leaders in the conference.  Through a poster session, the broader community, including the substantial contingent of industry participants in the conference, will also gain exposure to this new cohort of students. By helping doctoral students to appreciate each other's different perspectives and form a cohort across those boundaries, we can help to preserve the diversity of the field in the coming years.",
