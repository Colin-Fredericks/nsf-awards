 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a core-shell nanoparticle architecture with metal nanoparticles as the high capacitance core, and polymers as the shell.  The nanoparticles will be entrained in a broad spectrum of host polymers via a novel approach to produce high dielectric-constant films with minimum dielectric loss.  To scale up this process without losing the unique and valuable properties of core-shell nanoparticles, a wet chemistry route with laser for selective polymerization will be utilized to coat each metal nanoparticle with a polymeric shell.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide high-dielectric constant nanoparticles for the development of nanocomposite to meet future energy storage needs of supercapacitors.  Currently, commercially available supercapacitors either have too low power or energy density or are too expensive to manufacture.  This project is expected to enable the fabrication of ultra high energy storage capacitors by providing high energy and power density in a cost-effective manner.",

We have achieved the enhancement of the effective dielectric constant of the nanodielectrics by a factor of about 6 (k&gt; 40) using Ag nanoparticles dispersed in PVP, representing a good match with the k value of 58, as predicted by percolation theory.  An optimized method was designed to increase the k value and also to strengthen the cross link between the nanocomposite solution and the Si wafer. \n\nThe LCR characteristics were measured for a range of frequencies from 20 Hz to 10 MHz and exhibited less than 20% degradation over that range.  The measured breakdown voltage was &gt;156 V/&micro;m.  After a new procedure was implemented to increase the FOL of nanoparticles in the polymer, by using very lower concentration of nanoparticles the FOL in a polymer matrix was increased up to about 0.08 %, without agglomeration of nanoparticles.  Devices fabricated with the new FOL were tested and exhibited k value close to 70. We fabricated and characterized packaged capacitor prototype devices.\n\nIn order to promote collaborations with potential commercial vendors, working nanocapacitor prototype devices have been fabricated and tested.
