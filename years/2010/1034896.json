 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award was made to Kean University to provide research training for 10 weeks for 6 students, for the summer of 2010. The  6 students will work with 3 faculty conducting research, analyzing data, and writing research publications involving assessment and comparison of  the structure, diversity, and biomass of vegetation, arthropod, and soil microbial communities, and the composition of soil C and N components within intact and managed forests of Costa Rica and the northeastern United States. Through this project students and faculty will: 1) identify potential indicators of habitat condition; 2) determine if nutrient differences in soil can be correlated with, or determined as, drivers of differences in the biota of the different trophic levels; and 3) determine if similar patterns of ecological significance by habitat type or management strategy can be seen within and/or between areas studied in the eastern US and Costa Rica. The students, including those from underrepresented groups, will be recruited from the Kean University Biology Program and DOE Ronald McNair program and from other universities, and from the general student population at Kean University. Students will receive training in Ethics in Research, using the Resources for Research Ethics Education website (http://research-ethics.net/topics/) as the primary resource. Both the SURE (http://web.grinnell.edu/sureiii/) and (http://www.colorado.edu/eer/research/  undergradtools.html) instruments will be used to determine how students' perceptions of science of their own abilities have changed; whether the program influences how well they see themselves as scientists; what their primary accomplishments have been; and their development of a global perspective on the ecological/environmental sciences. For more information, contact Dr. Bill Eaton, School of Environmental and Life Sciences, Kean University, 1000 Morris Ave, Union, NJ  07083; 908-737-3653; weaton@kean.edu; http://www.kean.edu/~sels/resources/REU2010.pdf.",

The mentors and their undergraduate research students were successful in this approach. Through this NSF REU grant, the mentors and their students were able to demonstrate that differences in soil DNA-based microbial community characteristics, biomass, microbial activity, and carbon and nitrogen nutrient composition and dynamics can be used as indicators of environmental change, specifically to show how land management,and &nbsp;restoration strategies may be affecting the soil ecosystems&nbsp;in the&nbsp;lowland forests of Costa Rica. They were able to show that the tree species, <em>Pentaclethra macroloba</em>, important for its ability to move nitrogen into the soil (i.e., nitrogen-fixing) in these tropical forest, affects the structure of the soil microbial community, the tree and understory plant community; and also that as cleared regions of former primary forest regenerate, <em>P. macroloba </em>is the dominant nitrogen-fixing tree, and a critical driver of C, N, and P recuperation and soil ecosystem recovery. Once these tropical forests reach a certain point in forest succession, <em>P. macroloba </em>plays less of a role in these nutrient cycle activities, and an increasing leguminous and total vegetative diversity, complexity and biomass appear to become increasingly influential.
