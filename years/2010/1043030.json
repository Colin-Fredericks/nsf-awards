 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Foraminifera series is a quadrennial gathering of foraminiferal micropaleontologists and biologists from a variety of disciplines. It is supported by international foraminiferal groups, and is open to all who are interested in foraminifera and related topics.  The meeting is September 5 to 10, 2010, at the University of Bonn, Germany.  One aim of FORAMS 2010 is to allow specialists who would not otherwise normally be in contact to meet and exchange ideas. For example, foram micropaleontologists and geneticists commonly have different professional societies that meet at different times, yet some members of these two groups share common interests, for example in systematics.  The meeting has its own website which has been operational for over a year at http://www.forams2010.uni-bonn.de/. The Organizing Committee believes that the continued interest of students is critical to the health of the field. This proposal requests support for the attendance of US students at the meeting. These funds may be used for registration and travel, including housing.  Grantees would be selected on the basis of merit, and appropriate attention will be paid to the need to support minority groups and women. Selection would be made by a Selection Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Cushman Foundation for Foraminiferal Research, Inc.",
