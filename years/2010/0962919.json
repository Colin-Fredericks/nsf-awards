 "awd_abstract_narration": "MOBILIZE:  Mobilizing for Innovative Computer Science Teaching and Learning is a Targeted Math and Science Partnership between the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) as the lead and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as the Core Partner school district.  The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. are Supporting Partners.  The Partnership promotes computational thinking, with an overarching goal of fostering inventiveness and innovation among students and teachers through increasing the computer science instructional capacity of high schools, especially in a large urban school district.  This project brings together the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), an NSF Science and Technology Center (STC) in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Center X in the Graduate School of Education & Information Studies at UCLA.  MOBILIZE deploys challenging and engaging hands-on computer science projects and curricula using new participatory sensing technologies in high school mathematics and science courses.   MOBILIZE prepares a large number of high school teachers to use inquiry teaching methods with the intent that technologies that are ubiquitous with students today, such as mobile phones, peak the interests of students and motivate them in ways that ultimately increases both students' achievement and their identities as \"doers\" of science, while enhancing the computer science knowledge and pedagogical acumen of teachers.   \r\n\r\nMOBILIZE:\r\n--creates exciting, challenging, multi-disciplinary, real-life based, cutting-edge, hands-on inquiry projects, tools, and materials for teaching computer science concepts in high school  computer science AND in standards-based mathematics and science classes.  Piloting occurs locally with dissemination nationally, with the long term goal of increasing student engagement and achievement in computer science, mathematics, and the other sciences.  High school teachers work with STEM and education faculty to develop new computer science materials that build on the CENS Participatory Sensing systems, which involve students in observing and analyzing environmental and social processes where they live, work, and play;\r\n--develops an innovative model of professional development for current and future high school teachers around the implementation of these projects, to include multi-disciplinary teams of teachers organized into learning communities with STEM and Education faculty, coaching, and a new pre-service computer science methods course, in order to create a cadre of teachers with expertise in both computer science content and pedagogy; and\r\n--informs state and national policy changes (including changing the academic status of computer science from vocational to academic and establishing a computer science teaching credential) necessary to improve the quality of high school computer science instruction.\r\n\r\nThe research hypotheses explored focus on:  students as computer scientists, whether in mathematics, science or computer science courses;  teachers as computer scientists, whether teaching mathematics, science or computer science; and impact on pre-service teachers in terms of their likelihood to utilize inquiry-based instructional strategies during their early years of teaching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMobilize has made a durable impact on STEM education in secondary schools by creating, implementing, and developing the Introduction to Data Science (IDS) course.  IDS, created in partnership with UCLA Dept. of Statistics, UCLA Center X, and the Los Angeles Unified School District, is a year-long course that teaches students to use coding in the R environment to extract meaning and insight from data.  IDS is student-driven, and students use mobile devices to collect and share data about their lives and environment.  IDS teaches students to be constructive and critical of the role data play in their lives, culture, and government.  In the California public university system, IDS, a statistics course, \"validates\" a 3rd-year mathematics requirement, providing students with an alternative pathway to university admission. \n\nIDS is currently implemented in 14 school districts and 42 schools as of 2018-2019: Alhambra, Birmingham Charter, Centinela Valley, Chaffey, Culver City, Downey, El Rancho, Fallbrook, Hacienda-La Puente, Los Angeles Unified, Long Beach, Norwalk-La Mirada, Santa Ana, Santa Monica-Malibu.\n\nA key ingredient to the success of IDS has been strong teacher support, provided both by a series of professional development workshops as well as the establishment of a teaching community via the Mobilize wiki and an IDS Google Group where IDS teachers share best practices and materials, support each other, and ask questions. The professional development workshops focus on three key components: (a) developing strategies for active learning to foster core understandings in data science (b) building expertise in the statistical programming language R (using the Rstudio interface) and (c) developing deep understanding of statistical concepts.  Teachers meet for a 3-day summer session, a 2-day summer sessions, and then periodically for all-day workshops throughout the academic year. Workshops are led by teacher-leaders recruited from experienced IDS teachers.  Professional development is administered through UCLA Center X, and interested districts are invited to visit www.idsucla.org  to learn more.\n\nFor a full list of dissertations, publications, evaluation findings, and conference presentations, resulting from the Mobilize visit please visit wwwidsucla.org.\n\nAt its conception, Mobilize's goal was to implement participatory sensing ?? a data-collection paradigm in which groups of people use their mobile devices to establish communities around a central empirically-driven campaign ? in Math and Science classes in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  An initial finding was that a meaningful implementation of participatory sensing required deeper understanding of core statistical concepts (for example, interpreting distributions) than students were prepared for, and also required substantial time for learning to use the technology and for collecting sufficiently large data sets.  This led to the creation of IDS, which provided the time for a more complete implementation of participatory sensing by giving students the mathematical, statistical, and computational tools to analyze data.\n\nThe modeling process is at the heart of the IDS curriculum.  Students learn to navigate the \"Data Cycle\":  Ask Questions, Consider Data, Analyze Data, Interpret Analysis (and repeat as needed).  The Data Cycle is based upon the four steps of the statistical investigative cycle and described by the American Statisticial Association's Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education and is similar in many ways to the mathematical modeling cycle in presented in the Common Core Mathematics Guidelines.  The Data Cycle provides a means for students to integrate the computational and statistical skills they acquire into a meaningful whole.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane Margolis"
