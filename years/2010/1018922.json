 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tackles the development of new tools for the semantic \r\nanalysis of temporal signals, in particular (but not restricted to) \r\nvideo sequences. While most of the emphasis in video analysis so far has \r\nbeen at the low-level, the investigators plan to explore the use of \r\nCausal Analysis to perform inference and decisions to analyze video \r\nsignals. The challenge in this project is to bridge the gap between \r\nbasic descriptor at the signal level and Causal Calculus, that acts on \r\nsemantically meaningful representations. In particular, long-range \r\nprediction, not just short-range continuous extrapolation, requires the \r\ndevelopment of new tools that allow \"interventions\" into the model. How \r\nwould the state \"X\" evolve if event \"Y\" were to occur? To attain the \r\ngoals set forth in the proposal, the investigators must tackle \r\nfundamental problems in the analysis of time series, both at the \r\nlow/mid-level (defining a proper notion of ``distance'' between time \r\nseries that respects their intrinsic dynamics), at the mid-level \r\n(defining clustering schemes for action segments), and at the high-level \r\n(develop action semantics in an abductive framework). \r\n\r\nDuring this pilot one-year project, the investigators plan to explore the \r\nfeasibility of using causal analysis for performing long-range temporal \r\nprediction of events and actions from visual data. Sample applications \r\nthat are impacted in case of success are broad ranging from \r\nsurveillance to environmental monitoring to driver assistance in \r\ntransportation, with significant societal impact in reducing traffic \r\naccidents.",
