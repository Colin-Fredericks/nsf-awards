 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent molecular studies in plants have uncovered the surprising and intimate interconnections between immune signaling, hormonal actions and development.  For instance, analyses of plant genomes have revealed well over a thousand genes that appear to encode receptors - proteins whose function is surveillance of the intra and extracellular environment via binding to other molecules. Preliminary studies suggest that many of these putative receptors may be common to immune responses, hormonal signaling and development in plants.  However, most of the candidate receptors are currently \"orphan receptors\" whose biological functions remain unknown.  \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to reveal these functions and to explore the overlap between what have been disparate fields of plant biology, the 2010 Keystone Symposia meeting on Receptors and Signaling in Plant Development and Biotic Interactions will gather scientists working on plant development, hormonal signaling and immune responses in order to stimulate novel interactions among these research communities.  The major goal of this meeting is to advance understanding of plant receptor signaling and the molecular regulatory networks that are just downstream of the receptors themselves. This meeting is unique because scientists working on biotic interactions and plant development have never had such an opportunity for cross-talk.  This meeting will enhance infrastructure by fostering networking and initiation of collaborations.  The investigators anticipate the following educational benefits: acquaint trainees and investigators new to field with the state-of-the-art; critical scientific feedback; and career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists presenting cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nKeystone Symposia\u00c6s meeting on \"Receptors and Signaling in Plant Development and Biotic Interactions\" aimed to gather researchers from the fields of plant development, hormonal signaling and biotic interactions in order to stimulate novel interactions among these research communities.  The major goal of the meeting was to advance understanding in receptor signaling and immediate downstream regulatory networks.  Analyses of plant genomes have revealed an immense number of genes encoding putative receptors, e.g., in Arabidopsis, about 600 receptor-like kinases and 700 F-Box proteins.  Although it has been firmly established for a few of them that they function in the perception and transduction of endogenous or exogenous signals, most of them are currently \"orphan receptors\" in quest of ligands and functions.  In this meeting, leading scientists came together to present exciting new insights into the structure and function of known and novel plant receptors; to attempt to unravel the ligands and functions of the plant \"orphan receptors\"; and to reveal downstream signaling networks interconnecting immune responses, hormonal actions and developmental processes.  The program was structured according to biological processes, and included presentations by both leading and newer investigators involved in frontier research in each field: Growth Regulation; Development; Innate Immunity:  PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI); Receptors and Signaling in the Meristem; Differentiation and Patterning; Symbiosis; Innate Immunity II:  Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI); and Reproduction.  The specific objectives of this meeting were as follows:\n\nTo explore plant receptor and signaling in a context that crosses traditional boundaries in the plant sciences;\nTo stimulate discussions and collaborations among scientists from diverse fields;\nTo probe plant systems with a broader perspective; \nTo bring integrated approaches and new technologies to bear on advancing our understanding of receptor signaling and immediate downstream regulatory networks; and\nTo nurture and encourage the next generation of junior scientists.\n\n\n \n\nThere were 193 total attendees at the meeting.  Attendees were diverse with regard to gender, background, stage of career, and institutional affiliation.  More specifically, 44% of the meeting participants were female researchers.  While none of the participants self-identified as scientists belonging to US underrepresented minority groups, the meeting was highly international, drawing 64% non-US attendees.  Approximately 47% of attendees were students and postdoctoral fellows.  The meeting provided ample opportunity for training and professional development.  Plenary sessions included short talks drawn from submitted abstracts and many, if not most, of the presenters were students, postdoctoral trainees and newer investigators.  Two workshops on \"Discoveries in Plant Development\" and \"Frontiers in Biotic Interactions\" also consisted of short talks, providing additional opportunities for more junior participants to make presentations. Trainees and newer investigators were exposed to dozens of high-quality oral presentations by more senior investigators, who served as models for high-quality research and communication skills. In addition, two poster sessions provided venues for trainees and newer investigators to share their research and to discuss this research with more experienced investigators.  Finally, the unstructured portions of the meetings and the retreat-like venue provided significant and generous opportunities for productive informal interactions between trainees, newer investigators and more senior investigators. \n\n \n\nWe assessed outcomes with regard to attendee perceptions of the quality and impact of this meeting through post-conference surveys sent via email.  We received responses from 66 (34%) attendees.  The survey results demonstrated that attendees felt that the meeting was of high quality and value.  For example, 92..."
