From an economic development perspective, biotechnology is a desirable industry because biotechnology firms have the potential to generate high-paying, high-skill jobs. However, as a knowledge-based industry, biotechnology is largely dependent on the availability of specially trained professionals, particularly research scientists, engineers and technicians. Thus, this proposal seeks to cultivate the next generation of highly trained US graduate students who meet the growing needs of biotechnology employers and are prepared for careers in an area of significant employment growth. To accomplish this goal, a new master?s degree in Medical and Industrial Biotechnology will be created at Cornell University. This program has been specifically designed to introduce graduate trainees to the broad, interdisciplinary nature of the biotechnology industry by integrating a curriculum of modern biology, bioengineering and business courses with in-depth, hands-on biotechnology research training. This program will actively and aggressively broaden participation in science and engineering by working seamlessly with Cornell?s Diversity Programs in Engineering. With assistance from a 15-member industrial advisory board and over 40 faculty from 19 academic departments at Cornell, every effort will be made to recruit the most talented US citizens from diverse disciplines ranging from engineering to the physical and life sciences.",
