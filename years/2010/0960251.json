 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although oceanic lithosphere covers more than 60% of the earth's surface, models for its formation at mid-ocean ridges have been hampered by a lack of geochronological constraints on intrusive rocks that underlie volcanic rocks erupted on the seafloor. Recent advances in the U-Pb dating of zircons, refractory minerals that are found in gabbors and other intrusive rocks in ocean crust, now allow dates of intrusions to be measured.  This research pursues this objective using a combined secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) approach.  Samples of intrusive gabbros from Hole 735B on the Southwest Indian Ridge from the Ocean Drilling Program will be analyzed.  SIMS, which is a high resolution but large uncertainty technique that can measure geochemical differences on a micron scale, will be used to determine the trace element composition of zoning in zircons.  High precision isotope dilution TIMS dating of the zircons will be used to determine the magmatic evolution of the samples.  Uncertainties in the ages measured are expected to be 12,000 years or less.  This precision will provide unprecedented insight into how long it takes for ocean crust to grow at slow spreading ridges.  Broader impacts of the work include postdoctoral training and mentoring.  It also fosters inter-institutional collaboration and will support two PIs, one of whom is from a gender under-represented in the sciences, from an EPSCoR state. Outreach to high schools in the Cambridge MA area will be carried out and educational materials for them will be created on geochronology. Results of the project will be archived in NSF-funded publicly accessible databases.",
