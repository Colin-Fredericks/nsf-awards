Through this organization, students master competencies essential to biomanufacturing by preparing products that are needed by the community college biotechnology program, and neighboring high school biology and biotechnology programs. Both high school biotechnology and community college students, and students in the community college's School of Business work within this organization. Mixing students from the Biomanufacturing programs with students from the School of Business allow each set to learn from the other, thereby deepening the learning of all involved.",
