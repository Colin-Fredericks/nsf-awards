 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morehouse College's project  - Morehouse Wide Initiative for Sustainable Energy (M-WISE) - is based on institutional vision and student interest. The STEM based M-WISE program will utilize the strengths and resources of the entire institution to create a far reaching, transformative, interdisciplinary curriculum and research infrastructure for students to become leaders in the global arena of sustainable energy. The goals of M-WISE are to develop and institutionalize: 1) an energy curriculum that is interdisciplinary, transformative, STEM based and institution wide; and 2) an Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) that is linked to the energy curriculum.\r\nThe energy curriculum will be comprehensive and promote international studies and leadership skills. A goal of ISE is to initiate new interdisciplinary energy research projects, as well as foster student development through research, seminars, energy club and pre-freshman programs; and faculty development through research collaborations and workshops. This project will improve the quality of education, develop leadership skills and create global competency for African-American male students while exposing them to concepts in energy utilization, sustainability and materials development.  M-WISE will transform the approach of STEM education at Morehouse by creating a unique interdisciplinary research and community outreach infrastructure that is linked to a curriculum that will bring STEM and non-STEM students together to take STEM courses leading to a minor in energy.\r\nThe process for creating an energy related interdisciplinary learning culture among African-American male STEM students will be assessed, evaluated and published. The efforts of this project will result in a model for energy education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and liberal arts colleges that will track students into STEM and energy-related careers.",

This grant titled Morehouse-Wide Initiative for Sustainable Energy (M-WISE) developed, adopted, and evaluated an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary sustainability education, at a small liberal arts, Historically Black College and University (HBCU).

The focus group interviews of faculty indicated substantial faculty interest and approval of implementing sustainability education at the institution. Upon the completion of implementation of sustainability topics in courses a minor in Sustainability was developed at Morehouse College. \n\nCurrently within the United States only 7% of African Americans work in the renewable energy sector.  Results from this study provide potential insight and future promise as it relates to increasing the presence of African Americans in future careers in energy, green jobs or energy policy/economics, as well as the national failure to nurture scientific talent within the underrepresented minority population. \n\nAnother important outcome of M-WISE suggests a methodology that supports how to infuse a measured level of sustainability (25%) in courses at a small, liberal arts, HBCU without having to increase infrastructure (e.g., new faculty, new courses) which is often problematic at small institutions.  This study has been submitted for publication.\n\nIn addition to the M-WISE grant and supplements supporting the infusion of a sustainability curriculum into courses, this grant also supported a pre-freshmen bridge summer program, development of faculty research in sustainability and strengthened research capacity, as well as student organizations and a makerspace.\n\nA six-week, pre-freshman summer bridge program for students interested in majoring in STEM was developed to expose students to sustainable energy, sustainability and environmental impact early in the students' college career. In addition to mathematics course work and scientific literacy, students participated in guided inquiry research projects in sustainability and visited energy and sustainable facilities such as Georgia Power and SouthFace. Following participation in the pre-freshmen bridge summer program, 63.1% of students self-reported a positive relationship between the sustainability curriculum and changes in their personal behavior and plans, with respect to graduate study, careers in sustainability, and their personal ecological footprint. This work has been accepted for publication.\n\nA supplement to the M-WISE grant strengthened research capacity by: 1) conducting specific faculty development programing to increase the quality and number of research proposals submitted and funded; 2) providing publication costs; and 3) providing summer salary for faculty researchers engaged in sustainability research to facilitate them in becoming more productive researchers.  The M-WISE grant supported faculty research startups and continuation in topics relevant to sustainability. Research projects were supported in biofuels, cultural footprints, solar panel use, hydroponics development and economics.  A total of six manuscripts and one book was published from this research.\n\nA student organization titled Students Organizing for Sustainability (SOS) has been created and actively promotes sustainability.  In addition to numerous educational programs, in 2018 SOS won second place in the Ted Turner Green Drive competition designed to solve problems in sustainability in the city of Atlanta.  The Morehouse Makerspace Exploration Center (morehousemakerspace.org) was also developed from M-WISE supplemental funding.  Dozens of student projects related to sustainability have been developed including electric bicycles and shoes designed to charge cell phones.  Students from the Exploration Center have presented in five different conferences and in 2018 a team of freshmen won second place in the Emerging National Researchers makerspace competition by developing a Riverside Water Purification System prototype.\n\nAs a result of the M-WISE program, Morehouse College has become part of a network of collaborating institutions in Atlanta, Georgia that promote sustainable efforts.  The United Nations University recognized this cohort of institutions as a Reginal Centre of Expertise in sustainability and has ranked this center as number six in the world.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lycurgus L Muldrow"
