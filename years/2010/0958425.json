 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor James MacKay and colleague Jeffrey A. Rood from the Department of Chemistry at Elizabethtown College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to support a number of research projects at this primarily undergraduate institution. Faculty and students from nearby colleges (Lebanon Valley College and Franklin and Marshall College) will also use this instrument to support their research. The instrument will be used to support a large number of research activities, including: 1) the development of new synthetic routes to beta-lactams and allenolates; 2) the investigation of Group1/Group2 organometallic compounds and catalysts ; 3) the synthesis of metal phosphinate/phosphonate framework materials; 4) the synthesis and characterization of Group 14 organometallic compounds; 5) the development of luminescence-based sensors; and 6) the investigation of reactions of chiral, non-racemic trifluoromethyl-containing compounds.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research for a diverse group of young scientists.",
