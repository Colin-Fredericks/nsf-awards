 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to a recent report from the National Academies, the underrepresentation of women is largely due to institutional barriers and unintentional but wide-spread biases. At Northern Illinois University (NIU), faculty demographics in STEM disciplines show many of the same characteristics as the national statistics: relatively low recruitment rates for women and high attrition rates. To that end, this IT Catalyst project will explore mechanisms for creating high-level mentorship opportunities and peer support programs, addressing two key concerns of STEM faculty: (1) achieving a balance among teaching, research, service, and personal responsibilities in midcareer, and (2) developing a sense of agency within the workplace\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research literature on barriers which restrict women?s entry into and advancement in STEM discipline forms the theoretical basis for this project. The goal of this proposal is to collect the data that will identify issues and barriers. Those data will then be used, in the longer term, to discern which interventions and programs will be effective in retaining female faculty in STEM fields within the institutional context. For the past several decades, research has been directed toward enhancing women?s and other minority groups? participation in STEM discipline academic careers at all levels. While the ?pipeline problem? has been cited as a major issue, a recent report from the National Academies argues that the pipeline is not among the contributing factors to women?s slower advancement in STEM disciplines. Instead, it is the culture, not the numbers of available women, which drives inequities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The broader impacts of this project are multi-fold.  They include impacts at the institutional level and beyond.  It is expected that the data, interventions, models, and tools can make a substantial contribution to the wider literature and serve as models for others to follow.  Additionally, it is expected that project outcomes will benefit all university faculty, including members of other groups underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.  Project findings will be communicated through the project web site, publications, and presentations at conferences, thus impacting the ADVANCE community, at large.",
