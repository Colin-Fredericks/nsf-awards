 "awd_abstract_narration": "In our daily lives, the artwork we experience is increasingly the output of an algorithm executed within a computer; such algorithms are known as procedural generators. From the humble screensaver on the Macintosh with its swishes and whirls, to large simulated crowds in movies, our experience is enhanced by the power of procedurally generated content. \r\nAt the same time, specialized computer applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Final Cut Pro have made it much easier for human designers to manually create top-quality content, thereby unleashing the creative potential of millions. Though the cost of tools has come down, the cost of content creation remains high, limiting the volume of content each person can create. The goal of this project is to combine the speed of procedural generators with the expressive potential of manual content generation tools. We seek to create tools where the human designer and a procedural generator work together in a collaborative way, each building on the work of the other. We call such human/computer creative systems ?mixed-initiative,? since at any point, either the human or the computer can take the next step in contributing to the final creative content. With such mixed-initiative content creation systems, the potential exists for a rapid amplification of human creative potential, with the result being increased vibrancy and intricacy across a wide range of creative works.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore the design space of mixed-initiative content creation systems by constructing and evaluating one such system, called Springboard. Our target area for content creation is levels for computer games, specifically the genre of 2D platformers (such as Super Mario World). Computer games are a representative domain for creative content authoring, since they involve visual arts, spatial layout of game elements, animation, and game mechanics (movement, rewards, win conditions, etc.). Level design hence involves elements found in many existing content creation tools. Building and evaluating Springboard will yield an enhanced understanding of the technical architecture required to create such systems and the kinds of knowledge representations needed to permit flexible interaction of human and computer created content. Also to be explored is the value of creation, storage, and access to variants of the final creative product, thereby supporting rapid exploration of alternate designs. Studies of human designers using the system will provide insights into how mixed-initiative tools influence the human creative process. We anticipate procedurally generated levels will help designers generate more varied ideas during brainstorming activities, will permit designers to explore more design alternatives, and in general lead designers to create longer and more complex final level designs than when using traditional, manual-effort level design tools.",

They would like to be able to design a wide range of objects, perhaps in order to personalize or customize them for a particular situation. Most objects are complex, and their design requires significant skill and background knowledge. The goal of this project is to create computer tools that enhance our innate design abilities so that we are able to design complex objects more quickly and with a lower degree of skill and knowledge than an expert designer. Our approach is to create tools where a human designer and an automated computer designer take turns contributing to the object being designed. We call these &ldquo;mixed initiative&rdquo; design tools, since the human designer first takes initiative to contribute to the object, then the computer takes the initiative to add to this design, and so on. The main outcome of this project was the development of Tanagra, a mixed-initiative design tool for the creation of computer game levels for platformer type games.</p>\n<p>Mixed-initiative design tools can be developed to help people design a wide range of objects. However, to keep the scope of this project more manageable, we focused our investigations on mixed-initiative tools for the creation of levels for computer games. We especially focused on creating levels for 2D platformer games, similar to the well-known games Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog. This type of game was chosen due to its simplicity of gameplay combined with the wide range of different level types found in existing platform games. It is a simple domain that exposes the full complexity of the creative content authoring problem.</p>\n<p>Before you can create complex mixed-initiative authoring tools, you have to have computer algorithms for automatically creating content. Procedural Content Generation is a research field whose goal is the development of computer algorithms whose output is &ldquo;content&rdquo; of many different kinds. In the area of games, content can be items such as trees, rocks, and weapons, or spaces such as buildings, dungeons, and entire game levels.</p>\n<p>Our first step was the development of a level generation system for platform games called Launchpad. To create Launchpad, we studied many platform game levels and developed a way of breaking these levels down into their basic parts, which include platforms, gaps, enemies, items that the player can collect, and so on. We also saw that the player experience of platform games involves maintaining a rhythm of button presses so as to progress through the level. Launchpad combined these game elements together in unique ways while staying consistent with a predetermined rhythm of player actions. Launchpad was one of the first procedural content generation systems capable of creating complete, interesting game levels for platformer games. It was also the first level generator to evaluate the range of levels the system can create, called the expressive range. This work has inspired many other researchers to also create and evaluate level generation systems. Though influential, Launchpad was not mixed-initiative in its operation. Instead, it took a series of inputs from the designer indicating their preferences, and then proceeded to generate a large number of levels consistent with these designer preferences. This kind of batch operation is not the interactive turn-taking experience we desire for a mixed-initiative system.</p>\n<p>Mixed-initiative design systems are challenging to develop because they must adapt to the human designer making changes to any part at any time. In the Launchpad system, a generated level is built up from left to right through the combined effect of multiple decisions by the generator. For example, during generation a platform is placed at a given location because the player can potentially jump there from a previously placed platform across a previously placed gap. All of these placement decisions build on one another. If a designer were to change one of the platforms placed early on in the process, it would cause the rest of the level to be re-generated, and hence a small human designer change would have a big impact on the level. This &ldquo;small change, big impact&rdquo; problem led to a new approach where the parts of a level are connected to each other via a series of constraints on their placement.</p>\n<p>The Tanagra mixed-initiative level design system lets human designers move and place platforms as they wish, and the computer generator then adapts by making a similar sized change. The result is a turn-taking system where final levels are a combination of human and computer actions. A constraint-based approach is the key to making this happen. Using constraints, Tanagra is able to make small adaptations based on human changes (via the Choco constraint evaluation system), and thus provide a mixed-initiative style of interaction. The importance of constraints for mixed-initiative design systems is the major scientific outcome of this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/15/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Emmet James&nbsp;Whitehead</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1002852/1002852_10019337_1481850346864_tanagra_screenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1002852/1002852_10019337_1481850346864_tanagra_screenshot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screen shot of Tanagra\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1002852/1002852_10019337_1481850346864_tanagra_screenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of Tanagra\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A view of the Tanagra mixed-initiative level design tool.
