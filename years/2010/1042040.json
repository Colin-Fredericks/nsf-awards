 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of South Carolina, entitled \"NUE: Nano in a Global Context for Engineering Students\", under the direction of Dr. Navid Saleh, will offer the opportunity to teach the principles and application of nanotechnology through a real-world program of global significance: water decontamination. The proposed new Introduction to Nanotechnology course will address five focus areas under the common water contamination theme, namely, (i) arsenic, (ii) pathogens, and (iii) organics/metal contamination and remediation, (iv) contaminant sensors, and (v) alternative power supply for treatment systems. The course has three principal goals: (1) introduce nanotechnology to engineering students who otherwise have no formal exposure to this important emerging technology; (2) integrate the approaches pertaining to nanotechnology offered by different engineering disciplines; and (3) fully incorporate discussions about the practical ethical implications of implementing nano in a real, developing world context. The course will include students from Claflin University an historically black college that will broaden the impact of the course to a larger, more diverse audience. In addition, students who complete the course will have the opportunity to travel to Bangladesh, meet researchers and students at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, and visit actual water decontamination sites in that region. \r\n\r\nThe overall outcomes of this project include (a) development of an introductory nanotechnology class, (b) making the individual modules of the class available to other classes within USC and beyond, (c) incorporation of technical articles as the driver of the technical modules for student exposure to scientific research, (d) inclusion of minority students from Claflin University, and (e) international collaboration through the study-abroad program in Bangladesh.",

This creates significant challenges in engineering courses, where students are often used to see, touch, and experience the subjects they learn.  \n\nThis project focused on developing educational material to teach engineering students the basic concepts in nano-technology within the context of water contamination.  This was achieved by designing problem based modules that engage students and challenge them to find solutions to realistic engineering problems.  These technical modules were linked with modules in ethics to explore the advantages and challenges associated with new the implementation and development of new technologies.\n\nThe educational modules developed during this project are used for a new Introduction to Nano-technology course at the University of South Carolina.  Some of these modules have also been used in other courses such as the Introduction to Civil engineering course and the Introduction to Environmental Engineering.\n\nStudents participating on this project traveled to Navajo Nation to experience first hand the challenges associated with water contamination.  This enriching experience gave students not only an opportunity to see how nano-technology could be used to solve realistic problems but the opportunity to see the social challenges associated with water contamination.\n\nThe outreach and educational opportunities developed during this project were not only focused on undergraduate students.
