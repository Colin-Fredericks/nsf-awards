 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Research and Enrichment Program will provide an opportunity to translate the potential of a few promising students at Rutgers University-Camden and a few students from local high schools into measurable impact. As part of this project we will work very closely with these students over the next couple of years - teaching them advanced topics in discrete mathematics/algorithms, mentoring them, and working on research projects with them. Making a concerted effort to support and guide these students will enrich them individually, and also permit them to make a greater impact through their academic and professional endeavors. The research projects that we plan to work on are related to covering problems and scheduling problems. Like many other problems, the proposed problems are intractable and no efficient algorithms to solve these problems exactly are known. Our goal is to design efficient algorithms that produce near-optimal solutions for these problems.",
