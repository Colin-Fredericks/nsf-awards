 "awd_abstract_narration": "These investigators, along with graduate and undergraduate students, are installing 83 broadband seismic stations from the EarthScope Flexible Array pool to explore the deep structure of the Mid-Continent Rift System (MCRS). The MCRS is the fossil remnant of an extensive rifting event that failed to split North America during the Middle-Proterozoic era. This event left a large volume of dense basalts and associated strong geophysical anomalies. By imaging the deep structure beneath the rift, this seismic experiment investigates how such rifts form and then die, rather than developing into oceanic spreading centers. The seismic stations are located around, across, and along the failed rift, from the Minnesota-Iowa border into Canada by Lake Superior. Imaging the deep seismic structure of a central part of the MCRS will be undertaken with receiver function migration, ambient noise analysis, teleseismic surface wave dispersion analysis, regional S- and surface wave-train fitting, teleseismic arrival time tomography, re-analysis of existing seismic reflection & refraction data, and SKS-splitting analysis. These analyses are combined into a multi-resolution, three-dimensional image of the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the crust and mantle beneath the MCRS and its surroundings. Results of these analyses will illuminate the role of the mantle in the rifting process and its initiation and cessation. The results will also enhance our understanding of mid-continental earthquakes. This research project employs at least three graduate students, also involves undergraduate students, and fosters collaboration between researchers from Canada and the USA.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe SPREE (Superior Province Rifting and Extension Experiment) was a field deployment of roughly 80 seismometers in Minnesota, Wisconsin and southern Ontario, Canada.  The project aimed to image crust and mantle structure associated with the 1 billion year old Mid-Continental Rift in Minnesota.  Investigators from five institutions participated in the project.  The University of Minnesota group was responsible for three aspects of the study.  As the closest group to the field area, we had primary logistics duty.  On the science side, we are responsible for measuring shear-wave splitting and for any deep discontinuity imaging.  \n\nShear-wave splitting uses earthquake waves from distant tremblors to map the fabric of rocks beneath the array of seismometers.  This can identify old events related to opening of the rift, subsequent closing of the rift or processes that have modified the rocks both before and after rifting.  The dominant signal we see is due to modern motion of the North American plate, a signal commonly seen in continental areas that are currently stable.  Any signal remaining from the rifting event must be small.  This is interesting: active rifting events show strong fabrics in shear-wave splitting studies.  The absence of such a signal under the old rift suggests possible annealing of the fabric, loss of consistent fabric when the rift was closed up, or both.  \n\nWe have begun work with the group at Northwestern University to look at deep features (more than 250 miles deep) under the array of seismometers.  Although unlikely to tell us anything about the rift itself, deeper Earth structure is a clue to flow of material in the mantle and the composition of the mantle itself.
