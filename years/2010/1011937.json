 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Jeffery L Yarger and Gregory P. Holland of Arizona State University are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the molecular structure and dynamic properties of surface functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) using solid and liquid state NMR techniques.  The focus of the proposed research is on two classes of ligand-capped NPs.  The first is inorganic oxides modified with phosphonic acids and the second is Au and Ag metal NPs modified with phosphines or phosphonic acids.  Solution-state NMR will be used to study the ligand binding chemistry and transport properties when the NPs are solvated and magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR will be utilized for characterization of the capping agent and core structure in the solid form.  The mobility of the NPs in aqueous and organic solutions will be probed with pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusion measurements. \r\n\r\nThis research involves the development of solid and liquid state NMR techniques to obtain chemical information on nanoparticles that is not available with currently existing surface analytical techniques. The overarching goal of this research is to understand and control the surface chemistry of nanoparticles.  Such an understanding is key for the successful fabrication of nanodevices for applications ranging from energy storage to catalysis.  Students will be trained in advanced NMR techniques and nanoscience and K-12 teachers will be involved in this research project.",
