 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important activity toward advancing  accelerator capability  is research and development for a high luminosity muon collider. Muons have important properties compared to electrons and protons when considering a possible next step for a high energy physics facility. Since radiation by muons is much suppressed compared to electrons, it is feasible to consider a relatively compact circular collider in the TeV energy range for muons. However the muon, like the electron, is a point particle and therefore can explore the same physics regime as protons with approximately ten times higher energy. Accordingly the muon collider has attracted increasing interest over the past couple of years. Since the muon is an unstable particle there are many new facets of accelerator physics and technology that need to be examined before one can say with confidence that such a device will work. \r\n\r\nThe International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (or MICE) is a high energy physics experiment dedicated to observing ionization cooling of muons for the first time. Such cooling is a necessary step toward a muon collider. Cooling is a process whereby the emittance of a beam is reduced in order to reduce the beam size, so that more muons can be accelerated in smaller aperture accelerators and with fewer focussing magnets. This might enable the construction of high intensity muon accelerators, for example for a Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider, which potentially can attain higher energies than electron-positron colliders.  \r\n\r\nResearchers looking for a method of cooling muons designed the MICE experiment to test the effectiveness of a technique called ionization cooling. Ionization cooling takes place when muons are sent through an absorber in which they lose momentum via ionization energy loss. They are then reaccelerated in a linear accelerator where their energy is restored only in the forward direction. MICE will use a single particle beam, with not more than one muon passing through the detector about every 10 nanoseconds. The experiment needs to balance the cooling from energy loss with the heating from multiple scattering of the muons.\r\n\r\nThe Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment will make detailed measurements of muon ionization cooling using a newly constructed low-energy muon beam at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The experiment is a single particle  experiment and utilizes many detector techniques from high energy physics experiments. To characterize and monitor the muon beamline, newly developed scinitillating fiber profile monitors and scintillator paddle rate monitors are employed. In order to monitor the purity of the beam and tag the arrival time of individual muons, a dual aerogel Cherenkov system is used, and a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system will be used.",
