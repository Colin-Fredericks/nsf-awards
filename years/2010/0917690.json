 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type III (A:C) partnership between Villanova University, an NSF PFI grantee (0332490), and Bucknell University, an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee).  The project applies core and emerging research in acoustic signal processing, aiming at increasing acoustic system performance and enhancing ultrasound imaging. This is achieved through advances in signature analyses and feature extractions.  Novel fusion modalities based on multiple and distributed sensors are examined for further system performance improvements.  \r\n\r\nThis partnership recognizes the growing acoustic and ultrasound local and national job markets, spanning the healthcare, automotive, and aerospace sectors with applications ranging from medical diagnostic and therapeutic needs to predictive maintenance of machinery and products, and extending to acoustic source training and localizations. The proposed activities will serve to improve acoustic and ultrasound data analyses and imaging.  The enhancements in medical ultrasound imaging have clear societal impact, as they will increase diagnostic capabilities and quality of life while reducing medical costs.  In the predictive maintenance field, if more information can be acquired describing the state and properties of existing machinery, better decisions can be made with regard to failure prediction and safety issues.\r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Villanova University (lead institution), Bucknell University, and Gwynedd-Mercy College; Private Sector Organizations: Siemens and The Boeing Company; State and Local Government Organizations:  Ben Franklin Technology Partners; and Federal Government Laboratory:  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).",
