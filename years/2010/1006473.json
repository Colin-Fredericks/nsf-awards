 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research program is to understand the implications of homopolymer and electrolyte additives on the texture formation in block copolymer materials, and to establish the effect of filler particle shape on texture formation in block copolymer/nanoparticle blends. Specifically, this program will address the following questions: (1) What is the significance of enthalpic interactions on the grain boundary segregation process of homopolymer fillers and how does enthalpic interaction affect the capacity of a filler component to stabilize grain boundary structures? (2) To what extent does the effect of filler species on the grain boundary formation process obey universal principles? (3) Is it possible to selectively stabilize particular grain boundary structures by addition of filler particles that exhibit defect geometry-matched crystal shapes and what is the implication of grain boundary discrimination on the texture evolution of block copolymer/nanoparticle blends? Ultimately, this program aims to contribute to the knowledge-base that will be critical for the future rational design of block copolymer nanocomposite materials with tailored properties that are relevant to a host of transformative technology applications ranging from microfabrication or optical coatings to materials for energy storage and conversion. The proposed research will involve experimental and characterization techniques that are complementary to existing techniques at Carnegie Mellon University and that will be beneficial to the wider polymer community in the Pittsburgh area.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL \r\n\r\nThe aim of this proposal is to understand the governing parameters that control structure formation in block copolymer-hybrid materials. These are materials that are capable of the self-organization into a hierarchy of functional nanostructures that are of technological relevance in applications ranging from polymer membranes for next-generation lithium ion batteries to high-performance polymer photovoltaic materials. The particular goal of this project is to develop processes to control the formation of defects in these nanostructures, a key requirement for the future technological exploitation of block copolymer hybrid materials. The program will enhance the teaching of two polymer classes and provide training for one graduate and several undergraduate researchers in the critical area of polymer and nanoscale materials. Ongoing collaborations with researchers at Florida A&M University will be leveraged to enhance participation of minority students within the program. By virtue of guest lectures and demonstrations on the particular topic of ?Nanostructured Materials? this project will furthermore aim to stimulate students of middle and high schools in the East Liberty School district of Pittsburgh to pursue higher education in STEM related areas.",
