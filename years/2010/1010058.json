Theme 1 of the project defines a new non-orthogonal\r\nfusion frame.  Preliminary studies show that the matrix\r\nrepresentation of the new fusion frame operator can be diagonal\r\nover the same example where the existing fusion frame operator is\r\ncompletely sparse-less.  Because the fusion operation ultimately\r\ninvolves the inverse of the fusion frame operator, and because\r\nsubspace transformations are generally unavailable in practical\r\ndata fusion applications, such a new fusion frame with sparse or\r\ndiagonal fusion operator becomes crucial.  Theme 2 studies a\r\nnotion of multi-fusion frames based on multiple non-orthogonal\r\nprojections onto one subspace.  Nearly surprisingly, the new\r\nmulti-fusion frame operator defined on one proper subspace can be\r\neasily positive and invertible.  A number of theoretical issues\r\nare to be understood.  Rooted in studies of themes 1 and 2, theme\r\n3 outlines a notion of reflective sensing and multiple reflective\r\nsensing.  Their theory and applications in side-measured\r\ntomography and multi-path wireless signal receiving are examined. \r\nIt is relevant to point out that the implementation of\r\nnon-orthogonal projection operators is naturally achievable,\r\nbased on earlier work by the investigator on pseudoframes for\r\nsubspaces. \r\n\r\n     The project relates to signal processing applications. \r\nSignal processing generally refers to making the signal easy to\r\nhandle or of better quality.  It is everywhere seen in our modern\r\nsociety.  In this project, the principal novelties introduced to\r\nsignal processing are the new notion of non-orthogonal fusion\r\nframes and ideas of performing data fusion from, e.g., wireless\r\nsignals received from multiple paths.  Fusion frame is a notion\r\ndeveloped specifically for various data fusion applications. \r\nData fusion means combining data measured by different devices or\r\nby different means in order to obtain refined data.  The\r\nadvantage of non-orthogonal fusion frames lies in the fact that\r\nthey greatly improve efficiency of the data fusion procedure in\r\npractical sensor networks, particularly when the amount of data\r\nis large.  The project aims to develop effective methods of\r\ncombining data detected in an array of sensors where information\r\noverlay (among sensors) is abundant and unpredictable.  With\r\nextremely complicated information overlaps, exact and efficient\r\ndata combination is made possible by non-orthogonal fusion\r\nframes.  In particular, the project explores image fusion to\r\nprovide a combined image of much greater precision or resolution\r\nwithout ad-hoc procedures present in conventional techniques. \r\nData fusion problems arise in many applications, ranging from\r\ncommercial imaging to geographic survey, mapping, wireless\r\ncommunication, multi-sensor/camera surveillance systems, and a\r\ngreat number of sensor network applications.",
