 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award purchases a new Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) for geosciences research at the University of Minnesota. The instrument is used to support analyses of seafloor hydrothermal vent fluids and other geological materials, as well as train graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the art geochemical techniques. The institution has provided a strong commitment to the sustainability of the instrument by improving the associated laboratory facilities and providing technical support. NSF-related broader impacts of the purchase are primarily in building infrastructure for science at the host institution, student training, and support of research for a faculty member whose gender is under-represented in the sciences.",
