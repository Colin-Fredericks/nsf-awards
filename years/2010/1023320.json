 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Setswana language, spoken in Botswana, evidences some unusual consonants and consonant combinations, some of which are predicted by linguistic theory not to exist. The present study will investigate the consonant system of Setswana, using acoustic, perceptual, aerodynamic, and ultrasound techniques. The unusual sounds will be documented in order to test whether the general descriptions that have been reported in the literature are in fact accurate.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research resides in the collection of new empirical data against which linguistic claims will be tested. The results of this research will have implications for theories of possible inventories of sounds, of the physical articulatory and acoustic bases of sound changes, of the way language is processed, and of the way sounds in sequence interact, both at the physical and cognitive levels.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide new acoustic and articulatory data for a language with a number of typologically rare features. Results will be disseminated via multiple venues. The research will promote cooperation between Georgetown University and the University of Botswana. New ultrasound equipment will permanently enhance the research infrastructure at Georgetown. The research will also have a significant training component. Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in acoustic and articulatory data analysis. Finally, the research will contribute to the participation of under-represented groups in science by providing training to a local Setswana consultant and by supporting an African woman as a postdoctoral researcher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF grant BCS-1023320 funded preparation for linguistic fieldwork in Botswana in 2011 and 2012, on the languages Setswana and Sebirwa. (Actual travel costs were funded by a separate grant, BCS-1052937).\n\nFor a biologist, fieldwork might consist of travelling to Africa to study an ecosystem:  What plants and animals are part of the system?  How do they interact with one another and with their environment?  How is the system responding to environmental pressures?  For a phonetician, fieldwork is much the same, except that we study linguistic sound systems rather than biological ecosystems, examining vowels and consonants rather than plants and animals.\n\nSetswana and Sebirwa are scientifically interesting for the same reasons that an ecosystem might be.  They are reported to contain unusual consonants (called \"labio-coronal fricatives\") not attested in any other language.  At the same time, sounds that are universally expected cross-linguistically, \"plain\"  [p, t, k], are reported not to occur.  The consonants of Setswana and Sebirwa also interact in unexpected ways:  [l] changes into [d] and [b] changes into [p] under different circumstances than those found in other languages. \n\nBeyond documenting the unique features of these particular languages, the work will further understanding of general linguistic capabilities, limitations, possible inventories and possible interactions, providing greater insight into the human language faculty, and thus into the interaction between cognition and biology in general.\n\nWe are conducting the studies detailed below.\n\n1.  Document a new sound.  Sebirwa and certain dialects of Setswana are reported to use \"labio-coronal fricatives.\"  A fricative is a sound like [s] or [f], which make noise based on turbulent airflow.  What makes a labio-coronal fricative so rare is that turbulent noise is generated at two places in the vocal tract at once:  both at the lips (labio-) and with the front of the tongue  (-coronal).    In our fieldwork, we use a combination of ultrasound imaging, video imaging, aerodynamic measures, and audio recordings to document reported labio-coronal fricatives.\n\nAlthough quantitative analysis is ongoing, qualitative evaluation of our data from the Shoshong dialect of Setswana indicates a true double fricative, contrary to predictions in the linguistic literature.\n\n2.  Analyze a gap.  Setswana and Sebirwa are also interesting because of a set of sounds they reportedly don't have:  \"plain\" [p, t, k].  Theories of linguistic inventories predict that if a language has a particularly complex sound, it will also have its simpler counterpart.  Setswana has been shown to have complex ejective consonants, which involve closure and abrupt raising of the larynx, as opposed to a neutral larynx position in simple plain consonants.  Published  grammars indicate, however, that plain consonants are not used.\n\nIn our fieldwork, we are investigating this gap using electroglottography (EGG) in conjunction with audio recordings.  Preliminary analysis of our 2011 fieldwork shows both plain and ejective consonants in the Gaborone and Shoshong dialects, contrary to the claims in the literature, and in line with the predictions of general phonetic theory. \n\n3.  Investigate some unexpected interactions.  Commonly, speech sounds will undergo changes in order to become more similar to adjacent sounds.  Thus, in English, plural \"s\" is pronounced [s] in \"cats\" but [z] in \"dogs\", to match the state of the larynx in the preceding consonant:  both [t] and [s] are voiceless (no vibration), both [g] and [z] are voiced (vibrating vocal folds).  (We don't change the spelling, so you have to say the word to yourself to hear the difference.)  Changes like this one in English are termed \"phonetically grounded\":  they make sense in terms of making articulation easier, because two sounds come to match.  In general, sound changes are predicted to show phonetic grounding.\n\nSetswana, however, is argued to evidence two ..."
