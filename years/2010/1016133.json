 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate and plan for commercializing space weather specification and forecasting. Space \"meteorology\" is following a development path similar to that followed by terrestrial weather predecessors. For terrestrial weather, the National Weather Service (NWS) has, since its inception, provided forecasts for the nation. However, with the maturity of prediction capabilities, the noncommercial nature of the NWS resulted in the establishment of a thriving ?value-added? meteorological private sector. Although the nature of space weather will eventually elicit a private sector response that is different in specifics from that for terrestrial meteorology, the ultimate focus will remain the same: to provide commercial products and services that mitigate or eliminate negative environmental effects. However, commercial specification and forecast is still in its infancy and has not been investigated sufficiently to provide specific guidance to start-up ventures. The goal of this study is to conduct early-stage exploratory work on this largely untested approach.  The study combines the integrated-modeling expertise derived from the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM) with traditional business approaches used to establish and market new products and services.  The outcome of this effort would be more survivable spacecraft operation, more efficient satellite insurance coverage, and the beginnings of a competitive private sector focusing on providing the best space-weather products at the lowest possible cost.",
