 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies methods for analyzing large datasets using L1 and\r\nrelated regularization. Coordinate descent algorithms are developed to\r\nprovide entire families of solutions for L1 and more aggressive\r\nconcave penalized regression problems. Applications include\r\ngeneralized linear regression models for very wide datasets, and\r\nstructure-finding algorithms for undirected graphical models. L1\r\nregularization is used as well to develop efficient convex algorithms\r\nfor finding low-rank approximations (SVDs) to extremely large,\r\nsparsely populated matrices.\r\n\r\nThis project develops tools with a wide variety of applications,\r\nillustrated here in medicine and merchandising. Modern technologies in\r\ngenomics produce measurements of half a million or more\r\ngenotypes at particular locations (SNPs) along an individual's genome\r\nin a few hours. Armed with such measurements on a few thousand\r\nindividuals, some sick and some healthy, this project develops\r\npowerful statistical tools for identifying groups of SNPs associated\r\nwith diseases such as Alzheimer's or breast cancer. Online movie\r\nrenters or book buyers are often asked to rate their\r\npurchases. Although each individual sees a minuscule fraction of the\r\nselections available, the investigators are able to develop\r\nrecommender systems that exploit the overlap to learn genres of\r\nmovies, and assign viewers to like-minded cliques, and which allow\r\nthem to make recommendations for products not yet seen.",
