 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. Microorganisms sustain the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, one of the most important nutrient cycles on earth. A key step in this cycle, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by autotrophic microorganisms, was for a century thought mediated by a few restricted bacterial genera. Significant ammonia oxidation, perhaps most, is now attributed to a previously enigmatic group of Archaea - the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) - of high abundance in both marine and terrestrial environments. The investigators  prior physiological and environmental analyses, the foundation for this proposal, have shown that AOA are active within the marine photic zone and that their competitive fitness in the marine environment is at least in part attributable to an extremely high affinity for ammonia ? growing at near maximum growth rates at concentrations of ammonia that would not sustain known bacterial ammonia oxidizers ? and an unusual copper-based respiratory system that may render them more competitive in iron limited environments. The compelling inference from these prior analyses is that AOA alter and possibly control the forms of fixed nitrogen available to other microbial assemblages within the photic zone by converting ammonia, a nearly universally available form of nitrogen, into nitrite, a form only available to nitrite oxidizing bacteria and some phytoplankton. If correct, this has a significant impact on biodiversity. \r\n\r\nThe PIs  will use the most recent technological advances in protein and high throughput sequencing to evaluate the significance of nitrification in shaping biodiversity (genomic and metagenomics), activity (transcriptome, proteome and stable isotope probing), and in controlling availability of an important trace element (copper). In turn, by resolving the environmental and biotic variables that influence the diversity, distribution and activity of AOA, they will advance general understanding of their taxonomy. More directly, functional knowledge of the contribution of AOA to regenerated nitrate will improve estimates of new ocean production (?biological pump?) based on nitrate assimilation, which in the past has mostly neglected the importance of nitrification as a major source of nitrate. Together these studies will transform understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle, estimates of new production, and will ultimately provide a better understanding of the impact of human activity on this critical nutrient cycle.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The nitrogen cycle has been profoundly affected by anthropogenic inputs of reactive nitrogen into terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric systems ? having, or predicted to have, major impacts on marine biological production, increased N20 emissions, nitrogen pollution, and eutrophication. Likewise, there is a poor understanding of the relationship between nitrogen cycling and productivity in\r\nmarine ecosystems. Marine systems are increasingly affected by ocean acidification and by atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen. Since both changes greatly alter nitrogen available to microorganisms, the characterization of the response of these environmentally relevant AOA is of tremendous relevance to understanding the affect of acidification and anthropogenic nitrogen inputs on major ocean processes. The work will also provide an excellent interdisciplinary research opportunity for high school teachers and students. Outreach will enhance understanding among students and teachers of the role of microorganisms in global elemental cycles such as the N cycle. The research will also enhance collaboration among members of the Nitrification Research Coordination Network funded by NSF.\r\n\r\nIntegration. The proposed project encompasses and integrates the three dimensions (functional genetic, and taxonomic) of biodiversity. First, the project is framed by function: microbial control of one of the most important nutrient cycles on earth, the nitrogen-cycle. Second, it is motivated by recent genetic analyses that associate activities of a novel clade of Archaea (provisionally assigned to a new kingdom within the Archaea, the Thaumarchaeota) with control of ammonia oxidation in the ocean. Third, it is built upon a compelling synthesis of physiological and environmental data that lead to its central hypothesis ? that by altering and possibly controlling the form of nitrogen, the AOA also alter biodiversity and ecological function in one of the most productive environments on earth. It identifies a specific taxonomic imperative. The tremendous genetic diversity among the globally abundant AOA ? catalogued almost exclusively by gene sequencing surveys and therefore lacking formal description ? makes it essential to resolve membership into ecologically relevant groups or clades as a prelude to developing a formal taxonomy. The investigators have assembled a group of researchers with specific expertise in each of dimension and uniquely qualified to address the research objectives outlined in an integrative way.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most exciting areas of discovery in marine ecology is the flow of nutrients and energy between components of the microbial community. This is because microbes comprise the base of marine food chains and productivity is controlled by nutrients and energy.\n\nA rationale for this project was to study the relationships between organisms that acquire the energy for growth by photosynthesis (photoautotrophs) and microbes that acquire energy from chemical reactions that release energy (chemoautotrophs).   At first glance, those strategies might appear to be so different that the respective organisms would have little interactions. Indeed many chemoautotrophs are abundant in dark places where photosynthesis does not occur. However, one reaction producing energy that is harvested by microbes this the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite.  That has a big impact on the photoautotrophs, which compete for the ammonia as a source of the nutrient, nitrogen.  They can also use nitrite but must convert it back to ammonia - which requires energy!     This project goal was to study the oxidation by ammonia, which is carried out in the ocean priomarily by a class of microbes called archaea, and determine what controls their rates.  Moffett's specific contribution was to assess how the chemistry of seawater imposes specific challenges on the activity of these organisms.   \n\nIn particular, Moffett studied how key metals in seawater like copper (which are very scarce in the ocean) might affect the competition between archaea and photoautotrophs, like diatoms.   The enzyme that oxidizes ammonia requires copper.  Our work showed that much of the ocean is poised on the threshold of copper limitation for these ammonia oxidizers.  Therefore, factors that control copper distribution in the ocean can influence these rates.    Other biochemical reactions that need copper enzymes often have highly similar enzymes that can use other metals that might be more abundant.   But ammonia oxidizers are stuck with coppper.  \n\nNevertheless, there are some places where copper is very scarce, yet these ammonia oxidizers are plentiful.  The Arabian Sea is a great example.  We surmise that they have figured out a way to acquire the copper they need even when it is 'hidden' in highly inert forms.  For archaea that have mastered this trick, the copper is used by a whole suite of other biochemical functions as well.      That complicates our interpretation since we can't apply a \"one size fits all\" model of the relationship between copper and ammonia oxidation.    But it appears that copper plays a significant role in the structure of ammonia oxidizing communities.   In many cases, addition of even trace quantities of copper to seawater results in a noticeable increase in ammonia oxidation rates. \n\nThe work is closely integrated to the other activities of the project, especially the relationship between ammonia oxidation and ammonia concentration and light.   These organisms are really good at acquiring the ammonia they need even when it is very scarce.   That requires more copper. But they are very sensitive to damage by light. Much of that damage is caused by free radicals, which can be detoxified by enzymes - that require copper!      So the challenges of acquiring scarce amounts of ammonia and copper in sunlit waters are great.   Finally, the actual energy produced in the reaction is meager, so all of these complicated biochemical processes must be accomplished on a shoestring budget!   Yet somehow these organisms prevail and prosper.    Phytoplankton typically make do with the nitrite, having to give back the energy 'stolen' by the ammonia oxidizers to convert nitrite back to ammonia - the form required to make amino acids. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James W Moffett"
