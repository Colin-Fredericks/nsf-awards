 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will model, develop, design, and build an electromagnetic actuator using LaunchPoint?s patented nonlinear magnetic spring design.  The actuator will be used to operate valves in internal combustion engines.  Modern internal combustion engines use valve timing to optimize fuel/air/exhaust and mixing for complete combustion.  The availability of a full variable valve timing system has the potential to improve engine performance.  It will provide valve timing flexibility which will help in reducing engine-out exhaust emissions and improve torque characteristics of the engine.  Electromagnetic valves for engine applications have been developed, tested, and used in a limited number of internal combustion engines.  In that respect, the proposed technology is not new.  But the approach is different and the technology is different in that it can provide controlled opening and closing of the valve.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be that variable valve timing will potentially result in improved fuel economy and reduced emissions for conventional spark ignition and compression ignition engines.  The actuator could eliminate many engine components related to camshaft drive and result in reduced costs.  This technology could become an enabling technology for new generations of engines and in so doing could contribute to a cleaner environment.\r\n",
