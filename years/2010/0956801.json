 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes will study the technology barriers associated with creating exoskeleton assist devices for workers in distribution centers and automobile assembly plants. By using these devices, workers can dramatically reduce the load in the\r\nvertebrae of the lower back when maneuvering parts and boxes. The assist device will take the majority of the load off of the user?s body. Such collaboration between humans and machines has the benefit of the intellectual advantage of humans coupled with the strength advantage of machines. The proposed project involves the University of California at Berkeley as research partner, General Motors Corporation, and the U.S. Postal Service. The end goal is a reduction in back injuries in the workplace which are considered by OSHA the nation?s number one workplace safety problem.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are reduced worker?s compensation insurance costs, reduced disability payments, increased worker productivity, and the ability for workers to keep working into their older years. Furthermore, these new devices will open an entirely new market which will serve an important role in establishing the United States as the number one player in the emerging field of bionics. Additionally, establishing this market for exoskeletons will enable the development of other exoskeleton markets which include military exoskeletons for carrying backpack and body armor loads, rescue worker exoskeletons, stair climbing exoskeletons for urban firefighters, and wild-land firefighter exoskeletons. The potential impacts to worker safety and American quality of life are large and diverse.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this STTR project has been to create a set of practical technologies leading to the creation of high performance lower extremity exoskeleton assist devices for workers in distribution centers and industrial settings.  Classical lower extremity exoskeleton designs are targeted at extreme applications &ndash; typically either providing super human strength and stamina for military applications or restoring gait to people with severe lower limb impairment who cannot otherwise walk.  But these extremes ignore a vast need for assistive devices for workers at moderate to light loads.  Here the goal is not to radically alter the capabilities of the device operator but rather to mitigate against future injury with an exoskeleton.\n\nThe project team developed prototype exoskeletons that can reduce the load borne in industrial applications.  The design path focused on developing novel architectures that are low cost, unobtrusive, robust, and transparent to the device operator.  Device cost was minimized without sacrificing robustness through the extensive use of off the shelf components and simple control strategies.  Similarly, it became clear during the design that the device would need to require neither substantial training nor a complex interface, and these goals have been realized in the prototype.  Ekso Bionics is excited by the potential of these devices and is working with our partners towards their commercialization.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt R Amundson"
