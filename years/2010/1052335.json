They will perform (1) a science and technology demonstration viability study in collaboration with the Goddard Space Flight Center Heliophysics Division Space Weather laboratory; 2) a launch vehicle and International Space Station integration and deployment process systems engineering design and trade study in collaboration with the Johnson Space Center Space Environments group and Payload Office; and 3) a small satellite (e.g., CubeSat) storage container interface and on-orbit operations engineering design and trade study in collaboration the AMES Research Center Small Satellite Technology group.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to verify that it is feasible to launch large numbers of small satellites from the ISS. In so doing, the stage will be set for a unique method to address outstanding space-weather issues as well as advance our knowledge of the ionosphere?s interactions with the mesosphere, thermosphere, and magnetosphere. The strategic location of the ISS makes it an ideal platform from which to address science questions the need for in situ measurements to be made in both a difficult altitude range 125 to 250 km, and in rapid response to space weather phenomena such as a Superstorm or a stratospheric warning. By verifying that a cost effective and technically feasible method to use the ISS external payload capability to launch \"constellations\" on demand will provide national agencies, as well as commercial and educational entities, a new launch capability for LEO. Although the study focuses on ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere and ultimately magnetosphere science, the new access capability is not so restricted and science and technology missions covering a broader range will be enabled.",
