One is through developing the relative trace formula, the other is using a period transference principle based on the Rankin-Selberg method and the explicit realization of Langlands functoriality.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems",
