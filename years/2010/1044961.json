The PIs are requesting $20,000 to support between 20 and 40 students to attend the conference.\r\nThe ninth international USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI'10) will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada, October 4-6, 2010. The ninth OSDI seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. \r\nThis award is to make travel scholarships available to students and universities not typically represented at OSDI in order to improve the conferences impact and outreach.",
