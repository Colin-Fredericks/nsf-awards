 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this proposal is to test whether the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly is locally adapted; that is, if populations of this species have higher fitness (e.g., increased growth and survival) in its native versus non-native habitats.  For this purpose, a field experiment at one of the reintroduction sites of this butterfly in NW Ohio and a greenhouse experiment at Bowling Green State University, OH, will be performed.  A second research goal is to determine whether variation in host plant quality  influences the performance as well as feeding and oviposition (egg laying) preferences of the KBB.  This butterfly is likely to be highly affected by plant quality and other local environmental factors because of its restricted diet as well as limited dispersal abilities.  Results from the proposed research will be useful to reevaluate current management practices for the wild lupine and the Karner blue butterfly.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed study of local adaptation and its potential role in insect reintroductions will provide a pioneering case study in the emergent field of evolutionary conservation biology.  Results will contribute to conservation management as well as to education, promoting scientific literacy through a K-12 program aimed at increasing teachers' and students' awareness of current environmental problems causing the extinction of plant and animal species in NW Ohio.  The proposed project will also facilitate the participation of underrepresented groups in Science by providing an opportunity to recruit undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented ethnic groups, and by allowing the participation of a multi-ethnic school in northwest Ohio.  In this elementary-level public school, 40% of the students are from underrepresented groups and 90% are economically disadvantaged.",
