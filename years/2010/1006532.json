This project is closely tied to current experiments in two different classes of systems, ultracold atomic gases and complex materials, and will lead to fundamental insights into quantum many-body physics.  \r\n\r\nIn the area strongly interacting atomic gases, the PI will focus on: (i) the study of superfluid, ferromagnetic, and Fermi liquid phases, (ii) spectroscopic probes of pairing gaps and pseudogaps, and (iii) kinetic coefficients like shear and bulk viscosities and their anomalous behavior in the unitary regime. Many of the issues that will be addressed have interesting counterparts in solid state materials. These include questions like the possible existence of a ferromagnetic ground state in a single band repulsive model, or that of a normal state pairing pseudogap in strongly attractive Fermi gases, and questions about transport coefficients in regimes where quasiparticles are not well-defined. The PI will also explore the similarities between spectroscopic probes like momentum-resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy of cold atoms and angle-resolved photoemission in complex materials. \r\n\r\nA part of the project will deal with questions that are at the present time of direct interest only in complex materials. The PI will focus on the effect of disorder in strongly-correlated states which arise from doping Mott insulators. On the one hand, disorder gives rise to nanoscale inhomogeneity which plays a major role in determining observable properties, and on the other hand, it also acts as a local perturbation that gives new insights into the strongly correlated electronic state. A striking example is how disorder effects seem to be strongly suppressed in strongly correlated superconductors.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve training graduate students in important problems at the frontiers of research. Parts of the research will lead to cross-fertilization between the fields of atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, and high energy physics. The PI will continue to disseminate his results through talks and lectures at international conferences and summer schools, and to communicate the excitement of scientific research to undergraduates and high school students through popular lectures.  \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education to study the emergent properties of systems of interacting particles which lies at the heart of condensed matter physics. Some of the most interesting properties arise when the constituents are strongly interacting. The PI aims to gain theoretical insight into two classes of problems involving strongly interacting atoms in ultracold atomic gases and in complex solid state materials. Ultracold atomic gases are gases of atoms that are cooled using lasers or magnetic fields to temperatures very close to the absolute zero of temperature. This theoretical research is strongly motivated by recent experiments. The PI's goal is to obtain new insights and to make predictions that are testable through experiment. Parts of the research have an overlap with areas of physics as diverse as nuclear and high energy physics. The work on correlated materials aims to address the important questions like why the high temperature superconductors are unusually robust against impurities and imperfections in the materials, a matter of both fundamental and practical importance. \r\n\r\nThe research will involve training graduate students in important problems at the frontiers of research. Parts of the research will lead to cross-fertilization between the fields of atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, and high energy physics.
