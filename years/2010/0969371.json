 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will support the development of a new suite of tools to control and measure physical systems whose behavior is governed by quantum mechanics.  The project will extend current methods for single atom control to a many-body system associated with a large collection of atoms.  The fundamental goal is to use light as a quantum bus to connect distant atoms, and thus gain direct control over the quantum state of the combined many-body spin without the need for individual atoms to interact directly.  This will be achieved through coherent optical feedback, wherein a light beam is passed through the atom cloud to pick up information about the spin, and then returned in a second pass to transform the spin quantum state accordingly.  One important measure of success is the degree to which one can reduce (squeeze) the fundamental quantum uncertainty of the many-body spin.  Spin squeezing has direct application in quantum sensing and metrology, and may be a valuable resource for quantum communication and computing.  Coherent optical feedback has the potential to produce squeezing that improves exponentially with the product of time and optical density of the atom cloud, and could be a game changer relative to existing schemes that improve only linearly.  Experiments will be performed to determine the possible improvement in a real-world situation that includes decoherence, optical losses and imperfections.  Numerical simulation suggest that a factor of ten reduction in quantum uncertainty should be feasible in the planned first generation experiment.\r\n\r\nThe quest for control of complex quantum systems is a grand challenge currently pursued across a broad spectrum of physics disciplines. The effort is motivated by applications that range from the simulation of quantum many-body physics to quantum-limited metrology and quantum information processing, all of which share the goal of harnessing uniquely quantum properties to perform tasks that are not otherwise possible.  This project will contribute to the knowledge base of quantum information science, and to the training of future scientists in this highly interdisciplinary field.  Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, including education, research, and the dissemination of results.  The project will become a cornerstone of the NSF supported Center for Quantum Information and Control, co-located at the University of Arizona College of Optical Science and the University of New Mexico Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Weekly video conferencing, an annual research retreat, and joint participation in conferences will enrich the educational experience and strengthen the connections between junior and senior participants at both institutions.",
