Inspired by music-playing harmonicas that create tones via oscillations of reeds when subjected to air blow, the proposed concept exploits flow-induced self-excited oscillations of piezoelectric cantilever beams embedded within a cavity to transform wind energy into electricity. To achieve this goal, the specific investigations include i) integrating theories in continuous-systems vibrations, piezoelectricity, and fluid dynamics with computational analysis to develop a reduced-order mathematical model that governs the nonlinear aero-electro-mechanical response of the system; and ii) implementing analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methodologies from nonlinear systems dynamics to understand the interconnected role that the design parameters play in the electromechanical transduction and how to optimize them for enhanced performance . \r\nResults of this research will build the fundamental understanding necessary for energy harvesting from flow-induced oscillations and will provide the tools to determine the unknown role that the design parameters play in the limit-cycle oscillations necessary for energy harvesting. Micro-power generators based on the proposed concept will aid in powering and extending the autonomous operations of many vital electronic systems such as those used in wireless communications, remote sensing, and health-monitoring networks. Research results are tied to a myriad of educational activities and will result in new graduate course offerings.  These include a creative inquiry project and an outreach initiative to the local community. Extensive efforts are also proposed to provide underrepresented and minority students with similar experiences.",
