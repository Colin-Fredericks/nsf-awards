 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the S-STEM project \"Engineering the Husky Promise,\" the University of Washington (UW) establishes a scholarship program for talented low-income undergraduates in UW's College of Engineering, thereby supporting the \"Husky Promise\" - a guarantee for full tuition and fee scholarships for Pell Grant-eligible Washington State residents.  In the S-STEM program, each student is awarded a scholarship for up to $9000 per year for up to two years, depending on financial need.  The program supports at least 15 students per year, and more, if not all students have this much unmet need.  The significant financial support offered by S-STEM scholarships provides financially disadvantaged students additional time to focus on their studies, because they can work fewer hours at part-time jobs.  Beyond the scholarships, College of Engineering professors serve as mentors to S-STEM Scholars, especially through undergraduate research, and the scholars are offered an opportunity to develop a professional portfolio.  The College also reserves slots for scholarship recipients in its Engineering Community, an exciting experiential learning opportunity for engineering and pre-engineering students.  Four Resident Advisers, mostly engineering students, connect Community members with resources and programs and act as peer mentors.  On-site academic support, such as drop-in advising sessions, registration assistance, departmental and corporate information sessions, and tutoring sessions, is provided by the College of Engineering.  Social and informational events are planned by both the Advisors and the College.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives for \"Engineering the Husky Promise\" are that:\r\n     - minority students underrepresented in engineering, including those from local programs (Washington State GEAR-UP, MESA, and Rainier Scholars), receive at least 20% of the S-STEM scholarships;\r\n     - women receive at least 35% of the S-STEM scholarships;\r\n     - transfer students, of which half will be from UW MESA partner Community Colleges, receive at least 25% of the S-STEM scholarships, \r\n     - 81% of the S-STEM freshmen be admitted to a UW College of Engineering Department by the end of the sophomore year; \r\n     - 95% of S-STEM transfer students from community colleges graduate from a College of Engineering Department within three years; and\r\n     - at least 60% of S-STEM recipients participate in undergraduate research with College of Engineering faculty.\r\n\r\nIn order to serve students in the future and build on the basis of the S-STEM program, the College of Engineering is raising a sustainable endowment for additional scholarships.",

The S-STEM program provided academic   support to 40 students.  College of   Engineering faculty served as mentors to the students and 23 students engaged   in undergraduate research with College of Engineering professors.  A total of 49 students received career   counseling from either the College of Engineering\u00c6s Co-op &amp; Internship   program or the UW Career Services office.    Students were supported to attend events on campus including the   annual Women in Science and Engineering conference, the Office of Minority   Affairs and Diversity\u00c6s Educational Opportunities Program Celebration, an   \"etiquette dinner\" offered by UW Career Services, and an annual end-of-year   recognition event. \n\nThe S-STEM Scholars included a   number of students who had overcome extremely challenging obstacles to be   accepted at UW and enroll in the UW College of Engineering.  One grew up in foster care starting from   age five; she graduated in June 2014 and is now working with a startup.  A second student, also from the foster care   system, was just admitted to a UW engineering major through a highly competitive   process.  Two other students, who   effectively raised their younger siblings due to the drug addictions of their   parents, successfully graduated, even making the Dean\u00c6s List several   times.
