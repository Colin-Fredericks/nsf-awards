 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Philip P. Power at the University of California, Davis to carry out fundamental studies on the reversible reactions of unsaturated molecules with multiple bonded heavier main group and transition metal species. These studies focus on how small molecules containing multiple bonds interact in reversible processes with a group of elements that have not been well studied up to now. Examples of the small unsaturated (that is, multiple bonded) molecules to be studied include ethylenes, acetylenes, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These molecules are of great importance in industrial catalytic cycles which usually use transition metal compounds of metals such as titanium, rhodium or platinum as catalysts.\r\n\r\nThe studies will focus on abundant and inexpensive elements such as aluminum or silicon whose use may achieve better catalysis together with energy savings. In addition, the award supports the training of several undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in numerous practical research skills as well as in independent scientific thinking.",
