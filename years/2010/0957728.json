 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will characterize the first steps of gene activation by nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors are proteins with the ability to regulate the expression of adjacent genes and these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The PI will investigate the synergistic ligand effect observed for a hetero-dimeric nuclear receptor by examining its interaction with two cofactor proteins. The PI will use three-color brightness analysis to study ternary protein complexes directly inside living cells. The proposed studies will inspire further applications of three-color brightness analysis to other complex biological problems. The PI will provide research opportunities for REU students during the summer, which will expose these students to biological physics and encourage their interest in this subject. In addition, the PI will organize an annual three-day hands-on work shop for students from the biological sciences. The workshop will provide needed training for students who apply fluorescence techniques in their daily research, but without necessarily having a detailed understanding of the underlying principles.",
