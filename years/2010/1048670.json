The IPC meets quadrennially representing paleontologists from a broad variety of biological disciplines. The IPC is sponsored by the International Palaeontological Association, as well as societies and institutions of the host country. It is open to all who are interested in paleontology. The meeting is planned for June 28 to July 3 2010 at the Museum of Natural History (London). It follows on from the very successful second IPC at Peking University in Beijing, China, and the first IPC, held in Sydney, Australia in 2002.",
