 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems in which people and computers work together in a socially intelligent manner represent a new form of computing that brings together the challenges of traditional computing (e.g., algorithms, information representation, information acquisition, data quality) with those of human interaction (e.g., cognition, social interaction, culture, learning) and indeed a whole host of new challenges related to the combination of humans and computers (e.g., computer reasoning about human knowledge and abilities, socially-intelligent human-computer interaction, social computing). \r\n\r\nThis award supports meeting of SoCS Principle Investigators (PIs) (June 9-11, 2011) and will facilitate much needed interaction among researchers using the wide range of topics, methods and techniques. This PI meeting is designed to build on and leverage two other SoCS related workshops that will be temporally and physically co-located. PIs with active SoCS awards will be invited to participate in the meeting through a poster session where on-going SoCS research will be presented. The meeting also includes panels and discussions where best practices can be discussed. Many of the biggest challenges in successfully deploying computer systems in organizations come down to the difficulty of adapting technology to human organizations and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe development of the SoCS field will directly create new knowledge and understanding in how to more successfully manage the relationship between social (human) organizations and the computer tools they use to work together more effectively.",
