The sensor head will be manufactured by Optech and integrated with their existing ALSM system to allow for operation in the visible green spectrum for water penetration. Coupled with the recent acquisition of a full waveform digitization system, NCALM will be poised to develop techniques for two-color, full-waveform light detection and ranging (LIDAR) observations, including intensity profiles. Academic Researchers interested in the subtle bottom topography of shallow rivers, lakes and the neritic marine benthos will for the first time have access to a tool for high resolution, remote bathymetric mapping together with planning support, data analysis and quality control, and student research experience enabled by NSF support of NCALM. \r\n\r\n***",
