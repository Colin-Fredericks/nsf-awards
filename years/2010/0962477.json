 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) will study the process of turbulent magnetic reconnection through the use of large-scale numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models in regimes relevant to the solar corona. Specifically, this research team will investigate how random magnetic field footpoint motions on the Sun produce instabilities, large-scale fluid motions, Alfv\u00e9n waves, and turbulence; determine how the magnetic reconnection rate correlates with the level of self-consistently produced MHD turbulence; and obtain the overall Lundquist number scaling of the reconnection time-scale and energy dissipation rate. The researchers will also study the process that generates Alfv\u00e9n wave turbulence dynamically, instead of imposing turbulence externally. \r\n\r\nThis problem of magnetic reconnection and turbulence is highly relevant to solar research. The science results obtained from this project will increase our understanding of many fundamental phenomena in solar physics, such as coronal heating, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. The process of magnetic reconnection not only applies to the physics of the solar corona and heliosphere, but is also fundamental in many different physical systems, such as planetary magnetospheres, astrophysical accretion disks, and fusion experiments. This project will fully support a graduate student and provide partial support for a Post Doctoral Research Fellow. The PI plans to actively participate in education and outreach activities in the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) community, such as those organized through the 'Public Information and Education Outreach Office' of UAF's Geophysical Institute, as well as those coordinated by UAF's 'Science Education Outreach Network.' The PI will also teach university courses in plasma and space physics at UAF. The simulation codes developed in this project will be made available to the scientific community.",
