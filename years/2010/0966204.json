Recruitment specifically focused on underrepresented groups who could not afford to attend college. The goals of the program were to 1) develop and emphasize new science and technology programs; 2) increase the level of need and merit based financial aid; 3) develop curriculum to integrate academic enrichment and co-curricular activates; 5) create a collegial and supportive community; 6) establish academic pathways with New Hampshire community colleges in STEM disciplines; 7) build partnerships with community organizations and businesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Over the six-year time period (2010-2016) the program awarded 122 scholarships: 105 academic year awards and 17 one-semester awards. Half of the scholars were in the B.A. Biological Sciences program (35) and the other half in B.S. Computer Information Systems (20) and B.S. Engineering Technology (14) programs. 44% of the scholars were females. While women were overrepresented among Biological Sciences scholars (76%) and highly underrepresented in Engineering Technology (7%), they represented 28% of the CIS scholars, which is two times higher than the proportion of women in the College&rsquo;s undergraduate computing programs.</p>\n<p>More than two thirds of the scholars were transfer students with 50 or more credits transferred in. The program graduated 45 scholars: 33 graduated during the reporting period (2010 &ndash; 2016) and 12 scholars graduated by the end of the 2016-2017 academic year.&nbsp; Of the 33 scholars who graduated during the reporting period 82% started their careers in STEM fields and 12% have pursued masters and doctoral studies in biological sciences and medical field.&nbsp; Of the 24 scholars who did not complete the program, 9 transferred to other institutions, left their program of study, or became financially non-eligible for the scholarship, and 15 scholars lost their scholarships because of poor academic performance. Of these 15 scholars, 8 withdrew from the College, but 7 have successfully continued in their STEM majors, petitioned to re-enroll in the program, maintained good grades, and got jobs in STEM fields. The rate of students who lost their scholarships has steadily decreased, from 29% at the end of the first year to 21% after year 2, and 10%, and 4% in years 3, 4, 5, and 6. In its last year, the program registered the highest cohort GPA of 3.44 in both semesters and the highest retention rate of 96%. Scholars were very engaged in the College community through their participation as orientation and peer assistant leaders, presenters at the UNH Undergraduate Research Conference, technical lab assistants, and tutors in the Center for Academic Enrichment.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The UNHM-SST program contributed to the development of four courses that advocate and prepare students for STEM majors and careers: First Year Seminar with focus on STEM (1 credit), Shared Learning (2 credits) to emphasize peer learning practices, Exploring Your Career Options (1 credit), and Internship and Career Planning (1 credit). These courses were initially developed as cohort courses to form the learning community curriculum for the UNHM-SST scholars.

A significant outcome of this commitment is the creation of STEM educational pathways between the College&rsquo;s STEM programs and corresponding two-year programs at all seven community colleges in the state.</p>\n<p>Increasing support and enrollments in the College&rsquo;s STEM programs was an important factor in the College space expansion in 2015.
