Stein\r\nInstitution: Montana State University\r\nProposal No.: 1034434\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to determine the effects of wetland plant species and season on the removal of nitrate from constructed wetland microcosms at different organic carbon loading rates, and the relationship between rhizosphere microbial community dynamics and the composition of gaseous emissions from denitrification. The overall goals of the research are to minimize the NO3 and N20 in treated wastewater effluent and gaseous emissions and to maximize the amount of N2 produced during denitrification in treatment wetlands.  It is anticipated that the research will yield useful data on the optimal combination of plant species and operating conditions for use in constructed wetlands for tertiary treatment of municipal waste water. The project will support one masters-level graduate student and several undergraduate students at Montana State University. The results will be published in peer-reviewed articles and presented at national and international conferences. The PI has the opportunity to disseminate the results locally in Montana thru contacts in the state and municipal water treatment offices.   \r\n\r\n\r\nBruce K. Hamilton\r\n7/2/10",
