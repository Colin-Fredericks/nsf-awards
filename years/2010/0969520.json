The program has three components: 1) course development in three gateway courses that are prerequisites for further STEM study, 2) enhanced first year experiences including an innovative orientation course, and 3) apprenticeship opportunities for students.  \r\n\r\nGateway courses in physics, calculus and chemistry are being revised to incorporate interactive teaching, inquiry-based learning and assignments that reveal the societal benefits of STEM fields.  The revised freshman orientation course promotes community, engages students in problem-solving activities, introduces college survival skills and stimulates interest in STEM careers.  Students are provided apprenticeship opportunities to build community and establish relationships with other students and faculty.  Cal Poly - Pomona has a diverse student body and produces the largest number of underrepresented engineers and computer scientists in the state.  Successful strategies will be replicated at other California State Universities.",
