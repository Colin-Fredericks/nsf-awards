 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two primary goals.  The first is to solve the problem of the unitary dual: to describe the irreducible unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups. The primary tool is an algorithm to compute the unitary dual of any given group, which we are implementing inside the \"atlas\" software. We plan to use this information to prove results about the unitary dual, beginning with the unitarity of Arthur's unipotent representations. The second primary goal is to make information about representation theory of real groups accessible to non-specialists, via the software, a web site, public workshops, and other means. The atlas software is freely available on the atlas web site, and will continue to be maintained there indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using symmetry to study problems in mathematics and science dates back to Fourier's work on heat nearly two hundred years ago. In the hands of Hermann Weyl, Eugene Wigner, and Andre Weil, symmetry has come to play a central role in quantum mechanics and in number theory. Lie groups, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are the mathematical objects underlying symmetry.  Representation theory studies all of the ways a given symmetry, or Lie group, can manifest itself. The problem of understanding all \"unitary\" representations (in which the symmetry operations preserve lengths) is one of the most important unsolved problems in the subject, and has potential applications in many areas; for example, it is an abstract version of the question, \"what quantum mechanical systems can admit a certain kind of symmetry?\"",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Mathematics makes constant use of symmetry. Geometry in the plane (and\nso trigonometry, surveying, and so on) depends on the rotational\nsymmetry of the plane: moving southeast behaves in exactly the same\nway as moving north by northwest.  The sine and cosine functions are\ncharacterized by the fact that they change in a very simple way under\nrotation: the \"addition formulas\" for sine and cosine from\ntrigonometry. For that reason, these functions are fundamental for\nunderstanding anything about the plane.\n\nMore complicated kinds of symmetry lead to more complicated versions\nof sine and cosine. The rotational symmetry of a sphere leads to\nspherical harmonics, introduced by Laplace more than two hundred years\nago in his study of the motion of satellites. These same functions can\nbe used also to describe how the shape of the Earth deviates from a\nperfect sphere; or indeed for any problem in which the physical laws\ndo not change under rotation of space. (When Schrodinger wrote his\nequation describing the motion of an electron around an atomic\nnucleus, the equation had this rotational symmetry around the nucleus;\nso it was possible to write the solutions using Laplace's spherical\nharmonics from a hundred and forty years in the past.)\n\nThis project is joint work with Peter Trapa at University of Utah, Marc van\nLeeuwen at University of Poitiers in France, and David Vogan at MIT. It\nconcerns the search for analogue of sines and cosines---the technical\nname is \"irreducible unitary representations\"---for still more complicated\nsymmetry groups. Such groups arise in mathematics in problems of\nnumber theory, higher dimensional geometry, and differential equations.\nThey arise in physics when one tries (as we do not yet know how to do!)\nto describe elementary particles and gravity in a common theory.\n\nThe search for these irreducible unitary representation has occupied\nmany mathematicians for more than a hundred years.  There have been\nmany important successes, like work of Hermann Weyl and Elie Cartan in\nthe 1930s which treated all \"compact\" symmetry groups. (The rotational\nsymmetries of the plane and the sphere are both compact, as are the\nsymmetry groups in the \"standard model\" of particle physics; that\nmodel makes heavy use of the Cartan-Weyl work.)\n\nThis project concerns \"noncompact\" symmetry groups; in physics, these\nare the symmetry groups associated with physical theories\nincorporating Einstein's theory of gravity. In this setting, previous\nwork of Harish-Chandra and Langlands (around 1970) provided a list of\nrepresentations that was a little too long: it was guaranteed to\ninclude all the interesting (unitary) representations, but there was\nno way known to decide which representations in the list were unitary\n(and so could contribute to the description of interesting mathematics\nor physics).\n\nWe have found a way to decide this question, and written a computer\nprogram to carry out the calculations. We anticipate immediate\napplications to some mathematical problems where these symmetry groups\nare important, like the number theory field of automorphic forms. We\nhope eventually to see applications to physics; perhaps even to the\nquestion of finding a physical theory incorporating the standard model\nand gravity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey D Adams"
