 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project addresses the urgent national need of safe scavenging of oil from spills such as the recent and on-going deepwater disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Profs. Seal and Hench are using flyash, a waste material resulting from combustion of coal in electrical power plants, to absorb large volumes of oil from an oil-water mixture by a simple chemical alteration of the flyash surface in a cost effective manner. These materials then can be placed in a low-cost oil-permeable mesh packaging material for practical use in oil clean-up. After the clean-up, the materials can be easily recycled by feeding them into a combustion process to recover the thermal value of the oil without decomposition of the flyash. This will be a completely a green process. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in this project, and a sample kit will be made available to schools for science fair projects to stimulate innovative applications to clean the environment. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The current difficulty of finding an affordable and easily deployable solution to the Gulf oil spill disaster emphasizes urgency for new technologies in oil recovery. This project offers the opportunity to use low temperature chemical processing to tailor inorganic surfaces of complex amorphous aluminosilicates with high surface area at a molecular level. This provides the necessary hydrophobic groups to adsorb organic molecules including long chain hydrocarbons.  The process leads to an end product that is a low cost means of absorbing large volumes of oil and also be capable of recovering the energy value of the oil. This project potentially can lead to a general theory converting inorganic inert surfaces to a highly active hydrophobic surface without degrading the refractory characteristics of these inorganic complex silicates. The project is capable of rapid deployment to meet the needs of the current crisis. The RAPID project may result in a prototype process demonstration to commercial partners in the oil and energy sectors for manufacture and rapid deployment of a cost effective means of recovering the oil from shorelines, marsh lands, and water, while retaining the thermal value of the oil rather than disposing of the waste matter in an environmentally damaging manner.  The chemically optimized fly ash particles also can potentially be used in an oil recovery process by desorbing the oil from the surface without contamination by the decomposition of the particles.",
