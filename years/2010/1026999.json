 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\nThis project will develop a new approach to the weight of evidence problem. That problem has to do with how best to combine, in a meaningful and reliable way, complex sets of evidence including evidence from multiple disciplines, disparate methodologies, and often apparently conflicting results\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nIn this project, an approach to the weight of evidence problem using explanations as conceptual tools to organize the evidence and test hypotheses will be developed. The explanatory approach will then be applied to current scientific cases where the weight of evidence challenge is pressing. Finally, this approach will be compared with other approaches being developed, such as Bayesian Belief Networks, meta-analyses, evidence ranking, and expert elicitation techniques. The various approaches will be compared with respect to their rigor, their ability to consider a wide range of evidential sources, their ability to grapple with a range of contexts of application, the transparency of their method, and their ease of use.\r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nThe need for an approach to the weight of evidence problem, particularly in cases where direct human subject research would be unethical, has grown in recent years. Federal agencies have been called upon to utilize the best available science in setting policy, but when the science comes from multiple disciplines using different methods and points in various directions, how to do this cogently and transparently has become a serious challenge. This project will help address that challenge, by developing an approach and comparing it to the other approaches noted above. The PI hopes to be able to hone the explanatory approach such that it is both rigorous and transparent, while still remaining qualitative. Indeed, it may be that the explanatory approach is a necessary step for any of the quantitative approaches currently being proposed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project addressed the problem of how to weigh complex, often divergent, sets of evidence to determine \"where the weight of evidence lies\" in these cases.  Presumably, public policy decisions should (and are often required to) consider such overall weighings, so how they should be done is a pressing question.  This project developed the conceptual underpinnings of a qualitative approach, based on comparing rigorously competing explanations of the sets of complex evidence.  In doing so, the PI examined theories of inference to the best explanation, debates in philosophy of science on prediction vs. accommodation, the nature of coherence, and the epistemic value of the traditional theoretical virtues.  The result of these examinations was the development of a normative theory of inference to the best explanation (recent theories have largely been descriptive).  The theory depends on two levels of the assessment: first an examination of whether an explanation is adequate (Is it internally consistent?  Is it consistent with the available evidence?  Is it capable of producing new predictions?) and second an examination of whether the explanation has assurance that it is not just an ad hoc pastiche designed to enable a person to see the evidence how they would like to.  Crucial to this assurance against ad hocery is successful novel predictions.  In addition, there is some potential for unification of evidence to provide such assurance.  Precision increases the assurance of both of these forms.  The adequate explanation with the most assurance is to be taken as the best.  Thus, the normative theory of inference to the best explanation rests in part on a more finely grained appreciation of the strengths of the traditional theoretical virtues.\n\n \n\nIn addition to this core part of the work, the PI also compared the explanatory approach described above to a range of other approaches being developed, including expert elicitation, rule-based approaches, and algorithmic approaches.  Given the demands of the weight of evidence problem, including a need to have some way to assess which evidence is even considered relevant to any given question, the explanatory approach was found to be the approach that would either be preferable to the other approaches or be needed if the other approaches were to be successful.  Indeed, one of the strengths of the explanatory approach is its ability to show how to best utilize the best aspects of other approaches, such as expert elicitation and algorithmic approaches.\n\n \n\nThese results provide both new avenues of theoretical exploration in philosophy of science as well as the possibility for practical guidance in regulatory contexts.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Heather Douglas"
