 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines why some adolescents are more likely to break rules than others. Specifically, it tests an expanded version of legal socialization theory to help us better understand why some teenagers use drugs, bully their peers, act violently, and/or steal. Traditionally, legal socialization theory has hypothesized that moral reasoning, legal reasoning, and legal attitudes affect rule-breaking. More specifically, how people think about moral and legal matters shapes their legal attitudes, which, in turn, influence their rule-breaking behaviors. In general, positive views about the law affect rule violation directly, but the effects of moral/legal reasoning on rule violation are indirect (via legal attitudes). What the traditional model does not consider is how adolescents' views about the legitimacy of rule-makers (e.g., police, parents, and teachers) might also affect rule-breaking processes.\r\n\r\nUsing longitudinal data from two adolescent cohorts, the present study will examine, first, if perceived legitimacy affects rule-breaking independent of other legal attitudes. Then, it will assess the degree to which moral and/or legal reasoning influences rule-violation via its effect on teenagers' perceptions about the legitimacy of police, parents, and teachers. This study builds on prior research on 6th grade and 9th grade students who were followed over a four-year period (2006-2009). Data from the original study participants will be collected annually for an additional three years.\r\n\r\nThe current study is the first longitudinal study to consider the importance of various legal attitudes and the legitimacy of authority figures as predictors of rule-violating behavior, and to examine how they influence the relation between moral/legal reasoning and rule-breaking. Ultimately, the findings will provide important information for school-based intervention design and policies aimed at reducing behaviors like bullying and substance use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research project\u00c6s goal was to test two legal socialization models to explain why adolescents follow or break rules.  Legal socialization is a theory that explains how beliefs, attitudes, legal reasoning, authorities, and procedural justice affect people\u00c6s rule-violating and rule-following behaviors. In the current study with adolescents, authorities included parents, teachers, and police.  The behaviors that were measured included 24 behaviors that could be divided into violent behaviors, theft behaviors, and substance use behaviors.  The cognitive legal reasoning model argues that the higher legal reasoning, the more people will disapprove of rule-violating behavior and the more they will follow rules (not break rules).  The social procedural justice model argues that more procedurally fair people are treated by authorities, the more they will trust and feel obligated to the authorities (legitimacy), the less they will report legal cynicism, and the more they will follow rules (not break rules).  The project involved surveying two cohorts of adolescents ten times over the course of eight years (the last four times were funded by the current grant) beginning when the cohorts were 11 years old and 14 years old respectively.  The results found support for both the cognitive legal reasoning model and the social procedural justice model.  When the two models were combined, high legal reasoning and procedural justice were related to low approval of breaking rules, low legal cynicism, high trusting and feeling obligated to authorities and high rule-following (low rule-violating).  The findings have implications for how to reduce delinquent behavior in adolescents.  Adolescents who are treated fairly by authorities and trust and feel obligated to those authorities will be less likely to break rules and more likely to follow the rules.  The study also found the importance of parental and peer factors.  The more parents used an authoritative parenting style where they disciplined firmly but also explained the reasons for the discipline, the more their children trusted and felt an obligation to them, and the more they followed rules.  The more the adolescents\u00c6 friends engaged in rule-violating behavior, the more the adolescents broke rules.  In this study, we wrote six non-technical reports on the following six topics:  rule-violating behavior, parents, peers, substance usage, violent video game exposure, and bullying.  These reports were distributed to school officials including superintendents, principals and teachers.  The findings were presented to groups of police officers, counselors, teachers, and administrators who attended day long continuing education sessions.  They were also presented at staff meetings in the schools.   Two of the school have been considering implementing some of the findings from the study to reduce rule-violating behavior.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen S Cohn"
