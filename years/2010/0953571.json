 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to advance our understanding of the developmental basis of evolutionary change in Hydrozoa. Hydrozoans belong to the phylum Cnidaria, a group of marine invertebrates that represent one of the earliest animal groups. Although hydrozoans are constructed from just two cell layers and a few different cell types, they display incredible diversity in overall body form and life cycles. This study will test the hypothesis that hydrozoan diversity is in large part a result of evolutionary changes in the regulation of developmental genes. This will be investigated through examination of key morphological characters and developmental gene expression patterns in candidate genes. These character states and gene expression patterns will be analyzed within a phylogenetic framework, using methods that can test for correlations between changes in gene expression and morphological characters. \r\n\r\nThis research will not only enhance our understanding of the genetic basis for morphological evolution, but will provide innovative methods for studying developmental biology within an evolutionary framework.  These research methods will be integrated into courses on phylogenetics, evolution and development. Several undergraduates, two graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained on this project. Data from this research will be used to develop exercises for an existing educational website aimed to help those who teach evolution.",

Because of their relatively simple construction, with just two cell layers and a handful of cell types, they serve as a good model to understand the molecular genetic basis underlying the generation of diverse forms. Due to previous NSF funded research by my lab and others, we have a solid phylogenetic framework that enables us to trace the patterns of diversity within this group. For this project, we utilized modern genome sequencing methods and developed analytical pipelines to identify and characterize genes involved in prominent life cycle or body form traits, in several species of medusozoans. For example, phylogenetic research revealed&nbsp;that the jellyfish life cycle stage was lost or reduced multiple times in the diversification of medusozoans. We subsequently identified a gene that is only present in the genomes of species that have a jellyfish life cycle stage and appears to have been lost in those species that have a reduced or absent jellyfish form in their life cycle. In addition, we found that this gene only operates in developing and mature jellyfish. This provides an opportunity for future research to test the function of this gene using recently developed genome editing techniques such as CRISPR. Integrating phylogenetic patterns of diversity amongst living forms with cutting edge developmental genetic techniques will enable us to identify which genes and gene pathways were involved in generating the diversity of life's forms.
