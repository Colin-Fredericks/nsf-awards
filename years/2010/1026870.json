 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Robert A. Walker and Mary J. Cloninger of Montana State University are supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to conduct research -- in collaboration with Professors Colin D. Bain and Jas Pal Badyal of the Department of Chemistry, Durham University, Durham, UK -- to develop new strategies for creating functionalized surfaces that can trap and subsequently release soluble organic analytes from aqueous solutions in a controlled manner.  These strategies include novel applications of cold plasma chemistry and grafting dielectric surfaces with dendrimers.  The kinetics, thermodynamics and mechanisms of this selective \"catch and release\" chemistry will be explored quantitatively in situ and in real time using a suite of complementary optical spectroscopy techniques.   Information from these optical studies will provide the kinetic and thermodynamic data necessary for developing quantitative, predictive models of multi-valent association to and desorption from surfaces.  Professors Colin D. Bain and Jas Pal Badyal are funded by the UK funding agency, the EPSRC.\r\n\r\nThe ability to selectively remove large quantities of contaminants from solution remains an elusive goal of researchers in separation science.  If successful, the project will have a significant practical impact on activities as diverse as environmental remediation, water purification and drug delivery.  This interdisciplinary research will provides broad training opportunities and an international research experience for students at Montana State with participation of students from Native Tribal Colleges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project had as its focus the creation of new, molecularly-based substrates capable of specific and reversible removal of organic analytes from aqueous solutions.  In this context, \"specific\" meant that the functionalized surfaces were capable of selectively removing from solution targeted analytes while leaving other analytes unbound.  \"Reversible\" required that the bound analytes be released in a controlled fashion when specific triggers were introduced (such as changes in pH, ionic strength, temperature, etc.).  Using carefully tailored surfaces, this project studied the thermodynamics and mechanisms of this selective \"catch and release\" chemistry quantitatively in situ using a collection of complementary optical techniques and other analytical methods.  Related to this work were several additional projects that have examined reversible solute partitioning in heterogeneous systems and competitive binding of solutes to model biological membranes.  These new projects built upon lessons learned about the hierarchy of noncvalent forces in shifting the balance of chemical equilibria in chemically complex systems.  According to NSF guidelines, the outcomes of this work are separated into two separate categories:  intellectual merit and broader impact.\n\nIntellectual merit.  The most telling metrics of this project\u00c6s intellectual merit were the ways in which discoveries were disseminated to the scientific community.  Nine papers were submitted and published in the peer reviewed literature and student participants made six presentations at national and international meetings.  In addition, the principal investigators made an additional eleven invited presentations at national and international meetings.  Project PI\u00c6s also organized two separate symposia based on the themes at the heart of this project; one (two day) symposium was held at a national meeting of analytical chemists (Federation of analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Societies) and a second (three day) symposium took place at the international Pacifichem 2015 Congress.\n\nIn terms of scientific discoveries, this project had a number of important findings including the following:\n\n1.  Strategies were developed and refined for attaching dendrimers to silica surfaces and then functionalizing these dendrimers with specific functional groups that served as hosts to remove solutes from dilute aqueous solutions.  Importantly, a suite of analytical methods were used to quantify the number of hosts on the surface and determine what fraction of these hosts were accessible to solutes in bulk solution.  These studies illustrated that \u00e6more isn\u00c6t always better\u00c6.  Too many hosts on the surface rendered some hosts unable to bind guest solutes from solution.  These findings were published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces.\n\n2.  Solute affinity for lipid membranes was found to depend on both membrane phase and the solute identity.  Furthermore, although solutes showed greater ability to intercalate into membranes above the gel/liquid crystalline transition temperature, raising the solution temperature eventually led to those same solutes being expelled from the membrane back into aqueous solution.  This discovery was published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.\n\n3.  Studies of solute adsorption to different silica/liquid interfaces illustrated how subtle changes in solute structure affected whether adsorption terminated with monolayer coverage or continued to create multilayers and aggregates.  Solutes capable of strongly associating with the silica surface (through hydrogen bonding) at only one location showed a greater tendency to form multilayers whereas solutes capable of hydrogen bonding to the silica surface through two or more specific functional groups ceased to adsorb after a single monolayer formed.  Results were supported by complementary ab initio quantum mechanical calculations where solutes were embedded in a polarizable continuum.  Several papers reported t..."
