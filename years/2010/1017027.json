 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software errors frequently arise because a component of the program does\r\nnot correctly follow a well-defined protocol for accessing some stateful\r\nresource. Common examples include programs that misuse resource handles\r\nprovided by the operating system, incorrectly deallocate the same memory\r\nor other resource multiple times, or fail to properly sequence calls to\r\na complex program module. Such protocol violations lead to software\r\ncrashes or unintended behavior, potentially with disastrous\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nThe project objective is to develop programming language technology to\r\nallows software developers to conveniently describe protocols over\r\nstateful resources. This technology will uncover such bugs at design\r\ntime by statically checking whether the program is appropriately\r\nfollowing the desired protocols, thereby ruling out the wide class of\r\nsoftware flaws.  The new language mechanisms will be general purpose,\r\npractical, and suitable for use in a wide variety of applications\r\nranging from memory management to traditional protocol implementation.\r\nThe researchers will create a compiler infrastructure prototype and\r\nestablish the correctness of the approach by a machine-checked proof of\r\ntype soundness.  The primary broader impact of the project is the\r\ndevelopment of technology to help eliminate such programming errors\r\nearly in the software-design life cycle to decrease the cost of building\r\ncorrect, reliable software.",
