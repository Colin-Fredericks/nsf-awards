 "awd_abstract_narration": "The identity, activity, and longevity of plant cells is largely governed by the assortment of proteins they contain.  The synthesis of proteins is a highly orchestrated process that begins in the cell nucleus with gene transcription and continues in the cytoplasm following messenger RNA (mRNA) export from the nucleus.  In the cytoplasm, an mRNA may be stable or unstable, and may be sequestered or actively translated by ribosomes into protein. The stability or translation of mRNAs in multicellular plants also depends on developmental or environmental signals.  The goal of this project is to clarify how this cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulation occurs, and specifically to analyze the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in these processes.  In this Arabidopsis 2010 project, three research groups will collaborate to characterize the specific roles of more than 40 RBPs.  A major focus is to identify the mRNAs that are bound by specific a RBP in an RNA-protein (RNP) complex, and to identify other proteins within the RNP complex.  In addition, select RBPs will be analyzed for their roles in developmental networks and in dynamic responses to changes in cellular status due to environmental stress. The study will include functional analyses of RBPs through use of mutants. Methods will include deep sequencing of the mRNAs associated with specific RBPs and identification of the mRNA sequences recognized by the RBPs. These studies will combine advanced bioinformatic, molecular and genetic approaches. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broader impacts from this project fall into three areas.  First, the project will engage graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in state-of-the art technologies in molecular and cellular biology as well as bioinformatics.  In addition, undergraduate researchers will be mentored in research projects, and scientists and teachers will be provided summer workshops on cellular mechanisms of gene expression.  Second, the outcomes of the research will be made available to the larger scientific community through the establishment of a web site (Plant mRNP-Net), which will allow mRNA-protein network mining and include resources for educators.  Third, the project will work directly with The Leonardo, a Utah science museum, to assist in development of a classroom demonstration linked to the 9th grade curriculum.",

These processes were considered under several environmental constraints, including a deficiency of oxygen (hypoxia), limited phosphorous, cold temperatures and drought, using the model plant Arabidopsis. Here we summarize four examples of our outcomes. (1) The single- and double-stranded RNA binding protein Cold Shock Domain 1 (CSP1) was shown to rise in abundance under environmental stresses, increasing the proportion of a subset of transcripts with translating ribosomes under stress conditions. (2) Arabidopsis Pumilio family (APUM) RNA binding proteins. Study of the APUMs focused on plant-specific family members. The analyses included prediction of APUM binding motifs, evaluation of phenotypes associated with disruption or altered expression of APUMs, assessment of APUM location within cells, and investigation of APUM-bound mRNAs. (3) RNA helicases related to the DHH1 class of yeast. This included use of mutants to identify biological importance, assessment of sub-cellular localization, and consideration of interaction with other proteins and mRNAs. The results support the hypothesis that these proteins in the destabilization of mRNAs during development and in response to environmental stimuli.  (4) Detailed study of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms critical to survival of transient hypoxia, key to development and survival of floods. We showed that hypoxia causes a rapid but reversible gathering of most mRNAs into cytoplasmic aggregates that limits their translation into protein by ribosomes. A RNA binding protein called Oligouridylate Binding Protein 1C (UBP1C) was identified as responsible for this change in mRNA status. Through precise mapping of the position of individual ribosomes on mRNAs by a method called ribosome footprint profiling, we found that mRNAs elevated in abundance by hypoxia and critical for survival of the stress avoided capture by UBP1C. These mRNAs were produced by genes regulated by a specific transcription factor that is stabilized as oxygen levels decline within plant cells. This hints at coordination of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes during hypoxia.\n\nThe development and dissemination of methods and analyses pipelines was an essential component of our project. These included protocols for pur..."
