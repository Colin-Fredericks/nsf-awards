The proposed work has two main objectives: (1) to provide theoretical and numerical analyses critical for the development of the dynamic slip nucleation and propagation experiment at DUSEL Homestake; (2) to conduct field studies in order to locate existing faults and joints suitable for reactivation, nucleation, and propagation of dynamic slip within the scope of the proposed experimental facility.  Understanding these faults and fractures is critical for DUSEL project planning.",
