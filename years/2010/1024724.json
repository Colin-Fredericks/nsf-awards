 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a series of workshops held each year around the country.  These workshops bring together leading scholars as well as junior scientists who are working on cutting edge problems in mathematical economics and on new statistical techniques for the analysis of economic data. The specific workshop topics are Bayesian Inference, Time Series, Forecasting, Microeconometrics, Decentralization, and General Equilbrium.  Each workshop meets once per year, with a particular focus on younger scholars and scholars who have not previously presented in this workshop series.\r\n\r\nThe conference series makes special efforts to promote learning by young scholars.  Because each workshop meets at a different location each year, students at a wide variety of host institutions and neighboring institutions are able to attend the workshops at no cost. Other broader impacts include the interdisciplinary importance of new statistical methods for data analysis and research that has led to new insights into regulatory policy, the organization of financial markets, and the evaluation of social and economic policy.",
