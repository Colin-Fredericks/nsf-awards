 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Texas A&M University ADVANCE IT project is to double the percentage of tenured women faculty in STEM disciplines in the next five years and increase the number and diversity of women STEM faculty at all levels at the institution.  To this end, the project will organize activities related to gender equity around three major themes that include climate change activities, success enhancement activities and recruitment and retention activities.  Collectively, these activities will be implemented with significant input from campus leaders who have formed a strategic collaboration that bridges engineering, science and social science disciplines and builds on previous ADVANCE accomplishments at other institutions.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  The Texas A&M ADVANCE IT proposal is based on the psychologically healthy workplace model, which was established by the American Psychological Association and is expected to improve recruitment, reduce attrition and promote the success of STEM women faculty.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  As a result of the proposed collaborative activity between this project and that at Prairie View A&M, the Texas A&M ADVANCE IT project has the potential to broadly impact women faculty in the STEM disciplines beyond its own campus to other campuses within the same system.  Additionally, this project also focuses on raising awareness of implicit bias with students and staff at the institution.  In doing so, this project will serve to impact new audiences that have been underserved by the ADVANCE community.",
