 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this collaborative award is to elucidate the properties of natural fibers grown in a controlled environment and retted to form structural fibers through environmentally benign methods.  The research is focused on examing the effect of cross sectional architectures in fibers and their impact on fiber properties.  Modeling of the fiber properties and their introduction into compostable thermoplastic biopolymers will be conducted.  We will conduct mechanical testing and micromechanics modeling to enable a comprehensive basis for design of natural fiber composites.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the baseline developed through this investigation will form a blueprint for a new class of fibers.  The natural high resilience that plants show will be brought to bear new composites.  The impact of the effort is both immediate in the increased understanding of what improves the properties of natural fiber based compostable structures but in long term development of fiber composites.  The project will bring collaborative partnerships between University of Texas at Dallas and University of North Texas in Denton and enhanced interdisciplinary experiences for students in plant biology, materials characterization, and mechanics.  Outreach partnerships between the two institutions and Society of Women Engineer chapters will be conducted.",
