This abuse occurs for a long time and on repeated occasions (an average of about 45 times per victim in one recent study).

However, this type of offending abuse can be amenable to treatment. Treatment is the best way to prevent future abuse and help victims. The unbalanced policy attention may be because familial sexual abuse is considered \"low risk.\"\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, sexual abuse within the family unit &ndash; known as intrafamilial offending &ndash; is more likely to be unreported given the family relationship. Offenders who are identified as having sexually assaulted their biological children are sometimes deemed eligible for alternative sentencing. Diversion programs divert offenders from punitive prison terms and into specialized treatment and monitoring programs that are aimed at preventing future abuse.

They also helped refine long-debated questions about child sexual offender typology, suggesting that nonbiological father offenders should be grouped with biological father offenders rather than extrafamilial offenders. The absolute re-offense rates and length of protracted abuse within our sample attested to the importance of considering intrafamilial offenders within the population of child sexual offenders.\n\n \n\nThis research provided a unique opportunity to bring valuable insight to prevent recidiv..."
