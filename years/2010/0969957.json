 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the \"21st Century Astronomy Ambassadors Program : A summer academy for high school students at University of Texas at Brownsville\". The program supports high school students from the Texas Lower Rio Grande Valley (TRGV) who will become actively involved in research of modern astronomy including gravitational wave (GW) astronomy at the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB). The goal of the summer academy is to introduce young local high school students to physics and astronomy as an exciting field of study. Students who have an interest in science will gain exposure to university research and also a first hand knowledge of cutting edge research done by the Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (CGWA). Between 12-16 high school students will be given the opportunity to work directly with faculty and staff of the CGWA. The students will spend 30 hours a week at summer academy for a four week period. During the summer academy students will take theoretical classes as well as have laboratory hands-on experience. By the end of the summer the students will present their work in a forum where family, faculty and the media could be present. They are subsequently expected to get involved in research in association with the CGWA faculty members.",
