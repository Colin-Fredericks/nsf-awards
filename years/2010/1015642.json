  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe human circulatory system is responsible for pumping blood to all areas of the human body.  Blood carries oxygen and other nutrients which are necessary for tissues to function.  The delivery of these nutrients to the brain is especially important, as only a few minutes without blood flow is enough to permanently damage brain tissue.  This loss of brain function is known as a stroke.  Strokes are a major cause of death and disability, so the understanding of how blood flows in the brain is of prime importance.  \n\nThe human circulatory system has a number of built-in mechanisms that aid in preventing strokes.  This project dealt with developing a computer model of autoregulation, the phenomena where blood vessels increase in size when blood flow is decreased.  This increase in size allows more blood to flow through and increases the amount of oxygen and other nutrients delivered to tissue.  \n\nThe difficulty with creating a computer model of autoregulation is that it requires one to model the behavior of hundreds of millions of blood vessels at once.  There are multiple equations to be solved for each vessel, and solving them all requires the use of a supercomputer, a computer containing thousands of processors which work together simultaneously to solve these equations.  My work involved programming this supercomputer so it could solve the hundreds of millions equations as efficiently as possible.  In 2 months of work, I was able to modify a blood vessel autoregulation code to run roughly 50 times faster than it did previously.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William B Cousins"
