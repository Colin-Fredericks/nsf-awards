 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and nucleons (particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their interactions at low energies.  The strong and weak interactions are responsible for the structure of matter at the smallest known scale, a femtometer (size of the hydrogen atom nucleus) or less.  The research is motivated by the fact that the present comprehensive theory -- the Standard Model (SM) -- is known to be incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe rare decay of the pi-meson (pion) into an electron and a neutrino, occurring once in about ten thousand ordinary pion decays, provides a theoretically extraordinarily clean window to certain possible extensions of the SM, at a very large mass scale not directly accessible at any existing or planned accelerators.  The PEN experiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an international collaboration of seven institutions led by the University of Virginia (UVa) group, builds on the success of the PIBETA experiment which improved by about an order of magnitude the accuracy of several rare decay modes of the pion and muon (a massive relative of the electron) in a series of measurements finished in 2004.  A new project, encompassing experiments \"Nab\" and \"abBA,\" has been initiated at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, with the aim to measure simultaneously and precisely several key parameters of neutron beta decay.  Through their precision, these experiments will explore similarly interesting possible extensions to the SM.\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years this program has resulted in four doctoral degrees at UVa.  Three UVa Ph.D. students are currently working towards their theses.  Each year typically one to two undergraduate students are engaged in research on this project, thus gaining practical laboratory experience.",

The apparatus used is shown schematically in figure 1.  Over 22 million &pi;e2 events were recorded, as well as over 200 million muon decay events, to be used as normalization.  PEN data analysis is currently under way.  The branching ratio (probability) of the &pi;e2 decay is extremely sensitive to certain physics processes not included in the Standard Model (SM) of particles and fields.  This work is complementary to direct searches at the LHC at CERN. The PEN experiment, located at the Paul Scherrer Institute's Ring Accelerator in Villigen, Switzerland,is a collaboration of 7 institutions from 5 countries, led by the University of Virginia (UVa) group.\nDetailed Monte Carlo simulation, design and putting out to bid of a complex magneto-electrostatic spectrometer for precision measurement of the electron-neutrino correlation parameter \"a\" in neutron beta decay, for the Nab experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Tennessee.  All of these tasks have been successfully accomplished: the spectrometer is under construction by Cryogenic Ltd., dedicated Si detectors have been demonstrated to detect 30 keV protons, and the data acquisition system has been selected. All of the equipment is planned to become available for commissioning at the SNS in late 2015 or early 2016.  Actual measurements are planned for the 2016-2019 period.  The Nab experiment goal for the precision of the electron-neutrino angular correlation measurement  in neutron beta decay (n  &rarr; p + e + &nu;) is &Delta;a/a = 0.1%.  Nab also aims to measure \"b\", the Fierz interference term, a tiny distortion of the electron energy spectrum in neutron beta decay, so far not measured, at the precision of &Delta;b = 0.003.  The parameter b vanishes in the Standard Model.  Both measurements of a and b at the goal precision would severely oonstrain possible particles and processes beyond the SM.  Nab is a collaboration of 5 US research groups with 3 groups from abroad, led by the UVa and ORNL groups.\n\n\nAdditional preparatory work, including design and construction of prototype equipment, was completed for a new experiment, Fermilab E989, which aims to measure \"g &ndash; 2\", the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon.\n\nResults of this work have been presented in 5 journal articles, 9 conference proceedings and other published reports, and were presented at over 20 scientific meetings both in the US and abroad, by researchers supported by this NSF research award.
