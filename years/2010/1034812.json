 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Energy Efficient Systems will focus on optimizing energy utilization in electronic systems. SUNY at Binghamton, the University of Illinois, the University of Texas at Arlington and Georgia Tech are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with SUNY at Binghamton as the lead institution \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. Problem-oriented research related to Thermal Management and Protocols, Software Systems, Control Systems, and Implementation, will be addressed during the Center's first five year program. \r\n\r\nThe proposed center will enable a significant reduction in energy consumption in electronic systems, including data centers, thereby potentially reducing electrical power consumption across the nation. This will, in turn, reduce the nations consumption of carbon-based fuels and related emissions. The center will attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, by providing industrially-relevant training required by graduates entering the workforce. The center intends to leverage existing programming on its campuses to engage K-12 students in conversation on energy conservation, and is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups.",
