The instrumentation will be used to support research activities and education programs in (1) topographical imaging of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) thin films; (2) characterizing diffusion of lipid bilayer membranes on PEM films; (3) probing of ion channels in bilayer membranes; (4) studying the distribution, diffusion and aggregation of toxins in cell membranes; and (5) imaging the response of cell surfaces to shear stress.\r\n\r\nSoft interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, especially in biological systems.  The microscopy and spectroscopy tools that Wheaton College will acquire with support from this award will allow these young scientists and their students to investigate a number of interesting problems, lying at the interface of physics, chemistry and biology.  Results from this work may lead in years to come to a better understanding of how cells interact with their environment.  The young researchers working with the PIs will receive excellent training in the use of state-of-the-art research equipment.  \r\n\r\n",

This program was aimed at providing scientific opportunities for first-generation college-bound, low-income or African-American or Latino students from the Chicagoland area.  Use of the instrumentation in advanced Analytical and Physical Chemistry teaching laboratories expanded the impact of research to many dozens of students each year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Burden"
