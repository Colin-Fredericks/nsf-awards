 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project is to understand how specific organs synchronize with the brain and the external environment during embryonic development.  The first aim supports this objective through a systematic analysis of when during tadpole development the eye, ear, nose, heart, and kidney display a fully functional circadian rhythm.  Molecular approaches will be used to illustrate time of day-dependent changes in gene expression in developing organs to establish when during development they exhibit a mature circadian rhythm.  Another long term objective is to ask whether circadian rhythm is necessary for proper organ development.  Somites are blocks of tissue that are formed in pairs on each side of the developing spinal cord at regular intervals during vertebrate development.  They form the muscle and skin of the back and vertebrae in the adult.  The second aim supports the long term objectives by using a molecular genetic approach to decrease or increase the amount of xNOCTURNIN protein available in the cells of the early embryo and analyze for affects on somite formation and segmentation.  The result will shed light on whether genes like xNocturnin may have other functions during early development apart from controlling circadian physiology.  Successful completion of these experiments over three years will provide training and summer income for 8-12 undergraduates in the area of Developmental and Molecular Biology.",
