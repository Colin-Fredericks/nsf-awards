 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site program will engage 10 undergraduate students for 10 summer weeks each year in meaning and timely research focused on automotive and energy-related problems that have a direct impact on U.S. energy consumption, climate change issues and related national security issues. A special emphasis will be placed on technologies that aim to improve efficiencies of internal combustion engines, automotive manufacturing processes, automotive materials, alternative propulsion systems and lubrication and wear. In addition, another focus area will be on research that aims to improve the reliability of gearboxes in general and wind turbine gearboxes in general. \r\n\r\nKey features of this REU Site program include: 1) a unique three-tier mentorship program, that involves faculty, industrial mentors and graduates; 2) a strong commitment from several automotive and component manufacturers (General Motors, Chrysler, SKF USA) and individuals with extensive industrial experience to provide mentorship to the students and access to laboratory and industrial facilities; and 3) learning, networking and peer support opportunities through coordinated professional activities such as, industry and lab tours, seminars, interactions with professionals from industry, oral presentations and the opportunity to attend and/or present research findings at a conference. \r\n\r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? \r\nIn order to promote the participation of women and minorities in engineering, this REU program will recruit at least four of the ten students from underrepresented groups, with a particular focus on recruiting women into the program. Efforts will also be made to increase the number of minority student applicants and specific efforts will be made to recruit minority students from southeastern Michigan, as well as from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) nationwide. Research and outreach results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles.  Also, information about the program activities will be placed online and made available to the entire community.\r\n\r\n\"This REU site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\"",
