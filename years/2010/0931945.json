 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is a research infrastructure for the mathematical sciences that focuses on interdisciplinary research.  Its goal is to develop transformative mathematical research and to strengthen the workforce engaged in interdisciplinary research involving mathematics.  The IMA also serves to provide mathematical expertise to academia, industry, and government, and to communicate the importance of mathematics to the public.  The IMA accomplishes these goals through a variety of programs and activities. Its annual program draws a large and diverse community of scientists to the IMA's extremely collaborative environment.  Long-term visitors and postdoctoral fellows form the intellectual anchor of the Institute. Shorter-term visitors come for week-long workshops organized by scientific leaders. The focus of an annual program is set either on an application where mathematics is poised to make important contributions, or on a branch of mathematics and its diverse applications.  The IMA's annual program is complemented by a variety of thematically independent initiatives, including workshops on rapidly developing areas, outreach activities, and educational programs.  The IMA vigorously seeks to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in its activities.\r\n\r\nThe IMA is a national research institute which hosts scientific visitors from a variety of backgrounds at its Minneapolis location to conduct research in a highly collaborative environment.  These visitors include postdoctoral fellows and established researchers who spend extended periods, as well as those that participate for short programs.  The annually changing research focus draws these participants to the Institute.  The IMA offers educational and training programs for mathematical scientists at various stages of their careers.  It sponsors scientific activities at its partner institutions' sites.  IMA programs involve many branches of mathematics and address a wide range of applied disciplines.  The IMA is a center for industrial mathematics that offers companies valuable resources through its programs and vast connections. The IMA's diverse programs address the US national needs and positively impact on the nation's economic competitiveness. The institute is a mathematical sciences infrastructure that contributes to the health, prosperity, and security of the nation.",
