 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Amy Prieto and Matthew Shores at Colorado State University for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on chemical research applied to \"real world problems.\"  Sample projects include:  (1)  the synthesis and study highly distensible hydrogels with tailored-response capabilities; (2)  the study of polymerization and depolymerization reactions in areas with impact on sustainability; (3)  fundamental studies of light-matter interactions applied to areas of critical need like dye-sensitized solar cells; (4)  the study of the efficient synthesis of complex molecules with useful chemical or biological properties; (5)  the study of the complex chemistry in low temperature plasmas, like those used in material processing environments ; (6)  the study of the self-assembly of complex proteins; (7) the spectroscopic study of molecules at surfaces and in confined environments; (9) the development of new ways to synthesize nanoscale materials with useful properties; and (10) the design, synthesis and characterization of inorganic coordination compounds with tailored magnetic and electronic properties .   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities.  Students will be recruited from a large number of institutions across the country, including a number of schools that are minority-serving.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The research projects are in areas of chemistry that will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",
