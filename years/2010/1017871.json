 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, there has been an isolation of responsibilities of\r\nphysical layer (PHY) and higher layers of the network stack leading to\r\nsevere inefficiencies in bandwidth-limited wireless\r\nnetworks. Remedying these inefficiencies requires rethinking and\r\nredesigning wireless protocols such that higher layers and PHY work in\r\nsynergy. This project explores three schemes under the PHY-Informed\r\nNetworking (PHY-IN) framework. 1) Carrier Sense Multiple Access with\r\nCollision Notification (CSMA/CN) mechanism detects and aborts\r\ncollisions, breaking away from the existing collision avoidance\r\n(CSMA/CA) based schemes such as 802.11. 2) Constellation BAsed Rate\r\n(CBAR) adaptation scheme jumps to the best feasible rate suitable for\r\na varying channel. 3) Remap scheme permutes bit-to-subcarrier\r\nassignment for a retransmission to improve the chances of its success.\r\nThe PHY-IN framework has the potential to impact the landscape of\r\nfuture wireless networking protocols. Apart from mentoring both\r\nundergraduate and graduate students into independent researchers, this\r\nproject, involving an EPSCoR university and a research lab, will also\r\nhelp broaden the participation and industry collaboration.",
