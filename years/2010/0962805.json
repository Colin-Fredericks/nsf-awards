 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Math and Science Partnership project brings together forty-two rural Maine schools, the University of Maine, three Maine non-profits with expertise in science education, and science and technology leaders at the Maine Department of Education to target the teaching and learning of physical sciences in grades 6-9. The partnership research is aimed at gathering information on effective science curricula and pedagogy for working in rural communities. This project focuses on the identification and implementation of proven curricular resources and the full range of critical supports needed for their successful implementation. The Partnership implements research-supported curricula and intensive professional development for teachers using the new curricula. Pre-service teachers of science from the University of Maine and partnering universities participate in curriculum selection and professional development, and also work as teaching partners in the classroom to implement the curriculum. The implementation involves approximately 9800 students and 100 teachers and exposes teachers to 100 hours of professional development over two years. The project provides direct services to the participating districts, builds a regional infrastructure for ongoing improvement in STEM education and contributes to a designed research effort that will inform future rural educational initiatives.",

What was originally the MainePSP has grown through an iterative process of development, with investments in infrastructure leading to new opportunities and additional funding. At the same time, the inclusion of diverse stakeholders through responsive, evidence-guided governance structures has led to key decisions that expanded the reach and scope of the MainePSP far beyond what was originally envisioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Currently, the MainePSP continues beyond grant funding as the Maine STEM Partnership, fostered by the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education (RiSE Center) at the University of Maine. The Maine STEM Partnership brings together over 1,000 Maine educators, education researchers, and pre-service teachers to improve STEM education for students at all levels, with education research informing education practices, and education practices informing research. In 2016-17 alone, the Maine STEM Partnership impacted over 29,000 students across 160 schools, 101 school districts, and the University of Maine.</p>\n<p>Since 2010, the MainePSP and the Maine STEM Partnership have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built a professional community for STEM educators that reduced rural isolation for PK-12 teachers, increased connections between University STEM faculty and PK-12 teachers, and increased the use of active learning strategies at both PK-12 and University levels. This partnership grew to include PK-16+ educators, education researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, STEM faculty, and staff.</li>\n<li>Developed teacher leadership in the PK-12 community, supporting teachers in taking on new roles both within the partnership and within their schools and districts. </li>\n<li>Selected and supported adoption of vertically-aligned and standards-aligned science instructional resources for PK-9 classrooms. These materials were adopted across districts in our local-control state, providing opportunities for extensive and on-going summer and academic year cross-district professional development and sharing of resources.</li>\n<li>Fostered partnerships between education researchers and educators leading to evidence-based professional development focused on content knowledge, scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, knowledge of student ideas, and responsive classroom practices.</li>\n<li>Carried out education research leading to 495 presentations and publications to disseminate findings and results nationally and internationally, while building a vibrant education research community comprised of faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, pre-service teachers, educators, and collaborators. </li>\n<li>Hired additional education research faculty and staff at the University of Maine, building the capacity of the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education and the University of Maine to support education and education research.</li>\n<li>Developed, implemented, and iterated programs to improve pre-service STEM teacher recruitment, preparation, and induction into teaching, leading to additional grant funding for ongoing work</li>\n<li>Conducted hundreds of observations of University courses by K-12 teachers through the University Classroom Observation Program (UCOP), providing valuable feedback to University faculty while supporting teachers&rsquo; professional development.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key outcomes of the MainePSP include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements in the quality of classroom lessons, as observed by the project&rsquo;s external evaluators, Inverness Research.</li>\n<li>Improvements in student achievement, as measured on the science Maine Educational Assessments in grades 5 and 8 and in embedded MainePSP assessments.</li>\n<li>Improvements in student attitudes, as measured on the science Maine Educational Assessments in grades 5 and 8 and in MainePSP surveys.</li>\n<li>Increased time spent learning science for students in PK-5.</li>\n<li>Increased retention and positive experiences for students in University STEM courses.</li>\n<li>Increased professionalism and leadership for PK-12 teachers as well as improved content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge.</li>\n<li>Increased opportunities for education research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students to conduct research within an interdisciplinary research community, strongly connected to the educator community. </li>\n<li>New opportunities for undergraduates to participate in education research and gain valuable professional experiences in University and PK-12 classrooms. </li>\n<li>Enrichment of the graduate student experience through innovative arrangements that integrate pre-service teachers into the education research and educator communities. </li>\n<li>Creation of a cost-effective rental and delivery system for districts to use the vertically-aligned and standards-aligned instructional resources selected by the partnership. </li>\n<li>Development of processes for evidence-based decision-making that empower the professional community of educators and education researchers, including Task Forces to review and recommend instructional resources, a Curriculum Modification Review Board to consider proposed additions or modifications to resources, a research and evaluation infrastructure that uses extensive data collection and analysis to inform implementation, professional development, and classroom practice, and a Leadership Team representing diverse stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, the MainePSP built infrastructure that has been successful in improving science and STEM education in Maine, while building on a shared foundation of education research, teacher leadership development, and a community that brings multiple stakeholders together in decision-making.
