Diversity values are often rooted in different rationales about why it is important for minorities and women to be represented in organizations and decision making (e.g. productivity, legal, moral). These differential rationales may vary in perceived legitimacy, resistance by majority group members, and potential to promote social change. This study uses experimental methods to explore social psychological hypotheses regarding how diversity rationales influence behavior toward minority group members during collaborative decision making tasks. Participants first view a video with messages and imagery that indirectly expose them to one of four diversity rationales. They then collaborate with a small racially heterogeneous group to resolve a number of organizational scenarios. Data are collected through an interactive computer program that records patterns in the decision making process and administers survey questions throughout the task. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe findings will inform a growing debate about the conditions under which expanding diversity creates more inclusive organizational environments and improves intergroup relations.  The results can be used by leaders to better evaluate alternative policies, structural features, legal strategies, and training mechanisms that seek to institutionalize the value of diversity. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the conditions under which growing diversity in organizations (e.g. racial/ethnic, gender, class) has positive rather than negative consequences is a critical challenge for the twenty first century.  This two part study used cutting edge experimental methods to help us better understand (1) how inequality operates in organizations; (2) whether common diversity efforts are likely to reduce inequality by balancing group dynamics, reducing stereotypes and facilitating more equitable interaction; and (3) when diversity efforts may lead to positive outcomes.  Both laboratory and survey-based experiments show that inclusive organizational diversity values can lead to resistance that exacerbates existing inequality.\n\nIn Study 1, when a value of diversity was endorsed using an inclusive narrative and multiracial symbolism, minority teammates received lower evaluations, less deference, and were less likely to be selected as team leader than in control conditions.  Thus, inclusive diversity values may face challenges and while there may appear to be general buy-in to diversity efforts, significant resentment may pervade everyday interaction on an informal level. Study 2 results revealed that the framing of the inclusive diversity values does moderate the effect on attitudes and behavior.   For example, diversity values are often rooted in different rationales about why it is important for minorities and women to be represented in organizations and decision making (e.g. performance, legal, moral).  These different rationales may vary in perceived legitimacy, resistance by majority group members, and potential to promote social change.  While inclusive values emphasizing the business benefits of diversity such as profit and innovation were found to hinder inclusion, legal frameworks that made civil rights law salient were more likely to facilitate inclusive behavior and support for diversity.  Participants exposed to antidiscrimination law were more likely to acknowledge institutional bias, express a value of diversity, and recommend a minority candidate for promotion than those exposed to a business case for diversity. \n\nThese research findings inform a growing debate about the conditions under which expanding diversity actually creates more inclusive organizational environments and improves intergroup relations.  As organizations become increasingly diverse, results can be used by leaders to better evaluate alternative policies, structural features, legal strategies, and training mechanisms that seek to promote the value of diversity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jamillah E Bowman"
