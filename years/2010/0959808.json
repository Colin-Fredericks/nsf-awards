 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nIn order for astronomers to have the highest possible resolution to detect objects of the smallest angular size, they require large telescopes, or they combine the light from telescopes that are separated from one another.  As the separation between the telescopes increases, so does the ability to resolve finer details. The largest platform that is currently in use for astronomy is the earth itself.  Radio astronomers use radio telescopes that are spread by thousands of miles in what is called the Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA).  A large number of important scientific problems are investigated with the VLBA which also provides an important service in determining the positions and motions of objects on the sky, a branch of astronomy called astrometry.  Astrometry is important for all astronomers, but it also serves commercial and defense interests for satellite navigation and calibration of the GPS system. \r\n \r\nRadio astronomers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) have realized that they can significantly increase the sensitivity of the VLBA by adding computing power and data storage capabilities to the signal processing equipment that correlates the signals from the telescopes.  Their work, sponsored by the National Science Foundation's Major Research Instrumentation program, will allow scientists to see fainter objects to probe farther and deeper into space. It will also allow them to improve the accuracy of measurements made for astrometry.  The work will be led by Dr. R. Craig Walker of NRAO in Socorro, NM.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is a facility of the National\nScience Foundation that is part of the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory (NRAO), which is managed by Associated Universities Inc\n(AUI).  The VLBA was built for very high resolution radio astronomy\nand astrometry.  It is used by astronomers from throughout the world\nwith observing projects selected on the basis of the quality of their\nscientific proposals.  The array has 10 antennas of 25m diameter each,\nspread across the United States from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands.\nThe raw signals at each antenna are recorded on hard disk drives and\nshipped to Socorro, New Mexico.  There a computer cluster known as a\ncorrelator is used to combine the signals from all possible pairs of\nantennas to determine the interference patterns (fringes).\n\nThose fringes are used to make images and to measure accurate\npositions (astrometry).  The image resolution is better than 0.001\narcseconds, far higher even than the 0.04 arcsecond resolution of the\nHubble Space Telescope, let alone the roughly 60 arcsecond resolution\nof the human eye.  For measurements of the relative positions of\nsources that are less than a few degrees apart on the sky, accuracies\non the order of 0.00001 arcseconds can be achieved.  With the help of\ndistant calibration sources, such as quasars, the distance to closer\nobjects can be measured using triangulation based on the slight\nchanges in their apparent position caused by the motion of the Earth\naround the Sun.  This is the parallax method.  It is the gold standard\nof astronomical distance measurements because it relies solely on pure\ngeometry and is not dependent on complex models of the target objects.\nIt has long been used optically to measure the distances to nearby\nstars, but the additional accuracy of the VLBA allows parallax\ndistance measurements to be made for objects throughout our galaxy.\nAlso, since the VLBA works at radio frequencies, it can make such\nmeasurements of objects in star formation regions that are obscured\noptically by dust.  The astrometric accuracy of the VLBA also allows\ntransverse motions to be measured, which, combined with Doppler\nmeasurements of spectral lines from gas or stars, allows the 3D\nmotions of nearby galaxies to be measured.\n\nThe usefulness of the high resolution imaging and precision astrometry\ndepends on being able to observe a significant number of objects.  For\nexample, distances to nearby star formation regions can be measured\nwith an accuracy near 1 percent, far better than possible with other\ntechniques.  Such distances are critical for understanding the physics\nof star formation because all energy measurements depend on the square\nof the distance.  But the parallax distances are measured to stars\nthat have weak radio emission.  The current VLBA sensitivity is\nsufficient to measure a few such stars and very interesting initial\nresults have been obtained.  But an increase in sensitivity of even a\nfactor of a few would allow many more stars to be observed, providing\ndistances to many more regions and providing the 3D structure of\nnearby regions with multiple stars.  In fact, nearly all areas of\nscience done using the VLBA will benefit from an increase in\nsensitivity.\n\nThere is an on-going project to increase the sensitivity of the VLBA\nby a factor of about 3 for all observations of broad-band sources by\nincreasing the bandwidth.  That would be equivalent to increasing\nthe sizes of the antennas from 25m to 43m.  The major elements of the\nupgrade are new digital electronics at the antennas to process more\nbandwidth, a new recording system to allow more bits per second to be\nrecorded, and a new software correlator that can deal with all of\nthose bits, while providing a variety of enhanced capabilities\ncompared to the old correlator.  These engineering developments have\nbeen funded internally by NRAO operations and by AUI.  The most\nexpensive aspect of the upgrade is simply the purchase of all the hard\ndisk drives need..."
