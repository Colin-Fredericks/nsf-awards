 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research team will investigate the fundamental causes of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using simulations of solar active region formation by flux emergence from the convection zone into the corona. To accomplish their goals, the team members will utilize a new magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code being developed by the Center for Radiation Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) at the University of Michigan. \r\n\r\nThis CRASH code adds radiation transport and advance treatment of the equation-of-state to the MHD capabilities of existing models developed at Michigan, and will allow the simulation of flux emergence from a turbulent convection zone to the corona in a single computational domain. The Principal Investigator of this project will incorporate this numerical flux emergence component in Michigan's Space Weather Modeling Framework, in order to couple the solar-active-region-scale model to a global-scale coronal model extending to the Earth. The model's predictions will be compared to observations made at different levels in the solar atmosphere, including plasma flow fields in the convection zone determined with helioseismology, flow fields in the corona determined with Dopplergrams, and magnetic fields measured at the photosphere with vector magnetographs.\r\n\r\nThis new coupled modeling system will address a key National Space Weather Program objective by simulating magnetic flux emerging from the convection zone into the solar corona, erupting and then propagating as a CME into interplanetary space. It thus spans the space weather forecasting domain from Sun to Earth. This research will also support undergraduate and graduate education. Specifically, the requested funding will primarily support a graduate student, while research results will be incorporated into courses in the Department of Atmospheric, Ocean, and Space Science at the University of Michigan.",

However, our simulations are the first of the coupled system of convection zone, photosphere and corona, which illustrate these multiple processes working simultaneously in the presence of convection to transfer the magnetic flux and energy from the solar interior to convection zone.  Our research, for the first time, shows how the complex features of active regions that give rise to solar eruptions are produced and also illustrate the energetic connection between the solar interior and the corona in a realistic way.  \n\nMajor Findings\n\nNumerical simulations were performed of magnetic fields buoyantly emerging through the solar atmosphere. The simulations were performed with a realistic numerical model that simultaneously describes the convection zone, photosphere transition region and corona with the use of radiation loss terms, non-ideal equations of state, and empirical corona heating.  The model achieved the following results.  \n\n\n \n\nWe simulated the rise of the magnetic flux from a near-surface granular convection zone into the low corona and illustrate the complex interaction of magnetic fields with the turbulent convection and the formation of an ephemeral region.  Near-surface convection distorts and deforms the magnetic flux, intense magnetic fields form in the convective downdrafts where flux converges. \n\n\n \n\nPhotospheric flux concentrations (sunspots and pores) form on the scale convective down flows in the convection zone, which determine the bipolar structure of the emerged solar active region, while near-surface convective collapse intensifies the strength of magnetic fields.\n\n\n \n\nAn analyses of the buildup of coronal free magnetic energy was performed.  It is found that at the polarity inversion line (PIL), shear flows driven by the Lorentz force draw the magnetic fields parallel to the PIL while converging motions near the PIL concentrates the magnetic field and leads to tether-cutting reconnection, which in turn transfers the free magnetic energy higher into the corona. \n\n\n \n\nA comparison of a simulation is made with observations of active region (AR) 11158, which produced a fast CME and X-class flare. In both cases, strong magnetic and velocity shear, intensification of horizontal field strength, and concentration of free magnetic energy in the low corona are found to occur.

Most important, unlike earlier works these simulation incorporated magnetic convection, which shows the robustness of these physical proc..."
