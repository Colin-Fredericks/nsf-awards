 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with gravity wave drag (GWD) parameterization in climate models, particularly for climate change forecasts. Gravity waves influence the global circulation of the atmosphere by transporting momentum between and within the troposphere and stratosphere, but are too small to be adequately resolved in state-of-the-art climate models. Hence their effects are estimated, or parameterized, based on the resolved variables of the model. Recent studies have demonstrated that uncertainty in how GWD is parameterized has a first order impact on both the tropospheric and stratospheric response to anthropogenic forcing. Existing studies of parameterizations, largely performed \"offline\" with fixed background winds, are insufficient to quantify these uncertainties, as the impact of GWD is amplified by interaction with synoptic and planetary waves. To redress these concerns, the investigators will establish a framework for testing GWD parameterizations in an idealized general circulation model (GCM).\r\n\r\nThe idealized GCM captures the stratospheric and tropospheric circulation with fidelity, but with computational efficiency that permits us to systematically assess the impact of GWD parameters on a changing climate, driven both by trends in the troposphere (i.e. tropical upper tropospheric warming) and stratosphere (i.e. the cooling/heating of the polar vortex associated with ozone loss/recovery). The investigators will use the model to understand the influence of GWD on (1) trends in the tropospheric circulation, in particular shifts in the extratropical jet streams, (2) trends in the stratospheric circulation, in particular the Brewer-Dobson Circulation, and (3) stratospheric climate and variability.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research are (1) to help improve understanding and confidence in climate change forecasts, (2) to educate and mentor students at the undergraduate and graduate level, and (3) to provide a more general understanding of climate forecasting. The inherent uncertainty in climate prediction is a significant problem for the scientific community in communicating with the public. This project provides a case study in how models (in particular GCMs) can be used to quantify uncertainty, and used for outreach directed at undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has investigated the circulation of the stratosphere, known as the Brewer-Dobson circulation, and how it is linked with surface climate.  The Brewer-Dobson circulation is a global circulation of air through the stratosphere: air upwells in the tropics and drifts poleward into both hemispheres, finally descending back into the troposphere in the extratropics.  We have developed a richer theoretical understanding of the mechanisms by which atmospheric waves couple the troposphere and the stratosphere, with practical implications for how we should interpret and can improve climate models.  \n\nIn particular, our work has helped unravel an open question about climate model projections of future circulation changes in the stratosphere.  This gives us more confidence in the ability of climate models to simulate our current climate and to project future changes.  Changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation may affect the recovery of the ozone layer and the distribution of water vapor distribution throughout the stratosphere, which in turn impact ultraviolet radiation exposure, precipitation, and temperature at the surface. \n\nThe stratosphere begins approximately 12 to 18 km above the surface, just above the top of the highest clouds.  It is thus largely uncoupled from the day-to-day weather of the troposphere, but the flow here still interacts with the surface through waves.  Planetary scale waves driven by large scale mountain chains, such as the Rocky Mountains, and smaller scale waves associated with flow over individual hills and thunderstorms, propagate up into the stratosphere.  They then break, much like ocean waves at a beach, transporting momentum from stratosphere to the troposphere, which drives the Brewer-Dobson circulation.  The large scale planetary waves can be resolved and simulated in climate models, but the smaller scale waves (known as \"gravity waves\" in the jargon of atmospheric science) cannot be accurate captured, given current limits in computation power.  Hence their affect must be approximated, or parameterized.  Our work has focused on how these parameterized waves interact with the resolved large scale waves. \n\nComprehensive climate models almost uniformly predict an increase in the stratospheric circulation in response to increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  The stratospheric circulation cannot be observed directly, however,  and the range of uncertainty around the best indirect measurements is too large to validate the models.  Some measurements have actually suggested that the circulation might be decreasing, but model trends are not outside the envelope of statistical uncertainty.\n\nThus the research community has sought to understand the mechanisms driving the increase in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, to make sure that the numerical predictions are based on a firm theoretical foundation.  Changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation are interpreted through the principle of \"downward control,\" which directly connects the circulation to momentum transported by the waves.  Some climate models suggest that the parameterized waves will dominated the changes driven by anthropogenic forcing, while others suggest that the large scale waves will be most important.   These are fundamentally different sources of wave driving, associated with very different processes.  Hence a mystery: how can models predict the same overall response, but differ so greatly on why it happens?   Until this could be resolved, there was significant concern about the quality of the model projections.\n\nOur research began on a more fundamental level, asking how parameterized waves interact with the resolved circulation in idealized atmospheric models.  We discovered that there is a great deal of interaction between the parameterized waves and the resolved waves, and explain how these interactions are governed.  In particular, we found that perturbations to the gravity wave parameterization tend to be offset, or c..."
