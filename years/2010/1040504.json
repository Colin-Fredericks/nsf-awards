 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) is an array of 23 radio telescopes located at Cedar Flat, in the Inyo Mountains of California.  The array is heterogeneous, consisting of six 10-m telescopes belonging to Caltech, nine 6-m telescopes from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association, and eight 3.5-m telescopes of The University of Chicago.  Not all telescopes currently have the capability to observe at the same wavelength or frequency bandpasses simultaneously.  The goal of being able to outfit all telescopes with receivers capable of observing at the same bandpass at the same time will soon be realized.  A collaboration between Dr. John Carpenter of  the California Institute of Technology and Dr. John Carlstrom of The University of Chicago will develop the digital correlators and receivers to fully integrate the CARMA telescopes into a single array that cross-correlates the signals from all 23 antennas simultaneously over the full 8 GHz IF bandwidth of the CARMA receivers.  This will provide significantly enhanced observing capability and will enable new discoveries in cosmology (especially the study of galaxy clusters and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) and star formation (through the study of the chemistry and kinematics of molecular gas in star-forming regions).  This work is being funded by NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program though the Division of Astronomical Sciences.",

The main scientific aims of the 1-cm receivers were twofold: (i) to make observations of the continuum (broadband) radio emission from clusters of galaxies, and (ii) to search for carbon monoxide (CO) emission from distant clusters of galaxies. \nThe first of the major aims was accomplished - the 1 cm receivers were installed - and two series of very sensitive observations that were scheduled to cover the two major scientific aims were successfully completed each of which provided the key data for a graduate student?s PhD thesis.  In the first a very distant cluster of galaxies was detected using a kind of \"shadowing\" effect in which very distant radio emission, called the cosmic microwave background radiation, is scattered by the hot electrons in an intervening cluster of galaxies.  In the second the aggregate carbon monoxide emission from clusters of galaxies was detected. This latter result must still be confirmed by other experiments, but if it is confirmed then it will open up a new way of studying cosmology - i.e. the evolution of the universe.\nThe second of the major aims had been only partially accomplished when the CARMA National Science Foundation continuation proposal was declined, ending the operation of the interferometer, but with the permission of the National Science Foundation the aim was slightly modified to make the broadband digital backend for single antenna operation rather than for an interferometric array.  This has been successfully accomplished.  The digital work established how to run high-speed digitizers, how to transfer the data to fully programmable gate arrays, and how to program these arrays to make spectra.  A third graduate student?s PhD thesis was based partially on this work.  This digital work is being released to the public and it is expected that it will be found to have useful scientific and engineering applications in other fields.\nIn addition to these direct scientific outcomes this program undertook a number of other activities aimed at bringing the work to the attention of he public and having a broader impact.  With this aim in mind the activities below were undertaken.\nA small column entitled \"Astronomy Watch\" was written for each issue of the local newspaper, The Inyo Register, which comes out 3 times per week.
