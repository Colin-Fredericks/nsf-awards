The conference is jointly organized by the Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas - Pan American and the Faculty of Mathematics, Kyushu University.  \r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on current research in integrable systems and nonlinear waves, including work in two-dimensional nonlinear wave equations and soliton interactions; nonlinear water waves; nonholonomic dynamics; nonlinear equations with randomness; integrable systems and combinatorics; nonlinear wave phenomena in nonlinear optics and physics; and applications of integrable systems in random matrix theory, physics, and engineering.  The conference features plenary talks and other invited lectures by leading researchers, as well as a poster session for presentations by students and junior researchers.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will foster the scientific interaction of an international community of scientists working in these subjects and will provide an opportunity for junior researchers in these fields to interact with more experienced researchers and scientists from Japan and other countries.  Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.math.utpa.edu/kmaruno/SPI2010.html",
