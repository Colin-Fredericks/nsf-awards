 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThe project, proposed by the regional optical network, Pacific Northwest Gigapop, will replace an ad hoc system of connections to a tier of states in the northwestern United States with a fiber-based network capable of supporting multiple gigabit connections and extending from Seattle through Minneapolis to Chicago. It will upgrade connection points that various campuses en route will be able to connect to. These add/drop points are located at Yakima, Spokane, Missoula, Bozeman, Billings, and Fargo. The partners and campuses affected include the Pacific Northwest GigaPoP (PNWGP), the University of Washington, Heritage University, Washington State University, University of Idaho, University of Montana, Montana State University, North Dakota State University, the University of Minnesota, and the Starlight facility. The renovation also includes an optical switch at a PNWGP location in Seattle that will enable advanced networking research. \r\n\r\nThis project will enable researchers to transport efficiently large amounts of data between institutions in the north-western U.S. and over the national wide-area network. This will facilitate access to high-end computational and data resources used by researchers at north-western institutions. The upgrade will also provide scientists some flexibility to obtain dedicated bandwidth for specific research applications and will allow higher bandwidth connections to international research networks. \r\n\r\nExamples of research areas that will benefit from the regional networking renovation include: astronomy, high-energy physics, the history and three-dimensional geometry and kinematics of active and ancient orogenic belts, solar physics, biologically-inspired nano-materials, computational biology, and investigations of the material properties of seashells. \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing infrastructure for research, the renovated network will be a resource that facilitates distance education and collaboration.",
