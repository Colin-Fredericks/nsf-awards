 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to investigate impacts of changes in storm track dynamics on the recent rapid reduction in Arctic sea ice extent and volume. The increase of storm intensity and frequency result in enhanced high-frequency synoptic-scale variations and feedbacks in the Arctic climate system, and may make an integrative contribution to the basin-wide sea ice reduction. The project studies build upon previous work, and combine model simulations with satellite products and in situ observations to integrate and delineate physical causes of sea-ice mass balance changes in the context of storm-induced air-ice-sea interactions. This research will bridge synoptic-scale weather activities and large-scale climate variability and changes. The expected outcome includes assembled schematics linking storm-induced synoptic-scale variation with recently observed rapid loss of Arctic sea ice mass. Changes in sea ice concentration/extent, thickness/volume, and heat budget terms at the air-ice-sea interface that follow the motion of identified storms will be compiled. The project also has important broader impacts across the scientific community and in the general public. A Ph.D. graduate student will be trained to join the next generation of climate researchers. The project outcome will be integrated into graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 student lectures, and aid policymakers to make wiser and more economical decisions.",

One is called the &ldquo;AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP)&rdquo;. The standard 5 km APP product suite was later enhanced to include cloud properties, surface temperature and albedo, radiative fluxes, and sea ice properties in reduced spatial resolution of 25 km. The extended APP product suite is called &ldquo;APP-x&rdquo;. The APP and APP-x data products, their processing codes, and algorithm documentations can all be accessed and downloaded from National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) at the websites of http://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/geoportal/catalog/search /resource/details.page?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00940&nbsp; and http://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/geoportal/ catalog/search/resource/details.page?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00941 by any researcher and general public as well.</p>\n<p>Using the APP-x product suite, it is first time that the Arctic climate trend study reveals that Arctic sea ice has been declining in terms of sea ice extent/coverage, thickness, and volume over the period of 1982~2015 in both warm and cold seasons represented by September and April. The Arctic ice extent/coverage has been decreasing at the rate of 1.47x106 km<sup>2</sup> per decade, ice thickness has been thinning at the rate of 1.7 cm per decade, and correspondingly the Arctic has been losing its ice at the rate of 1693 km<sup>3</sup> per decade in September. In April, those values are 1.26x106 km<sup>2</sup> per decade, 4.6 cm per decade, and 4193 km<sup>3</sup> per decade for Arctic sea ice extent/coverage, thickness, and volume, respectively. In addition, one of the first applications of APP-x led to the discovery that, over the period 1982&ndash;1999, the Arctic warmed and became cloudier in spring and summer, but cooled and became less cloudy in winter over the central Arctic Ocean, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, and Barents Sea. The implication was that if seasonal cloud amounts did not change the way they had, surface warming would have been even greater than what was observed. In contrast, the recent extension of APP-x through 2015 shows that the central Arctic Ocean has warmed significantly over the last 1.5 decades such that the overall effect for 1982-2015 is winter warming rather than cooling, with a weak cooling in the Siberian region. It was demonstrated that changes in ice concentration and cloud cover played major roles in the magnitude of Arctic surface temperature trends. Significant surface warming associated with sea ice loss accounted for most of the observed warming trend in autumn. In winter, cloud cover trends explain most of the surface temperature cooling. In spring, half of the warming is attributed to the trend in cloud cover.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xuanji&nbsp;Wang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480529716191_appx_north_images_20150401_1400_0.eps--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480529716191_appx_north_images_20150401_1400_0.eps--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Arctic Sea Ice Thickness\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480529716191_appx_north_images_20150401_1400_0.eps--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic Sea Ice Thickness\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Arctic sea ice thickness in meter on April 1, 2015 from satellite observation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xuanji Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xuanji&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Arctic Sea Ice Thickness</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480530032578_Trend_IceThickness_April--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480530032578_Trend_IceThickness_April--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Trend\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1023371/1023371_10020390_1480530032578_Trend_IceThickness_April--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Trend\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Arctic sea ice thickness trend in April over 1982-2015 for the Arctic Ocean area north of 60 degree with the thinning rate of 4.6 cm per decade.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Xuanji Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Xuanji&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Trend</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
