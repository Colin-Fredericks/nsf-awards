 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an observational program to characterize the fundamental properties of massive stars.  Dr. Gies and his team will conduct observations of the diameters and flattening of nearby massive stars, obtained with optical interferometry.  The first part of this project will determine temperatures, radii, masses, and rotational velocities for a large sample of massive stars.  The rotational speeds will be estimated through interferometric measurements of rotational flattening and spectroscopic measurements of the Doppler shifts related to rotation.  The second part of the project will examine how close pairs of massive binary stars interact over time exchanging both mass and angular momentum. The observations for this project will be conducted using the Center for High Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) telescope array, located at Mt. Wilson, California.  \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to impact the wider field of stellar astrophysics because the observations will provide key tests of theoretical models for the rotational evolution of massive stars from youth to old age.  The project will also involve graduate students at Georgia State University (GSU), and the results from this research will be incorporated into that institution's undergraduate curriculum.  The PI also proposes to engage in education and outreach activities in coordination with the Mount Wilson Observatory, and the GSU Hard Labor Creek Observatory in Georgia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe stars in the sky are so far away that they appear as pinpoints \nin even the best telescopes.  The challenge of resolving them into \ndisks like that of the Sun requires the construction of arrays of \nsmaller telescopes, known as interferometers, that can combine \ntheir collected light to create an instrument more powerful than \nany single telescope.  Georgia State University operates the \nCenter for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array at \nthe historic Mount Wilson Observatory in southern California, and \nthis six-telescope interferometer is the best in the world for the \nstudy of stars and their immediate environments. \n\nThe CHARA Array telescopes were the primary means to launch a series \nof investigations on distant hot and massive stars.  The measurements\nwere used to determine the temperatures and sizes of these huge \nstars, and because many of them rotate very rapidly, they may \nassume a flattened shape that can be measured with the Array. \nThe fastest rotating hot stars often eject gas from their rapid \nspinning equators to create a circumstellar disk.  The CHARA \nArray was used to make the first survey of the sizes and \norientation of the disks of these so-called Be stars.\n\nThe origin of the fast spin of Be stars is still mysterious, \nbut there is some evidence that a nearby orbiting star might \nhold the explanation.  Many massive stars are born in co-orbiting\npairs known as binary stars, and as stars age they may grow in \nsize to reach dimensions comparable to their separation.  \nWhen the more massive of the two grows to a critical radius, \nit will begin to lose mass by a gas stream to the companion. \nThis mass donor star may be eventually stripped of all its \nouter layers to reveal a hot small core, while the companion \ngainer star will increase in mass and spin up.  CHARA Array \nobservations of one such system, phi Persei, have detected the \nhot companion orbiting the brighter Be star, and these observations\nallow us to estimate the masses and other properties of both stars, \nproviding us with clear measurements of the outcome of the stellar\ntransformations that occurred in this system. \n\nOther binary systems consist of stars that orbit white dwarfs, the ancient\n remains of once brilliant stars.  If the separation between stars is small \nenough, then mass transfer to the surface of the white dwarf may\noccur.  In some circumstances, the gas accumulated on the white \ndwarf may become so hot that a thermonuclear explosion occurs that \nblasts the accreted gas into space.   The CHARA Array focused on \none such explosion of Nova Delphini in 2013, and these observations\nrevealed for the first time how the expanding fireball changed in \nappearance following the explosion.  The extraordinary power of the\nCHARA Array telescopes has given us the means to explore the \nproperties and life stories of stars in vivid detail.\n\nThe award from the NSF made possible these scientific investigations \nand provided unique training opportunities in optics, techniques \nof astronomical observation, and computational methods of data\nanalysis for the scientists, postdoctoral research associates, and \ngraduate students involved with the work.  All of the students and\nscientists in the project participated in public outreach programs \nto share their knowledge and excitement about these discoveries.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas R Gies"
