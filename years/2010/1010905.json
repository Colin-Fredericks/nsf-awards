 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whole genome duplication, or polyploidy, is an important phenomenon in evolution and has been characterized in several different lineages including vertebrates, fungi and land plants.  Polyploidy is especially prevalent in flowering plants where most, if not all, species have had a genome duplication event at some point in their evolutionary history.  Analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences and chromosome size variation suggest that the origin and early diversification of the flowering plant family Agavaceae may have been spurred by genome duplication.  This study will utilize high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of genes in species representing all major lineages in Agavaceae to test this hypothesis, and to assess how divergence in gene content and gene function have influenced speciation and chromosomal evolution.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this study will contribute to a growing understanding of factors influencing the fate of duplicate genes following whole genome duplication events. In addition, the project includes a substantial training component.  The research will employ state-of-the-art gene capture, sequencing and computational technologies. Undergraduates will be trained in these technologies and will learn how to perform comparative genetic analyses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Plant genomes are remarkable for their plasticity and history of whole genome duplication (polyploid) events seen in duplicated genes and chromosomal segments. These genome duplication events have been associated with shifts in gene function and the evolution of major innovations including the origin of the flower. More recent whole genome duplications have been hypothesized to contribute to economically important traits in crop species lineages including potato, cotton, peanut, soybean, maize, and sugarcane.  Furthermore, induction of polyploidy has been used in plant breeding programs for decades to overcome obstacles such as hybrid sterility.  Understanding the underlying mechanisms and consequences of polyploidy is essential to elucidating the evolution of plants, especially flowering plants, and developing targeted applications for plant breeding programs.  This investigation of ancient whole genome duplication in a common ancestor of yuccas, agaves, and hostas revealed that the timing of polyploidy event coincided with the origin of the strange bimodal distribution of 5 large and 25 small chromosomes that has been observed in these species.  In addition, this work has produced gene capture probes that will be used in future studies of gene retention and loss following the ancient genome duplication discovered through this research.\n\nAgaves and their relatives are keystone species in the ecology of the American desert and were vital to the flourishing of a number of pre-Columbian cultures.  Today, agaves are used in the production of mescal and tequila and have been recently identified as a potential source of biofuel.  Our research has identified a previously unknown polyploid event that occurred prior to the diversification of the agaves and their relatives, including hostas.  The event occurred prior to the desertification of North America (~15 million year ago) and may have facilitated the diversification of agaves into desert habitats. \n\nWhile genome duplications have occurred repeatedly in flowering plant history, gene numbers seem to remain stable with about 20-40 thousand genes per genome being found across all sequenced plant genomes.  Following genome duplication, most duplicated genes are lost.  However, the retention and functional evolution of some genes have been hypothesized to contribute to major innovations in plant evolution.  Understanding the fate of duplicate genes following polyploidy events will elucidate the molecular basis of novelty following ancient genome duplications.  Future work on the genomes of agaves, yucca, hostas and their relatives will build on the work described here to test whether duplicated genes involved in specific processes such as flower development and water use efficiency may have been preferentially retained in these lineages following the ancient genome duplication we have discovered.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael R Mckain"
