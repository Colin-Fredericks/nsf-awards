 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  This new Science Master's Program in Climate Science and Solutions provides interdisciplinary and focused training to prepare students for careers in emerging sectors of the economy that deal with climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. It will emphasize development of skills related to the design, implementation, verification and assessment of emission reduction and offset projects, renewable energy, carbon sequestration technology, carbon footprint management, and corporate environmental responsibility.  This SMP is built around an interdisciplinary set of core courses in the science of climate change, natural resources economics, sustainable systems engineering, and the science and management of greenhouse gases. Through other existing courses, the proposed program will incorporate \"plus\" disciplines into the curriculum (Biology, Business, Engineering, Environmental Science, Forestry, Geology, Political Science) that will enable student specialization depending on needs and interests. An innovative summer internship with an industry partner will provide experience that grounds students' understanding of the relationship of their coursework to real-world applications, further develop our students' skills in areas directly related to workforce needs, and connect students with businesses and organizations that may hire them upon graduation. The program will be managed adaptively with feedback from students, internship hosts, and an advisory board from academia and industry.",
