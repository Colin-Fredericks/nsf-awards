Hershberger, Gregory R. Cook, Sivaguru Jayaraman, Seth C. Rasmussen and Wenfang Sun from North Dakota State University Fargo will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) photochemical reactivity of photoactive chromophores; 2) study of conjugated organic materials for applications in photovoltaics; 3) characterization of synthetic chiral amines and chiral building blocks; 4) study of the role of transition metal ions in protein and enzyme function; 5) study of square planar platinum compounds for energy conversion and chemical sensing; and, 6) development of homogeneous catalysis for decarboxylative transformations.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
