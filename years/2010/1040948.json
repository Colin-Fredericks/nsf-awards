Lectures on all the leading galaxy simulation codes will be given, in most cases by the leading experts in the world, including the authors and main users of these codes.  The student body will comprise about 60 of the brightest and best-prepared graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the world who are working on understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies, including both theorists and observers.  Codes and sample outputs will be provided to all the students, along with accounts on a new supercomputer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center so that they can practice running simulations and analyzing outputs.  Ample opportunities will be provided during the school for student interaction with the lecturers and with each other.\r\n\r\nWe are at the early stages of a revolution in computer-aided discovery, with ever-more-realistic simulations and an increasing ability to manipulate, and extract hidden meanings from, enormous datasets.  Advances in astrophysics result from a combination of observation and theory, with simulations and data manipulation playing an increasingly important role as computer power increases and codes improve.  We must empower astrophysicists to use the new supercomputers efficiently, both to understand astrophysical processes through simulation and to analyze the petabytes and soon exabytes of data that will flow from new telescopes and supercomputers.  Educating a new generation of researchers through programs such as this summer school will play an essential role in this effort.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary &amp; Intellectual Merit: The 2010 University of California High-Performance Astro-Computing Center (UC-HIPACC)  International Summer School on AstroComputing (ISSAC) was on the subject of Galaxy Simulations.  During the three weeks of the school there were six week-long series of lectures with simulation code workshops plus six supplementary lecturers.  All lectures were videorecorded, and the slides and videos are available at the website \nhttp://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/2010SummerSchool_archive.html (click on Program for the slides and videos).  \nThere were 60 students selected competitively, including 20 from outside the U.S.  All students were given supercomputer accounts on the San Diego Supercomputer System, on which computer codes and sample inputs and outputs were made available.  With the help of the NSF funding, we supported a total of 39 participants\u00c6 lodging and a portion of their travel expenses.  \nThe students learned the latest methods for galaxy simulations since the lecturers included the authors of most of the main computer codes currently used in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.  Afternoon workshops gave the students the opportunity to run and analyze their own simulations.  There was an opportunity for students to present oral reports on their projects, with awards for the best ones (chosen by the students).  The student evaluations were extremely positive.\nOutreach:  There were no outreach activities supported by this NSF award, which was strictly for participant support.  However, UC-HIPACC director Primack is much involved in public outreach on modern astrophysics and cosmology, including preparing material for major shows at Morrison Planetarium of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and at Adler Planetarium in Chicago.  Primack is also coauthor of a new popular book, The New Universe and the Human Future (Yale University Press, 2011), with a website http://new-universe.org hosting many astronomical videos. \nBroader Impacts: Many of the best young astrophysicists working on galaxies attended the school, and they no doubt learned a great deal of relevant science and computational technique.  The lectures will be useful to many others who view them on the website.  In addition, a collaboration between students Chris Moody and Matthew Turk and lecturer Patrik Jonsson has developed a pipeline so simulations run with several modern codes can be analyzed with Turk's powerful yt analysis package and ported to Jonsson's state-of-the-art Sunrise code for making realistic images of galaxies including the effects of stellar evolution and dust absorption and re-radiation.\nThe simulation techniques discussed at the school are at the cutting edge of supercomputing technology.  Lectures and discussion included previews of forthcoming supercomputing technology and code development.\nSince the 60 students at the school included many of the brightest young astrophysicists and the school taught them the latest techniques for hydrodynamical simulations, it certainly helped to develop human resources in both science and computational simulation.\nFuture Plans: UC-HIPACC, an University of California systemwide institute supported by funds from the UC Vice President for Research, plans to sponsor an International Summer School on Astro-Computing each summer.  In summer 2011 it is being held at UC Berkeley and LBNL on Computational Explosive Astrophysics (supernovae, gamma ray bursts, etc.) and in summer 2012 it will be at UC San Diego on Astro-Informatics.  The NSF support for the 2010 school helped to launch this effort.\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel R Primack\nDemographics and selection of students: \n\nThere were 59 students selected competitively, including 14 from the University of California, 22 from other U.S. institutions, and 23 from outside the U.S.: Australia (2), Chile (1), England (1), France (4), Germany (7), Italy (1), In..."
