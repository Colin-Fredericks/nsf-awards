The third symposium will (1) provide a forum for the global community of scientists studying ocean acidification to share their research results through oral and poster presentations; (2) identify priority research topics and approaches for international collaboration through discussion groups; (3) create a summary of the latest research results for policymakers, and (4) create a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal and a scientific summary to disseminate the results of the symposium to the broader ocean science community and make the results available for assessments such as that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The symposium will be hosted by a consortium of institutions in Monterey, California in autumn 2012. The planning committee will consider topics identified by national research communities, such as the priority areas identified by NSF through responses to its solicitation of first-year Ocean Acidification proposals-  molecular/cellular, high latitude, and paleoceanographic aspects of ocean acidification - and priorities identified by the National Research Council report Ocean Acidification: A National Strategy to Meet the Challenges of a Changing Ocean.  Funding will emphasize support for early career scientists, students and scientists from under-represented groups.",
