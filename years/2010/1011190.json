This conference will assemble researchers, practitioners and educators from Indigenous communities of the Americas who are concerned with the preservation of Indigenous language amidst rapidly expanding global influence.   The central goal is to deliver and share information about best practices and strategic planning in language preservation efforts and discuss contemporary research about the impact of policy issues on indigenous language survival. \r\n\r\nBased on previous conference information, there are about 150 participants anticipated, from both the United States and Latin America, who are involved in language policy issues at various levels.  The conference is staged to spark an international dialogue about policy issues that will foster a better understanding of the unique challenges facing Indigenous communities with respect to their languages.",
