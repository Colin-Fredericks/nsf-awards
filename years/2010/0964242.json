 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been an enormous amount of work in recent years directed\r\ntoward understanding the structural and dynamical properties of\r\n\"informatics graphs\" or \"complex networks.\" Most of this work has been\r\non small to medium-sized networks, and it has led to an improved\r\nunderstanding of the properties of networks arising in many graph\r\nmining applications.  In spite of this, formulating appropriate models\r\nfor and answering even basic questions about larger informatics\r\ngraphs remains challenging.  For instance, recent work has shown that\r\ndynamic properties as well as basic structural properties of large\r\ninformatics graphs are not reproduced even qualitatively by popular\r\nnetwork generative models.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will use traditional and recently-developed\r\napproximation algorithms for the graph partitioning problem as\r\n\"experimental probes\" of large informatics graphs in order to\r\ncharacterize in a more robust and scalable manner the structural and\r\ndynamic properties of very large informatics graphs.  This will\r\ninclude extending and implementing recently-developed algorithms such\r\nas \"local\" spectral methods and algorithms that intuitively\r\n\"interpolate\" between spectral and flow-based methods, as well as\r\nrevisiting in light of new applications traditional methods such as\r\nthe global spectral method and ideas underlying the popular package\r\nMetis.  A central goal will be to provide the analyst with tools that\r\nhave sufficient algorithmic and statistical flexibility to\r\ncharacterize the local and global structures of large networks in a\r\nrich and robust way.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the proposed work lies in extending recent\r\ntheoretical and algorithmic developments and applying them to very\r\nreal-world problems.  The Broader Impact of the project lies in\r\nenhancing interdisciplinary education at Berkeley and Stanford and\r\nmore generally.  This will involve the organization of meetings and\r\ncourses that will include the opportunity for research projects,\r\nincluding by students from underrepresented groups, that focus on\r\nbridging theoretical methods and real-world applications.
