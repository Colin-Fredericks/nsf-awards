 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neotoma is a multiproxy relational database that includes fossil data for the past 5 million years (the Pliocene and Quaternary). It is a community database that provides the underlying cyberinfrastructure for a variety of disciplinary database projects. The Neotoma project is an international collaborative effort among individuals from 23 institutions, including domain scientists representing a spectrum of Pliocene-Quaternary fossil data types, as well as experts in information technology (IT).  This project builds on the initial development of the Neotoma database, which was funded in 2008 with a 2-year grant from the NSF Geoinformatics program. Neotoma involves domain scientists representing a wide spectrum of fossil groups from the Pliocene and Quaternary teamed with information technology (IT) professionals from the Center for Environmental Informatics (CEI) at Penn State, where the database is hosted. A workshop was held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC on 31 January-2 February 2009 to plan for the future development of Neotoma. This project is the outgrowth of the DC workshop.\r\n\r\nDuring a 2-year development project, the database structure of Neotoma was designed and implemented with the import of vertebrate faunal data from the FAUNMAP database and pollen data from the Global Pollen Database. The North American Plant Macrofossil Database was updated, and data are now ready for import. The Neotoma website was launched, and the Neotoma explorer provides a map-based interface to the data.\r\n\r\nDuring the next phase ( this project) several new constituent database cooperatives from North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia will join with Neotoma, and several new data types will be ingested, including diatoms, ostracodes, insects, and testate amoebae.  Neotoma will be exposed to outside developers via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and a Software Development Kit (SDK), whereby both desktop and webbrowser- based applications can acquire data from Neotoma over the Internet. Data-steward tools will be developed that will allow stewards to upload and update data remotely.  This project establishes working groups for various database activities, including development of software tools, development of age models, integration of various fossil types from packrat middens held in different databases, and organization of a new peatlands constituent database. Two database-wide workshops will be held for coordination, planning, and conceptual development.",

The objective of this project was the development of the &ldquo;Neotoma Paleoecology Database,&rdquo; which is a relational database that includes many kinds of fossil data for the past 5 million years. Neotoma is a community database that provides the underlying cyberinfrastructure for a wide variety of disciplinary database projects. It is a curated database, in which the data are vetted and quality checked.

The database structure simplifies cross-disciplinary analyses and development of common software tools for data ingest, display, discovery, analysis, and distribution. Neotoma has the scientific objective of providing the easy ability to create and analyze multiple datasets representing a variety of ecosystem components, which lead to important new insights into past changes and creation of new understanding of climate-biota relationships, as well as to the development of new predictive models. Understanding that would not be possible from the study of one data type alone.</p>\n<p>Neotoma is essential cyberinfrastructure for global-scale climate-change research. The constituent databases have been the foundation of broad-scale paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental studies that provide an understanding of the context for recent global change. These databases are used for almost every aspect of this research, from broad-scale synoptic studies to understanding the context of local site studies. Open access and common data structure promotes the development of a wide range of graphic and analysis tools, and research projects can focus on specialized tool development and data analysis rather than database development and maintenance. Neotoma addresses the problem of overall paleo database management&mdash;the long-term maintenance of a multiplicity of databases developed with one-time or intermittent funding&mdash;by consolidating and providing a common IT infrastructure. Neotoma offers greatly expanded opportunities for educators and students to experience an integrated, multidisciplinary scientific database through hands-on exploration of real scientific data. Finally, Neotoma provides the necessary cyberinfrastructure for individual scientists and research teams to meet the NSF requirements for data management plans and for journal and institutional requirements for data archiving, including well established protocols for data archival, curation, and distribution.</p>\n<p>Neotoma now contains more than 15,000 datasets from 67 countries and for 23 data types. Some of the most numerous datasets are vertebrate fauna (3383) and fossil pollen (2645). The database also includes modern datasets used to calibrate environmental and climatic parameters from fossil data, including modern samples for pollen (2596), diatoms (626), and ostracodes (386). Neotoma &ldquo;Data Stewards&rdquo; may upload data to Neotoma and manage data in Neotoma. The various constituent Neotoma databases appoint their own stewards. A software interface has been developed to allow stewards to validate and upload data and to update data already in the database.</p>\n<p>The main public portal to the database is the website&nbsp;<a title=\"Neotoma Website\" href=\"http://www.neotomadb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.neotomadb.org</a>.
