Requested are analytical capabilities sought by both geological and biological researchers at CSU-Fullerton. The instrument will offer in-house analyses to support extramurally-funded research now requiring contract laboratory contracts. The PIs will attack a range of research themes including paleoenvironmental reconstructions, environmental biogeochemistry, tephrochronology and marine ecology. Tephra beds will be assayed in order to better understand paleogeography. Metal contaminants will be assessed in impacted environments. For the marine ecology applications, the PIs will track seawater elemental flow between marine organism populations. The instrument will directly support students affiliated with the PIs. It is also proposed as a teaching resource for non-major courses. CSUF is a Hispanic Serving Institute with close to 50% of biology graduates being women. Research results will be published in peer-reviewed literature. The lead PI will house and administer the instrument. New users will be trained before being allowed to operate the instrument. The instrument will be made a regional resource for 15 local colleges/universities. Cost re-charges will be instituted to support long-term maintenance.\r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was purchased using funds granted by the National Science Foundation Major Instrumentation (MRI) program.  The ICP-OES is used to determine what elements are present and at what amounts in a range of materials ranging from rocks to water to food.  As a result, the ICP-OES has wide range of applications.  The ICP-OES that was acquired for our research is largely being used to measure trace element concentrations in geologic materials (sedimentary rocks, volcanic glass, and groundwater and surface water).  PI Woods and students (Elizabeth Agredano, Elizabeth Ortiz, Robert Sia and Shawn Sullivan) are primarily using the ICP-OES to measure trace elements in sedimentary rocks deposited during and following the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, the largest mass extinction in Earth history.  This research is important because it allows us to determine what the causes of the mass extinction were, and how long it took for life to recover from this crisis, an important piece of knowledge given that the Earth is currently experiencing a mass extinction.  Early results indicate that the extinction was likely related to oxygen-depleted waters in shallow marine environments, which smothered organisms, and led to a mass die-off.  Primary producers (i.e., marine plants) recovered quickly from the extinction, within a few 10\u00c6s of thousands of years, and flourished to the point that the decomposition of dead plant material removed oxygen from the water and caused continued stress, preventing the recovery of organisms higher up the food chain.  Co-PI Knott is planning on using the ICP-OES to chemically fingerprint volcanic glasses that can be used with other information to determine the history of volcanic eruptions and tectonics in the southwestern United States over the last few million years.
