Various sized aggregates of molecules displaying noncovalent interactions will be prepared in a variety of chemical environments, and they will be studied using vibrational spectroscopy and computational modeling.  The educational plan focuses on integrating computational methods and experiment in all levels of physical chemistry curricula and includes a summer research program in physical chemistry.  This work will enhance our fundamental understanding of nocovalent interactions in condensed phases.  Such weak interactions play important roles in a range of chemical and biological systems and are emerging as central in systems-level control over complex biological processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder NSF grant CHE-0955550, the Hammer group at the University of Mississippi (http://thehammerlab.com) elucidated how noncovalent interactions and environment affect the physical and photophysical properties of important biological and materials building blocks.  Laser-based molecular spectroscopic techniques including infrared, Raman and surface enhanced Raman (SERS), fluorescence and single molecule fluorescence spectroscopies and mass spectrometry were used to study a number of important molecular systems under varying experimental conditions.  Molecules of interest included the azabenzenes pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, pyridazine, and s-triazine, 1H, 1,2,3-Triazole, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), urea, B-N and B-P dative bonded molecules such as ammonia borane, and nanomaterials that involve transition metal pincer, thiophene, thienopyrazine, indolizine, perylene bisimide, perylene diimide, and siloxane building blocks.  The integration of experiment with theoretical modeling was also a key component of the program. \n\nOne important outcome is the discovery that when nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecules interact with solvent molecules, there is partial charge transfer from the nitrogen atoms out into the solvent network.  The magnitude of charge transfer was found to be directly proportional to a blue shift (increase in energy) observed in vibrational normal modes of the nitrogen-containing building blocks.  It was also discovered that the solvent molecules that create the most extended hydrogen bonded networks exhibit the greatest blue shifts.  These results could have important implications in molecular recognition in biology.  The effect also extends to SERS experiments where interactions with silver atoms can lead to spectral shifts and complications with trace molecule detection.  It was also found that the addition of an extra electron to nitrogen-containing heterocyclic molecules can induced proton transfer in hydrated pyridine to create the hydroxyl radical and that changing the number of water molecules interacting with nitrogen-containing molecules plays a big role in determining the resulting properties of the charged system.  These results could help us better understand the effects of radiation damage in biological systems.\n\nAnother important outcome involves the important small molecule trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).  TMAO belongs to a small class of organic molecules called osmolytes, which have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally because they play important roles in biological functionality. Through microsolvation of TMAO, the evolution of TMAO?s normal modes with increasing numbers of water molecules led to the discovery that most likely three water molecules hydrogen bond to the terminal oxygen atom in TMAO in solution.  It was also found that water molecules are likely not interacting with TMAO?s methyl groups to a substantial degree. These results have important implications in TMAO's role as an effective osmolyte in biology.\n\nNoncovalent interactions also play important roles in affecting the properties of nanomaterials.  One outcome of this program was showing how intermolecular interactions affect stability and photophysical properties of materials building blocks.  This is especially true for catalysts and also solar cells where it was shown that intermolecular interactions directly affect excited state lifetimes (and thus charge injection efficiency) of sensitizer dyes.  These results are helping chemists design better materials for solar cells.\n\nBeyond the immediate scientific advances, the broader impacts of this work included the development of human resources and educational material for physical chemists with five educational publications resulting from this program.  This grant supported work on projects that involved one postdoctoral scholar, ten graduate students, and fifty-one undergraduate students, and resulted in four PhD theses, a masters thesis, 18 Honors theses, and over thirty total publications. This grant has helped support the training of all these individuals in the interdisciplinary activities under this project (physical chemistry, laser technology, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, molecular and chemical physics, computational modeling, etc.).
