 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research provides the first Pliocene paleo-oceanographic observations from the Bering Sea and supports the objectives of IODP expedition 323 for understanding the associated factors influencing climate change during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, including a warm period of the early Pliocene, when pCO2 levels were similar to today\u00a1\u00a6s levels. The flow of water masses between the Bering Sea and the Arctic and Pacific oceans, changes in Arctic ice volume, and whether dense intermediate waters formed in the Pacific during this time will be investigated as some of the possible triggers of past climate change. The high resolution sediment records obtained from this cruise, with relatively large-amplitude signals, provide a unique opportunity to understand how insulation changes in the upper atmosphere propagate through the climate system and to further test if the orbital cycles of climate change primarily operate on 23ky versus 40 ky timescales. This study utilizes K % logging data from the cruise with paleomagnetic, sedimentological (eg., grain size analysis) and paleontological (eg., analysis of microfossil assemblages; d18O and d13C measurements of benthic and planktonic forams) measurements from the drill cores. The information expected from this study is critical for understanding the fundamental drivers and feedbacks between ice sheets, oceanic and atmospheric circulation and the global carbon cycle. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project significantly advances large investments previously made in an important IODP expedition. The data derived from this investigation can provide important information for paleoclimate/ocean models, and is relevant towards projections of future climate under IPCC AR4 scenarios. The project includes a team of early and mid-career scientists, and includes international collaborations with other scientists of the IODP community. Support is also provided for undergraduate and graduate education, and for public outreach and education.",
