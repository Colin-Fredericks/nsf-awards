 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder is to advance and communicate knowledge on hazards mitigation and disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. Using an all-hazards and interdisciplinary framework, the Center fosters information sharing and integration of activities among researchers, practitioners, and policy makers from around the world; supports and conducts research; and provides educational opportunities for the next generation of hazards scholars and professionals.  This grant enables the Natural Hazards Center to conduct its information clearinghouse activities, which include: a website at www.colorado.edu/hazards; other web-based products, including the biweekly publication Disaster Research and a quarterly Research Digest;  library and information services; publication of a newsletter, the Natural Hazards Observer; support for post-disaster quick-response research and publication of quick-response reports; and an annual workshop for researchers, students, the private sector, and government representatives.  This grant also supports various outreach activities, such as public presentations and media-related activities?all aimed at transferring knowledge on research findings and best practices for disaster loss reduction.",
