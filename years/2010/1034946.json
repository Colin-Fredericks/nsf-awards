 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Space Science Institute (SSI), in partnership with the University of Colorado's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and Oregon State University, are developing a Track 1, pilot project, called Discover Earth: An Innovative Technology Program for Libraries and their Communities. The project uses current geoscience research data to illustrate important Earth science concepts (e.g. spatial/temporal scales, cycles, states of matter). It also promotes the geosciences and geoscience careers as exciting and highly relevant to modern society. Technology is transforming not only how we conduct scientific research and education (both formal and informal) but it also has had a profound influence on the way people can communicate and access scientific information. The purpose of the project is to develop, implement, and evaluate several innovative geoscience education technologies that are tested in a library setting on two types of display platforms (spherical and multi-touch flatscreen). The project team also studies what kinds of social networking technologies work best to build a library community of practice (CoP). Lastly, the project produces several Earth science resources and activities that librarians can use to enrich the exhibit experience.",
