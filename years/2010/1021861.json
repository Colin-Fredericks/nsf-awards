 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infectious disease has long been studied either via investigations into the pathogen or host. However, it is more appropriate to consider disease as the outcome of how the genomes from two organisms interact, especially for endemic diseases which cause significant and persistent losses in numerous economic arenas ranging from agriculture to business. This project will begin one of the first investigations into how the genetic diversity present in entire host and pathogen genomes simultaneously interact to control the infection outcome. Using next generation sequencing with a diverse and destructive plant pathogen, Botrytis cinerea (grey mold), and a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, this project will specifically identify diversity networks that enable an endemic plant disease to overcome diverse and fluctuating plant defenses. This will provide unique insight into how endemic diseases may evolve and provide ideas of how to counter this evolution. Additionally, this project will provide novel insights and guidance into how to conduct genome wide association studies on complex phenotypes such as disease. The project will involve a highly integrative combination of biology, genetics, biochemistry and computational genomics all within a single laboratory that will provide an optimal platform in which to train future scientists that can take full advantage of all genomic technologies to more efficiently solve societies pressing questions and problems.",
