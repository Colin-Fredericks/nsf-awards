First, he considers exact relations and\r\nlinks for effective tensors of fiber-reinforced elastic\r\ncomposites, by applying the general theory developed by him and\r\nhis collaborators.  The general theory provides a strategy for\r\nfinding every relation and link.  However, the actual execution\r\nof that strategy is far from trivial.  The case of\r\nfiber-reinforced elastic composites is both important for\r\napplications and incredibly challenging technically, because the\r\nmicrostructure is two-dimensional while the properties of the\r\ncomposite are represented by three-dimensional fully anisotropic\r\nelastic tensors.  This topic builds on the successful solution of\r\na similar, simpler problem in the context of Hall-effect\r\nconductivity.  A second problem concerns morphological stability\r\nof phase boundaries in materials capable of undergoing\r\nmartensitic phase transformations.  The investigator studies the\r\npossibility of a configuration in which the only mode of\r\ninstability is the global motion of the phase boundary. \r\nMathematically this corresponds to the failure of the generalized\r\nsecond variation to stay positive.  The difficulty is that all\r\nother stability criteria are required to be satisfied.  The\r\nresolution of this issue opens the way to a complete\r\nunderstanding of all instabilities of configurations with smooth\r\nphase boundaries.  In the context of periodic composites,\r\nmorphological instabilities may occur locally within a period\r\ncell.  Their interaction with the effective behavior of a\r\ncomposite is investigated, following prior work for structural\r\nand material instabilities. \r\n\r\n     Heterogeneous media, or media with internal structure, are\r\nof great importance in applications.  Composite materials, which\r\nhave by now become ubiquitous, are one example.  Another example\r\nis shape memory alloys and other smart materials.  These two\r\ngroups of materials are very different, yet have some important\r\ncommon features.  A well-known connection between the two\r\ntheories can be used to shed light on the less well-understood\r\ntheory of martensitic phase transformations responsible for much\r\nof the shape memory behavior.  One aim of this project is to\r\nunderstand elastic properties of fiber-reinforced elastic\r\ncomposites.  Such composites may combine two cheap but imperfect\r\nmaterials to produce a new material that is either rare or not\r\nfound in nature at all.  For example, modern skis use composites\r\nto create a material that bends easily but is incredibly stiff\r\nwith respect to torsion.  However, there are limitations to what\r\ncan be achieved by composites.  The investigator maps out those\r\ninstances where the benefits of creating composites are\r\ndramatically reduced due to the presence of \"exact relations,\"\r\ni.e. relations between material moduli that cannot be altered by\r\nmaking composites, no matter how hard one tries.  The present\r\nwork focuses on a very widely used class of fiber-reinforced\r\ncomposites.  Another aim of the project is to understand\r\ninstabilities in models of non-linear elasticity and shape memory\r\nalloys.  One widely known type of elastic instability is\r\nbuckling.  Martensitic phase transitions responsible for shape\r\nmemory behavior are another kind of instability.  These examples\r\nshow how important instabilities are in applications.  The\r\ninvestigator classifies all possible instabilities in a\r\nsystematic way, with the secondary goal of solving one of the\r\nlong-standing mathematical problems: finding \"correct\" sufficient\r\nconditions for stability.",
