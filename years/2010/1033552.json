In particular, butanol isomers have gained interest as an alternative fuel due to their superior fuel properties to relative to ethanol.  The proposed research will use metabolic engineering approaches to enable the fermentation of the non-digestible, soluble carbohydrate fraction isolated from many common oilseeds such as soybean, cottonseed, and sunflower seed, to butanol.  Many of these materials are byproducts of biodiesel or bioethanol production.  For example, large amounts of galactose-rich soluble carbohydrates, constituting approximately 10% of oil seed weight, represent a sustainable yet underutilized feedstock for biofuel.  Towards this end, the hydrolysis of the galactose-rich oligosaccharides and subsequent fermentation to 2-butanol by engineered E. coli will be studied and optimized.   Furthermore, natural and engineered strains of Clostridia may also be able make effective use of this feedstock.   Genetic modules for engineered strains of Clostridia will be developed that enable the efficient uptake and metabolism of galactose-rich oligosaccharides and their fermentation to 1-butanol.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe education plan will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in biochemical engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry.   Undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited for these activities through existing programs at Rice University.   As part of the outreach plan, after school and summer research experiences for local high school students will be coordinated through the Harmony Science Academy, a largely minority charter school.  Some of these students will present their work at the Science & Engineering Fair of Houston and at the International Sustainable World Project Olympiad (Energy, Engineering, & Environment I-SWEEP).",

The project was composed of three components involving the engineering of the host for optimal uptake of these unusual sugars, followed by the engineering of the downstream production of biofuel molecules derived from natural intermediates of metabolism by the microbe.\nDuring the course of the project we constructed several genetic modules related to formation of longer chain alcohols by assembling genes from several organisms.  The constructs were placed into an appropriate host organism for testing. We also investigated procedures for efficient extraction and isolation of the small carbohydrate fraction of the soy and cottonseed meal.  These methods involved examining extraction conditions (e.g. time, acidity of the solution, temperature, and volumes required) and hydrolysis conditions using dilute acid at high temperature, commercial alpha-galactosidase enzymes, and engineered bacteria expressing the hydrolytic enzymes.  The resulting mixture of sugars was examined in test systems for alcohol or chemical production by the engineered microes. In a number of experiments appropriate conditions were determined that exhibited good conversion to product.\nWith clostridial strains the formation of the 6-carbon long acid was studied and engineered version of Clostridium acetobutylicum was made that showed higher formation of C-4 alcohol than parental strains.  The new method for diverting reducing power to formation of longer chain products instead of being lost as hydrogen may be useful in various  fermentation processes,\nThe project contributed to the training of 9 undergraduates, 3 high school students, 2 graduate students, and 3 postdoctorals and a visiting scholar.   Two articles have been published, along with 4 book chapters or reviews including those in revision, and two other manuscripts based on presentations at meetings are planned.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George N Bennett"
