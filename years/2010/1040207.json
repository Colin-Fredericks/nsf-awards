The work will\r\n-\tEnhance PHY and MAC visibility of operational wireless networks by distributed acquisition of RF signals and decodable frames and\r\n-\tFacilitate evaluation and repeatable experimentations in ongoing research projects in the area of wireless communications and networking,\r\nThe project involves\r\n-\tDevelopment of software tools for trace collection and replay for repeatable experimentation;\r\n-\tCollection of extensive wireless traces in campus environments to understand propagation characteristics, device types, and co-existence issues;\r\n-\tConstruction of device fingerprint database for commonly used wired devices; and\r\n-\tPerformance of synthetic MIMO experiments in a fully controlled environment.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe experimental facility is likely to advance research in wireless monitoring and diagnosis by collecting comprehensive wireless traces and supporting design, analysis, and optimization of distributed space-time processing in both controlled and real-world deployment conditions. Complementing the existing apparatus for telecommunication system design within two centers, it should greatly strengthen and broaden wireless activity. Consequently, it will help students to obtain hands-on experience and expertise in theory and practice of experimental wireless and cognitive radio techniques. Thus it contributes to train highly skilled personnel in a critical area.",
