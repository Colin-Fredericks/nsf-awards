Since 2002, this conference series has become a premiere international forum, attracting many leading and emerging researchers from diverse disciplines working in different countries.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The conference provides a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in an emerging area that encompasses many engineering disciplines. The main objective is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum to promote and expedite progress in understanding fundamental phenomena in applications involving channels of small dimension.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The international nature of the meeting promotes global interaction. This conference will support a number of students as well as emerging research leaders to attend the conference. Emphasis will be made to solicit participation from underrepresented groups.",
