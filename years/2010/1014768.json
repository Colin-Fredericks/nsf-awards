 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial support for young physicists from US institutions to attend the 2010 CERN-Fermilab Hadron Collider Physics Summer School, which will be held at Fermilab 16-27 August 2010. The school will be attended by approximately 150 advanced graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers from all over the world, with a strong interest in hadron collider physics (both theorists and experimentalists). Lectures will be pedagogical reviews of both the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of hadron collider physics, as well as a number of special topics drawn from other exciting results at the forefront of research. Lecture topics will cover theoretical overviews of electroweak physics, quantum chromodynamics, heavy flavor physics, Higgs boson theory and phenomenology, and extensions of the Standard Model (supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and strong dynamics). Experimental techniques fundamental to current hadron collider experiments are reviewed (trigger and data acquisition systems, calorimetry, tracking and muon detection, data analysis, computing models, and statistical analysis methods), as well as concepts of accelerator physics, with a detailed overview of the CERN accelerator complex and the LHC. The summer school is an excellent opportunity for young physicists to gain experience in a number of areas including accelerator physics and for them to interact with more experienced researchers in an informal setting. The proceedings will be widely circulated.",
