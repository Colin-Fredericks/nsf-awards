 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polar oceans are the main sites of deep-water formation and are critical to the exchange of heat and carbon between the deep ocean and the atmosphere. This award ?Historic perspectives on climate and biogeography from deep-sea corals in the Drake Passage? will address the following specific research questions: What was the radiocarbon content of the Southern Ocean during the last glacial maximum and during past rapid climate change events? and What are the major controls on the past and present distribution of cold-water corals within the Drake Passage and adjacent continental shelves? Testing these overall questions will allow the researchers to better understand how processes in the Southern Ocean are linked to climate change over millennia.  This award is being funded by the Antarctic Earth Sciences Program of NSF?s Office of Polar Programs, Antarctic Division. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT: The skeletons of deep-sea corals are abundant in the Southern Ocean, and can be dated using U-series techniques making them a useful archive of oceanographic history.  By pairing U-series and radiocarbon analyses the awardees can reconstruct the radiocarbon content of seawater in the past, allowing them to address the research questions raised above.  Collection of living deep-sea corals along with environmental data will allow them to address the broader biogeography questions posed above as well.  The awardees are uniquely qualified to answer these questions in their respective labs via cutting edge technologies, and they have shown promising results from a preliminary pilot cruise to the area in 2008.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS: Societal Relevance: The proposed paleoclimate research will make significant advances toward constraining the Southern Ocean?s influence on global climate, specifically it should help set the bounds for the upper limits on how fast the ocean circulation might change in this region of the world, which is of high societal relevance in this era of changing climate. Education and Outreach (E/O): These activities are grouped into four categories: i) increasing student participation in polar research by fully integrating undergraduate through post-doctoral students into research programs; ii) promotion of K-12 teaching and learning programs by providing information via a cruise website and in-school talks, iii) making the data collected available to the wider research community via data archives such as Seamounts Online and the Seamount Biogeographic Network and iv) reaching a larger public audience through such venues as interviews in the popular media.",

The science aims of the project included a combined study of the past and present biogeography of cold water corals in the Drake Passage, and investigations into their major controls and paleoclimate reconstruction using skeletal remains. As such the cruise was designed to image and collect samples from coral habitats and their environments stretching from the continental Shelf of South America, across fracture zones and seamounts in the Drake Passage and down to the West Antarctic Peninsula. The skeletal remains of corals were collected in trawls, dredges and with the Kasten corer. The most effective sampling on shelf areas was with the Blake Trawl and the most effective sampling on seamounts and fracture zones was the newly constructed Hein dredge. Specific efforts towards inclusion of students and post docs were made on this cruise, including undergraduates who had not been to sea before. Junior personnel were exposed to all aspects of the science and cruise activities to maximise their experience. The training they received during the cruise consisted of learning technical skills of collecting at sea using a variety of over-the-side equipment, scientific processing of samples (biological, fossil, geological, water) and data analysis.
