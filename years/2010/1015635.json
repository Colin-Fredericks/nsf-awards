  "por_txt_cntn": "In addition to causing increases in temperature, climate change is altering precipitation regimes across the globe. Climate models project two types of changes: 1) changes in mean (average) precipitation, and 2) increases in precipitation variability, which will result in fewer rainfall days as well as more extreme storms and droughts. My project examines how primary production, the biomass produced by plants through photosynthesis, might be affected by these alterations in precipitation. Furthermore, I am testing whether plant species with certain traits are more sensitive to these changes. I focused on leaf and whole plant traits that may affect the ability of vegetation to respond to changes in water availability: leaf area, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N), leaf phosphorus (P), plant height, and plant biomass. I hypothesized that species with traits that facilitate immediate responses to water availability will have higher sensitivities to precipitation mean but lower sensitivities to precipitation variance. Specifically, I predicted that species and functional groups with low leaf LMA, high leaf N, high leaf P, and smaller plant sizes will be more sensitive to precipitation mean but less sensitive to precipitation variability than species and groups with the opposite traits. \n\n\n I sampled plant traits at the Inner Mongolia Grassland Ecosystem Research Station (IMGERS), one of the chief long-term ecological research sites in China. IMGERS is located in the Xilin River Basin in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. The Inner Mongolia Grassland is part of the Eurasian Steppe, the largest contiguous grassland in the world. Using standardized methods, I collected functional trait data from over 800 individuals of 30 different species. I am currently analyzing this data. First, I am quantifying the sensitivity of total production in the ecosystem to changes in precipitation mean and variability by applying a sensitivity analysis developed as part of my master's thesis to long-term primary production data sets from IMGERS. Next, I am calculating the precipitation sensitivities of each species separately. Lastly, I am using correlation analyses and multivariate techniques to test for relationships between sensitivities and species with certain traits. \n \nThis project takes advantage of long-term ecological monitoring in China to address an important gap in knowledge about the impacts of climate change on primary production, a key ecosystem function. Quantifying the response of primary production to changes in the precipitation regime is critical because primary production  sets the carrying capacity of ecosystems by determining the energy available for all organisms. Primary production is also an essential component of the global carbon cycle; changes in primary production will affect ecosystem and global carbon balances. Knowing which plant traits are correlated to precipitation sensitivities will enable ecologists to identify species and groups of species that may be more vulnerable to the forecasted  changes in precipitation regime already apparent in many regions. Finally, understanding how plants with different traits respond to precipitation could improve seasonal forecasts of primary production. Accurate forecasts would help prevent overgrazing of rangelands and inform management of wildlife species dependent on the availability of plant biomass. \n\n\nAn NSF grant for graduate students enabled me to work in China and to collaborate on this project with a well-known Chinese ecologist affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany. Collaboration with Chinese scientists is increasingly important as China is quickly emerging as a world power and a leader in science. My experience in China was fruitful in ways that go beyond this particular project. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn about how science is carried out in China, to see what daily life is like for Chinese grad..."
