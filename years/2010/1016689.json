 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers could solve a number of problems substantially faster than their conventional counterparts.  However, all known quantum algorithms exhibiting speedups use one of a small number of techniques that are responsible for their success.  \r\n\r\nThis project pursues novel quantum methods for problem solving, particularly for optimization and simulation of quantum systems.  The methods for optimization will include linear transformations in signal analysis and filter design that generalize the Fourier transform, which is key in quantum computing.  Special interest will be given to the fractional Fourier transform and wavelet transforms, and to their applications in quantum black-box algorithms that compute specific properties of a function.  Efficient quantum circuits that implement these transformations will be developed and their impact in quantum-algorithmic design will be analyzed.  \r\n\r\nThe methods for the simulation of quantum systems will use adiabatic state transformation, which is a key tool for accessing energy states in physics via slow evolution.  Adiabatic quantum algorithms to compute finite-temperature properties will be designed, and their computational cost will be compared to that of conventional Monte Carlo methods.  Complexity lower bounds will also be obtained.  In addition, the impact of the devised quantum methods in other areas of quantum information, especially in quantum metrology and parameter estimation, will be explored.",
