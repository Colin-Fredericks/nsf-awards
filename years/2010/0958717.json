Clyde, Lead PI, University of New Hampshire\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThe Bighorn Basin Coring Project will collect ~200 meters of core from each of three sites (Polecat Bench, Gilmore Hill, Basin Substation) in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming to better constrain the causes and effects of Paleogene hyperthermal events. Hyperthermals are abrupt, large-magnitude global warming events associated with extreme perturbations to the Earth's carbon cycle. Two events in particular will be targeted - the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ETM1) and the Elmo (ETM2) event. The PETM is the best documented hyperthermal and involved the release of 2,000-6,800 gigatons (Gt) of carbon from an unknown reservoir over less than 10 thousand years (ky) causing the earth to warm by 5-9\u00baC for a period of 100-200 ky. For comparison, the entire fossil fuel resource base on earth today is estimated to be ~5,000 Gt. Elmo is a smaller amplitude event that occurs after the PETM and just below the Chron C24N/C24R polarity reversal in marine records but remains poorly documented in continental sections. By applying a variety of sedimentological, geochemical, and palynological methods to the proposed cores we hope to better understand what caused these events, study the biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks that operated during them, and reveal precisely how they impacted continental environments. The Bighorn Basin preserves the most expanded stratigraphic records of the PETM and Elmo yet known, so these cores will provide an opportunity to study hyperthermals at unprecedented resolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project drilled, sampled and analyzed a core through rocks from the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming.  The PETM was a period of global warming 56 million years ago that was caused by a massive release of carbon to the atmosphere.  The rocks that were drilled were formed by sediment carried in rivers and were further modified by the development of soils.  To learn about climate and vegetation during this period of global warming, we studied the remains of the waxy coating on leaves that can be preserved for millions of years in sedimentary rocks.\n\nFrom the core, we analyzed the abundance, type and isotopic signature of fossilized leaf wax compounds called n-alkanes.  We were interested in how well the compounds were preserved in the rocks in the core compared to those that were exposed in outcrops on the surface.  We suspected that the leaf waxes in rocks at the surface might be heavily degraded and wanted to know if information on the type and isotopic signature of the waxes was changed by degradation.\n\nWe found approximately 60 times greater abundance of leaf wax compounds in the core than that in the associated outcrop of similar rocks (Figure 1).  This suggests that degradation has removed a large portion of the fossilized leaf waxes in these surficial rocks, and suggests that future studies could benefit from analyzing leaf waxes and other organic compounds in continental cores.\n\nWe also analyzed the type and isotopic signature of the fossilized leaf wax compounds to determine if degradation altered these signatures.  We found that in spite of massive loss of leaf wax compounds at the surface, the leaf waxes that are left behind record the same signature as those preserved in the core.  This result is very encouraging as it supports the findings and conclusions of previous studies that have analyzed leaf waxes from outcrop samples.\n\nIn addition, we found that the preservation of fossilized leaf waxes decreased significantly during the PETM.  This is most likely the result of higher rates of respiration of organic matter in soils during this period of elevated temperatures.  As the PETM is in many senses an analogue for future climate change, this suggest that future warming would likely be associated with greater carbon soil respiration.\n\nThe broader impacts of this research are three-fold.  Firstly, this project developed a broad international collaboration on a first-ever NSF-funded attempt to drill a continental core to study climate change during the Paleocene and Eocene.  Secondly, the project supported the research career of individuals who are often underrepresented in geosciences, namely female undergraduate students, female graduate students and female professors.  Thirdly, this project provided insight to past climate change and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, which is relevant to understanding future climate change and its impacts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Francesca A Mcinerney"
