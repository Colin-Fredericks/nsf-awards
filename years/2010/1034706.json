The mission of the center is to create new tools, processes, and methodologies that will assist in generating higher quality products at lower costs. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research projects at the Wayne State site will engage faculty from five department, four engineering disciplines and anthropology. The stated focus on large industry and utilizing expertise in the achievement of design objectives for human use overlaps significantly with the current research in the e-Design Center. Wayne State brings unique strengths with top research scientists in fundamental and applied research, affiliated with several university centers and institutes. \r\n\r\nSite research from Wayne State will be integrated into its broader graduate and undergraduate education endeavors to enhance students development and preparation. Wayne State University has a large minority population as well as a high percentage of female engineering graduates. (The reference to Wayne State as a \"Carnegie I\" institution reflects a very dated understanding of the Carnegie institutional designations, in that this designation has not been in use since 2000 http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/02/27/carnegie. Carnegie has classified the institution as \"Research University/Very High\", or RU/VH since 2005.). One of the I/UCRC team members is involved in the Wayne State K-12 STEM education curriculum innovation efforts. One research project will develop education toolkits to enhance high school student's multi-stage problem solving skills. The connection with the existing e-Design center assures an understanding of intellectual property management and effective management at the Center level.",
