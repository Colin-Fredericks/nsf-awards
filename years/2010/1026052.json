The group is very experienced at providing technical assistance and holding workshops. They will handle all of the logistics needed for a successful PI meeting. A draft of the proposed agenda is included in the proposal as well as evaluation information and its implementation. The proposal well done, very cost-effective and will benefit young investigators and faculty from minority serving institutions (MSI).",
