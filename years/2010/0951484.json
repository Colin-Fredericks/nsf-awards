 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued operation of the living collection of Ambystoma mexicanum, commonly called the axlotyl at the University of Kentucky. The collection, originally established many decades ago at IU, is a historically significant resource that provides animals used actively and widely in biological research. The ongoing development of genome resources for the axolotl and other closely related species is expected to foster continued interest in Ambystoma as a powerful non mammalian vertebrate model system. Most notably, axolotls are studied because they are unique among vertebrates in being able to perfectly regenerate numerous body parts. These include the spinal cord, limbs, jaw, and tail, all of which can be regenerated at any point during embryonic, larval, and adult life. Relocation of the collection to the UKY will consolidate the living stock resource with genome and bioinformatics resources currently being developed for the Ambystoma research community. The collection will not only continue to enable traditional research areas where the axolotl is the best vertebrate model system, it will also continue to take an active role in facilitating use of the organism in K-12 education and public outreach efforts.",
