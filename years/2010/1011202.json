 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"\r\n\r\nThis  Science Masters Program (SMP) award aims to develop several well-defined ?green-themed? science concentrations, including biotechnology (especially biofuels), sustainability, urban environmental analysis and management, and industrial mathematics across all three of the Rutgers campuses in Newark, New Brunswick, and Camden, NJ. The goal of the new degree program is to train the next generation of individuals to assume key leadership roles in science-intensive industries and to translate research into commercialization. This program will recruit, enroll, and provide tuition fellowships for two cohorts of students into the new professional science master?s degree program. Additionally, this program will recruit and train talented US students especially from underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), and prepare them to obtain high-paying jobs in emerging green-technology industries of critical importance to the economy of the U.S.   Ultimately, this initiative will fuel innovation and economic growth in New Jersey and the U.S. The degree includes a science concentration combined with a common set of business ?plus? courses.  The business ?plus? courses include finance and accounting, management, communications, marketing, and ethics. Students will complete a research internship as well as an integrated capstone course in which they will learn how to evaluate, convert, and commercialize science, engineering and technology discoveries into new economic ventures.  This new SMP model will both improve the STEM to industry connection and increase the number of underrepresented minority graduates in the STEM pipeline.",
