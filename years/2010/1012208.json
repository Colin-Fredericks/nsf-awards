 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data Protection laws that exempt data that is not individually\r\nidentifiable have led to an explosion in anonymization research.\r\nUnfortunately, how well current de-identification and anonymization\r\ntechniques control risks to privacy and confidentiality is not well\r\nunderstood.  Neither is the usefulness of anonymized data for real-world\r\napplications.  The project addresses anonymization on three fronts:\r\n\r\n1) Textual data, even when explicit identifiers are removed (names,\r\ndates, locations), can contain highly identifiable information.  For\r\nexample, a sample of chief complaint fields from the Indiana Network\r\nfor Patient Care (INPC) found several instances of \"phantom limb\r\npain\".  Amputees can be visually identifiable, but the HIPAA Safe\r\nHarbor rules do not list this as \"identifying information\".  Any\r\npolicy explicitly listing all types of identifying data is likely to\r\nfail.  Through a joint effort with computer science and linguistics,\r\nthe project is developing new methods to remove specific details from\r\ntext while preserving meaning, eliminating such highly identifiable\r\ninformation without a priori knowledge of what would be identifying.\r\n\r\n2) Current anonymization research is based on unproven measures of\r\nidentifiability.  Through a re-identification challenge on synthetic\r\ndata (but based on real healthcare data), the project is evaluating\r\nthe efficacy of these measures.  Interdisciplinary teams of students\r\nare given challenge problems - anonymized data with hypothetical\r\nhealthcare data - and asked to make (hypothetical) inferences about\r\nhealth information of individuals.  The results can be used to\r\ncalibrate the effectiveness of different anonymization measures.\r\n\r\n3) The utility of anonymized data has been a concern among research:\r\nDoes anonymized data provide credible research results?  By partnering\r\nwith healthcare studies at the Kinsey Institute and Purdue University\r\nSchool of Nursing, the project is comparing analyses on original data\r\nwith analyses on anonymized data, and evaluating the impact of types\r\nof anonymization on research results.  A related issue is determining\r\nthe impact on data collection: Are individuals more candid in their\r\nresponses if they know data will be anonymized?  Outcomes are broadening\r\nthe scope of research that can be performed on anonymized data, while\r\nensuring that researchers know when access to individually identifiable\r\ndata (with attendant restrictions and safeguards) is needed.\r\n\r\nThrough these tasks, the project is advancing our ability to utilize\r\nthe wealth of data we now collect for the benefit of society, while\r\nensuring individual privacy is protected.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/TextAnon",
