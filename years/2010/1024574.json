 "awd_abstract_narration": "Competitive Savings, Competitive Growth, and Global Implications\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Research Agenda\r\nThe research aims to document a new motive for savings and a new stimulus for entrepreneurship and economic growth. While the existing literature on savings discusses the roles of the precautionary savings, the life-cycle factor, financial development, culture, and habit formation, the PI's argue that these are incomplete. Using both data from within China and across countries, they study whether a new status-seeking motive for savings can be quantitatively powerful enough to drastically augment the precautionary savings motive and other determinants of the savings rate. A key driver for the progressively stronger status-seeking motive is a rising sex ratio imbalance. The preliminary evidence suggests that the status-seeking motive may explain about half the increase in the Chinese savings rate from 1990 to 2007. While theoretical models on status seeking do exist, none of them features a sex ratio imbalance. The sex ratio imbalance could present a non-trivial challenge as opposing partial equilibrium effects could offset each other (e.g, dissavings by women could offset the increased savings by men). The PI's construct a model that explicitly features sex ratio imbalances, and they show conditions under which the economy-wide savings rate increases with a rise in the sex ratio. The same force that leads to competitive savings can also induce people to become more entrepreneurial and to supply more work effort. The PI's provide the first evidence in the literature on these channels. They also provide general equilibrium estimates that suggest the effect of a rise in sex ratio on economic growth is positive and economically significant. They propose a field research in a remote mountainous area of China to study savings and entrepreneurship motivated by status-seeking competition, including in relation to a wedding event in a family.\r\nThe Broader Impact Resulting from the Proposed Research\r\nThe research has both empirical relevance and important policy implications. The phenomenon of global current account imbalances, a large U.S. current account deficit, matched by large current account surpluses of China and some other economies, is often understood as the result of some countries' exchange rate manipulations or financial sector deficiency or both. Policy efforts by the U.S. government and international financial institutions to address the problem are often guided by such thinking. Yet, according to the research, such thinking is at best incomplete and at worst misguided. If the status-seeking motive plays an important role in generating the rapid rise in the savings rates in China and other Asian economies, then policy dialogues that ignore this savings motive will not likely yield desired results. Similarly, if the sex ratio is a key driver for entrepreneurship and growth, the high growth momentum in China, India, and Vietnam (countries known to have a strong sex ratio imbalance) will last longer than what one would expect from the traditional Solow growth model. The pace of the realignment in the international economic order can be expected to quicken in the decades to come.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe competitive saving motive refers to savings for the purpose of raising one's relative status in the competition for dating and marriage partners.  This was first proposed by Shang-Jin Wei and Xiaobo Zhang (JPE, 2011), whose research was supported by this NSF Grant (SES-1024574).  The higher an individual's savings relative to those in the same age and gender cohort, the better his/her competitive position.\n\n               Wei and Zhang (2011) estimated that a heightened competitive saving motive, triggered by a sharp rise in China's male-to-female ratio in the pre-marital age cohort since 2000, contributed to about 50% of the actual rise in the Chinese savings rate.  In fact, many countries, including Singapore, India, Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan have also exhibited unbalanced sex ratios in the pre-marital age cohorts.  Accordingly, the competitive saving motive may have played a quantitatively important role globally.  The same saving motive is present in countries with a balanced sex ratio, though it is not as easy to estimate its effect.  \n\nTheory\n\n                Qingyuan Du and Shang-Jin Wei (2013) formalized a theory of the competitive saving motive and clarified the conditions under which this saving motive at an individual level can translate into major changes in economy-wide aggregate savings.  First, while the savings rate of the surplus gender tends to rise, the impact of an unbalanced sex ratio on the savings rate of the gender in shorter supply is indeterminate. Third, nonetheless the economy-wide savings rate goes up unambiguously in response to a higher sex ratio.\n\n               While higher aggregate savings due to a skewed sex ratio may be transitory, the effect could be long lasting.  The increased savings rate due to the competitive saving motive is socially inefficient.  While all young men (and their parents) hope to improve their chance of marriage by increasing savings and reducing consumption, such hopes cannot be realized in the aggregate, as the total number of unmarried young men for the country as a whole is ultimately determined by the sex ratio, and not by the aggregate savings rate. \n\n               Besides raising the savings rate, individuals and households may also respond to marriage marked competitive pressure by purchasing visible status goods, increasing work effort and entrepreneurship, and accumulating more human capital. \n\nEvidence\n\n               There is abundant evidence that (relative) wealth helps one to gain status in the dating and marriage market.  By and large, there are no wealthy men who are involuntary bachelors.  \n\n\n               Across countries during 1990 and 2010, Du and Wei (2014) report the male-to-female ratio for the pre-marital age group of 10-24 is a predictor of a country's savings rate.  Across households within China, Wei and Zhang (2011) show that households with an unmarried son, living in a region with a more skewed sex ratio, tend to save more than other households.\n\n             Demand for home ownership is stronger by families with a son, especially in regions with a more skewed sex ratio.  House prices are found to increase faster in regions with a more skewed sex ratio (Wei, Zhang, and Liu, 2017).           \n\nPolicy implications\n\n This research indicates that a rise in the sex ratio in China, Vietnam and several other countries may be an important reason for a rise in the savings rate and a rise in their current account surplus as a share of GDP. When a large country such as China runs a surplus, the rest of the world has to run a deficit collectively.\n\nAn elevated level of savings rate due to a sex ratio imbalance can create an impression of an under-valued real exchange rate even when there is none (Du and Wei, 2016). Instead of focusing exclusively on the nominal exchange rate, a broader look at structural determinants of savings and investment may be a more productive way to address global current account imbalances.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shang-Jin Wei"
