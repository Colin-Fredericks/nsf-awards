The coursework focuses on learning modules that utilize interactive software based on SciPy (scientific tools for python).  The modules play a role similar to laboratory experiments, and are studies by teams of students.  Each team has members with different skills coming from biology, chemistry, engineering, computer science and physics.  The learning modules can be modified easily and analyzed in ways that foster creativity and interaction between team members.  The software runs on all major computer platforms and is easily installed on the students' computers.",
