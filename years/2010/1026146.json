 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ticks are very important vectors of human and animal disease agents. In order to develop effective control strategies, accurate identification of these ticks is critical, including identification of the three active life history stages - larva, nymph (i.e., immature stages) and adult. The current project focuses on a worldwide and diverse group of ticks. Adults are generally well known, but while natural-history collections include large numbers of immature stages, they often cannot be associated with those adults. This project aims to address this problem by (1) using genetic data (i.e., barcoding) to associate immatures with adults, (2) providing descriptions of the immatures and adults, including development of on-line identification keys to all stages, and (3) studying evolutionary relationships among the species. Using the information gathered, hypotheses on geographical distributions and host associations will be tested. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide training in tick identification and database development and management for two graduate and several undergraduate students. The generated on-line resources will allow easy access to an enormous amount of information for public health professionals and the general public. Moreover, the assembled data will allow ticks to be used as a model organism in studies of biogeography and host associations. All specimens from the two largest collections in North America will be data-based and all information will be web accessible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project involved extensive DNA sequencing for a wide range of Amblyomma species.  These data are primarily used to develop well supported hypotheses of relationships in the genus (the first comprehensive attempt for this group), which in turn are used to make inferences on the evolution of host choice and biogeography.  All of this will help better understand a tick genus that is both interesting in terms of its evolution, and important because of its ability to vector important diseases of humans and domestic animals.  Resulting data also allowed development of a protocol for rapid identification of immatures, a significant issue as immatures of Amblyomma species are often incompletely known.  Development of a morphology based character set, to be used in updated taxonomic keys, is ongoing.  It will include an extensive study of distribution of cuticular glands in Amblyomma larvae.\n\n \n\nAccess to a wide variety of information about Amblyomma is significantly improved by making collection data for the two largest tick collections in North America, the US National Tick collection, and the holdings at Ohio State University, available online.  The system employed includes interactive distribution maps.  These collection data are integrated with literature data dealing with descriptions and taxonomic acts for the genus, and new high-resolution images for a one-stop information hub for Amblyomma.  All of this is available online through a single access point (acarology.osu.edu/database).\n\n \n\nThe project included training of 4 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students, and results have already been incorporated in teaching by the principal investigators.  The genus Amblyomma is important in terms of public health, and the added clarity in terms of species delimitation provided in this project will be a major benefit for researchers, epidemiologists and laypeople, having to deal with these ticks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lorenza Beati"
