 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutrinos from the Sun are ideal for studying neutrino-flavor phenomena and astrophysics. The Sun offers the greatest source flux of a pure electron-neutrino flavor coupled with high matter density in neutrino transport, long baseline, and low neutrino energies. An effective tool for new advances compares the luminosity of the Sun separately measured by neutrinos and photons that can uncover surprises in neutrino physics as well as astrophysics. A precision measurement of the neutrino-derived luminosity of the Sun is possible only by the detection of low-energy (<2 MeV) solar neutrinos that contain > 99.9% of the flux. One of the few answers to the experimental challenge of real-time low-energy neutrino detection is the indium-based Low Energy Solar Neutrino Spectrometer, LENS. It will uniquely provide a nearly background-free complete spectral image of solar neutrinos using Charged-Current-based neutrino detection with powerful tags of space and time coincidences. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide funds to test the LENS concept and technology in all its aspects via a relatively inexpensive prototype - Mini-LENS - at 15% of the length-scale (1/300 the volume) of LENS, with the goal of providing a robust characterization of the performance of the technology. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact on science, technology and education includes: the participation of students and postdocs with opportunities and outlets for curiosity- and imagination-driven research into a physics understanding of the world with simulations, chemical processing, and data acquisition systems. Students will gain valuable hands-on experience working with state-of-the-art instrumentation. Convenient access to the underground laboratory at Kimballton provides excellent training in the intricacies of research underground. The technology of mini-LENS reaches into other realms, and provides new opportunities in other fields.",

While ten billion neutrinos from the sun pass through your eyes each second, they are exceptionally difficult to detect, requiring ton size underground detectors to detect even a few per day.&nbsp; But this feature also allows them to convey information from the depths of the Sun with little interference, making them excellent probes for our understanding of stellar operation.</p>\n<p>There were two initial foci of this research.&nbsp;

The second was to look for a catalytic hydrogen burning cycle using carbon and nitrogen.&nbsp; This produces what are known as CNO neutrinos.&nbsp; It is a 1.7% contribution for the Sun, but helps determine the &lsquo;metalicity&rsquo; of the sun when it was first formed &ndash; that is, the fraction of gas which was heavier than helium.&nbsp; This measurement could help resolve disagreements between solar abundance measurements and helioseismology, with major implication for slightly heavier stars.</p>\n<p>The detector uses an indium loaded scintillator which is sensitive to only &lsquo;electron&rsquo; type neutrinos, the ones produced in the Sun.&nbsp; However, neutrinos can oscillate into different flavors (muon and tau) as they travel to Earth, and so these oscillation parameters can either be determined, or values used from other experiments, to help normalize our results.&nbsp; The LENS detector had a unique approach to see neutrino interactions using an optical lattice (the &ldquo;Raghavan Optical Lattice&rdquo;, named after its originator).&nbsp; This divides a large scintillator volume into small cubic regions, separated by thin walls having lower index-of-refraction.&nbsp; The result is that light produced in the scintillator (due to neutrino capture on dissolved Indium) is channeled by total internal reflection along the principle axes to six specific photomultiplier tubes where it is detected.&nbsp; This &lsquo;digitizes&rsquo; the event, allowing an event &lsquo;topology&rsquo; to be used to reject backgrounds.</p>\n<p>The mini-LENS project was to develop a small proto-type of this detector to learn and demonstrate its capabilities.&nbsp; Progress was made in scintillator development, lattice fabrication, and a smaller version, called &lsquo;micro-LENS&rsquo;, was built and deployed in the Kimballton Underground Research Facility (KURF), just north of the Virginia Tech campus.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the initial PI, Raghavan passed away in 2011 before mini-LENS and LENS could become a reality.&nbsp; The collaboration continued to develop the LENS concept.&nbsp; The fundamental issues which emerged were the prohibitive cost to calibrate the pp results to better than 3%, when the science goals had evolved to desiring a 1% measurement.&nbsp; In addition, intrinsic light quenching of the scintillator reduced the resolution, making sufficient light yield with currently available lattice fabrication materials impossible with the size needed.&nbsp; This caused a transition in focus to the CNO neutrinos (whose higher energy makes them easier to detect, and unobscured by the intrinsic activity of the indium), but their much lower rate required a larger detector than presently affordable.&nbsp; The LENS approach to measuring CNO we believe is still the best method for an unambiguous CNO result.</p>\n<p>The optical lattice approach, however, has proven to be valuable in other venues, in specific the search for sterile neutrinos, and the monitoring of nuclear power reactors.&nbsp; The key feature here is the excellent spatial and time coincidence for event topology which allows operation at the surface of the earth, without the need of substantial shielding.&nbsp; Two detectors are utilizing this technology, the first being NuLat (a merger of the LENS and mTC collaborations), and the second the Chandler experiment (the merger of ROL technology into the SoLid neutrino detector approach).&nbsp; These are both ongoing efforts.&nbsp; NuLat retains the true 3D features of LENS, although instead of indium doping, now uses Li-6 doping to detect the inverse-beta-decay signature of anti-neutrinos.&nbsp; The technique to build a lattice to larger scales is now understood.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;B&nbsp;Vogelaar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1001394/1001394_10020679_1512975204658_neutrinoSpectraLogPBG--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1001394/1001394_10020679_1512975204658_neutrinoSpectraLogPBG--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Solar Neutrino Spectra in LENS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1001394/1001394_10020679_1512975204658_neutrinoSpectraLogPBG--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Solar Neutrino Spectra in LENS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Solar neutrino spectrum anticipated from LENS detector.
