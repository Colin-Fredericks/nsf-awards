 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed to develop and implement a new type of terahertz modulator by exploiting, for the first time, MEMS reconfigurable subwavelength metallic slits. This terahertz modulator takes advantage of low loss and broadband transmission of electromagnetic waves through multiple layers of subwavelength metallic slits to offer unprecedented modulation bandwidths of at least ten times higher than the prior art. Moreover, this terahertz modulator offers up to 100 percent modulation index while operating at competitive modulation speeds and modulation voltages compared to the state-of-the art.  While theoretical investigations provide a deep understanding of electromagnetic wave interaction with multi-layered subwavelength metallic slits, the experimental effort provides an intuitive insight to develop proper designs and fabrication processes for realizing a fully integrated terahertz modulator. Various geometries will be explored to mitigate the tradeoff between the modulation voltage, modulation bandwidth, modulation index, modulation speed, and modulator reliability.  \r\n\r\nThe outcome of this research will enable terahertz spatial beam forming and developing high-performance active and passive terahertz imaging systems based on compressive sensing. The integrated education activities will train graduate and undergraduate students on interdisciplinary research.",
