 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER grant supports initial exploratory work on the utility and feasibility of providing informal science education (ISE) educators with access to current and relevant peer-reviewed research findings. The investigators of the Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) in England and the Learning in Informal and Formal Environments (LIFE) Center at the University of Washington will select about 200 peer-reviewed research studies from published journals and translate them into practitioner-friendly language. The translations will explicitly note the relevance of the findings to informal science education contexts. The translated abstracts will be posted on a website that will be field tested with some 200 ISE practitioners to determine whether the translations and presentations of the research are accessible and usable. \r\n \r\nThe audience during this exploratory phase will be educators who design and lead science education programs for children and youth in informal settings such as museums, botanical gardens, youth development organizations, after-school programs, and different media-based contexts, such as web, television, and radio. The research summaries will provide these educators, who do not have access to published research journals, with information about learning progressions, curriculum design and sequencing, use of new media, building on the cultural resources of children, the nature of scientific argumentation, and education policy. The journals covered will include those oriented primarily towards researchers (Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Journal of the Learning Sciences, Studies in Science Education, International Journal of Science Education) as well as practitioners (Curator, Science Communication, Journal for Education in Museums, and Afterschool Matters). The abstracts will be field tested with practitioners and will be evaluated by an experienced advisory panel. The results of the work will be published in journals and posted on a website.",
