 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to increase the number of women and minorities graduating with baccalaureate degrees in chemistry, mathematics, and computing from Columbia College, a private women's college with 46% minority enrollment. Scholarships are being awarded to 18 female students for up to four years. The project objectives are \r\n1) to recruit academically talented but financially needy women and minority students to major in chemistry, mathematics, and computer and information science, \r\n2) to increase retention rate to 75% by providing academic support, mentoring, and community building opportunities, and \r\n3) to prepare participants for successful entrance into the workplace or graduate school. \r\n\r\nA joint venture of the chemistry, mathematics and computing programs, this project builds upon a 2003 CSEMS grant and on the existing college support services but targets a broader audience. A management team composed of faculty and industry representatives administer the project. Admissions, financial aid and career services personnel are also involved. The participants take a series of common courses, are advised and mentored by faculty using Appreciate Advisement, and participate in monthly lunchtime seminars, field trips, and group dinners. Participation in peer-mentoring opportunities is also encouraged. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project is based on activities geared to recruit, retain, and prepare women for successful careers while pursuing current and academically rigorous baccalaureate degree programs, administered by dedicated and knowledgeable faculty. This project can contribute to the knowledge of how to recruit, retain, and engage women to major in chemistry, math and computing.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: The project can broaden the participation of women and minorities in chemistry, mathematics and computing and lead to more of these underrepresented groups in South Carolina entering careers in these fields in the 21stCentruy workforce.",
