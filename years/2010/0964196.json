 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rule systems are increasingly used in areas ranging from Program Analysis,\r\nSemantic Web, Security Frameworks, Sensor Networks, Cognitive Radio, and\r\nDisruption-tolerant Networking, each with its own demands for efficiency\r\nand scalability.  Advances in these areas will lead to a new generation of\r\nrobust and secure applications that control devices on which human safety\r\nand even lives depend, supply with critical information, and help people\r\nmake informed decisions by pulling together distributed Web-centric\r\nresources, analyzing them, and automating complex information-bound tasks.\r\nHowever, existing implementations of rule systems are not sufficiently\r\nscalable and have been shown to vary widely in performance.  To make the\r\nabove vision of next generation robust applications a reality, one must\r\nunderstand the performance characteristics of rule systems and develop\r\nscalable optimization and analysis techniques for them.  Although advances\r\nhave been made in improving performance of rule systems, the problem\r\nremained extremely challenging and poorly understood both theoretically and\r\nimplementation-wise.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a comprehensive framework for rigorous\r\nunderstanding and optimization of rule systems.  The approach is based on\r\nprecise cost calculations and global program transformations, and it\r\ncombines and extends techniques from database query optimization, compiler\r\noptimization, and recursive query processing.  It includes: (1) techniques\r\nfor generating logically equivalent but more efficient programs; (2) cost\r\nmodels and analysis for generating parameterized cost formulas for the\r\nrunning time and space usage of rule programs; (3) techniques for\r\nestimating parameters of the cost formulas; (4) heuristics for searching\r\nthe exponentially large space of logically equivalent rule programs to find\r\nthe ones with the best predicted time, space, and tradeoffs; and (5)\r\nimplementation of the strategy as an optimizer for the widely used,\r\nopen-source XSB Logic Programming System.  The method and implementation\r\nwill be evaluated using applications in Program Analysis and Semantic Web.",
