This project focuses on the development of bootstrapped learning techniques to rapidly create domain-specific semantic analyzers, and the automatic harvesting of domain knowledge from unstructured text.\r\n\r\nThis project establishes a new cooperative bootstrapping paradigm to learn semantic analyzers for different tasks simultaneously by allowing classifiers for different tasks to learn from each other.\r\nThese analyzers then populate a domain event graph with semantic information extracted from a domain-specific text collection. New knowledge harvesting algorithms acquire domain-specific facts and inference rules from the graph. This project explores the domain of veterinary medicine using message board posts by veterinarians to acquire real-world knowledge for the purposes of animal health surveillance.\r\n\r\nThis work will advance the state-of-the-art in natural language technology by developing a new bootstrapping framework to rapidly create semantic analysis tools for specialized domains.  This technology will impact many NLP applications, including information extraction, question answering, and summarization.  The knowledge harvesting tools will be made publicly available to allow for direct impact across many disciplines that have a need to extract knowledge from unstructured text collections.  This project will also benefit society by creating new tools for animal health surveillance, which could provide early warning signs of zoonotic disease outbreaks (such as bird flu and mad cow disease), exposures to toxic substances, and contamination in the food chain.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSome of the most pressing needs for natural language processing technology come from specialized domains, where general language resources are insufficient, such as medicine and genomics.  Creating technology that can understand specialized domain texts would enable researchers to automatically extract and coalesce knowledge from large text collections to generate new insights for experts in these fields and to help them keep up with the literature and late-breaking news. A key challenge, however, is the need for semantic analyzers that can understand the vocabulary in a specialized domain and recognize important events and semantic concepts. Dictionaries and language resources for specialized domains are uncommon and often need to be created manually, which is often prohibitively time-consuming and expensive.\n\nThis research project developed new techniques to automatically generate dictionaries and semantic analysis tools to extract information from specialized domain texts. New methods achieving state-of-the-art performance were developed to recognize and extract information about events (e.g, the actors and objects involved), and to identify terms corresponding to key semantic concepts (e.g., diseases in disease outbreak stories or animals and medications in veterinary texts).  A key innovation is that these semantic analysis tools can be easily re-trained to rapidly create dictionaries and text resources for new domains with minimal manual effort. This project also demonstrated new technology for extracting information from texts discussing animal health events, which is an important domain that could provide early warning signs about disease outbreaks, exposures to toxic substances, or contamination in the food chain. The resulting text analysis technology could also broadly benefit many types of text anpplications, including question answering, information extraction, and text summarization systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen M Riloff"
