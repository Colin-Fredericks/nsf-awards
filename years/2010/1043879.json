MathDL, now the pathway project in NSDL for the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) with stewardship for undergraduate mathematics, provides access to a wide variety of online materials from Partner sites as well as many resources on the site itself. MathDL is creating a New Collection of quality resources for a range of undergraduate mathematics courses. This component enables users to browse materials, organized by courses and topics, post and access reviews and other materials concerning online resources, and join a community of colleagues working on the same curricula. In addition MathDL is adding two new sections to the existing online publication, Loci and the daily Math in the News articles: Mathematical Communication, featuring advice and exemplars of good mathematical communication; and Tools for Online Mathematics. MathDL is expanding the impact of the New Collection by workshops and minicourses at national and local meetings of MAA and presentations at colleges and universities with a particular focus on underrepresented groups, especially the historically black colleges.",
