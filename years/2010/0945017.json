 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to design, develop and commercialize cost-effective, high performance, innovative antioxidants for sustainable alternate bioenergy fuels, in particular, for biodiesel and biolubricants. Oxidative stability of oils derived from bio-sources is inferior as compared with those derived from fossil fuels. This is a key issue for the alternate energy industry. It is expected that the proposed antioxidants will prove to be very effective in improving thermo-oxidative stability.  This enhanced stability will result in an extended service life. The current commercial antioxidants are not effective in face of the challenge posed by plant-derived bio-oils, and the performance of these antioxidants does not necessarily increase linearly with concentration. There is a need to design and develop next generation antioxidants, which are more effective than those that are available today.  This proposal addresses the design and testing of new macromolecular antioxidants to provide better protection against oxidation in bio-energy fuels and lubricants.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this research project will be in the development of a product that plays a key role in reducing the nation's dependence on imported oil by developing higher quality alternate fuels. By improving the oxidative stability of bio-based oils and fuels, it will be possible to make viable products to compete against petroleum based products that are used in automobile and other industrial lubricant applications.",
