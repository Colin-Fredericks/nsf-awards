 "awd_abstract_narration": "International Conference on Alternative Energy (ICAE); Caribbean University proposes organizing the first International Conference on Alternative Energy (ICAE) in San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 15-16, 2010. By supporting research and development in alternative energy, the nation can potentially reduce its dependence on foreign oil and create employment opportunities. In order to support these efforts, the ICAE will bring together leaders in the field from around the globe to share original concepts, research findings and create collaborations. The gathering of leading academics, researchers and government officials from the countries in the Western hemisphere, Europe and Asia will address important and pressing alternative energy topics in the areas of State-of-the-Art Technology, Public Policy, Research and Economics with a particular focus on the participation of students, women and minorities in the conference and field. Over the course of two days, these leaders will advance knowledge and understanding across the field by engaging in plenary sessions, technical sessions and round table discussions. In addition, there will be several keynote speakers as well as optional academic and industrial tours designed to showcase the extensive industrial infrastructure of Puerto Rico and research activities and facilities at local universities. Located in Puerto Rico, Caribbean University is well qualified to develop and host the conference because of its location, prior work in the field of engineering education and alternative energy and access to the resources necessary for the conference. Furthermore, the organizing committee has experience in developing similar events such as the \"Segunda Cumbre de Expertos: Telecomunicaciones en Puerto Rico,\" a telecommunications conference held in November 2007.\r\n\r\nResearching and developing alternative energy is a high priority for the nation. Advances in alternative energy are of benefit to society because they can lead to the creation of jobs and also a reduction in pollution and dependence on other nations for oil. Therefore, the broader impacts of the conference include both the advances and discoveries that will be shared at the conference as well as the distribution of results after the conference and ultimately the potential benefits to society of alternative energy advancements. ICAE will also provide opportunities and support for commercialization and entrepreneurial endeavors. This will be done through special technology commercialization panels during the ICAE conference. The conference will provide opportunities for participants to meet, network, exchange information and initiate partnerships. They will also learn about the mechanics and logistics of working internationally. There will be broad participation specifically targeting students, women and minorities from throughout the Caribbean, the Americas, Europe and Asia with a focus on underrepresented groups. For example, student scholarships will be provided to promote teaching, training, and learning.",
