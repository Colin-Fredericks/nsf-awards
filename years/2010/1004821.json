 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center For Great Lakes Studies (CGLS). The REU site provides environmental aquatic science research training for nationally-recruited students in a cohesive, multidisciplinary environment. The program will support nine students/summer during a ten week summer research program. Students interested in chemistry, geology, and biology of lake and ocean settings are paired with mentors supervising active research laboratories. Together they develop a program of study compatible with the advisor's interests and capabilities within one of the active interdisciplinary research programs. Workshops on graduate school and career opportunities, writing and public presentation of results, and related topics will be offered. At the close of the 10-week session, each of the students will present a poster and oral talk describing their work to a public audience. They will write a detailed paper in the format of a typical journal article. Students will also be encouraged to present their work at professional conferences.",
