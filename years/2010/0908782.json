De Pablo. \r\n\r\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) on Nanostructured Interfaces and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM) Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) on Biomedical and Energy-Driven Systems and Applications will collaborate to offer their local K-12 teachers the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research in nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) and materials science and engineering (MSE) and to create classroom educational materials based upon that research.  This RET in Engineering program at UW and UPRM will provide a total of 23 K-12 teachers over a three year period, an opportunity to participate in a six week summer research and professional development experience with additional responsibilities and activities during the academic year to build upon the summer experience.  As RET Fellows, the teachers will work with UW MRSEC and UPRM CREST faculty, postdoctoral associates, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students to conduct research in NSE/MSE and to develop related curriculum.  A highlight of this program will be the capstone exchange week, during which the RET teachers and project team will go to UW or UPRM for a week long exchange between the RET Fellows of their RET experiences, research, posters, and curriculum materials; their schools and cultures of K-12 education; and their host universities.",
