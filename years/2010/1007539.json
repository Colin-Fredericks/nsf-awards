 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the dynamic and electrodynamic interactions between upper atmospheric regions using measurements acquired by an extensive suite of ground-based instrumentation located throughout the Caribbean.  Specifically, the research will focus on characterizing the development of neutral and electrodynamic irregularities related to sporadic, patchy layer formation in the lower (E-region) ionosphere, traveling ionospheric disturbances, and quasi-periodic irregularities associated with coupling between the ionospheric E- and F-regions.  Experimental investigation of these phenomena will utilize the incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in addition to active and passive optical remote sensing by Arecibo imagers and LIDAR systems.   Active experiments using the new Arecibo facility for ionospheric modification are also planned.  To supplement the Arecibo instrumentation, a set of coherent scatter radar imagers, one located on St. Croix and one to be deployed on the island of Dominica in the West Indies as part of the proposed work, will be used to locate plasma irregularities, identify their intermediate-scale structuring, and place them in the context of quantitative, ground-based measurements for the first time.   This project will result in a significant expansion of ground-based infrastructure in the Caribbean which will benefit both students and international collaborators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt mid latitudes, some of the strongest perturbations in the ionosphere are ionization layers in the E region that appear suddenly over periods of tens of minutes and often last for many hours during the night.  These layers, referred to as Sporadic E, are subject to a variety of instabilities that produce turbulent structure in the ionization.  The study was designed to give us a better understanding of the processes that lead to instability by using a combination of radar and optical measurements at the Arecibo Observatory and in the nearby region of the Caribbean, which is a part of the globe where strong layers occur frequently.  \n\n\nThe Arecibo radar is the most sensitive radar in the world.  Using that radar allowed us to make measurements of both the plasma and background atmospheric motions with very high time and height resolution in the region above the radar.  In addition, Cornell University and Clemson built, installed, and operated two imaging radars on the islands of St. Croix and Guadeloupe.  The imaging radars use sophisticated data analysis techniques to produce maps of the horizontal extent and movement of the ionization turbulence.  In addition, optical imaging data tuned to specific emissions from the lower ionosphere region provided maps of the horizontal structure in the atmospheric flow.\n\n\nA long series of data from observational campaigns that used all of the available measurement techniques was analyzed.  The results showed that the primary drivers for the ionization turbulence are neutral waves and turbulence created by strong winds and large wind shears in background atmospheric flow.  The large winds and shears are a common feature that occurs in the same region of the atmosphere where the ionization layers are found.  Some earlier studies had suggested this mechanism, but the project supported by the grant is one of the most extensive and comprehensive studies of the phenomenon and has therefore provided the clearest evidence yet of the importance of the neutral flow as the driver for the ionization structure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miguel F Larsen"
