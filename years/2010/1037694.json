 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to expand the use of a pedagogy developed by the PIs, project enhanced learning (PEL), significantly extending the scope of it use across engineering science courses and at two partner universities.  The project will document difficulties encountered in spreading the PEL method across departments and universities, thereby contributing to the STEM community's understanding of barriers for broad adoption of effective pedagogies.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to build partnerships and networks in support of an adaptation of a teaching method that has been well-established by rigorous research to be effective at improving learning for engineering students.  The partnership addresses inclusion of under-represented groups in engineering, particularly those from urban environments.  All three partner universities are located in urban centers.  Should this project be successful, it could have broad impact on how \"core\" engineering science courses are taught.",
