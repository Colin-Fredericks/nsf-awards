 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this MRI acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is to enhance existing research programs, facilitate and promote new multidisciplinary research, enrich the educational curriculum, increase outreach activities involving K-12 students, and expand existing and future industrial collaborations at Oakland University.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe requested scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) has imaging, structural, and chemical analysis capabilities for both conductive and non-conductive samples.  The proposed SEM/EDS acquisition will result in a fundamental understanding of engineering, physics, and chemical aspects of MEMS devices, polymeric and metal nanocomposites, bio-inspired electronics and surface and interface chemical systems.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis acquisition has three broader impacts: (i) Scientifically and economically, the SEM/EDS will enable a higher level of research on materials, devices, and related technologies, which coincides with vigorous attempts being made to diversify the local economy and add new growth to the frontiers of discovery in Metro Detroit area. (ii) The SEM/EDS will contribute to our continued effort in graduate and undergraduate research training for which the research team has an excellent record. (iii) This acquisition will enhance our outreach programs where we have established close collaboration with local high schools to facilitate participation of high school students in research.",
