 "awd_abstract_narration": "The METALS (Minority Education Through Traveling and Learning in the Sciences) represents a multi-institution collaboration to broaden participation in STEM fields by creating meaningful geoscience experiences among groups typically underrepresented in the geosciences and to motivate these groups to choose academic and career paths in the geosciences. The METALS program aligns four universities with strong field geology programs, an institutional history of emphasizing teaching and mentoring in the geosciences, and a commitment to providing access to college for large populations of underrepresented minorities. A strategic alliance of active geoscience diversity programs at San Francisco State University, the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of New Orleans, and Purdue University is being used to engage minority high school students in experiential learning opportunities through field-based settings. Project activities include: (1) Four 10-day instructional field trips, each for 40 high school students selected from each of the four university regions. The field trips take place in a different region each year: California and the Pacific Coast, the Colorado Plateau and Southwest, the northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains, and the Gulf Coast. (2) Professor and graduate student-led field seminars and colloquia designed to connect underrepresented students with a deeper understanding of how Earth science processes impact local communities, how place-based understanding of landscapes varies among cultures, and the geological configuration of the U.S. (3) The building of pathways and support systems among the universities, first through students traveling and learning together in the geosciences, and second through social networking and 'virtual' sharing during the academic year resulting in an expanded network of mentor friends and a broader connection to faculty outside their department that will encourage and support student effort throughout their careers. (4) Engagement of minority graduate and undergraduate students in the program through field and research projects that grow out of data collected during the summer programs.  The METALS program is expected to: significantly affect the academic choices of minority students as it relates to their choice of major and course selection in college; promote excitement about geology in a field setting while gaining a mutual respect, interdependence and trust among individuals of different ethnicities; and, strengthen the collaboration and knowledge base among partners toward encouraging diversity in the geosciences.",

This part of the collaboration incorporated cultural issues, especially those pertaining to Native peoples of the U.S.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nFollow-up at the home institutions included mentoring for individual students involved in the program, with the goal of assisting them with college preparation, enrollment and retention.  \n\n\nMore than 100 high school students (49 from New Orleans) participated in engaging and challenging geoscience field-based experiences in unfamiliar landscapes, including several National Parks. \n\n\nThe participating students, who are from underrepresented groups in the sciences, came from a wide range of cultural backgrounds and geographies and were able to engage in cultural exchange with their peers as they explored geoscience in new landscapes.\n\n\nMany of the participating students have enrolled in science (some geology) programs at colleges across the country and are now well into their academic careers. At UNO one undergraduate from METALS is on track to graduate with a degree in geology.\n\n\nThe students explored a number of societal issues with important connections to geoscience. Each year the location of the field trips gave new opportunities to explore new geo-societal issues. Issues relevant to minority groups, including Native Americans and African American proved to be powerful.\n\n\nThe impacts of these experiences on each of the students cannot be easily measured and many effects are tangential and will continue for many years. Dr. Bailey's qualitative evaluation provided valuable insight for understanding the depth of the experiences for the students. The results of the evaluation indicated that the goals and objectives of the project were met.\n\n\nEvaluation findings indicate that the METALS experiences lead to a deepened interest in geosciences and as the students continue in their academic pursuits they call on these experiences and they help to shape their academic decisions.\n\n\nThe METALS model can be replicated at other institutions and in a wide variety of setti..."
