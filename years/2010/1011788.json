 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the work of Professor Robert E. Gawley of the Chemistry Department at the University of Arkansas for the study of chiral organolithium compounds. This effort is organized into three aims: 1) mechanistic studies and development of the scope of a catalytic dynamic resolution (CDR), 2) measurement of the thermodynamic parameters for carbanion inversion of selected, synthetically important, organolithium compounds and testing of CDR in the new systems, and 3) evaluation of the range of electrophiles suitable for use in stoichiometric and catalytic dynamic resolutions, specifically metal electrophiles for cross-coupling reactions. This project includes a collaborative effort with Dr. Iain Coldham at the University of Sheffield, U.K. Graduate students from the Gawley group will travel internationally to participate in the effort. \r\n\r\nControl of stereoselectivity, the preferential formation of one mirror image of a chiral molecule, is one of the most important challenges facing synthetic chemists today. It is critical to the pharmaceutical industry, since most drugs are chiral and often only one of the forms is medically beneficial. This research develops new methods of stereoselective synthesis. The approach uses the electrophilic (electron-loving) substitution of chiral organometallic compounds, where a metal such as lithium, magnesium, copper or zinc is bound to an anionic (negatively charged) moiety. By careful analysis of the reactivity and structure of selected systems, the group is establishing principles of catalytic dynamic resolution to produce one chiral product selectively.  The research involves an international collaboration with faculty and students in the United Kingdom and promotes learning through direct research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPharmaceuticals are an essential part of modern healthcare.  Part of the cost of developing a pharmaceutical drug is due to the cost of manufacture.  More efficient manufacturing methods can help keep the drug costs down.  The overall goal of this NSF funded project was to understand and develop new chemical reactions involving chemical species known as organolithiums.  Organolithiums, compounds of carbon and lithium, are widely used in drug discovery and production.  As a result of financial support from the NSF via this grant, we have discovered new physical phenomena of organolithium compounds that will enable the more cost-effective development and potentially production of new pharmaceutical compounds.  In addition, we have gained a greater understanding of the chemical behavior of organolithium compounds.  A second part of this project involved the preparation of a new chemical reaction catalyst using organolithium chemistry.  Although we were unsuccessful at applying the organolithium chemistry to the catalyst preparation, we successfully prepared the catalyst in another fashion.  The catalyst contains a copper atom, and we have been able to use the copper catalyst to prepare one of two possible mirror image compounds in a selective fashion.  Modern drugs are required by the FDA to contain only of the two possible mirror images, so our copper catalyst will simplify this process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthias C Mcintosh"
