It is atmospheric radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the atmosphere's evolving chemical content that governs Earth's temperature and drives potential climate change. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This award provides support for travel by eight U.S. researchers to the Sixth International Symposium on Radiative Transport, which will be held in Antalya, Turkey, on June 13 - 18, 2010. This meeting has been held periodically since 1995, and is a premier event attracting scientists and engineers in the field of radiative heat transfer. Priority will be given to U.S. Ph.D. students and post-doctoral associates working in radiative transfer. Support for pre-tenure faculty members at U.S. academic institutions will also be considered for support.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The symposium will be attended by a diverse cadre of researchers including physicists, chemists, materials scientists, atmospheric scientists, power production engineers, manufacturing engineers, and others who are concerned with a wide spectrum of fundamental challenges and opportunities in radiative transport. Continuing a tradition from previous symposia, it is expected that the most important 30 to 35 papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, which is a premier journal in the subject matter of the symposium, and of which the PI and co-PI are associate-technical and technical editors, respectively. Efforts will be made to include participation of students and young faculty members from underrepresented groups.",

This Symposium is a follow-up of the five previous meetings held in Ku?adas? in 1995 and 1997, Antalya in 2001, Istanbul in 2004, and Bodrum in 2007.  The Symposium honored three internationally known scientists in the field of radiation heat transfer, Professors Pinar Meng&uuml;&ccedil;, Nevin Sel&ccedil;uk, and Jean Taine for their significant contributions to the discipline.

In addition to these dedication lectures the Symposium featured 40 contributed technical papers and nine posters on such topics as inverse radiative transfer, radiation models, radiative properties of materials, near field radiation, radiation transfer in combustion and industrial systems, radiation transfer in two-phase and non-homogeneous systems, and gas phase radiation transfer.  Symposium paper and poster contributions came from 18 countries and 60 scientific laboratories.  Twelve submissions reflected international collaborations among the co-authors.\n\nAll manuscripts accepted for presentation at the Symposium were rigorously reviewed (full manuscript) by two or three experts.  Acceptance of manuscripts presented at the Symposium was based on rigorous full-paper review by two or three experts.  Authors whose papers were accepted for Symposium presentation were invited to revise their work based on reviewer comments before final submission.  All Symposium papers were assembled on CD-ROM, and, based on initial peer-review and subsequent evaluation by four special issue editors, a subset of fourteen of the contributed papers was selected for post-conference publication in a special issue of the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer (J.
