 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to study systems with dipoles, e.g., atoms or molecules with directional nonlinear electric interactions. One goal is to utilize these nonlinear interactions to import them in a true manner between matter (e.g., atoms) and light (photons), and thus to make very low-intensity light nonlinear, to apply, for example to switches or \"photonic quantum information.\" In addition, \"superradiance\" in dipole matter that allow laser-like phenomena will be studied in very general setups that allow a multitude of systems, ranging from atoms to spins in semiconductors. \r\n\r\nFour areas of education and outreach will be promoted during this project. (i) Many of the topics attract particular interest from students, and will involve them inside and outside the classroom. (ii) Seminars are regularly organized around the topics. (iii) As a woman, the PI is particularly well placed to attract, and has a history of attracting, specifically female students, and helping them to succeed. (iv) Outreach in undergraduate institutions and through departmental programs for even younger students. These activities will complement efforts to build an active AMO community at the University of Connecticut.",
