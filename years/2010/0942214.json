This platform allows teachers and students to emulate real-world devices by plugging in the desired modules such as different radio technologies, sensor types, and other components typically found in wireless systems. From the software perspective, WIPER automatically recognizes the inserted modules and provides programmers access to library functions that facilitate rapid development of wireless applications. The WIPER programming environment is extensible and offers an easy-to-use graphical programming interface.\r\n\r\nThe project provides instructors with a tool for rapid development of wireless networks and systems with minimal learning curve. Besides this new learning platform, the project provides novel learning materials for the WIPER platform.\r\n\r\nThe WIPER platform can be used in courses such as computer networks, sensor networks, mobile computing, or wireless communications. The PIs leverage the WIPER platform to further raise interest in wireless systems and recruit students from underrepresented groups. The PIs work with Notre Dame's Innovation Park to explore commercialization opportunities to provide educators with access to the WIPER platform.",
