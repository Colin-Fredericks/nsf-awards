Proposed activities are well conceived and organized with sufficient access to resources.\r\nThe proposal seeks to fund the participation of approximately 50 US female engineering faculty at the research summit in Orlando, FL facilitating international collaborations in targeted engineering disciplines of sustainable energy, clean water and health care. The PIs expect another 50-60 female engineers from foreign countries to join this summit and to be supported by their academic or research constituents. The proposal provides a sound rationale, and addresses a real need for a clear pathway in pursuing international collaborations; and  expanded databases on engineering women faculty and common issues they are facing.",
