 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms require chemical elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) for growth and development. P is of particular interest because it is especially important in construction of genetic material such as DNA and RNA and is often present in limiting concentrations in the environment. This project will investigate the biological rules that determine the elemental recipe (\"stoichiometry\") of microorganisms that grow under severely P deficient conditions in a set of unique desert springs in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis study will use both laboratory and field experiments, combined with cutting-edge methods of molecular biology and genomics, to investigate how changes in P supply alter the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these microorganisms and to reveal how they cope with shortages of this essential chemical element. Furthermore, the study will help us understand how human alterations in P supply, such as those driven by inefficient use of fertilizer or by inputs of P-rich sewage, affect microbial ecosystems. It will also help in discovery of new genes and genetic strategies by which organisms efficiently use P. These discoveries may be useful for agriculture and other settings in light of growing concern about the finite supply of economically recoverable P for fertilizer production. Finally, the project will produce bi-lingual science education products that will enhance science education in Arizona and nationally for both K/12 students and the general public.",
