 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all scholarship about public opinion and the Court is\r\npredicated on the view that the media are principal actors in\r\ndiffusion of knowledge about the Court. Yet most Court reporters have\r\nlittle to no legal training and media coverage may conflict sharply\r\nwith views in the legal community.  So, what role does the media play\r\nin the public understanding of the Court?  Do news and editorial\r\nboards exercise discretion in writing about law in systematically\r\ndistinguishable ways?  What are these implications for the study\r\nof judicial politics? What are the normative implications?\r\n\r\nTo date, virtually no systematic, large-scale, empirical examination\r\nhas shed light on the foundational role that the media play in the\r\ndiffusion of legal knowledge.  This project fills that\r\nvoid by:\r\n \r\n --  characterizing how the media, via hard news stories and\r\n    editorials, has portrayed the workings of the Supreme Court over\r\n    time, across cases, and across outlets;\r\n\r\n -- assessing how media coverage of the Court differs from the\r\n    understanding in the legal community;\r\n\r\n --  providing publicly available data and summary measures that\r\n    describe how media outlets disseminate information about the Supreme\r\n    Court;\r\n\r\n --  providing documented, easy-to-use software for the statistical\r\n    analysis of newspaper articles and editorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is the first assessment of media coverage of the\r\nCourt that examines all news stories and editorials on the Court\r\nwritten by over 20 major newspapers in a 10 year period.  A major\r\nportion of the project is the development of widely-applicable,\r\neasy-to-use software and statistical methods for analyzing the content\r\nof news articles.  In so doing, the principal investigators are \r\npositioned to address foundational questions in how, what, when,\r\nwhere, and why the media reports on the Court.",
