 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award are an integrated research and education plan focused on investigation of a non-intrusive biosensing paradigm and multi-modality cognitive inference approach for human-machine systems.  The transformative nature of the paradigm under investigation is to build miniature sensing elements on machine surfaces, so that human physiological signals can be acquired non-intrusively in real-time through natural contacts during human-machine interactions. The new inference approach is inspired by human biological learning behaviors and aims to infer human cognitive states based upon individualized and multi-modality cues, including physiological signals, along with integration of various cue-state relation mechanisms. Two test-beds in transportation and medicine will be established to validate the theoretical work.\r\n\t\r\nThis project will transfer research outcomes into education curricula for a wide variety of trainees, including graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students. Minorities and underrepresented groups will be recruited into this interdisciplinary field. This program will engage and train the general public through close interactions with government agencies, industries, and international collaborators. It is anticipated that the program will produce groundbreaking results in applying sensor technology to human cognitive system modeling, and have huge impacts on public safety and human health worldwide.",
