ACES manages cluster computing resources for three academic departments spanning two schools at MIT. Approximately 1/3 of the processors are in the geophysics subcluster, ACES-GEO.  ACES-GEO Pis will  purchase a pre-assembled cluster machine from THINKMATE which would include a controlling node, at least 11 compute nodes and a switch unit.  Node configurations will include multi Quad-core Intel CPU, massive RAM and storage capacities.  The new cluster will support computationally intensive PI and student research involving  geodynamical modeling of Earth and Planetary interiors, geodetic data analysis, cryosphere dynamical modeling, seismic imaging and interpretation, land form evolution, and inversion of remnant magnetization.  The cluster will support the computational needs of four assistant professors, two of whom are women.",

The areas of research being carried out on the cluster include geodynamical modeling of both the Earth and other bodies in various evolutionary stages, analysis geodetic data, ice sheet models (and other dynamic systems) driven by large data sets, seismic imaging and interpretation, land form evolution, and inversion of remnant magnetization.

The developments made on ACES will be readily accessible to other investigators including those using somewhat smaller clusters.\nSocietally important problems are being addressed using the ACES system. Problems addressed include estimating the state of the sea surface and how it responds to climate change. Understanding volcanic and magmatic systems can have a direct societal impact in volcanically active regions, as does the more detailed understanding of plate movements, seismicity (including induced seismicity). The elements needed to understand these classes of problems are included in the ACES science section.  Al..."
