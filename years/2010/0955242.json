A range of microscopy and spectroscopic characterization methods will be used to study conducting polymers in different environments ranging from single polymer chains up to thin films.  The aim is to understand how polymer conformations influence aggregation properties in bulk materials that affects the device performance. The educational plan focuses on improving programming skills at the undergraduate chemistry course level, developing a graduate level nanoscience course, and participating in outreach programs to local Native American groups.  This work will enhance our fundamental understanding of organic photovoltaic materials and lead to more rational ways to process these materials during device fabrication.  Ultimately, this work could lead to less expensive and more efficient solar energy collection devices.",

The major scientific goals of this research are to understand the impact of chemical structure, conformation, molecular packing and order on the outcomes of electronic processes, such as charge and energy transfer, that determine material and device performance metrics.  The intrinsic disordered nature of conjugated polymers leads to extreme heterogeneity which presents formidable challenges for extracting this information on sub-micron size scales.   Our basic scientific approach for addressing these challenges entail 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' materials fabrication and characterization strategies to close the loop in understanding over the nano- to micrometer size scales.  \n\nThe top-down thrust of this research focused on obtaining new insights of the relation between microstructure and local photocurrent production in next generation polymer solar cell devices.  These so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems are comprised of a polymer component as the electron donor and fullerenes (Buckyball) as the electron acceptor.  BHJ morphologies are highly complex due to demixing between polymer/fullerene components over the nano- to micrometer size scales, however, conventional device characterization techniques average over these features.  Unfortunately, the predictive capability from this data was severely lacking, which was evident from stagnant solar cell performance between ~1999-2010.  My group developed and successfully employed a highly sensitive and in-situ chemical imaging technique (i.e., resonance Raman spectroscopic imaging) that was combined with photocurrent imaging to construct microscopic maps of the local packing state and composition and material performance attributes in functioning devices.  This approach is completely non-invasive and reveals the complex morphological landscape and the contributions of specific morphological features to photocurrent generation efficiency in heterogeneous BHJ films.  Selectivity could be further improved by choosing laser photon excitation energies resonant with specific polymer forms (i.e., crystalline or amorphous regions).  Importantly, the spatial resolution obtained from our combined chemical and electrical imaging approach is comparable to scanned probe techniques that only expose topographical qualities of the BHJ films in non-ideal device environments.  Our top-down studies on polymer-based BHJ solar cells have revealed new views on the effect of microscopic morphology and subtle intermolecular interactions on material performance in functioning devices.  This information can now better guide materials scientists and engineers in developing new strategies to optimize BHJ morphology for improved device performance.\n\nThe bottom-up thrust of this research involved using new self-assembly approaches to control the manner in which large conjugated polymer semiconductor molecules pack within supramolecular aggregates.  This molecular level of structural control enabled new investigations of the fates of energy within these materials, which is of central importance for achieving efficient optoelectronic devices.  The experimental approach primarily used is single molecule spectroscopy whereby individual molecules or nanostructures can be interrogated one particle at a time thus bypassing heterogeneity effects frequently encountered.  My group was the first to demonstrate how the ordering within polymer supramolecular aggregates dictates the spatial extent and directions by which energy can propagate through these materials.  This was extended to investigations of injecting charges which followed similar pathways.  We then demonstrated how structural ordering influences conversion between diamagnetic and paramagnetic excited states w..."
