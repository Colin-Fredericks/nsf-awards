Harelstad\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V ATLANTIC EXPLORER operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS); namely closed circuit TV up-grades and a new RADAR.  The items requested will either improve safety or enhance the vessel?s science support capability. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences vessel supports federally funded scientific research throughout the Atlantic basin to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  The ATLANITC EXPLORER is the vessel that also routinely services the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) stations.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  All told, the ATLANTIC EXPLORER is scheduled to complete nearly 140 NSF sponsored days in 2010.",

Project Activities and Findings:\n\na)  Research \n\nShipboard Scientific Support awards for the R/V Atlantic Explorer provide the tools and equipment required to support scientific research and technology development which improves scientific knowledge of societal relevant environmental issues.\n\nMany of the major research projects that have used these vessels are oceanographic time-series efforts (http://www.bios.edu/research/time_series.html). For example, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) is an oceanographic time-series project funded by NSF.

This, in a very positive sense, has increased the demand for improved and upgraded ship equipment and instrumentation.   \n\n b) Education \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer operations are important contributors to education, training and public outreach.  Given the proximity of Hydrostation \"S\" and BATS to Bermuda, these cruises serve an important educational role in training future generations of potential oceanographers. At a time when fewer and fewer new scientists are going to sea, the importance of recruiting these new scientists and providing sea-going training experience is critical. \n\nThe R/V Atlantic Explorer also contains the only classroom in the UNOLS fleet that has been designed primarily for undergraduate education.\n\nII.
