 "awd_abstract_narration": "Full Center Proposal (Phase III) for an I/UCRC for the Center for  Design of Analog-Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC)\r\n\r\n0968877 Washington State University; John Ringo\r\n   \r\nCDADIC is proposing a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for central personnel, evaluation and research.  The lead of the proposed Center will be Washington State University (WSU) with site locations at the University of Washington (UW) and Oregon State University (OSU). \r\n \r\nCDADIC was established in 1989, and is currently a self-sustaining Center that continues to operate under the IUCRC model.  The Center's research focus is on the design and development of analog and mixed-signal circuits and systems.  While CDADIC has made numerous advances in this area over the past two decades, the demand for more advanced circuit design technology continues to grow as does the need to address the critical national concern of a shrinking domestic workforce in this field.  In the coming years, the Center will continue to provide new technology and highly trained employees for this industry.\r\n\r\nCDADIC has made significant contributions and will continue to do so to the semiconductor industry and society.  The Center has contributed to economic growth through new technology development and transfer, and new technologies have been transferred to industry over the years.  Industry partners provide a mechanism for the incorporation of Center output into commercial products.  The wider utilization of devices developed for DoD in commercial applications is a routine component of the Center business practices.  Since its inception, CDADIC has provided research and educational opportunities to approximately 500 students, with nearly 90% of its graduates going into industry.  CDADIC's educational objectives are well aligned with NSF goals, specifically the Center commitment to the integration of research and education in order to produce highly trained analog/mixed-signal designers for employment in industry.  Under-represented students are recruited through a variety of mechanisms such as REU awards, and recent related research funding resulted in a domestic student workforce development initiative. \r\n",
