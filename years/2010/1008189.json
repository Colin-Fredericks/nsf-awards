 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network project brings together Purdue University \r\nand the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain, to develop advanced \r\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques for investigating at \r\nhigh-resolution the material properties of viruses in relevant saline \r\nsolutions. The goal is to enable significant advances in understanding \r\nviral function or its mitigation in medicine or in the synthesis of a \r\nnew generation of nanomaterials using viruses for medicine, \r\nnanocomposites, sensors, and nanoelectronics. The proposed AFM \r\ntechniques use novel multi-frequency techniques such as multi-harmonic \r\nor bimodal AFM which can provide compositional contrast in liquids far \r\nexceeding conventional methods at much faster speeds and with much \r\ngreater sensitivity. The theory component of the proposed work attempts \r\nto distil metamodels from numerical simulations of mathematical models \r\nof AFM cantilevers tapping on samples in liquids, in order to link the \r\nobserved material contrast to quantitative measures of local material \r\nproperties. The experimental component of the proposal will investigate \r\nthe inherent heterogeneities of elastic stiffness and charge density of \r\nthe capsids of bacteriophages (phi 29 and T7) and eukaryotic viruses \r\n(minute virus of mice, and adenovirus) in solution and the influence of \r\nsub-surface DNA structure on the surface elasticity and charge of fully \r\nassembled viral capsids. The goal is to systematically investigate at \r\nhigh resolution the connection between DNA packing and capsid structure \r\nand the electromechanical properties of the assembled virus. An improved \r\nunderstanding of the structure-property-function relationships of \r\nviruses would not only broadly benefit medicine and virology, but it \r\nwould also be a great boon to the many emerging applications of viruses \r\nin materials science and nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to engage strongly with the materials and \r\nbiophysics communities, AFM industries, and to the larger AFM materials \r\ncommunity via cyber-enabled initiatives on the nanohub to ensure a wide \r\nranging impact of the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the \r\nOffice of International Science and Engineering.",
