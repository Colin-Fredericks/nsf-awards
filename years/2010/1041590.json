 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relativistic jets are generally found to occur in accreting black hole systems.  Recently, however, jets have also been seen in a few neutron star systems, implying that a relativistic jet needs only a compact relativistic star, and not necessarily a black hole.  This project consists of numerical simulations of relativistic jets from black holes and neutron stars using a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code, in order to identify similarities and differences in the two kinds of system.  Very recent preliminary work on this problem by Professor Narayan's finishing graduate student has led to very interesting results, and an opportunity has arisen at short notice to keep that student working on this problem before taking up his post-thesis appointment elsewhere.  There is clear intrinsic value to the research being done by the person most familiar with it, and this extension of his thesis research will provide this junior researcher with an opportunity to expand into a new area before moving on to the next stage of his career.\r\n\r\nThis award is made under the Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program.",
