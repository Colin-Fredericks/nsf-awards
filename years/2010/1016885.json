 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithmic game theory is a field that uses and extends tools from economics and game theory to reason about fundamental computer science problems and applications.  The PI will pursue a broad research agenda across three central subfields of algorithmic game theory. The first set of goals is to develop general analysis frameworks that can identify robust guarantees on the worst-case inefficiency of equilibria, and to consider measures of inefficiency other than the quality of a worst-case Nash equilibrium. The second set of goals concern developing novel worst-case analysis frameworks to inform the design of incentive-compatible auctions for revenue-maximization problems. The final goal is to apply computational complexity theory to explain rigorously certain barriers in economics and game theory, in particular in optimal mechanism design and in equilibrium computation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The goal of this research project was to develop new results in\ntheoretical computer science that are useful for reasoning about\nfundamental economic problems.\n \nFor example, consider the problem of selling items in an auction ---\nsuch as collectables on eBay, wireless spectrum to telecommunication\ncompanies in a government auction, or sponsored links to advertisers\nthrough a search engine auction.  How can a seller determine the best\noutcome (either for the seller or for society) even when there is\nlittle data about bidders' preferences?  What about when the\ntheoretically optimal auction is too complex for direct use?  Are\nthere simple auctions that are guaranteed to be approximately optimal?\n \nFor another example, consider a network (traffic, communication, etc.)\nin which end users choose their own routes.  How does the performance\nof such \"selfish routing\" compare to the theoretical optimum?  What\nkind of behavioral assumptions are necessary to prove that selfish\nusers attain outcomes that are close to optimal?   This research\nproject developed theory to help answer all of these questions.\n \nThe research project also involved the mentoring of PhD students,\ninnovation in graduate teaching, the dissemination of lecture videos\nand notes for graduate courses, the teaching of algorithmic\nfundamentals through massive online open courses, and the organization\nof both traditional and new meetings for the presentation and\ndiscussion of cutting-edge research.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tim Roughgarden"
