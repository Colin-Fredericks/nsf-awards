This conference will be structured around three workshops that focus on the following topics:  (1) the effect of varying element ratios on community structure at low trophic levels and food quality at mid and high trophic levels, 2) large-scale regional comparisons of marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem processes research approaches and results, and 3) sensitivity of marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles to enhanced stratification.  The National Science Foundation will sponsor the participation of 5 early career scientists in this meeting.  This will provide them with an opportunity to learn about new linkages between food webs and biogeochemical cycles, interact with senior scientists, and forge new collaborative efforts.",
