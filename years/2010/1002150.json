Ultra Wide Band radio is a promising technology for intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications since it is capable of achieving high-speed and robust transmissions within a short distance.  However, in-vehicle channels introduce dense and extended multi-path components into received signals, and are sensitive to the movement of drivers and passengers. Hence existing Ultra Wide Band technologies need to be redesigned when applied to an in-vehicle environment.  This collaborative project firstly addresses the differential code shifted reference technology to capture more signal energy without performing channel estimation leading to an enhanced bit-error rate performance in a low complexity.  Secondly, cognitive Ultra Wide Band radio will be used to proactively eliminate various in-band narrowband interferences. Finally, intra-vehicle control and communications systems necessitate an innovative research strategy and design methodology in order to meet the requirement on the coexistence of reliable real-time control message delivery and high-speed date communications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This collaborative project will improve the education quality of electrical engineering and technology programs by involving undergraduate and graduate students and will attract students, especially those from minority groups, to the fields of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology through seminars and demonstrations.  Moreover, the research will help American automotive companies become the worldwide leaders in intra-vehicle wireless control and communications applications, save costs up to billions of dollars per year, enhance the reliability of American made vehicles, offer customers attractive features for informatics and entertainments, and ultimately boost the sales of American automotive products.  Lastly, the outcomes of the research can be easily extended to other American industrial sectors, and hence increase the high-tech ingredient of American industry.",
