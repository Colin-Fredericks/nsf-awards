 "awd_abstract_narration": "Canada appears to be facing an era of debilitating political deadlock where deep-seated regional and ethno-linguistic cleavages prevent any single party from capturing a majority of seats in the Parliament. The last three elections have each resulted in a minority government, and a fourth consecutive minority government looks likely. Little is known about how citizens respond when democratic systems that, for a number of successive elections, produced stable governments with comfortable majorities switch to producing successive short-lived minority governments. \r\n\r\nGiven this context, this study focuses on the following topics. First, how does the seemingly endless procession of short-lived minority governments impact support for the Canadian political system?  Second, who do Canadians blame for the ongoing instability? Third, do Canadians desire significant institutional change and, if so, what changes do they want? Fourth, who do the citizens believe is responsible for the serious economic and political problems facing Canada? Fifth, how do citizens assign credit and blame to parties for handling (or failure to handle) these problems? Sixth and finally, how do these factors affect party choice and electoral turnout? \r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, the researchers use a two wave internet survey involving 3,000 respondents in the initial wave. The initial wave will occur prior to the election. The second wave will involve recontacts after the election with the initial set of interviewees. \r\n\r\nThe data from the survey will be made public within one year of the researchers receiving the data sets. In addition, this survey is modeled after the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The support from the National Science Foundation provides resources for a core set of questions on the survey. This allows other scholars to purchase modules on the survey to address specific questions of interest to them. They are able to stretch their own scarce resources by not having to pay for the core set of questions.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBy producing a majority government, the 2011 federal election ended a lengthy period of instability in Canadian national politics.  That period had begun in 2004 when the then new Conservative Party of Canada had nearly upset the Liberals.  Reducing the Liberals to a minority government in 2004, the CPC defeated them in 2006.  However, the Conservatives could not win a majority in either that election or in the subsequent one in 2008.  Throughout much of the 2011 campaign, it looked like the result would be yet another Conservative minority.  But, history did not repeat itself a third time.  Although their vote share was only two percent greater than it had been in 2008, the Conservatives benefitted from a very strong performance by the NDP and very weak ones by the Liberals and the Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois.  The result was two big winners and two big losers.  The CPC and the NDP were the big winners&mdash;the former party got its majority and the latter became the official opposition party in Ottawa for the first time since its predecessor, the CCF, was founded in 1932.  The big losers were the Liberals and the Bloc.  The Liberals were reduced to \"third party\" status for the first time in history with a meager contingent of 34 MPs, and the Bloc returned only 4 MPS.  Both Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff and BQ Leader, Gilles Duceppe lost their seats.        \n\n            The NSF funded election survey has allowed to understand what happened in the 2011 Canadian election, and why Canadians voted as they did.

The fact that the Conservatives won a majority government should not be taken as a sign that a majority of Canadians are especially enthusiastic about the CPC or any of the other choices on offer in federal politics.  Indeed, when non-voters are taken into account, one sees that the CPC won a majority government with the support of slightly less than one eligible voter in four.  The NDP was supported by less than one eligible voter in five, and the Liberals, by only slightly more than one eligible voter in ten. As in 2008,..."
