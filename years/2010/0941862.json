Prior NSF funding produced jGRASP, a software development environment that allows students to visualize their programs and data structures.  While jGRASP has been widely disseminated and has been met with a high degree of success, teachers do not use the data structure visualization features to their full potential.  Objectives of this project are to train teachers to use effective program visualization practices in the classroom and to develop a set of learning materials that integrate dynamic visualizations with appropriate teaching strategies.\r\n\r\nTwo summer workshops are the primary strategy for developing materials and training faculty.  The first workshop is designed to develop data structure visualizations and make plans for participants to use the materials during the following academic year.  The second workshop is designed to refine materials and to train additional teachers.  Expected outcomes include learning resources, data structure visualizations and a diverse community of trained faculty from high schools, community colleges and universities.  \r\n",
