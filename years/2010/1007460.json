The support is primarily aimed at graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, women and minorities. The conference is scheduled to be held on July 26-30, 2010 at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany. It follows a companion summer school in Braunschweig, July 22-24, 2010. \r\n\r\nLevy processes are at the crossroad of many different mathematical disciplines such as Fourier analysis, potential theory, partial differential equations, fractal analysis, and various branches of stochastics. At the same time, Levy processes are now being used in a great variety of scientific and engineering problems, and as a result, a host of new mathematical problems have arisen. Essential use of the theory of Levy processes occur in disparate fields such as mathematical finance, insurance, telecommunications, extreme values theory, quantum theory, meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics, and many other areas. \r\n\r\nConferences on Levy Processes foster cross-fertilization of ideas and help researchers to enter into these ares of vital and often interdisciplinary research. A central theme of this proposal is to help make the conference, as well as its satellite summer school, accessible to junior researchers and graduate students in the United States.",
