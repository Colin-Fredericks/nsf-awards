The workshop is scheduled for March 18-20, 2010 in Arlington, VA. The goals of the workshop are to (1) address the challenges and opportunities presented by a common assessment tool; (2) share best practices in developing, implementing, and assessing Ethics/Responsible Conduct of Research training; (3) share ideas for improving individual program implementation; and (4) discuss best practices in student recruitment, development, and tracking, and mentor training. The goals will be accomplished through presentations and panel discussions by experts, through opportunities for discussion and networking among participants, through a poster session, and through a final report to be submitted to NSF summarizing the workshop findings. An existing website (http://www.bioreu.org) will be used to register participants, solicit poster abstracts, collect information from participants that will inform the development of a final agenda, and to identify individuals who volunteer to become facilitators, reporters and scribes for the breakout sessions. Over 150 participants are expected, and a Leadership Committee has been formed to assist in the planning. The PI, Robyn Hannigan, may be contacted at Robyn.Hannigan@umb.edu.",

Given that\nBIO REU programs, nationally, provide meaningful hands-on research and training to our future scientific leaders the 2010 BIOLOGY REU Workshop enabled community input into the development of new infrastructure to enable (1) assessment of student learning gains, (2) training in scientific ethics, and\n(3) travel support for students to present their research at scientific meetings.
