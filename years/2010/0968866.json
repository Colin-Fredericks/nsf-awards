The emphasis will be on the way these lasers remove electrons from matter, and how these processes can be controlled by using parameters of the laser (such as intensity and polarization) as control knobs.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The use of intense lasers in the physical and biological sciences has opened up new frontiers for research and applications. The research described here will have an impact on all disciplines which rely on using current or projected laser sources. Students will be trained in the use of new computational procedures, which are applicable across disciplines also.",

This is a high-stakes issue in laser physics since the returning electron, by carrying back the energy it absorbed from the laser, can act as the agent of many key processes in intense laser physics, including the structural analysis of macromolecules and the design of new light sources through generation of ultrahigh harmonics.  When the laser is linearly polarized, the \"recollision\", \"rescattering\" or  \"three-step\" model, consisting of \"ionization / travel in the laser field / return to the core\" (all along the direction of polarization) has been immensely successful in both interpreting current experiments and devising new ones.
