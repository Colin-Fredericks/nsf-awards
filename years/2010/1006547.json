 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are a group of smart materials capable of changing their color reversibly in response to external stimuli, such as electric field (electrochromism) and light (photochromism), etc. Smart devices based on TMOs have extensive applications in energy saving, conversion, and storage, providing great potentials to help solve the current globe energy crisis. The goal of this project is to realize the selective growth of TMO nanowires without the assistance of catalysts, and study their electrochromic properties in applications of nanoscale smart devices with enhanced performance. The research activities in this project will allow participants to develop solid knowledge on fundamental science, accumulate experience with comprehensive research tools, and enhance their communication skills with experts in different research fields. This project also promotes current activities in the nanoscale science and engineering program and the emerging materials research at UNC Charlotte to create highly interdisciplinary environment for integrated research and education for both graduate and undergraduate students, including minority students. Research results will be broadly disseminated through conference proceedings and journal publications, and will be integrated into existing and new educational courses.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Selective growth of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures is essential for large scale device integration, but so far the selective growth of 1D nanostructures is dominated by catalyst-assisted processes that are not suitable for electrochromic applications. This research project targets creating non-catalyst selective growth of TMO nanowires by surface nucleation control. The work will reveal the growth mechanism which will enable excellent controls on growth sites, orientation, alignment, and doping of nanowires for device fabrication. TMO nanowires are expected to have enhanced electrochromic properties in response speed and coloration efficiency with their reduced dimensions and enhanced surface area. The research activities will produce a fundamental understanding of electrochromism in nanostructures and establish the structure-property-performance relation for TMO nanowires to improve their electrochromic performance by fine structure controls. This research project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research topics such as materials synthesis and characterization, microdevice fabrication, electrical/optical property measurement, and electrochromic property testing.",
