 "awd_abstract_narration": "While transformations to an aquatic lifestyle have been intensely studied in organisms ranging from insects to whales, basic questions remain unanswered for birds: e.g., how many times has 'aquatic flight' been gained and aerial flight lost? A large collaborative team will focus on resolving the controversial evolutionary relationships of wing-propelled diving birds (including new fossils). Phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to investigate musculoskeletal, neurosensory, and feather microstructure changes across aerial to aquatic flight transitions. Techniques such as X-ray computed tomography, histology, and computer modeling will also be utilized.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts focus on interdisciplinary undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in systematics, histology and biomechanics. Highlights include a mentored research experience for undergraduate students from under-represented groups. Public outreach and education activities include co-instruction of a 3 year Geoscience module of the nationally-recognized UTeach secondary school teacher preparation program, Expanding Your Horizons workshops to encourage young women to pursue science careers, web-cast lectures and distribution of curricular materials via university and museum  programs, and a dedicated blog.  Broad dissemination of research findings is achieved through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and data sharing via online databases.",
