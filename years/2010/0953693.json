 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes program of the Chemistry Division is co-funded by the Biomolecular Systems Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. The award supports work by Professor Ekaterina Pletneva at Dartmouth College to probe and then rationally modulate mechanisms of conformational switching in signaling proteins. The studies will determine how redox chemistry and ligand binding combine with the protein folding dynamics to afford function. Kinetic measurements of gated electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer will serve as analytical tools to quantitatively characterize structural changes in proteins and thus experimentally map energy landscapes of protein folding and function. Teaching efforts will bring elements of modern research into upper-level and introductory chemistry courses including opportunities for undergraduates to influence science through critical writing. Professor Pletneva and her students work on the Women in Science project at Dartmouth and reach out to local science teachers and their students, establishing connections with a young generation of prospective scientists. These studies advance understanding of many biological systems where conformational changes govern function and provide valuable insights for the design of protein-based switchable devices for use in electronic nanocircuits and artificial photosynthesis. Rational manipulation of protein folding and switchable behavior will be an important step toward these engineering applications.",

Many of the above functions depend on the ligand coordinated to the heme iron as well as the structure of the protein <em>and</em> its rearrangements (conformational switching, Figure 2). This project has primarily focused on the heme proteins in which changes in the oxidation state of iron (Fe<sup>II</sup> or Fe<sup>III</sup>) are linked to ligand substitution (Figure 3) with the goals to probe and rationally modulate mechanisms of these poorly understood functional transformations. Such rearrangements are commonly encountered in sensor proteins and affect the catalytic function of enzymes. In addition to bringing fundamental knowledge, elucidating the mechanistic principles of these biological phenomena has the potential to guide the design of new types of drugs that target protein redox activity, as well as of switchable components for molecular electronics and artificial photosynthesis.</p>\n<p>We have targeted native sensors (GSU proteins from <em>Geobacter sulfurreducens</em>) as well as model systems that we have engineered (&ldquo;switchable&rdquo; variants of cytochrome c). A robust cytochrome c<em> </em>template with a pliable loop that surrounds the heme was used to create a series of His-to-Met and Cys-to-X (X=Met, His, Lys) redox switches; over twenty new variants of cytochrome c<em> </em>(with modifications at the heme ligand and surrounding polypeptide) have been prepared and characterized. These<em> </em>model proteins have offered a detailed characterization of redox-dependent stability, protonation, and redox interconversions of hemes, shedding light on the forces that control ligation and redox reactivity of these key bioinorganic centers.</p>\n<p>Thermodynamic stability measurements on ferric and ferrous proteins, electrochemistry experiments, and model binding studies of small heme peptides have revealed that, while trends in metal-ligand binding affinities mirror the preference for a particular ligation in a given oxidation state, the protein scaffold and solvent interactions may significantly alter the redox-dependent protein stability. Kinetic experiments have illustrated that the nature of the dissociating ligand as well as variations in local protein conformational dynamics define the ligand switching rates. Modifications targeting the hydrogen-bonding network of cytochrome c<em> </em>yielded several variants in which the native ligand Met is replaced by a Lys residue in the ferric protein, the ligation also found in the alkaline form of cytochrome c. Our recent crystal structure of Lys-ligated cytochrome c<em> </em>has revealed a surprisingly compact protein fold, distinct from the native structure, with the heme coordination loop refolded into a &beta;-hairpin. The structure provided fine mechanistic details of the transformation of cytochrome c<em> </em>into the alkaline form, a conformation with proposed roles in oxidative phosphorylation and apoptosis.</p>\n<p>We have also evaluated the highly-relevant relationship between conformational flexibility and ET reactivity. As we have seen in our studies, protein rearrangements can become a rate-controlling step in redox transformations. We have demonstrated that added polypeptide flexibility in the electron path could greatly accelerate ET rates. Photoinduced ET studies of a molten-globule form of cytochrome c, a conformational state with a highly flexible tertiary structure, have identified that protein refolding controls ET rates. That work has demonstrated that the protein redox function is intimately connected to the folding landscape and suggested a role of biologically relevant changes in protein dynamics in dramatically altering ET rates.</p>\n<p>New chemical reagents for protein labeling have been developed to overcome common challenges of double labeling in studies of protein dynamics.
