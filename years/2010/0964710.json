 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information systems that handle personal information must adhere to\r\nlegal regulations, corporate privacy policies, and contractual\r\nagreements designed to protect personal privacy.  Relying exclusively\r\non application designers and developers for such assurances is\r\nunrealistic.  There is a need for methods and tools that can identify\r\nerrors in the handing of personal data and provide formal assurances\r\nthat personal information is handled appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a software development framework that uses\r\nnovel language-based techniques to ensure that software enforces\r\nprivacy policies.  Privacy policies (based on legal and regulatory\r\nrequirements) are formally specified in temporal logic, and identify\r\ncircumstances under which information can be shared (based on criteria\r\nsuch as the roles of individuals involved, prior events, and whether\r\nthe data has been aggregated) and future obligations that are incurred\r\nas a result of the information sharing.  The framework consists of\r\npolicy analysis tools, a programming language, program analysis tools\r\nthat verify both privacy and declassification policies are enforced,\r\nand a runtime environment.  Used in concert, these components produce\r\ndistributed information systems that verifiably handle personal\r\ninformation appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe framework being developed by this project will address problems\r\nfaced by many information systems.  However, the project will focus\r\nespecially on the needs of the medical industry, both with respect to\r\npatient records and clinical trials.  As medical practice transitions\r\nto electronic medical records, the need for high-assurance systems\r\nbecomes increasingly acute.  This project will develop the\r\ncapabilities needed to verify that electronic medical records\r\nsystems comply with applicable privacy policies.",
