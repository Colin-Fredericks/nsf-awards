 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Michael Jochim and students from the University of California, Santa Barbara will carry out a two-year program of archaeological survey and excavations in southern Germany.  The goal of this work is to gain a deeper understanding of how populations in the region coped with and adjusted to the dramatic environmental changes at the end of the last ice age by testing three models of cultural change.  With the rapid environmental warming that occurred ca. 12,000 - 10,000 years ago, the environment underwent enormous changes in vegetation and animal life, forcing groups of hunter-gatherers to alter their subsistence, patterns of settlement, and social organization.  The general pattern of these adjustments is known, but various regions of Europe show considerable differences in the timing and exact nature of these adjustments.  Southern Germany, just north of the Alps, is an area where the environmental changes were most drastic, undergoing a transformation from ice sheets and open tundra to closed, mixed forests within a few thousand years.  The current archaeological record from this area, however, does not allow for a detailed examination of the cultural changes that occurred in response.  This project will build upon earlier research and address the deficiencies in current knowledge by 1) locating and excavating new sites that provide preservation of bone and wooden artifacts in addition to stone tools and 2) enlarging the sample of artifacts from surface sites in a variety of different locations by fieldwalking.  The project will focus on two formerly large lakes (the Federsee and Pfrunger Ried) and their hinterlands where considerable background research has already been carried out.\r\n\r\nThe immediate goal of this research is to obtain greater understanding of the behavioral adjustments to the end of the ice age in this region.  In a broader sense, this research provides a case study for investigating cultural changes elsewhere during this period and for understanding the processes of hunter-gatherer adaptation to environmental change in general, by identifying the combination and sequence of different areas of behavioral adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe educational impact will include the further development of a regional archaeological database in a well-studied region that will be made available to other scholars.  Moreover, this project will continue the exposure of American students to European sites and scholarship that has been ongoing for the past 29 years.  The PI has long-standing relationships with the University of T\u00fcbingen and the State Office of Historic Preservation of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg that has facilitated such interaction, and previous fieldwork projects have included participation of German students in excavations, special tours of ongoing Palaeolithic and Neolithic excavations, lectures and demonstrations of flint-knapping, and participation in experimental projects.  All materials will be curated with the Landesmuseum in Stuttgart, Germany after analysis in Santa Barbara.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe major goal ot this project was to gather information about  sites of the Late Palaeolithic and Early Mesolithic periods of southern Germany (roughly 12,000 - 7000 BC) in order to investigate changes in patterns of land use as part of the responses to dramatic environmental changes at the end of the last ice age, when open steppe-tundras were replaced by closed forests.  Three different possible patteerns of response derived from ecological theory and detailed environmental reconstructions were to be tested.\n\n\nThe techniques used included surface collecting of artifacts from plowed fields where sites had been previously identified, using trenches and broader excavations in new potential sites around former lakeshores, and study of existing artifact collections held by museums and private collectors.\n \nA total of 50 known surface sites were visited, yielding thousands of artifacts.  Collections from two museums and one private individual added another 2000 artifacts to the study materials.  Nine locations around lakeshores were investigated with excavations; eight of these produced stone artifacts and four had animal bones as well.  Information from all of these sources were added to a large database that will be made available to U.S. and German scholars.  Artifacts will ultimately be stored in Germany with the State Office of Historic Preservation in Stuttgart.  \n\n\nAmong results was the finding that during the Late Palaeolithic, when the first pine and birch forests developed, groups were small and highly mobile, in contrast to earlier ice age inhabitants.  Campsites of these forest dwellers were largely confined to the shores of large lakes and the Danube Valley and their subsistence was based primarily on large game, including moose, red deer, and wild horse.  Later Mesolithic groups, who inhabitated mixed coniferous and deciduous forests also emphasized large game, but increasingly included more small mammals, birds, fish and freshwater shellfish into their diets.  Moreover, their campsites showed much more variation in size and location and were much more numerous as well.\n \nThese results suggest that the initial responses to the environmental changes included shifting from hunting herd animals like reindeer to the pursuit of more solitary forest game, increasing mobility, and restricting settlement to the most productive areas in what was otherwise a rather homogeneous environment.  Through time, the environmental changes created a more diverse mosaic of different vegetation and a greater diversity of animal prey.  Subsistence broadened to include greater diversity of food sources.  Campsites similarly were located in a greater diversity of locations in order to take advantage of the seasonally changing distribution of animal prey.  Some plant foods, including hazelnuts, also began to appear in the diet.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Jochim"
