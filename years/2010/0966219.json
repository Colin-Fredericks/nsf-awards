The project develops new support mechanisms including multi-disciplinary seminars, industry forum, and online academic/social networking to compliment mature student support services, such as learning community and co-ops/interns.  Interactions among students and industry professionals help increase the focus and interest of students, enhance the educational experience of students, and build a relationship of feedback and exchange for students' ongoing success.  Women and underrepresented minorities are also being recruited as participants of the project. An independent evaluator is involved in project evaluation.",
