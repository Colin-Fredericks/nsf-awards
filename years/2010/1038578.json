A strongly polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming would be a breakthrough in complexity theory over the real field. It may lead to improved algorithms for harder types of\r\nconvex programming (e.g., semidefinite) which (albeit in polynomial time) are currently prohibitively slow.  Better algorithms for matrix preconditioning have the potentially to significantly improve linear algebra software packages.",
