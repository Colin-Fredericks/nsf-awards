 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meiosis is the specialized cell division that halves cell DNA content to generate gametes, which then fused during sexual reproduction. Although meiosis is widespread, some species undergo meiosis despite lacking genes that are required for meiosis in other species. Little is known about why some species have lost meiosis genes but not meiosis. This project will investigate whether lichens, mutually beneficial coexisting fungi and algae, harbor changes in meiosis genes associated with this form of symbiosis. DNA from multiple species of fungi and algae that form lichens will be searched for gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses will compare 17 meiotic genes from multiple lichens to determine whether lichenization is associated with loss or rapid sequence change of meiosis genes. \r\n\r\nBy characterizing the effects of symbiotic coexistence upon lichenized fungal and algal reproduction, this project will provide an important comparison for other symbioses (e.g. pathogens, mutualists). This project will also further our understanding of how meiosis genes vary while the overall process remains intact. Aspects of this work will be incorporated into on-going educational activities, including high school and undergraduate student research mentoring and annual public-access seminars.",

However, some species have functional meiosis despite having lost genes critical for meiosis in other species. Therefore, determining which species have lost meiosis genes without damaging meiosis is important to understanding how meiosis can sometimes vary without failing.\n\n Some fungi have the pattern described above: they undergo meiosis and sex without meiosis genes critical in other species.  Which factors allow some fungi to lose meiosis genes without harmful consequences? Is it how frequently they have sexual reproduction? Is it whether they cause diseases or not?  One factor could be mutualistic symbiosis, where two species coexist such that each species survives and reproduces better together.  This predicts both species will evolve combinations of genes and genetic variation that work well together.  If so, asexual reproduction&mdash;producing offspring identical to parents&mdash;may be best: every offspring inherits genotypes that work with genotypes of the symbiosis partner.  Sex may not always be beneficial because offspring will be genetically different from parents, and their genotypes may not work well with the symbiosis partner. \n\nWe investigated meiosis genes in lichens: fungi and algae in a mutualistic symbiosis.

We also surveyed publicly available genome sequences of non-lichen-forming relatives.  Of multiple different species of lichenized fungi and algae found to have Rad51 (a gene coding a protein functioning in meiosis and mitosis), five had Dmc1 and/or Mnd1 (genes encoding proteins that work in a complex and function only in meiosis).  Some of these species are not known sexuals, so our findings predict that meiosis happens under unknown conditions.  Another five species did not have detected Dmc1 or Mnd1.  \n\nTo efficiently study more meiosis genes within a single lichen, \"NextGen\" genome sequencing was performed on a lichen containing the fungus Physcia and algae Trebouxia.  Initial data assemblies were prepared and the best version of the Physcia/Trebouxia genomes will be made publicly accessible.  Trebouxia was a \"typical\" green alga: it had the same core set of meiosis genes in non-lichenized green algae.  Physcia had most of the meiosis genes as non-lichenized fungi, but did not have Pch2 or Hop1.  These genes have been independently lost together in several non-lichenized fungi; future work can explore what properties Physcia has in common with species that lost these genes and whether their meiosis changed.  We started work applying the same \"NextGen\" sequencing to several lichenized Xanthomendoza fungi, but on-going troubleshooting will delay release of the genome sequences to the public.\n\nMany lichenized fungi and algae seem to have the same set of meiosis genes as non-lichenized relatives or, forPhyscia, have independently lost meiosis genes following the same patterns as in non-lichenized relatives (i.e., Pch2 and Hop1 lost together).  However, having the same genes could st..."
