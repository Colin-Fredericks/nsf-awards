 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is realization of Networked Mobile Assistive Systems (NMASs) that allow people to receive physical assistance and rehabilitation treatments anywhere, at any time with feedback regarding adequacy and appropriateness of training. The approach taken will consist of two major elements: a body-sensor network and a highly reliable wireless network. Most of the data acquired from a body-sensor network and the algorithms for the control of mobile power assistive devices will be stored on a host server, and users will access the system with any portable computer while receiving appropriate assistance and rehabilitation treatment. The networked systems will also allow doctors to observe the stored information without compromising the important, sensitive personal interactions between the provider and the patient.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will contribute to the improved quality of life for physically impaired people (young or old) who have problems with community mobility and specific gait limitations. It will also provide a powerful tool to physical therapists in the treatment of patients. The project team consists of two PI's from Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and a consultant from Physical Therapy. This team uniquely links engineering with clinical applications. The interdisciplinary research opportunities will be made available to engineering students and students in physical therapy. The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) at the University of California, Berkeley provides a unique environment and opportunity to the team to interact and share research findings with other researchers and students.\r\n\r\nThe project is an Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Project jointly funded by ENG/CMMI and CISE/CNS.",
