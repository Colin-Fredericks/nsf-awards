 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit resulting from the proposed research of the Stony Brook NSF supported particle physics group, Experimental Studies of Fundamental Symmetries, will be the provision of new understanding of underlying causes for the breaking of the symmetry in the fundamental forces of nature. The symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak forces is observed to occur above the 100 GeV scale, but is broken at low energy. The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter posits the Higgs mechanism, resulting in an observable new particle (the Higgs boson), which induces the symmetry breaking, and gives mass to all observed quarks, leptons and gauge bosons. Though logically consistent, this mechanism is widely believed to be an incomplete and a probably flawed explanation. New phenomena are likely to exist which could point the way to further unification of forces and identify a candidate for the dark matter in the universe. New experimental data are essential to discover how Nature has chosen to extend the SM. These questions will be explored in  two experimental programs, one  at the ATLAS experiment at the CERN and the other being  D\u00d8 research at the Fermilab Tevatron. \r\nThe broader impact of the program touches several areas. The group  will develop improved training programs for high school physics teachers, support the Mariachi Project that installs detectors to sense high energy cosmic ray showers in high school classrooms across the region, allowing students to collaborate through a computer grid in measuring their properties and to learn experimental skills, and to continue to give talks on physics research, accelerators and technological spinoffs to general audiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe one year NSF grant \"Experimental Studies of Fundamental Symmetries\" awarded to Stony Brook  University researchers Paul Grannis, Roderich Engelmann, Robert McCarthy, Dean Schamberger and Dmitri Tsybychev began in 2010.   Our research centered on the continuing program with the D&Oslash; experiment at the Fermilab proton antiproton collider and on initial operations and data analysis using the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland.\n\nIn prior grants, we built the signal processing electronics for the D&Oslash; calorimeters, the detectors that measure the energies of particles emerging from a collision, and built the high voltage system for the ATLAS calorimeter.   During this grant we led the D&Oslash; calorimeter operations effort and expanded our responsibilities in ATLAS.  Based on our earlier leadership in the D&Oslash; silicon strip vertex detector, we are responsible for building and testing a similar device, now based on pixels, to enable ATLAS to meet the increased LHC event rate.\n\nIn a previous grant, we measured the W boson mass at D&Oslash; to a precision of 5 parts in 10,000, the most accurate determination yet of this fundamental quantity.  It is important to know the W boson mass accurately since it can indicate the mass of the Higgs boson postulated as the source of mass to all elementary particles.  In the current grant, we embarked on a new W mass measurement using four times as much data.  New challenges had to be overcome to meet the higher instantaneous collision rate.   The analysis is nearing completion.\n\nWe searched for the Higgs boson at D&Oslash; directly in final states containing tau leptons from the Higgs decay and a conference publication reported this analysis. No single search is capable of uncovering the Higgs boson but our results, with several others, led to the exclusion of some Higgs masses and are closing in on the remaining windows.\n\nUsing D&Oslash; data we have also explored the CP symmetry that postulates that Nature treats particles and antiparticles on an equal footing, but is manifestly broken in our universe of matter only.  We previously measured the extremely rapid oscillation between particles containing a bottom quark and an anti-strange quark to their anti-particles, thus constraining possible new massive particles.  In this grant year, we published an analysis that set new limits on the CP violation in these particles.\n\nWe have trained three PhD students and one postdoctoral researchers on D&Oslash; during the grant period.   With our colleagues, we published about 50 refereed papers in leading journals over the past year, and played leading oversight roles for guiding about eight of them.\n\nIn ATLAS, we had developed many of the tools needed to calibrate the energy measurements of electrons, photons and, from the measured imbalance of momentum in events, unseen particles like neutrinos.  Our energy calibration methods were published in the past grant year and were adopted as standards by ATLAS.   We have developed new detectors for measuring the short-lived particles such as bottom quarks within the harsh radiation environment of the LHC.  We have initiated analyses with the new data from the LHC to measure the rate of production of W bosons, both alone and in conjunction with quark jets, and have established a search for Supersymmetry, a prime candidate to supplant the Standard Model, using combinations of electrons and missing momentum.  We published new limits on the masses of leptoquarks produced in 7 TeV collisions.\n\nIn this year, we have trained four students and four postdocs in our ATLAS program. With our colleagues we published about 50 papers, one with primary authorship, were instrumental in five summer 2011 conference papers, and were primary authors of six papers detailing the performance of the ATLAS detector.\n\nWe have been leaders in making the case for a new project, the International Linear Collider, which we believe will be ne..."
