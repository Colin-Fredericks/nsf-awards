 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S. participants in a Madrid-based semester-long sequence of technical research workshops, courses, collaborative visits, and an international conference in a subject area at the boundary of traditional control theory and combinatorial algebra.  The three-month sequence of events is motivated by recent innovations in combinatorial algebra, particularly combinatorial Hopf algebras, and their powerful application in numerical integration and control.  \r\n\r\nThe program consists of:\r\n*  A week-long technical workshop in early April in Madrid. The goal is to bring together experts and young innovators from different areas, survey the state of the art in each, and forge consensus on research topics in which swift progress is feasible.\r\n*  A mid-April week-long school in Zaragoza, Spain aimed at graduate students and postdocs in mathematics, physics, and related areas who are planning to do research in the field of control and modern combinatorics.  Four established researchers in these fields will lead the school, which is to include lectures and problem sets.  \r\n*  A month-long advanced course on combinatorics relevant to control, offered in Madrid in May.  \r\n*  Focused research collaborations.  Small teams of two to four researchers will collaborate in Madrid for periods from two to four weeks during mid-April to mid-June on the research themes identified in the workshop.  It is intended that these collaborations will connect creative young talents with experienced leaders in the fields.  \r\n*  A week-long International Conference  held in Madrid in June. Participants of the preceding events will present their results, redefine objectives for future research, and lay the foundation for future collaborations.  \r\n\r\nThe activity promises to build new long-term international research collaborations and to catalyze research in this promising interdisciplinary area.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://dftuz.unizar.es/coco2010/",
