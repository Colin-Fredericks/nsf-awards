 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mammalian herbivores are a significant driver of plant species composition in tallgrass prairie.  Despite their demonstrated importance and ubiquity in prairies, considerable uncertainty remains concerning the interactive effects of mammalian herbivores in prairie ecosystems. This project will use an existing long-term prairie restoration with sites of different ages to examine the interactive effects of three dominant herbivore species -- deer, rabbits, and voles -- on plant community composition and rates of soil carbon and nutrient cycling.  Herbivore exclosures will be established in prairies of different ages to determine how the influence of herbivory changes through time.\r\n\r\nThis work will improve our understanding of the role of herbivory in restored prairie ecosystems.  Prairie restorations rarely take into account the importance of herbivores, thus the project has important implications for the management and restoration of grassland ecosystems.  This research will integrate research, outreach, and education with undergraduate students, K-12 students, and the community.  The project will recruit students from underrepresented groups for summer research opportunities for undergraduates. In addition, the proximity of the project to the college campus provides opportunities for both K-12 and community education.  Finally, the project will enhance undergraduate education in ecology through the development of new inquiry-based laboratory activities.",

This study was established to determine the relative importance of different herbivore species in restored prairie, the changes in the importance of herbivore impacts as restored prairie ecosystems develop over time, and the interactive effects of multiple herbivore species on community composition and ecosystem processes. To date, the project has resulted in two peer-reviewed publications (both with undergraduate co-authors), three conference presentations, two presentations at the local middle school, and presentations and newspaper articles at Carleton College.
