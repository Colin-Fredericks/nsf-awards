 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 27 February 2010 Chilean earthquake generated a large transpacific tsunami and controversy as to what some have referred to as overly conservative warning issued for Hawaii and Japan. We propose to conduct a rapid reconnaissance survey of the coastline of Chile and offshore islands of Santa Maria, Juan Fernandez and Easter, and the Marquesas in French Polynesia. The survey will interview eyewitnesses to determine the local tsunami kinematics, i.e., polarity of the first arrival, interval between waves and which wave in the train was the largest- and the societal response. The team will measure inundation distances and runup heights and will attempt to identify why the tsunami-related death toll in Chile is concentrated in a few specific locales. The questions that will be addressed include whether certain areas were tsunami traps and whether the observed runup height distribution around the Pacific was predictable, using existing numerical methods and forecast technology. The team will survey in the period between March 6 and March 24, since tsunami watermarks are highly ephemeral, and will coordinate closely with UNESCO, international and Chilean colleagues and their students.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",

Ancestral tsunami knowledge from the 1960 event combined with education and evacuation exercises prompted most coastal residents to spontaneously evacuate after the earthquake. This partial success was overshadowed by the vast majority of tsunami victims being campers and tourists, a population that is not easily reached by community-based education. The international tsunami survey team (ITST) was deployed within days of the event and surveyed 800 km of coastline from Quintero to Mehu&iacute;n and the Pacific Islands of Santa Mar&iacute;a, Mocha, Juan Fern&aacute;ndez Archipelago, and Rapa Nui (Easter). The collected survey data include more than 400 tsunami flow depth, runup and coastal uplift measurements [Fritz et al., 2011]. The tsunami peaked with a localized runup of 29 m on a coastal bluff at Constituci&oacute;n. The observed runup distributions exhibit significant variations on local and regional scales.

A follow-up survey from May 21 to 23, 2010 focused on Mocha Island. Aerial reconnaissance flights were conducted between Pelluhue and the Arauco peninsula as well as over Robinson Crusoe and Mocha Islands.
