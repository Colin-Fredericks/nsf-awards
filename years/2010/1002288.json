Adverse weather conditions degrade the performance of the system, causing increased bit error rate (BER), packet loss and network delays, as well as decreased network throughput. The objective of this project is to design a hybrid optical/RF system that is resistive to degradations caused by poor optical channel condition due to atmospheric turbulence. Combinations of experimental research and theoretical modeling will be utilized to realize such a system. The research will include the design of an optical transceiver that will efficiently handle optical transmission using different wavelengths while maintaining a light-weight optical interface and consuming minimal power. The research will examine the use of proper wavelengths for data transmission to minimize the influence of weather and maximize range without increasing transmission power. Current optical channel estimation algorithms will be examined and suitable ones will be developed based on multi-frame averaging. Estimation will be carried out using available wavelengths. The hardware design and software algorithms for the most current methods of pointing, acquiring, and tracking (PAT) will be examined to support optical communication between mobile aerial vehicles and stationary vehicles fixed at pre-determined, known locations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The direct impact of the proposed project is the development of a unique optical transceiver, which will implement multiple wavelengths. Results of the work would make free-space optics a viable option for various wireless applications. Hence, the demand for all-time connectivity that is currently satisfied through the use of RF technologies may shift toward using optical technologies. This could aid by curbing the rapid increase in RF noise level caused by the almost daily introduction of a number of various RF devices. Results of the work have airborne Internet and battlefield communication applications. Graduate students will be trained, and a major undergraduate training program is leveraged.",

The first of these methods, called wavelength diversity, attempts to exploit the fact that different wavelengths of light can pass through a particular level of turbulence or type of weather better than others, which would allow the system to operate at a higher level. The complication is that the lenses and other optical components used in the system also behave differently at different wavelengths, which could cancel out the benefits from using a given wavelength.  The research used computer models and experimental studies to test the method.  One key result was that, although the choice of wavelength did change the performance of the system somewhat &ndash; either the number of errors in the collected data or the ability to overcome errors in aligning the transmitter and receiver changed &ndash; the system could maintain communication at any of the wavelengths used without having to retune the system each time the wavelength was changed.  This suggests that the system could switch to the best wavelength choice, or use multiple wavelengths, for achieving the best performing system, and the only penalty paid was the time required to switch from one wavelength to the other.  The ability to adapt the system as needed to changing atmospheric conditions had not been achieved in any other optical wireless communication system design to date.\n\nThe second method examined during the project, called transceiver diversity, explores the possibility that there are multiple optical sources at the transmitter and/or multiple optical detectors at the receiver, which provide multiple possible pathways for a signal to be successfully transmitted.  In such a case, an algorithm is needed to select which combination of source and detector is the best one at any time.  The research examined three different algorithms, called switch-and-examine, switch and stay, and switch to dominant combining, which provided three different approaches to maintaining a properly functioning communication channel. One key result was that all methods reduced the amount of monitoring and switching operations that the electronic processors must perform, which simplified how the receiver operated and shortened the time required to switch from a failing pathway to a pathway that would allow communication to proceed.  A second key result was that the reduction in operations by the processor was greatest for switch and stay combining in general.  The third key results was that the choice of threshold power &ndash; the power below which a pathway was determined to be failing &ndash; used within the algorithm strongly determined both the reduction in processing and the number of errors occurring in the system.  The simplification and reduced processing demands of the receiver make these algorithms attractive for use in any optical wireless system using transceiver diversity, and is particularly attractive for mobile optical wireless systems that have operating limits on size, weight, and the amount of power they have available.\n\nSeveral broader impacts arose from the research work.  First, the results indicated that transceiver diversity can be combined with wavelength diversity in several different combinations to create a system suitable for use in a wide variety of applications, with particular emphasis on mobile communications applications. Both methods can be implemented within optical wireless modules without greatly increasing size, weight or power consumption, m..."
