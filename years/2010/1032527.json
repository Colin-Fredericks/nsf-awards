 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering(BRIGE) grant will be used to determine how microscopic mechanical properties contribute to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mobility. MSCs are bone marrow-derived adult stem cells that are involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration. In the body, their recruitment to tumor or wound tissues is mediated by soluble proteins often released from hypoxic (oxygen-deprived) tissues. In the lab, MSC treatment with soluble proteins or hypoxia increases MSC migration. The proposed studies will systematically characterize the effects of tumor-secreted soluble proteins and/or hypoxia on the microscopic mechanical properties of MSCs. The mechanical response of a cell to chemical or physical stimuli is regulated by the cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of protein filaments extending throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoskeletal filaments are linked to adhesion molecules in the extracellular environment by focal adhesion complexes. The organization of cytoskeletal filaments and focal adhesion complexes changes rapidly during cell migration. Using quantitative real-time microscopy techniques, including particle tracking microrheology and time-lapsed fluorescent microscopy, the effects of selected stimuli on intracellular rheology, cytoskeletal organization (including cytoskeletal filaments and focal adhesion proteins), and interaction with cell adhesion molecules will be monitored. Together these techniques will be used to identify the mechanical and adhesive properties of migratory MSCs.\r\n\r\nMSCs are good candidates for the development of cell-based therapeutics. They can be easily harvested from bone marrow, expanded in the lab, genetically manipulated, and differentiated into different types of tissues. However, ex vivo expansion of MSCs alters their morphology limiting their mobility after reinfusion.  The studies will provide fundamental information that will be used to optimize the migratory behavior of expanded MSCs. If the research is successful, these studies may provide a new strategy for the delivery of MSC-based therapeutics.",

MSCs are highly proliferative adult stem cells that are involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration. The migration of MSCs from the bone marrow to the tissues is mediated by soluble factors, such as proteins and small molecules, which circulate in the blood. Previous studies have demonstrated the important role of these soluble factors in mediating MSC migration; however, changes in the microscopic mechanical properties that contribute to migration were not well understood. \n \nThis career development plan utilized sophisticated microscopy techniques to quantify the effects of soluble factor treatment on the morphological, mechanical, and adhesive properties of MSCs and fibroblasts (used as control cells). The mechanical properties of individual cells are regulated by the cytoskeleton, a complex network of protein filaments within the cell, which reorganizes dynamically to transform cell shape and to generate forces required for adhesion and migration. For these studies, cells were stimulated with soluble factors collected from tumor cells in culture, which were used to mimic the soluble factors present in tumor tissues. After incubation with soluble factors, MSCs, but not fibroblasts, underwent dramatic elongation coupled with changes in the organization of the cytoskeleton. By tracking the motion of particles embedded in the cells, we were able to determine the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. These studies showed that MSCs shifted from a softer to a stiffer state within thirty minutes of soluble factor exposure, a change that required three hours in fibroblasts. Furthermore, cell migration assays showed that even a one hour exposure to soluble factors increased MSC migration. Since soluble factors mediate cell migration by interacting with cell surface receptors that require much longer synthesis and transport times, these results suggested a novel \u00e6mechanical priming\u00c6 achieved by short-term exposure to tumor-secreted soluble factors. We hypothesize that the rapid mechanical response of MSCs to soluble factors is a measure of their mechanical plasticity, which may be an important predictor of their ability to overcome in vivo transport barriers. This fundamental information about MSC migration is important in the development of MSC-based therapies for tissue regeneration and disease.\n\n \n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                         \nBroader Impact \n \nThe educational outreach component of this project has included in-person and videoconference training at multiple levels and disciplines. Throughout the course of this project, several high school interns, visiting summer undergraduate students, Georgia Tech undergraduate students (from Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Biochemistry), and graduate students (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Biology) have worked on this research project. Using videoconferencing equipment purchased with funding from this project, my lab interacted directly with a high school physics class in Thomasville, Georgia and through Direct-2-Discovery (D2D) with science students in Ireland and high school and middle school science teachers in Barrow, Cobb, and DeKalb Counties. The Dawson lab has offered 8 D2D presentations per year throughout this project, with several of these presentations being viewed by multiple classes, and all focused o..."
