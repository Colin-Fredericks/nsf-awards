 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduates will assemble for eight weeks at Auburn University in each of the summers 2010-2012 to conduct research in areas of algebra and discrete mathematics. Our aim is to provide participants with an authentic research experience and get them excited about graduate school and research careers.  The essential part of our program is that we lay out a lot of research problems, and participants can work on any one of them with anybody. The pattern of activities will therefore be as in our previous REU programs:  intensive introduction to problems and problem areas in the first two to three weeks, capped by an obligatory \"ice-breaker\" presentation by each participant in the third week, followed by a \"research institute\" in the remaining five weeks, capped by a final presentation by each participant at the end of the final week.\r\n  \r\nDuring the research institute phase, there will be at least one research presentation every day, by faculty and graduate students of our Department of Mathematics and Statistics, visiting luminaries, and the participants themselves.  But the main feature of that phase will be research carried on by the participants, in various combinations with faculty, graduate students, and themselves. Publishable results will be written up either by the participants themselves, with advice from the project directors, or, in the case of joint work with faculty, by a faculty member in consultation with the participant(s). Communication will be maintained with participants after the program ends for the purpose of conducting further research, presenting results at national conferences, recruiting for subsequent programs or graduate study, and for assessing the impact of the program on their lives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant in question funded 3 summer REU programs, 8 weeks each, in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  A total of 24 undergraduate participants were supported by the grant, and in 2011 we had one unfunded participant, as well.\n\nOur aim, in each program, as in the 6 REU programs we conducted with grants prior to this one, was to provide the participants with what we consider to be an authentic experience of mathematical research, so that the participants may better judge for themselves whether or not they wish to follow a road leading to a career in mathematical research.  To be clear:  it is not our aim to recruit people into mathematical research, nor to \"train\" people to do mathematical research.  We think that we have hit on a way of doing things that generally results in those of our alumni who are suited by interest and ability to a career in mathematical research steering toward such a career, and those who like mathematics, but are not really suited for a life in mathematical research, steering toward something else--often computer science, or statistics, or mathematics education. \n\nResearch in mathematics is not like research in the sciences.  In the sciences, it is probably optimal that young people ooze into research through an apprenticeship system; they have a mentor or mentors, and they are assigned to work on a project.  In our program, it is not like that. In the first 3 weeks the participants are given a boot-camp introduction to the background of a variety of open problems or areas of research in discrete mathematics and algebra.  Nothing is required of them except to prepare and deliver a talk, the \"ice-breaker\", on some piece of mathematics.  Usually, the ice-breaker will be the attempted presentation of a few pages of a research paper.   After the ice-breaker nothing is required, but in almost all cases the participants will begin working on something of their choosing.  Often participants will work on more than one thing.  Occasionally a participant will ask to be assigned a project, and will work on it under the direction of a faculty member--not everyone is ready for jumping into research without a life jacket.  In these cases, we assign projects and provide mentors--we are not against such things on ideological grounds! \n\nOne byproduct of our laissez-faire approach has been a fine crop of mathematical discoveries made by undergraduate participants in our programs.  These are not discoveries that have been pre-discovered by faculty, who have then \"led\" an undergraduate to the very same discovery;  these are bona fide discoveries made by undergraduates.  They may occur in the course of collaboration with other participants, or with faculty, or they may be found by a participant working alone, but they are very definitely discoveries made by a single undergraduate.  These discoveries will usually appear in publications.  The 3 REUs under discussion produced 12 papers, of which 10 have appeared in refereed journals; the other two have been accepted, but not yet published.  Of the 12 papers, 5 have no faculty co-author.  Faculty provided editorial advice, but the mathematics, and most of the writing, was done by participants. \n\nOf the 24 funded participants in the 3 programs, at least 13 have entered graduate school in mathematics.  One of these has earned a Master's degree and left for a job in business, but the other 12 are aiming for a doctorate.  Of the remaining 11 participants, one is finishing a Master's degree in statistics and is headed into graduate study in biology, and another is in graduate study in computer science (at M.I.T.!). Another is finishing a stint with Teach For America and planning to go into mathematics education.\n\nOne of our REU alumni subsequently got a Goldwater Scholarship, three won NSF Graduate Research Fellowships, and another one received honorable mention in the competition for the NSF GRF.  We can't take credit for these achievements, but we might have had something to do with them...."
