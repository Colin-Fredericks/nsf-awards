Mills and colleagues Jessica Hollenbeck, Laura Hunsicker-Wang and Adam R. Urbach from the Department of Chemistry at Trinity University will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broad band probe. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) probing the conformational flexibility of designed ankyrin-repeat proteins; 2) studying the cooperation of intermolecular interactions within the framework of a rigid DNA duplex in complexes containing polyamide ligands; 3) examination of the pH dependence of the redox behavior of Rieske proteins through chemical modification of potential titratable groups to characterize modified amino acids; and 4) evaluation of interactions of lithium counterions with antiaromatic dianions.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.\r\n",
