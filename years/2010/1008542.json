 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply new expertise and a novel approach to fundamental questions in Biological Oceanography: how is population structure affected by connectivity and transport and what traits drive spatial patterns in survival of larvae or adults. Many key species in the marine environment inhabit and need to deal with spatially and temporally variable environments. Yet, in Biological Oceanography and for the study of ecology in non-model species (those lacking genomes, or strong genetic analyses), investigators have largely relied on one or a few loci to investigate spatial and temporal patterns. This shortcoming provides little resolution of population structure and how oceanographic parameters affect populations.\r\n\r\nIn this EAGER project, the PIs will use high throughput genomic approaches to identify and analyze genetic markers in hundreds of individuals without a need for prior genome information. The approach will use a modification of methods used with model species to sequence a reduced representation cDNA library made from many individuals in the species of choice in order to identify, at minimum, 300-500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNP identification will be followed by MassARRAY genotyping of 100s of individuals within and among populations and, depending on genetic distance, species. Analyses will reveal population structure and importantly, SNPs associated with particular traits in the genotyped individuals. Because these SNPs are from coding sequences (expressed genes), the associations will be between specific genes and traits of interest (e.g., survivorship, fitness, growth). \r\n\r\nThis approach is novel and innovative and contains some risk, making it highly suitable as an EAGER project. It does not rely on existing genome sequences, yet provides many SNPs per chromosome. This depth of information provides two important results: very high resolution of population structure and association between SNP and biologically important traits. The interdisciplinary aspects of the work combine bioinformatics, statistics, biological oceanography, molecular biology, marine conservation, and population genetics. \r\n\r\nBy applying the most recent high-throughput technology with methods to identify SNPs in outbred natural populations, the PIs will resolve species distributions and the effects of global warming and habitat change on populations and better assess conservation practices. Additionally, because so many (300-500) markers are used for coding regions, it will be possible to ascertain selective differences among genes that affect biologically important traits. Thus, by identifying and utilizing 100s of SNPs from the coding sequences of any organism, the PIs will both measure population structure and connectivity and identify genes important for particular life-history traits. Notably, a sequenced genome is not necessary for this work, making it broadly applicable across species.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts consist of introducing new technologies to important, basic problems in population structure of marine organisms, with broad applicability in biological oceanography.",
