Since the forthcoming austral summer season will be the last of the IceCube MREFC project, the University of Wisconsin submitted this proposal through the NSF's RAPID funding mechanism to be able to take advantage of the last 2500-m deep ice holes and communication cables that will already be deployed for the IceCube string of Digital Optical Modules. The proposed NaI(Tl) detectors will be attached to the bottom of these last two IceCube strings and use the string's \"special device\" power and communication wires to send data to the surface.",
