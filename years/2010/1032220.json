At this workshop, leading edge researchers in the field engaged in a sustained, creative dialogue that produced the kind of coordinated review and analysis necessary to translate such momentous developments into momentous benefits for the scientific community.\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities\nTo achieve this goal, our workshop focused on both the commonalities that exist between clusters, clouds and grids and explored the ways they must interface and interoperate with one another to support today\u00c6s data intensive collaborations.  The architectural similarities between these basic types of computational infrastructure, and the fact that high performance clusters typically make up the major compute nodes of grids and clouds, means that deployment, operational, and usage issues surrounding the latter form a superset of the issues surrounding clusters.
