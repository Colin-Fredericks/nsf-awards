 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global-scale environmental changes are critical to our survival as they may affect the capacity of the Earth to sustain life. From the perspective of education and research, the topic of global change presents a rich domain of inquiry, exploration, and discovery at all grade levels. GLACIER's primary goal is to provide graduate fellows a strong interdisciplinary perspective on global change research by training them to observe and analyze both physical and anthropogenic processes and their consequences at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.  GLACIER fellows will also have the opportunity to enhance their teaching skills and learn how to translate their research into exciting and dynamic STEM classroom lessons in grades 5- 8.  GLACIER will also train teachers to use geospatial technologies (such as remote sensing, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)); learn about methods and field work used to study global change, create sustainable curricula for grades 5-8 based on an inter-disciplinary approach, and cultivate new ways of engaging their students to think about environmental problems. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: GLACIER will help educate a citizenry that can make informed decisions about the environment, and to train future generation of scientists  with a multi-disciplinary perspective and strong analytical skills. Finally, systematic evaluation criteria will provide feedback regarding the value of our multi-disciplinary focus. GLACIER will strengthen the ties between Boston University and two partner school districts of Cambridge and Brookline, as well as enhance existing links to local museums, zoo, aquarium, and other field sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Its focus was to enhance the science curricula related to global change in the following five thematic areas: <i>biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, energy, and data and measurement</i>.

Our annual evaluation reports show that GLACIER fellows gained important mentoring and teaching skills, as well as an understanding of the needs of K&ndash;12 teachers and classrooms. Some fellows have reported that these skills have impacted their future teaching careers. Fellows have appreciated the connections to local community and the chance to teach in middle school classrooms. Their role as resident scientists at schools enhanced their confidence and motivated their participation in other events (e.g.&nbsp;science fairs). The curriculum developed&nbsp;by the fellows is posted on the GLACIER &nbsp;website.

The program involved 10-12 faculty at Boston University in various STEM disciplines. Faculty have visited middle school classrooms and have developed partnerships with the teachers via outreach programs in other NSF grants. These connections, as well as a curriculum that resulted from the program (posted on the website), and the&nbsp;fellows' improved understanding of STEM learning in schools and curricula development will sustain the program impacts for the next three to five years. <strong>Our NSF-funded GK&ndash;12 </strong>program<strong> has had a significant impact on all participants, including 54 graduate students, 50 classroom teachers, and around 5000 middle school students in the Boston area,</strong> and has created and strengthened university and K&ndash;12 partnerships.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sucharita&nbsp;Gopal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947950/0947950_10013963_1494594973123_EdwinAlfonzo2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947950/0947950_10013963_1494594973123_EdwinAlfonzo2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Edwin Alfonzo 2016-17\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947950/0947950_10013963_1494594973123_EdwinAlfonzo2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Edwin Alfonzo 2016-17\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Alfonzo is a third year graduate student in Chemistry.
