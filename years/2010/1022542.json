The goals are to continue to empower more biologists to be leaders in science education reform; to expand and support an interactive community of biologists committed to scientific teaching and the scholarship of teaching and learning; and through these biologists, to catalyze the network of life science professional societies for the purpose of developing sustained undergraduate education reform. To accomplish these goals, biologists are recruited based on interest, a commitment to changing the way they teach, and a willingness to become catalysts for change at their institution and any biological professional society they belong to. Once selected they are briefed through electronic communication and brought together with their colleagues for an intense face to face workshop experience. They are also provided with expert mentoring until they have reached the goals they have committed to achieving in teaching and leading colleagues at their home institution and through their professional society. Approximately 250 biologists are to be educated and at least 9 professional societies are targeted in this project.\r\n\r\nThis project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.",
