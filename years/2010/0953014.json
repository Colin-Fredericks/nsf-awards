 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer systems security is an arms race between defenders and\r\nattackers that has mainly been confined to software\r\ntechnologies. Increases in the complexity of hardware and the rising\r\nnumber of transistors per chip have created opportunities for\r\nhardware-based security threats. Among the most pernicious are\r\nmalicious hardware footholds inserted at design time, which an\r\nattacker can use as the basis of a computer system attack.\r\n\r\nThis project explores of the feasibility of foothold attacks and a\r\nfundamental design-time methodology for defending against them.\r\nFirst, this project looks at techniques for highlighting potentially\r\nmalicious circuits in a design automatically.  The basic algorithm,\r\ncalled dead circuit identification (DCI), analyzes hardware\r\ndescription language source code and dynamic execution traces of\r\ndesign verification tests to identify suspicious circuitry whose\r\nresults do not impact the computation.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect of this project is a system for removing suspicious\r\ncircuits from a design automatically.  The dead circuit elimination\r\n(DCE) tool removes suspicious circuits from a design by pushing\r\npotentially malicious logic up to a higher layer where it can be\r\nanalyzed in more detail at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe third aspect of this project is a new technique for generating\r\ntest cases and perturbing existing test cases to search specifically\r\nfor potentially malicious circuits.\r\n\r\nThis project provides a pathway to detection and defense against\r\nsecurity risks from hardware comprising attacks, making the enormous\r\ndisruptions possible with such attacks far more difficult than today.",
