In this project, we set out to develop a localization and culture design toolkit. In addition to the toolkit, we also lay the foundation for a design pattern language. The goal of the toolkit and the design pattern language is to bridge the gap between ethnographic field knowledge and data, of the Aboriginal culture knowledge traditions and the traditional design process.

The results of these activities were realized via four phases described below.\n\nIn phase one the expressed interest of the community regarding computing technology was evaluated.  Each Aboriginal group, referred to as a Mob, varies in language, values, practices, and customs. The elders of the Brewarrina community expressed interest in technology; its ability to fill a generation gap and undo the damage of history; educate the kids in respect to their heritage; and to fill the academic voids that exist in their community.  The members of the Redfern community are a mixture of aboriginals from various Mobs\u2019 in NSW and Queensland. As a result, their concentration was more in terms of their struggles to reclaim the land, and its significance to the Aboriginal people as a whole.  In addition, their focal point where more geared towards the movement of unifying the aboriginal people. \n\n In phase two, an analysis was conducted to explore the gap between expectations and what is provided by the current design approaches.  In Brewarrina, this was done via a focus group with the elders of Ourgunya, a women\u2019s support organization.  We found that the priority for the Brewarrina community was a matter of identity, it was decided that the objective would be to structure an introduction of computer technology program and its use around the levels of identity within a community. Due to limited resources in the community the partner organization, OLPC Australia, supplied 10 XO laptops to the Brewarrina community.
