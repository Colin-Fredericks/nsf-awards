 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project - Targeted Infusion: Increasing Mathematics Teacher Production through Curriculum Enhancement and Innovation - at North Carolina A&T University proposes to enhance the mathematics education program to increase the institutional capability of preparing future minority secondary mathematics teachers. The goal of this project is to increase production and improve high-quality preparation of future mathematics teachers through curriculum enhancement and innovation. \r\nThe objectives are: (1) to increase the production of future minority mathematics teachers with adequate credentials in mathematics; (2) to improve retention of mathematics education students; (3) to increase and retain the content knowledge of mathematics; and (4) to expose mathematics education students early on with challenging pedagogical scenarios on planning, implementing and assessing mathematics instruction. \r\nThe project seeks to broaden the mathematics education curriculum and education opportunities for undergraduate students at NCA&T, foster and nurture students' interests in mathematics education, and retain them in academic programs and careers in secondary mathematics education. The local school district's lateral entry secondary mathematics teachers will benefit from participating in mathematics content knowledge and pedagogical skill training and development workshops to better prepare them for the licensure examination, hence helping alleviate the shortage of qualified secondary school mathematics teachers in local secondary schools.",

As a result of implementation of the targeted infusion program in mathematics education at NCA&amp;T, a mathematics secondary education minor program was developed and offered since the fall 2011, two lab-based mathematics education courses were developed and included in both the mathematics secondary education major and minor curricula, and the mathematics education teaching laboratory was renovated and enhanced with the state-of-the-art A/V and computer equipment to facilitate mathematics education content knowledge instruction and pedagogical skill practice training. Over the four-year funding period, sixty-four mathematics secondary education undergraduate students were supported by the grant to work as teacher assistants, supplemental instruction leaders or tutors to gain practical teaching experience in the real classroom setting. The enrollment of students in the mathematics secondary education program was increased from 17 students in the fall semester of 2009 to 27 students in the fall 2010, 25 students in the fall 2011, 28 students in the fall 2012, and 21 students in the fall 2013.
