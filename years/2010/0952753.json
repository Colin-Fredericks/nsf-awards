 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Tobias Ritter of Harvard University.  Professor Ritter will apply the knowledge of the structure and reactivity of binuclear transition metal complexes to the development of catalytic carbon-fluorine bond formation.  First, an operationally simple synthetic methodology will be developed to effect a silver-catalyzed fluorination of arylstannanes.  Second, the silver-catalyzed fluorination reaction will be extended to complex small molecules.  Subsequently, other oxidation reactions will be investigated that benefit from the redox participation of two transition metals.  \r\n\r\nProfessor Ritter's research could lead to efficient methods for the preparation of fluorine containing organic molecules.  These molecules are highly sought after in the development of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.  In addition, they are also needed in molecular imaging via positron-emission tomography.   \r\n\r\nProfessor Ritter will also initiate educational projects that interweave research and teaching.  One project involves an outreach program targeting schools that serve predominantly underrepresented groups.  Professor Ritter will travel to different schools as part of a panel of Harvard researchers that will give a general introduction into different opportunities in Chemistry followed by specific guidelines for applying to graduate schools.  Another program will focus on establishing early contact to local high school students in the Boston area and educating them about chemistry and science in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe mechanism of Pd-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H oxidation chemistry continues to be vigorously discussed.  Historically, Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis cycles have been proposed.  We evaluated a detailed study of Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H chlorination and proposed dinuclear Pd(III) complexes as intermediates.  We have identified a succinate-bridged dinuclear Pd(II) complex, which self-assembles during catalysis, as the catalyst resting state.  In situ monitoring of catalysis has revealed that chlorination proceeds with turnover-limiting oxidation of a dinuclear resting state, and that acetate ions, liberated during the formation of the catalyst resting state, catalyze the bimetallic oxidation.  Informed by reaction kinetics analysis, relevant dinuclear Pd(III) complexes have been prepared and observed to undergo selective C&ndash;Cl reductive elimination.  Based on the combination of kinetic data obtained during catalysis and explicit structural information of relevant intermediates, we propose a Pd(II)2/Pd(III)2 catalysis cycle for Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed aromatic C&ndash;H chlorination.\n\nFluorinated organic molecules are finding increasing use in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science.
