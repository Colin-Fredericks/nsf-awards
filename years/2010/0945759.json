 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is intended to develop a differential drive system capable of powering a mid- to long-range wireless power delivery system. Conventional drive circuits create significant quantities of noise and interference that prohibits the proper operation of wireless delivery systems. Due to the transmitting function of a wireless power system, the implications of this noise and interference are significant and limit the usability of most wireless power systems. A differential drive circuit used to power the wireless power transmitter greatly reduces noise by relying on an oscillating signal to transmit power between transmitters and receivers. This oscillation reduces the magnitude of noise of each oscillation, but more significantly pairs and therefore cancels noise generated system as a whole. With careful tuning and alignment, these oscillations are correlated, canceling the noise and reducing the noise generated. Designing a differential drive to power the circuit allows a variety of wireless power systems to meet all regulatory requirements and transmit power to handsets and other electronic systems without excessive interference. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to allow for widespread adoption and integration of wireless power delivery systems. Prior limitations on commercial exploitation of wireless power have been limited by regulatory limitations and the excessive noise created by these systems. Using a differential drive, permits a variety of transmitters and applications to be developed, as well as increase the potential range of wireless power. In addition to passing regulatory requirements, the differential drive system permits wireless power receivers to be integrated into a variety of electronic hand-sets that were previously impossible. The differential drive will reduce interference, such that prior applications such as mobile phones, laptops, and other handhelds can now be powered wirelessly. The implications of this project?s goals are significant in expanding the range and usability of wireless power. Reductions in noise and interference will improve usability of wireless power systems, and increase adoption in both the consumer and military electronics fields.",
