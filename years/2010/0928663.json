 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lithosphere is the Earth's rocky outer shell. Lithospheric 'plates' drift over the Earth, carrying the continents, and large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur where the plates interact. Hence, understanding the lithosphere is central to our understanding of how the Earth works. The oceanic lithosphere, which covers some 70% of the Earth, is central to our understanding of global geodynamics and plate tectonics, but our understanding of its character (including composition and thickness) and the factors that control them is poor. Variations of seismic and electrical properties of the Earth are indicators of compositional variations. The aim of this project is to use the most up-to-date seismic and electromagnetic methods to address two fundamental questions about the lithosphere that lies beneath the Pacific basin: What factors control the seismic structure of the lithosphere, and what defines the base of the lithosphere? The broader impacts of this work include improved understanding of factors such as the composition of the lithosphere that affect volcanic eruptions, great earthquakes and tsunamis that threaten heavily populated areas in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and elsewhere around the Pacific Rim.",

One key reason why delineating the structure of oceanic lithosphere is important is because of the central role that the lithosphere plays in maintaining life as we know it on Earth.

Our project is motivated by the fact that our current understanding of lithospheric physical properties is poor.\n\nThis grant provided support to conduct a large geophysical experiment (the NoMelt experiment) in a reference section of oceanic lithosphere of the Pacific plate south of Hawaii in 2012.  The experiment consisted of active- and passive-seismic components and a magnetotelluric (MT) component.  Analyses of this rich dataset remain ongoing, but several key findings have already been made.  Results from the MT component show that the mantle?s electrical structure can be explained by a mostly dry, melt-free mantle.  Results from the passive-seismic component reveal inherited fabric in the lithosphere, low-amplitude fabric oriented in the absolute-plate-motion direction just below the lithosphere (effectively defining a sharp lid/asthenosphere transition), and then a separate fabric within the underlying mantle. Results from the active-source component show that uppermost mantle composition and fabric is consistent with simple 2D mantle corner flow and melt extraction at a mid-ocean ridge for stable plate spreading, but that very small changes in mid-ocean ridge dynamics produce substantial mantle heterogeneity.  Estimates of seismic velocity gradients with depth from the active-source seismic data can be explained by the closure with depth of dry or serpentinized microcracks that are oriented normal to the plate-spreading direction.  This suggests that the minimum tensional stress within the uppermost mantle may be oriented in the plate-spreading direction.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Lizarralde"
