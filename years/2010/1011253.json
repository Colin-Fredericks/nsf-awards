 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species, males compete aggressively for access to females and resources. Behavior patterns associated with aggression are regulated by both internal and external factors that the animal must integrate in order to make the appropriate behavioral response to a situation. Steroid hormones are excellent candidates for integrating external environmental cues and internal mechanisms such as brain gene expression. This research will use the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to investigate the molecular processes by which the sex steroid hormone estrogen influences social behavior. Males of this species have two distinct social phenotypes that are reversible depending on social context. This plasticity will be utilized in order to gain insights into the biological mechanisms of male-male competition by investigating the neural, hormonal, and molecular underpinnings of aggression in dominant and subordinate males. Specifically, the brain gene expression changes in dominant and subordinate males will be measured after the estrogen pathway is pharmacologically disturbed, giving insight into which genes are under estrogenic influence. Ultimately, this research will provide insights into the molecular and hormonal processes that underlie male-male competition and its evolutionary consequences.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide excellent educational opportunities to high school students, undergraduates, and one graduate student. The PI is the organizer of a research internship program for student from an urban, largely minority high school in Austin. Both investigators frequently participate in science outreach programs both on the UT Austin campus and in the local community.  Both investigators strive to enhance the infrastructure for research and education by establishing journal clubs and contributing to education panels for improvement of undergraduate science labs.",
