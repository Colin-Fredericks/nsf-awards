 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to develop methods to measure, and theoretical models to interpret, the interaction between biological molecules, such as proteins and DNA, and fine-scale or nano-materials.  This knowledge will be fundamental for the development of the scientific and engineering basis, both for the design of therapies that employ biomolecule-nanomaterial hybrids, and for understanding of the possible deleterious effects of nanomaterials on health.  The approach taken will be to develop and employ complementary tools in experiment and theory.  The project will initially focus on the well-defined nucleic acid-carbon nanotube system and will (i) measure forces required to detach single biological molecules from individual nanoparticles, (ii) develop theoretical models to convert raw experimental measurements into fundamental physical properties, and (iii) study binding and competition between biomolecules and nanoparticles in a simulated cellular environment. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will be to generate fundamental quantitative data, to uncover underlying principles that govern the interaction between biological molecules and nanomaterials, and to suggest ways to manipulate them through chemical modifications.  Such information is critical for the design of novel therapies using new hybrid constructs.  For example, knowing quantitatively the strength of binding between a therapeutic biological molecule and a carbon nanotube will permit the design of therapies that rely on the delivery of the drug using this nanomaterial as a carrier.  Similarly, the results of this research will help to develop the framework for understanding the basic interactions between nanomaterials and the biological molecules in human cells and for predicting potentially harmful effects.  This award will also support, through collaboration with a local science museum, the development of informal science education for the general public about the mechanistic basis of the health effects of nanomaterials and their potential applications in biomedicine.",
