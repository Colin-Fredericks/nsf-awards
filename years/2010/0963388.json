 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis project involves the renovation of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's (SERC's) field monitoring network and environmental data acquisition system, an integrated, distributed facility designed for long-term environmental research on the Rhode River. SERC uses the Rhode River's watershed and sub-estuary as a model system to measure the environmental responses of linked ecosystems in a coastal landscape to climate variation and human impacts. The individual components of the facility are used for monitoring the flow of air, water, and materials through the linked ecosystems that comprise SERC's model landscape.   The Rhode River is a 'perched watershed' that sits on top of an impervious clay layer. The clay layer prevents water and chemicals of the Rhode River's watershed from exchanging with the deeper aquifers that are fed by other parts of the larger Chesapeake watershed. As a result, changes in the volume of water and its chemical characteristics reflect the effects of local climate, atmospheric deposition and land use activities within the watershed. Such measurements across the linked ecosystems in the watershed reveal the landscape-scale response to climate or land use management.\r\n\r\nThe types of research activities and topics pursued using the Rhode River field facility include:\r\n --\tStudies that measure and model the watershed discharges of water, sediment, and nutrients as a function of precipitation, land use, and geological features. These provide information on sources, sinks, and transformations of nutrients and other chemicals such as mercury, and their variation with changes in the quantity and timing of precipitation.\r\n --\tThe long-term responses of C3 and C4 plant communities to rising CO2 based on field manipulation of atmospheric CO2 concentration.\r\n --\tThe combined effects of elevated CO2 and elevated estuarine nitrogen on soil surface elevation.\r\n --\tThe pathways by which mercury enters seafood, combining studies of the atmospheric deposition of mercury, mercury transport and methylation in small watershed, the fluxes of mercury and methymercury through marsh and streams, and the accumulation of methylmercury in terrestrial and aquatic biota. \r\n --\tStudies of what regulates source and sink processes as dissolved organic matter is transported from wetlands and tidal marshes to the coastal ocean.\r\n \r\nIn addition to providing infrastructure for research by SERC personnel, the facility to be renovated is also a resource for an array of collaborative research and research training programs undertaken by academic partners.  Undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers participate in research using the facility.  The research conducted can help determine the effectiveness of new environmental policies.  The renovated infrastructure will support research that can lead to improvements in the management of watersheds and estuaries.  Two of the watershed discharge measurement stations to be renovated will be used for K-12 education and public education on watershed research.  The proposed upgrade to SERC's data transmission network will enable real time transmission of field data, which will facilitate sharing data via internet with collaborating scientists, students, and the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed and repaired valuable parts of the research infrastructure of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) campus.  Infrastructure repaired or developed included a network of 8 stream gauges and water flux stations in the Muddy Creek and Rhode River watersheds.  At each of the stations instruments monitor the movement and quality of the water in the streams.  A second component was the the addition or repair of 3 tidal gauging and water quality monitoring stations to SERC's experimental coastal wetland sites.  These modifications enable the monitoirng of the tidal movement of water at the wetland site as well as monitoring of water quality.  The final component was the addition of communication towers and wireless communication instruments that allow field data to be transmitted from anywhere within SERC where research is being conducted to the main laboratory.  The repair and modification of the stream monitoring weirs and tidal stations allow the continuous collection of environmental data across the SERC forest and estuarine habitats.  These data provide information on how weather related events such as storms and dry periods affect these systems.  Many ongoing SERC research projects depend on these data to relate the abundances of plants and animals to environmental changes.  The addition of the wireless communication system increases the security and availability of all data collected at remote field locations.  The new infrastructure also enables SERC education programs to demonstrate the functioning of modern techniques of environmental monitoring.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard W Osman"
