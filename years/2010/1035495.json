 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a Noyce Fellows Program at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and builds on a recently implemented new undergraduate teacher preparation program, NAUTeach, and a new post-baccalaureate teacher preparation program for STEM professionals, the Certificate for Mathematics or Science Teachers (C-MOST). NAUTeach is an undergraduate science and mathematics teacher preparation program modeled after the UTeach program. The C-MOST program attracts STEM career changers and can be completed in three semesters in on-line or face to face formats. Across these two programs, along with the Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, NAU has committed to graduate 80 secondary science and mathematics each year by 2013. The project is supporting 56 science and mathematics teacher candidates with $15,000 one-year stipends or scholarships. The project also includes an induction program that provides continued training and support for Noyce fellows and includes both face to face and distance-delivery formats. Furthermore, through a partnership with Mesa Community College (MCC), the NAU Noyce Fellows Program provides internships for up to 75 freshman or sophomore students each year from the Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) and NAU who have expressed an interest in STEM disciplines. The partnership with MCCCD provides a pipeline from the community colleges to teacher certification programs at NAU, to increase the diversity of students who pursue teaching science and mathematics, and to prepare teachers from areas in the state that are often hard pressed to employ qualified secondary science and mathematics teachers.",

Approximately 18% of recipients were from underrepresented populations, a number equal to the national average for teachers (AACTE, 2013). In addition to receiving stipend or scholarship support, over 40 Noyce recipients were provided financial support to attend state, regional, and national math or science professional conferences, including regional and national Noyce conferences.

Fifty-seven Noyce recipients have successfully completed their teacher preparation program to date (with three more in progress), 17 (28%) with certification in math teaching and 40 (72%) with certification in science teaching. Of the 57 graduates thus far, 70% are teaching in math or science classrooms in high needs school districts in the 2017-2018 school year.

Over 30% of interns were from underrepresented groups, higher than in the teaching profession overall. It was hoped that offering early experiences in teaching would be an effective strategy for increasing diversity in the teaching profession. Interns provided valuable support to the STEM educators running the camps, and helped facilitate positive STEM experiences to an estimated 5,800 K-12 youth.

Additionally,16 non-Noyce graduates participated in one year of the induction program. Participants reported that the Noyce program gave them the support, confidence and tools to be successful and to continue to improve their teaching. Retention of induction participants in teaching is high, with only two teachers who participated in the program having taken a break from teaching at this time.
