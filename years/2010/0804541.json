In particular she intends to\r\ndescribe possible realizing manifolds and to link their geometry\r\nto the type of system they realize. In the past the PI has\r\nstudied how biHamiltonian structures are generated by the\r\ngeometry of curves in realizing manifolds. She also studied\r\ngeometric realizations of equations of KdV type in Hermitian\r\nSymmetric manifolds, linking the projective character of\r\ndifferential invariants to equations of KdV-type. In this project\r\nshe proposes to deepen this relation and to expand it to\r\nparabolic manifolds. In joint work with M. Eastwood she will be\r\nusing tools in classical differential geometry to find projective\r\nstructures on flows. Resolving this differential geometry problem\r\nwill very likely create geometric realizations of KdV-type in\r\nparabolic manifolds. She will also investigate the possibility of\r\na similar connection in other geometries, for example that of\r\nSchr\u00f6dinger, mKdV and sine-Gordon flows to Riemannian\r\ngeometry. Finally, in joint work with Calini and Ivey, the PI\r\nwill study geometric and topological properties of solutions to\r\nrealizations of soliton equations, in particular those\r\ncorresponding to finite-gap solutions (periodic case). The study\r\nwill try to link properties of these solutions to their spectral\r\nparameter.\r\n\r\nSetting an appropriate geometric background is often a\r\nfundamental step in the resolution of a problem.  A choice of\r\ngeometry establishes the properties and laws we wish to keep\r\nunchanged: Relativity (with Lorentzian geometry setting the\r\ninteraction between space and time) and computer imaging (using\r\nprojective geometry when 3D perspective needs to be preserved)\r\nare some of the best-known examples. But nowadays many engineers\r\nand physicists, including some groups working on data collection,\r\nconsider a basic knowledge of differential geometry to be\r\nfundamental. Geometric thought is commonplace, as often finding\r\nthe right choice of geometry for a problem is an initial step in\r\nits resolution - it all depends on how (or with which geometric\r\neyes) you look at it -. BiHamiltonian nonlinear equations are\r\nvery rich in structure and they are often used to model different\r\ntypes of phenomena. Their rich structure allows us to find a\r\ngreat deal of information about the system they model and to\r\npredict behavior. The best-known completely integrable systems\r\nare bi-Hamiltonian, and their solutions predict the behavior of\r\nfluids, from water waves in shallow water to the trailing\r\nvortices behind the wing tips of an airplane.  These phenomena do\r\nnot, in principle, exist within any given geometric\r\nbackground. When we find geometric realizations for a completely\r\nintegrable system we gain information in two different ways: 1)\r\nWe learn that the behavior of these phenomena can be visualized\r\nwithin a certain geometry, and we learn how to visualize it. In\r\nparticular, the same phenomena can be described in more than one\r\ngeometry; 2) We learn that some geometries are hosts to phenomena\r\nthat were not known to exist in that context before. For example,\r\nby linking projective and centro-equi-affine geometries, we can\r\nfind evolutions of star-shaped curves that behave like solitary\r\nwaves. The better we understand the relation between these two\r\napparently unrelated subjects, the more we can transfer our\r\nextensive geometric knowledge, their connections and properties,\r\nto the understanding of completely integrable systems. And\r\nvice-versa.",
