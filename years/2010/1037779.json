The project seeks to engage students and contextualize learning using active/collaborative pedagogies.  Students will partner with Habitat for Humanity as part of an existing course in the degree program; learning gains will be assessed by an external evaluator.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project, if successful, will be to build partnerships between the PI's institution and community-based charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity.  Students in construction engineering will be exposed to a diverse group of volunteers, which may broaden their perspective.  The project plans to disseminate their service learning model to partner schools.",

Specifically, the project established the conditions to compel students to be responsible for their own learning in the classroom and to demonstrate the utility of integrating service-learning into a targeted freshman engineering course in Construction Management and Civil Engineering Technology (CM/CIET) program.\n\n \n\nThis research deployed three important project components: (1) adaptation and translation of a successful research result for new instructional strategies, (2) demonstration of student-learning improvement based on an active, service-learning approach, and (3) dissemination of the project results to create a synergistic environment where best practices in teaching similar courses are shared. Addressing these project components led to accomplishing the following objectives:\n\n \n\n&bull; Increase student learning\n\n&bull; Increase student engagement\n\n&bull; Enhance faculty-student interaction\n\n&bull; Improve student cooperation\n\n&bull; Promote active learning\n\n&bull; Improve student performance of course learning objectives\n\n \n\nTo accomplish research objectives listed above, this research developed, implemented, and validated two significant research components &ndash; new instructional strategies using lecture modules and service-learning approach using Habitat for Humanity project participations.\n\n \n\nImplementing New Instructional Strategies &ndash; Evolving the Classroom Paradigm Inside the Classroom\n\nThis project developed, adapted, and tested classroom materials, in the form of lecture modules, for a freshman course. Guided by recent findings and developing pedagogical research, this project focused on an active learning, team-based approach to education. In each module, students were moved out of the traditional setting involving passive listening to lectures given from platforms by learned professors. On the contrary, students worked in teams to complete worksheets that guide them through the process of learning, actively engaging them in processing information, as well as routinely utilizing and developing important skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking.\n\n \n\nBridging the Learning Material, Teaching Strategies, and Service Learning &ndash; Getting Experience Outside the Classroom\n\nThis project formally deployed students to local job-sites where students received hands-on experience while participating in a housing construction program, Habitat for Humanity. Students received direct experience actually building a residential facility potentially involving a wide range of technical trades, including wall framing, exterior siding, roofing, and interior finishes involving sheetrock and installation of windows, doors, and molding.\n\n \n\nMajor Outcomes and Findings\n\nThe project successfully implemented active-learning, student-focused educational protocols coupled with the routine deployment of student teams to Habitat for Humanity construction job sites as a service-learning medium. Inside the classroom, students were engaged and were compelled to take responsibility for their own learning. Outside the classroom, Habitat for Humanity served as a gateway to hands-on opportunities for students with little or no experience in construction. Beyond the education of students, the project merit and impact extended outward to many targets.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project integrated research into education and building bridges for tomorrow. An active-based, student-focused methodology was validated as a successful means for student achievement, engagement, and mastery of learning objective..."
