 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent rapid increases in tourism, migration, and the spread of invasive species have escalated local tensions between conservation and development to a global level, with the Galapagos Islands placed on the United Nation's list of World Heritage Sites that were \"In Danger\" in 2007.  A number of political and environmental leaders have generated a new vision for the islands, hoping to rewrite past policies that separated pristine nature from people by focusing instead on participatory environmental management.  Attempts to resolve this crisis, however, must be negotiated among a wide set of stakeholders with diverse perspectives and interests, including local residents, conservationists, scientists, tourists, and the tourism industry.  Set in the context of a crisis moment in the Galapagos Islands, this doctoral dissertation research project will use the giant tortoise, an emblematic species and contested symbol of the archipelago, as a lens through which to explore changing relations among science, nature, and society.  The doctoral student conducting this project will position the tortoise at the center of debate among these stakeholders by exploring answers to the following questions:  (1) How does the giant tortoise's history reflect changing human interactions with and valuations of nature?  (2) How do different valuations of the giant tortoise today reflect competing designs for the future of the islands?  (3) How are tortoises and their relations with people and the environment being remade by recent shifts in science and conservation?  Archival and ethnographic methods will be used to address these questions, including research at natural history museums, surveys and in-depth interviews across stakeholder groups in the Galapagos, and participant observation of evolutionary and ecological tortoise science and conservation programs.\r\n\r\nThis project takes a trans-disciplinary approach to understanding the complex entanglements of nature, society, and science at the heart of debates about sustainability and environmental management.  Although sustainability and participatory environmental management are popular policy goals, their realization has often remained elusive.  This project will contribute important theoretical insights for understanding the challenges of achieving sustainability in the context of increasing development pressure and conflict that threatens iconic endangered species and preservation sites around the world.  Through dissemination to academics, Galapagos conservation officials, and local communities, project findings will have a potential impact on how conservation and development policies are formulated in the Galapagos. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
