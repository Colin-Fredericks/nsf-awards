 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project examines the feasibility of developing a Digitally-based Renewable Energy Laboratory (D-REL) as a electronic courseware for teaching renewable energy concepts in middle schools.  Renewable energy is a national priority and the most viable alternative to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, reduce hazards caused by humans to the environment, and improve the US economy.  Despite a close alignment within the National Science Education Standards, renewable energy concepts are generally not taught in schools because teachers have limited knowledge of the concepts, and more importantly, do not have access to the educational technologies to teach these concepts. During this project a multi-disciplinary team of renewable energy experts, educators, computer graphic animators and programmers will identify key renewable energy concepts and outline steps involved in production and utilization of renewable energy to produce the D-REL. These interactive renewable energy process simulations will use a computer-based graphic interface, and subsequently, using 'backwards design' with feedback from teachers, interactive, educational video games will be developed. \r\n\r\nThe worldwide computer based learning industry is presently valued at $49 billion. This industry is expected to grow exponentially as the price of computers continues to drop, and as a result our technology will become more important. The renewable energy industry will maintain growth with investment greater than $200 billion over the next five years. As renewable energy production grows, the industry must be supported via science education and our D-REL technology will be in demand.  Our target market is the student  population of 55 million. To the best of our knowledge, no technology similar to ours exists, reducing competition. Our technology teaches politically, socially and economically on one of the most important topics.",
