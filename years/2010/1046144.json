 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine methanotrophic ecosystems are responsible for consuming around 75 Tg of methane annually, preventing this potent greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere. These microbial ecosystems thus play a vital role in the global climate system. The nature of these communities depends on the presence or absence of oxygen: methanotrophy is a bacterial lifestyle in aerobic shallow sediments, but in deeper anaerobic sediments it is the exclusive province of archaea, in syntrophy with sulfate-reducing bacteria. It is known which phyla are most commonly found in methanotrophic environments. However, because of these environments' physical inaccessibility and because nearly all microbes from these systems have resisted cultivation, understanding of these communities lags far behind their importance. The cultivation-resistance of microbial hosts from these systems has additionally prevented the use of classical methods to study the viral community. Thus, to date science is largely unable to fill in the broad outlines of marine methanotrophic biodiversity, to fully describe the microbial communities or determine what shapes them.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to define the importance of viruses in structuring functional, genetic, and taxonomic diversity in methanotrophic marine ecosystems. The underlying assertion is that viruses structure the diversity of archaeal and bacterial communities in these ecosystems by causing both mortality and horizontal gene transfer. To establish viral contributions to biodiversity of aerobic and anaerobic marine methanotrophic ecosystems, this project combines biogeochemical, genomic, and metagenomic approaches, in both field and laboratory settings.\r\n\r\nIntegration\r\n\r\nThe project first seeks to assess viral activity in situ by extending established stable isotope probing techniques to quantify rates of viral production at sea floor methane seeps. The same techniques will be used to track the flow of carbon from methane to microbes to viruses and to isolate genetic material from just those organisms that actively cycle methane-derived carbon, enabling the production of microbial and viral metagenomes that are anchored in ecosystem function. Comparisons among these metagenomes will reveal any functional sequences in transit between organisms, providing the basis for an evaluation of the relationships between functional and genetic diversity. At the same time, single-cell whole-genome amplification will pinpoint individual cells for comparison with the microbial and viral assemblages, permitting assessment of the relationships between taxonomic and genetic diversity. Last, the comparison of genomic and metagenomic data both within and across distinctive marine methanotrophic ecosystems will enable analysis of the relationship between functional and taxonomic diversity.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThe project will offer training to postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students. A field studies course will bring ~12 undergraduates on a research expedition and provide them a rich educational experience, truly integrating teaching and research. To facilitate translation of this research to the public sphere, a workshop on science communication will be developed and hosted, led by a veteran science journalist. The PI will continue to lead outreach efforts by example, serving as a resource to journalists, federal agencies, and members of Congress.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project investigated the ecological and evolutionary relationships that occur between and among microbial life forms, initially within the backdrop of the deep-ocean. The focus was on bacteria, archaea and their viruses, and the environment was sediment with low-oxygen and abundant methane.  Several key discoveries emerged from this work.  Foremost amongst them was the finding of self-guided protein diversification within an archaeal virus endemic to this sort of environment.  This finding opened a door to identify retroelement-based diversity generation as an active and commonplace mode of adaptation among ultra-small bacteria and archaea belonging to recently-discovered candidate phyla.  The analysis of diversity generation among the candidate phyla suggests a role in binding dynamics that benefits the cell for adhesion, regulation, or other processes.  By crystallizing the diversified proteins, patterns emerged that suggest biochemical unity in protein binding functions that link the candidate phyla to better established bacterial and archaeal phyla.  Other outcomes of this research include an improved understanding of the processes that act on oil in the deep ocean, both allowing deposition to the sea floor, but also controlling the rate at which microbes access and consume the hydrocarbons; the discovery of expansive microbial mats conditionally lining the sea floor of the deep ocean; finding of carbon flow from methane to sulfur bacteria in microbial mats; and new insights to the dynamics of archaeal lipid membranes and metabolisms.  This work also provided a range of broader impacts that include training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars as well as providing at-sea oceanographic experience for undergraduate students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Valentine"
