 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently the National Science Foundation funded a field campaign to study the occurrence of nitrogen fixation in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ESTP-10\u00b0S-20\u00b0S, 80\u00b0W-110\u00b0W) and determine its contribution as a source of new nitrogen to primary production in the region.  The proposed cruise tracks cover a wide range in primary productivity, from some of the most productive to least productive marine waters in the world.  Two scientists from the University of Southern California in collaboration with a researcher from the University of California, Los Angeles will participate in the cruises to quantify the contribution of nitrogen fixation to primary and export production rates.  To attain their goal, the researchers would determine Net Community Production and Gross Photosynthetic Production (NCP and GPP) by measuring biological O2 supersaturation and 17O excess of oxygen dissolved in the upper ocean.  Oxygen supersaturation from biological processes can be determined from measuring O2/Ar ratios of near surface waters, which effectively removes the effect of supersaturation produced by bubble injection and other physical processes. The 17O excess permits surface water oxygen that has been produced by photosynthesis in situ to be distinguished from oxygen from the atmosphere.  In addition, 222Rn profiles in the upper water column would also be obtained and used to assess the rate of air-sea gas exchange and eddy diffusivity across the thermocline.  A system to measure near-surface radon while underway is also planned and should ascertain spatial/temporal variability in gas exchange and help identify recently upwelled or downwelled water masses.  Results for the O2/Ar and delta 17O methodologies, coupled with areal mapping of radon deficiencies will yield an excellent data base for estimation of carbon export within the ETSP.\r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the research may lead to reduced uncertainties in the gas exchange rates which could improve the precision of productivity measurements.  This project represents a collaborative effort between two academic institutions in the Los Angeles area.  One postdoc and two undergraduate students from the University of Southern California will be supported and trained as part of the project.",

Several different approaches were used to assess the accuracy and complexity of each method. The isotopes of dissolved oxygen indicate the gross rate of oxygen production by plants. The amount of oxygen (relative to argon) in the surface ocean indicates the net excess of photosynthesis relative to respiration. Both of these techniques require estimation of the rate of exchange of oxygen across the air-water boundary, so knowing the rate of gas exchange is also key.  We used naturally occurring radon gas as a tracer to help quantify this process and thus help in our interpretation of the oxygen data.  Because we made so many oxygen/argon measurements, we saw a rich fabric of patterns in the surface ocean, with high oxygen production zones and lower oxygen production zones that have great heterogeneity in time and space.  Stations along a cruise transect at 10&deg; S had generally higher rates of productivity than stations along a transect at 20&deg; S, between 80&deg;W and 100&deg;W.  Our goal was to define how oxygen reflects production within this region of the ocean, but we teamed with other investigators to compare and contrast other methodologies.  For example, satellites predict much higher rates of carbon production than those indicated by our oxygen production measurements.  Traditional measurements of photosynthesis using 14C tracers also predict much larger growth rates than do our oxygen measurements.  What this study indicates is that different types of measurements of ocean productivity, and thus estimates of marine carbon dioxide sequestration, may have significant differences.  Much of these differences reflect variations of natural processes in space and time, responding to spatial variability of physical processes such as upwelling.  Furthermore, each method detects responds slightly differently to organism physiology in carbon production in the ocean, both in time and location in the water column.  Putting together a vast array of different measurement techniques has given us additional insight and teaches us about the spatial and temporal characteristics of plant production and decay in the upper ocean.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William M Berelson"
