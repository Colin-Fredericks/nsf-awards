A primary challenge in the field of gas-surface reaction dynamics is to develop a complete mechanistic understanding of interfacial processes, from the initial impact and accommodation to product formation and desorption. This challenge is particularly formidable for atmospheric gases colliding with organic surfaces, where the complex nature of the interface and high reactivity of the gases can result in a broad range of reaction pathways.

Together, these methods have helped in the development of a comprehensive description of the transformation of reactants into products at the gas-organic surface interface and provided an unprecedented level of insight into how gases react in the environment.\n\nOxidation at organic surfaces. Organic particulates and aerosols are abundant in the troposphere. The surfaces of most particles are initially hydrophobic, but reactions with oxidants such as O3, NO3, and OH render them hydrophilic by incorporating polar functional groups into the materials. Such reactions are important because they affect the fate of both particulate matter and the concentration of pollutants throughout the atmosphere. In addition, reactions between oxidants and organic compounds affect the balance between incident and outgoing radiation levels across the planet.\n\nThe focus of our NSF-funded project has been on building a more fundamental understanding of interfacial reactions relevant to the fate of atmospheric gases. For example, the initial step in the reaction of O3 with surface vinyl groups is addition across the double bond (primary ozonide formation); however, it was previously unknown how the rates of ozonide formation depend on the initial surface structure or polarity.
