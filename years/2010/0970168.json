 "awd_abstract_narration": "At high energies, only neutrinos can directly convey astrophysical information from the most distant reaches of the Universe or from deep inside the most cataclysmic, breathtakingly powerful, regions yet identified. Neutrinos provide a unique view of how nature accelerates particles and can clarify the role of hadrons in the astrophysical milieu. With 59 (out of 80) IceCube strings deployed since January 2005, the IceCube collaboration is poised to advance the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide funds to accelerate the advance of the scientific frontier by developing and extending data analysis and simulation tools to search for a diffuse flux of Ultra-High Energy (UHE) neutrinos using the IceCube Observatory. The proposed work will develop event reconstruction code and will investigate new procedures to reconstruct events by taking advantage of the information contained within the complete waveform record. Their proposed research plan includes simulation studies of UHE neutrino events in IceCube using a supercomputer cluster and they have started to investigate the performance at UHE energies. They have been approved for 500,000 cpu hours on the Teragrid clusters. Two years of IceCube data should improve current flux limits by a factor of 4 since little background remains in the UHE analysis. If no signal is found, then the flux limits will be less than any version of the Waxman-Bahcall bound, which implies that cosmic ray accelerators must be less efficient at producing neutrinos. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this proposal provide an outlet for curiosity and imagination driven research by graduate and postdoctoral students who will be given the opportunity to learn about data acquisition electronics, detector simulation, and data processing. Student training is founded on strong mentorship.",

Therefore, neutrino astronomers can peer into the most energetic and explosive objects in the sky.  Another important feature of neutrinos is that they come in 3 varieties, whereas light particles come in only one variety-  light is light.  Measuring all 3 neutrinos varieties provides a far more engaging instantenous view.  It is similar to comparing a color photo with a black and white.  \n\nThe promise of neutrino astronomy took a significant leap forward when the IceCube collaboration reported a few years back that some of the events are inconsistent with all known backgrounds, and therefore, evidence that the source was somewhere in space. The events seem to come from all directions equally.  That is, none seem to come from a particular object or class of objects.  The most likely explanation is that they do not come from our own galaxy.  If they did, there should be more neutrinos coming from the galactic plane than elsewhere, contrary to what is observed.  \n\nSo what sort of thing can create high energy neutrinos?  About a decade ago, the most common ideas from theoretical astronomers focused on the same sorts of objects than can produce extremely energetic cosmic rays.  This may not seem obvious at first, but cosmic rays have been detected for more than a century so quite a bit more is known about them compared to neutrinos.  Cosmic rays reach the same energies as IceCube neutrinos, and at they too seem to come from all directions uniformly.  An important feature is that cosmic rays contain a sizeable fraction of all the energy in the universe, and so any source that produces  cosmic rays must be powerful and relatively abundent.  Both properties suggest that sources of cosmic rays could be sources of neutrinos as well, especially if the accelerator is surrounded by gas or dust as is common in many galaxies.   But this association between cosmic ray sources and neutrino sources had an important consequence - the energy spectra of neutrinos would be similar to the energy spectra of cosmic rays.  Recently, IceCube presented results that indicate the energy spectrum of cosmic rays from outside our galaxy is much different than the energy spectrum of the IceCube neutrinos.  Thus, the hoped for connection does not seem to be present.\n\nMy group has studied neutrinos at the very highest energies.  For example, we pointed out that the isotropic directions of the measured neutrinos can be used to constrain the maximum from from a point source outside our galaxy.  This holds true at even higher energies, where no neutrinos have been measured.  The limits themselves also constrain the maximum flux from a point source outside our galaxy. We concluded that it would be very unlikely for IceCube to detect an extragalactic point source.  Thus far, both predictions have been validated by IceCube data. \n\nWe also started to investigate the connection between the amount of signal measured by the photomultiplier tubes in IceCube and the inferred energy of the particle that generated it.
