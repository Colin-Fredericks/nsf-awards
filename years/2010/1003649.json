 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is broadening student involvement in undergraduate research and establishing undergraduate research as an essential component of a two-year community college education to better prepare students as future employees of the region's biotechnology industry. Regional industry representatives promote undergraduate research for the development of strong non-technical skills, and the life science industry requires employees to have these skills in addition to technical skills. In addition to providing support for students participating in undergraduate research, this project is providing support and professional development for faculty mentors, increasing connectedness and retention of students in the STEM technologies, increasing partnerships with local universities, high schools, and industries, and disseminating knowledge of research methodology to the College and local community. The benefits for students include a better understanding of the relevance of classes and improved critical thinking skills. Additionally, students learn to work independently and collaboratively, learn to recognize errors, and gain self-confidence. When students enter the workforce, they have developed inquisitiveness and an understanding of how research is applied to 'real-life' problems. They know how to methodically look for solutions and analyze results.",
