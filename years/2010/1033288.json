 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several years our understanding of the important role that small ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play in controlling intracellular processes has grown tremendously.  The goal of this interdisciplinary project, combining chemistry and molecular biology, is to add an additional artificial function to the intracellular small RNAs: the fluorescent reporting of intracellular process.  For this purpose, we will engineer new small RNAs that will be both responsive to metabolites and bind light-up dyes (dyes that that increase fluorescence upon binding to the receptor).      \r\nNew fluorescent probes for metabolites would help increase our understanding of intracellular processes, leading to immediate basic science benefits and longer-term impact on human health.  A postdoctoral scientist or a graduate student, undergraduates, and high?]school students will all be exposed to the multidisciplinary approach and will learn how to develop and optimize useful intracellular reagents.  One of the organisms we will use to demonstrate the function of new RNA-based probes is the social amoebae, Dictyostellium; thus, we may produce highly visually attractive movies that will be used to spark the interest of participating K-12 students in science and to explain basic principles of multicellularity, evolution, parasitism, social behavior, origins of altruism and cheating.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOligonucleotide-based receptors are called aptamers.  The focus of this grant was the development of basic science supporting novel uses of aptamers for in vivo and intracellular imaging.  We describe here three biggest advances made in the course of our studies:\n\n1. Development of a general method to identify (that is, select through evolutionary protocol) ternary complexes between aptamers, boronic acid-based receptors, and sugars (saccharides) that can be used as specific and sensitive sensors (for these sugars).  Boronic acid-based receptors on their own lack specificity, while aptamers without these receptors lack affinity for simple sugars.  When two types of reagents are combined they form stable ternary complexes with sugars, and only then we can take advantage of the best properties of both systems. The method was demonstrated on three monosaccharides, glucose, fructose, and galactose, with individual aptamers binding each of these with high specificity.  This type of reagents will be particularly useful in glycomics, and could also be used for in vivo imaging of glycans (e.g., complex sugars displayed on cell surfaces).\n\n2. Development of an aptamer-based light-up (\"contrast-up\") moiety for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  We isolated an aptamer that binds lanthanides with high affinity and thereby causes large increase in contrast.  Coupled with other aptamers sensing metabolites, this light-up moiety can be used to image specific processes in vivo with MRI in the following manner: an increase in concentration of a metabolite would increase binding of a lanthanide to the aptamer, with simultaneous increase in contrast. \n\n3. Engineering of streptavidin-oligonucleotide complex with exquisite sensitivity to single-point mutations.  We synthesized complexes of a single molecule of streptavidin with a single oligonucleotide displaying three biotins.  These complexes, when they encounter complementary oligonucleotide \"pop\", that is, open up displaying a biotin.  This can be used in non-sandwich-based assays for small oligonucleotides (e.g., microRNAs).\n\nThe novelty of these three advances is representative of the intellectual merit of our efforts.  The most important longer-term broader impact is expected to be in health care.  For example, our progress allows construction of new glucose sensor with improved accuracy in hypoglycemic region. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Milan N Stojanovic"
