 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to set a model for other institutions by developing and implementing an intensive \"boot camp\" based on cohorts to transition veterans to four year engineering degree programs.  A particular emphasis of the proposal is on providing needed skills in mathematics, to ensure those coming from military service are given the tools to succeed in engineering programs.  The proposed program is comprehensive, addressing elements such as internships with industry, mentoring, recruitment, and cultural orientation.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to develop, then test, a model to help transition veterans to engineering degree programs.  The overall goal of this project is to leverage the military service and experience of veterans to increase success in obtaining engineering degrees.  Should this project be successful, the knowledge gained and practices developed may help other engineering schools recruit and retain veteran students.  A particular feature of this project is the focus on support for veterans with a wide spectrum of disabilities.",

Several innovations were introduced in these bootcamps including the emporium approach (one room school house with every level of math competence functioning at the same time) and the introduction of KINECT as a tool to engage students physically in the creation of graphs and formulas. We also evaluated the effectiveness of our cultural orientation programs, buddy system application and mentoring programs through an external evaluation that included individual interviews and focus group data.\n\nObjectives of VetsEngrProject\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n ..."
