 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor Robert J. Madix at Harvard University for a research project that will develop the fundamental basis for simple, novel heterogeneously catalyzed reactions for the transformation of amides, imines, nitriles and aziridines over copper, silver and gold surfaces through understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of the surface reactions of nitrogen-containing molecules. The proposed studies are based on fundamental principles of surface reactivity discovered and developed in previous NSF-supported work. Amidization, iminization, nitrilation and aziridination reactions facilitated by these group IB metals will be studied utilizing well defined single crystal surfaces. This research will provide a molecularly based understanding of the elementary reaction steps of these complex synthesis reactions. They have the potential for transforming existing technologies into more energy efficient and environmentally benign processes.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Madix will perform research that will have a significant impact on important chemical transformations for the industrial sector with significant outcomes of improved catalyst selectivity, reduced waste, and potentially lower energy consumption. The proposed research is important to the development of processes critical to maintaining leadership in the multibillion dollar chemical industry in the United States and to the reduction in energy use. Broader impacts of the research has as an outcome the training and professional development of postdoctoral students and the training of both women and minority students. Professor Madix will include undergraduates in his research through the REU program at Harvard and will conduct coordinated activities with local high schools to stimulate the interest of minority high school students in physical science. Harvard University's existing partnerships with both The Engineering School at the Hyde Park Educational Complex in Boston and the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School will be utilized.",
