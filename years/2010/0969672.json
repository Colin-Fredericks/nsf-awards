 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe foremost objective of this project is to extend the local representation of the\r\ncharacteristic classes of noncommutative spaces to the more intricate spaces \r\ndescribed by the spectral triples of type III  introduced by Connes and the PI.  The \r\nresulting local-global theory will be applied to the transverse geometry of\r\nfoliations, to modular forms, Hecke operators and Rankin-Cohen brackets, and to \r\nthe refinement of the mathematical formulation of the standard model of particle\r\n physics.  In the process, the Hopf cyclic theory of characteristic  classes for \r\nfoliations will be extended to all classical types of transverse geometries. In a \r\ndifferent direction,  the concept of boundary will be incorporated in the spectral \r\ntriple approach, and the characteristic classes of the noncommutative spaces \r\nwith boundary will be developed  by means of relative cyclic cohomology.\r\n\r\n In various branches of science, the concepts of local and global form two markedly \r\ndifferent but coexisting facets of a theory, which are often correlated in an \r\ninteresting way by a local-global principle. The present project  will develop new\r\ntools  for the implementation of this principle in the setting of noncommutative \r\ngeometry, a modern variant of geometry inspired by quantum mechanics which\r\nallows for non-commuting operator-valued coordinates. Although this feature \r\nprecludes ab initio any naive spatial conceptualization based on points, there is  a \r\nmore subtle interpretation of the notion of locality, inspired by the Bohr \r\ncorrespondence principle in quantum mechanics, which will be fully exploited. The \r\nproposed work will engender new connections between  several fields of \r\nmathematics and physics, thus stimulating their mutually enriching interaction.",
