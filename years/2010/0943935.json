 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nThe focus of this proposal is to collect fossil plants and palynomorphs from Permian-Triassic (P-T) rocks of the central Transantarctic Mountains (CTM), together with detailed data on sedimentologic and paleoecologic depositional environments. Fossil plants are important climate proxies that offer a unique window into the past, and the CTM fossils are an important source of data on the ways that plants responded to a strongly seasonal, polar light regime during a time of global change. The proposed project uses paleobotanical expertise, integrated with detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy, to reconstruct Permian-Triassic plant communities and their paleoenvironments. This interdisciplinary approach could uncover details of Antarctica?s complex late Paleozoic and Mesozoic environmental and climatic history which included: 1) deglaciation, 2) development and evolution of a post-glacial landscape and biota, 3) environmental and biotic change associated with the end-Permian mass extinction, 4) environmental recovery in the earliest Triassic, 5) strong, possible runaway Triassic greenhouse, and 6) widespread orogenesis and development of a foreland basin system. The PIs will collect compression floras both quantitatively and qualitatively to obtain biodiversity and abundance data. Since silicified wood is also present, the PIs will analyze tree rings and growth in a warm, high-latitude environment for which there is no modern analogue. Fossil plants from the CTM can provide biological and environmental information to: 1) interpret paleoclimate when Gondwana moved from icehouse to greenhouse conditions; 2) trace floral evolution across the P-T boundary; 3) reconstruct Antarctic plant life; 4) further understanding of plant adaptations to high latitudes. The Intellectual Merit of the research includes: 1) tracing floral evolution after the retreat of glaciers; 2) examining floral composition and diversity across the PTB; and 3) obtaining data on the recovery of these ecosystems in the Early Triassic, as well as changes in floral cover and diversity in the Early-Middle Triassic. Antarctica is the only place on Earth that includes extensive outcrops of terrestrial rocks, combined with widespread and well-preserved plant fossils, which spans this crucial time period.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\nThe broader impacts include public outreach; teaching, and mentoring of women and underrepresented students; mentoring graduate student, postdoctoral, and new faculty women; development of an inquiry-based workshop on Antarctic paleoclimate with the Division of Education, KU Natural History Museum; continuing support of workshops for middle school girls in science via the Expanding Your Horizons Program, Emporia State University, and the TRIO program, KU; exploring Antarctic geosciences through video/computer links from McMurdo Station and satellite phone conferences from the field with K-12 science classes in Wisconsin and Kansas, and through participation in the NSF Research Experiences for Teachers program at the University of Wisconsin.",

The project encompassed a multidisciplinary approach that utilized various types of paleobotanical expertise integrated with detailed sedimentology and stratigraphy in order to reconstruct Permian-Triassic paleoenvironments and plant communities. This award supported field work in the Central Transantarctic Mountains and lab work at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. This interdisciplinary approach was a powerful tool in uncovering details of Antarctica&rsquo;s complex late Paleozoic and Mesozoic history. Our findings provide a detailed view of environmental and biotic changes in polar Pangaea, including 1) the late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), 2) Early Permian deglaciation, 3) Middle and Late Permian development and evolution of a post-glacial landscape and biota, 4) environmental and biotic change associated with the end-Permian mass extinction, 5) environmental recovery in the earliest Triassic, 6) strong, perhaps even a runaway greenhouse in the Triassic, and 7) widespread orogenesis and development and evolution of a Middle Permian-Triassic foreland basin system. Major results indicate that Lower Permian glaciogenic strata were deposited in a glaciomarine basin rather than in a terrestrial setting during the LPIA, and that Antarctica was never completely covered by a massive ice sheet as was previously reported. This glacial interval ended in the Sakmarian (Early Permian) with rapid retreat of the glaciers out of the depositional basins. Although glaciers continued in Australia until the early Late Permian, Antarctica, was ice free following the Sakmarian. During glacial and post-glacial times, strata were deposited in a narrow possibly fault-bounded &ldquo;rift basin.&rdquo; Development of a broad, trough-shaped basin during deposition of Middle and Upper Permian coal-bearing strata signaled evolution of the area into an under-filled foreland basin. By the Middle and Late Permian, the landscape was covered by plants with fossil forest growing along stream courses and on floodplains. Trees of the Glossopteris flora, were both deciduous and evergreen (based on geochemical analysis), underwent self-thinning, and contain no evidence of frost damage despite their location within the South Polar Circle. Quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on high-resolution isotope records indicate that the Permian Polar Regions (&gt;75? S) experienced wet and warm winters similar in seasonality to the present day Pacific Northwest. Compared to modern forest, the Permian forest had high basal areas and high biomass, which was exceeded in both only by modern Sequoia forest. Previous reports of Upper Permian and Lower Triassic strata suggested that a change in fluvial style occurred across the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) due to plant extinction.
