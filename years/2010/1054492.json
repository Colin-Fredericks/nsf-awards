To defend against such attacks, each node in a wireless sensor network needs to view its action executions as moves in a game whose ultimate objective is two-fold:  \r\n\r\nFirst, the node needs to execute enough actions so that its reputation as a reliable node remains high between its neighboring nodes.\r\n\r\nSecond, the node needs to refrain from executing some actions in order to ensure that the lifetime of its battery remains long.\r\n\r\nThe PIs are working on constructing a utility function for this game and analyzing various ways in which the game can reach an equilibrium state, where the minimum battery discharges in the network are minimized and the node reputations remain high.",

Network simulations implementing game theory consistently have a lower net voltage loss than simulations not using game theory, regardless of network size. For all normal scenarios, applying game theory consumes less voltage than not applying game theory. Applying game theory also results in a higher utility since nodes applying the game theory decide not to send packets when the utility is negative. As we increase the total percentage of malicious nodes in a network, average reputation of nodes decreases. In both scenarios the total reputation is higher if we do not use the game theory and that is because by using game theory we change the reputation and negative reputation of malicious nodes would change the total average reputation of the network. As we increase the percentage of malicious nodes in a network the total voltage loss is always lower by using game theory if we use broadcast approach.
