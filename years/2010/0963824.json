 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US participants of Thematic Program: Dynamics and Transport in Disordered Systems at the Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada in the Spring 2011.\r\n\r\nIt has been known for a long time that heat flows from hot bodies to cold ones, that differences in voltages generate currents. \r\nEven if macroscopically this is well studied in many contexts, it is not easy to understand these phenomena at the microscopic level.\r\n\r\nSeveral mathematical models have been proposed for the phenomena. Some of them based on probability theory and some of them are  classical and  deterministic.\r\nIn recent times, there has been very good progress in both classes of models the mathematical phenomena discovered are eerily similar sometimes. \r\nThe main goal of the special semester is to bring together specialists in both types of models to find common ground and to make sure that there are students who get trained in both points of view.",
