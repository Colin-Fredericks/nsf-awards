 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with models of wireless multi-terminal networks incorporating practical constraints such as individual links that experience fading, applications that are delay-sensitive, network communication that is subject to broadcast and interference  constraints and nodes that are constrained to operate in half-duplex mode. The network is assumed to be static for the duration of the message, but can change from one message to the next and channel-state information is assumed to be present only at the  receiver.   In such settings, cooperative communication in which  intermediate nodes facilitate communication between a particular source-sink pair, is key to efficient operation of the network.\r\n\r\nA key goal of any communication system, is one of achieving an optimal rate-reliability tradeoff.  The diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) determines the tradeoff  between relevant first-order approximations to the rate and reliability of communication.  The DMT of point-to-point communication links has been extensively studied and signal sets are available that are optimal under any  statistical distribution of the fading channel.  There now  exist protocols and codes for two-hop relay networks that come close to achieving the  corresponding min-cut  upper bound on DMT.  Goals of this project include:  1) determining the DMT of various classes of multiterminal  networks ranging from broadcast, cooperative-broadcast and multiple-access channel networks to layered multi-hop networks; 2) identifying the classes of networks for which the DMT of the network is given by the DMT of the min-cut; 3)  assessing the impact of asynchronous operation of the network, as well as of the presence of feedback along one or more links in the network; 4) the construction of codes with lesser decoding complexity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of the project was initially on the development of efficient codes for wireless communication.  Subsequently the scope of the project was expanded, with NSF permission, to include work on error-correction in networks, coding for distributed storage and distributed function computation.\n\nTwo papers relating to the development of efficient codes for wireless communication were published that presented fundamental results relating to the tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing gain in wireless cooperative networks.  The multiplexing gain is a measure of how much information can be efficiently transmitted while diversity serves as a measure of reliability.\n\nWork conducted on this project contributed significantly to network error correction and the related topic of index coding. \n\n There was also significant progress on the problem of design and analysis of error-correcting codes for distributed storage.   In a distributed storage system, data pertaining to a file is stored across nodes of a network.  A node could for instance, correspond to a hard disk in a data center.   The principal aims are to make it easy to repair a failed node while keeping the overhead in terms of redundancy introduced to combat node failures low.  Two classes of codes have been proposed, known respectively as regenerating codes and codes with locality.  \n\nOur work on this project contributed to both approaches as well as in the construction of a class of codes that unifies both classes of codes.  This class of code is termed as \"Codes with local regeneration\".     There was also collaboration with the advanced technology group of storage industry leader NetApp that resulted in an emulation of coded system based on codes with local regeneration.  This work was presented at a premier workshop of the storage industry. \n\nThere was also work conducted on distributed function computation where new concepts were introduced, and schemes were presented that permitted the efficient computation of sets of linear functions where the arguments of the functions are outputs of geographically distributed sources of information.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhen Zhang"
