 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental question remain on how nitrogen (N) cycles in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and on the relative contribution of denitrification and anammox to the loss of fixed N.  Recent work by scientists at the University of Washington and Princeton University showed the occurrence of anammox and denitrification in the OMZ of the Arabian Sea and indicated that denitrification dominated the fixed N removal in contrast to reports for the OMZ in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ESTP).  The observed difference was attributed to the nature and timing of organic carbon supplied to the OMZ waters.  In this project, the scientists propose to explain the limited observations of denitrifications in the OMZs by documenting that denitrification is linked to the flux of organic carbon from surface waters whereas anammox does not respond directly to organic C inputs but depends on the flux of soluble byproducts such as ammonium and nitrite released during the breakdown of organic matter.  A field program involving two separate cruises, one to the ETSP and one to the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) will be carried.  These sites were selected because the ESTP is the most studied of the three major OMZs whereas the ETNP is the largest OMZ by volume and may be quantitatively the most important in terms of combined nitrogen removal.  The experimental plan to attain their goals include the following: (1) use extensive spatial coverage as a substitute for high resolution temporal coverage to obtain many measurements of denitrification and anammox rates; (2) use manipulation experiments to investigate the response of denitrification and anammox rates to specific perturbations such as organic matter additions and transient oxygen perturbation; (3) use new tracer measurements to distinguish denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and anammox in incubation experiments; (4) use DNA/RNA microarrays to investigate relationships between transformation rates and the denitrifier assemblage to resolve the role of particles in stimulation of denitrification rates; and (5) use high sensitivity oxygen probes to define the oxygen distribution and to follow oxygen dynamics at low levels in tracer incubation. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the broader impacts, the University of Washington plans to contribute time on the R/V Thompson so that undergraduate students can participate in a cruise and learn about the methods and techniques involved in carrying out oceanographic research, especially those related to this study.  One graduate student from the University of Washington and one postdoc, one graduate student and one undergraduate student from Princeton University would be supported and trained as part of this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFixed nitrogen, i.e. nitrogen in a form that is biologically available, is necessary for life and is thought to be the major limiting nutrient to biological productivity in the ocean on glacial/interglacial timescales.  Fixed nitrogen\u00c6s link to productivity makes it a signification control on the ocean\u00c6s productivity and carbon cycle.  The oceanic fixed nitrogen inventory is controlled by the balance between conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas to a biologically-useful fixed form by one group of bacteria, and its re-conversion back to nitrogen gas that is accomplished by a different group of bacteria.  Despite nitrogen cycle\u00c6s importance, the current state of the oceanic inventory is unknown and the pathways of loss are not understood.\n\nTwo biological processes control the vast majority of fixed-nitrogen loss, denitrification and the newly discovered anammox.  Both of these processes take place in locations where there is virtually no oxygen in the water, i.e., anoxic zones.  About half the total marine fixed nitrogen loss occurs in three large water-column anoxic zones.   We worked in two of these (Figure 1), the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) and South Pacific (ETSP).  Major research goals were to: 1) determine the relative rates of the two biological  processes that produce nitrogen gas and their control mechanisms and, 2) determine if the oxygen deficient zones where these process occur are expanding globally, as has been suggested by other studies.\n\nOur measurements showed that although the ETNP and ETSP were similar in many respects, there were fundamental differences.  In both locations had thick anoxic (containing no measureable oxygen) layers but the one in the ETNP was about 800 m thick, while that in the ETSP was only about 300 m thick (see figure 2).  Both sites contained a prominent peak in the intermediate compound nitrite.  In the ETNP there were two peaks in the amount of nitrogen gas produced, while in the ETSP there was only a single peak, but the magnitude was larger.  These different result from different circulation patterns in the North and South Pacific.  In the South the water below the anoxic zone is relatively young and oxygen rich.  The high oxygen content of this water makes it difficult for the anoxic zone to grow downward.  Whereas in the North Pacific the water below the anoxic zone is relatively old and oxygen poor making it easy for the anoxic zone to grow downward.\n\nDenitrification is a process that relies on organic carbon degradation to produce energy for growth.  This organic carbon degradation produces carbon dioxide, ammonium, and nitrogen gas.  In contrast, anammox bacteria react ammonium with inorganic nitrite to form nitrogen gas and energy for grow.  Previous work on the relative importance of these two mechanisms has been contradictory, with estimates of the relative importance varying between almost all anammox to about 75% denitrification.   However, the previous studies did not include measurements of the sinking particulate-organic material in the water and it is thought that this sinking particulate matter is the main source of energy for the ecosystem.  We conducted a series of experiments in which we incubated water samples with different amounts and forms of organic matter included sinking particulate organic matter we captured from the water column.  In our experiments showed that denitrification was the dominant mechanism of nitrogen gas production and that the relative amount of anammox was determined by the amount of ammonium liberated during organic matter degradation.  This information clarifies our scientific understanding of the nitrogen gas production mechanism in the ocean and will be important when modeling nitrogen gas production, how it might change under different scenarios for future climate change, and how that will affect oceanic productivity.\n\nRecent work has suggested that low oxygen and anoxic zones in the ocean are expected to increase in volume..."
