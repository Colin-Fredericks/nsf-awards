All the students are academically talented students demonstrating financial need and drawn from the surrounding area that is predominantly populated with students from the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo. \r\n\r\nStudents are recruited from a variety of sources including local high schools, collaboration with local math and engineering clubs, existing UNM-G \"math camps\", as well as on-campus learning communities specifically designed for prospective \"Roads to Achieving a Degree in Science\" (RADS) students. Selection criteria include financial need, academic potential, and achievement. Student support services build on the strong history at UNM-G of educating students who need developmental course work prior to successfully completing their associate degrees and transferring to four year programs. Specific student support activities include specially designed learning communities, faculty advising and recruitment, tutoring, a mentoring program provided by professionals employed in the STEM fields, and development of Summer Bridge programs for RADS Scholars to ease their transition to four year STEM degree programs.",
