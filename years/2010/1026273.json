 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), with resources, staff support, and oversight provided by the NAS Polar Research Board (PRB) is proposing a synthesis activity for U.S. efforts, accomplishments, and lessons learned during IPY 2007-2008. The workshop will use a theme approach to facilitate integration and illustrate how IPY combined to move forward polar understanding. The workshop will feature invited presentations, discussions, and breakout group synthesis, to explore issues such as the research capacity and data that resulted from IPY, the value added lessons from international partnerships and education efforts, and the scientific discoveries made, especially related to the role of the polar regions in the global earth system. The workshop will be organized by an ad hoc committee of volunteer experts appointed by the NAS, with resources, staff support, and oversight provided by the PRB, the U.S. National Committee to IPY. The appointed committee will reflect a diversity of expertise and experience. The workshop will result in a peer reviewed National Academies report. The intended impact is to leave a record of IPY 2007-2008 for current decision makers, future scholars, and polar enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe PRB will appoint a diverse planning committee and involve diverse workshop participants. The workshop will strive to foster partnerships amongst researchers and will bring to the public and policy makers an understanding of what took place, why, and how the IPY foundation might be built upon for future endeavors. The PRB will use the tools of the NAS to ensure broad dissemination of the resulting report and will prepare Reports in Brief for easy distribution (both in the U.S. and to our international partners).",
