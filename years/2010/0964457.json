 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies an important class of complex structured planning \r\ndomains called ``service domains'' using simulators and probabilistic\r\naction models. Examples of service domains include optimizing emergency \r\nresponse in a typical city, scheduling doctors and nurses in a \r\nhospital, administering tasks in a typical office, optimally delivering \r\nproducts to shops from distribution centers. These domains \r\nshare many characteristics such as relational structure, parallel actions, \r\nmulti-time-scale decision making, exogenous events, and the need for \r\nhuman interpretable solutions that make them highly challenging.\r\nThe project develops scalable and principled planning algorithms for \r\nservice domains through a variety of techniques including a novel\r\nhierarchical framework of multi-time-scale optimization, new\r\nmodel-free simulation-based planning algorithms, and model-based \r\nplanning via composition of first-order decision diagrams. These \r\ntechniques are applied to the real-world problem of optimizing \r\nthe fire and emergency response in cities through a collaboration\r\nwith the fire department of Corvallis, Oregon. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of the project include new algorithms and frameworks to solve \r\nservice domains, prototype implementations of the algorithms\r\nin the emeregency response domain, and new testbeds of service domains \r\nfor research. The broader impact of the work includes more cost-effective \r\nemergency response systems, and development of new research-oriented courses, \r\ntutorials and special workshops on the next generation decision support \r\nsystems for service domains.",
