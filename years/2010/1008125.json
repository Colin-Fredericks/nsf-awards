 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network award supports an international team of researchers at Cornell (US), Imperial College (UK) and Oxford University (UK) to investigate the synthesis and characterization of novel classes of metal-based nano-structured particles and composites with well-defined geometry and connectivity. The materials are obtained by a modular bottom-up approach of metal-containing nanoparticles (NPs) with core-shell architecture as well as nanocomposites from metal NPs and block copolymers (BCs) as structure-directed agents. The aim of the program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, thermodynamic and kinetic formation principles enabling general and relatively inexpensive wet-chemistry methodologies for the efficient creation of multiscale functional metal materials with novel optical property profiles that may revolutionize the field of nanophotonics/plasmonics/ metamaterials, enabled by nm-scale control over the underlying structure over large dimensions. The proposed research includes synthesis of all necessary organic/polymer and inorganic components, characterization of assembly structures using various scattering, optical and electron microscopy techniques, as well as thorough investigations of their optical properties including simulation and modeling efforts, and work towards major novel optics in the form of sub-wavelength imaging, highly sensitive hot-spot arrays over macroscopic dimensions for sensing, and sub-wavelength waveguiding. While the main focus of the work lies on non-magnetic materials and the assessment of linear optical properties of the fabricated compounds, a crucial point of the investigations is finding synthesis approaches that can be generalized over a wider class of materials systems. A final thrust of the program addresses a particularly topical exploitation area, integrating specific plasmonic structures into hybrid solar cells and characterizing and optimizing plasmon enhanced photogeneration of charges and subsequent solar cell efficiency. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the fundamental principles for successfully combining nanomaterials science with photonics/plasmonics in order to exert control over electromagnetic waves in deep sub-wavelength volumes will have profound impact in a broad range of areas. If successful, the project will provide advanced molecular design concepts for the next generation nanostructured materials in applications such as nanowaveguiding, single-molecule sensing and power generation (photovoltaics). Furthermore, discovering soft-matter, bottom-up approaches to co-assemble polymers and ceramics with metals could enable completely novel ways to organize matter into structures with functionalities not previously available. Team members are well-qualified bringing together unique expertise in the areas of hybrid materials synthesis and characterization, plasmonics and photovoltaics. The research project draws on a number of traditionally separated scientific disciplines, combining materials science with optics/nanophotonics and optoelectronics, thus providing a unique educational experience for students of all levels. The international collaboration will integrate research and education through a suite of proposed programs including international student exchanges, development of cyberinfrastructure, the participation of underrepresented groups, enhancement of infrastructure for research and education, and industrial outreach.",
