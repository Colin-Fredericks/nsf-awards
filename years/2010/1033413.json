 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE special project funds the organization of the CISE Broader Impacts Summit. The goals of the summit include educating the CISE community about the NSF Broader Impacts criterion how to evaluate this criterion as part of a research project.  The Summit should provide researchers and educators with the opportunity to forge collaborations and build long-term partnerships that may lead to a wide range of activities with the potential to enhance CISE research projects. The Summit is to be organized by a Steering Committee that represents all CISE divisions and a range of CISE disciplines.  The investigators plan to discuss, present, and subsequently develop guidance materials for the CISE computing research community on how to effectively integrate broader impact activities into research projects. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project will arise from the working group discussions at the summit. At the end of the summit, a report is to be developed that synthesizes both current and future ideas in each of the five broader impact categories. This should provide research based methods for CISE investigators to connect their research and broader impacts in innovative ways.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project will arise from the computing community members, by those to whom they speak about the summit, and by those who access materials created after the summit. The project includes dissemination plans to ensure the efforts from this project have an impact on future NSF projects. The impact on future NSF projects should result in significant broader impacts from CISE research projects across all five broader impact categories.",
