Profs. Balch and Olmstead and their students will synthesize new fullerene derivatives that contain metal atoms in their backbone. These new fullerenes will be assembled to create unique metal organic frameworks and networks with unconventional chemical reactivity properties. These new and innovative materials are potentially transformative since they could be used as components of greatly improved catalysts and gas storage devices. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to students and postdoctoral research associates in cutting edge research in nanoscience and nanotechnology.",
