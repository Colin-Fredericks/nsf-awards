 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a model alternative energy certificate program, that leads to a new Associate of Applied Sciences degree in industrial technology and a new certificate program for wind energy technicians. The project is establishing career pathways to technical work in the renewable energy fields. The specific needs for a renewable energy certificate are being identified, and space in the planned Community Technology Center is to be devoted to the laboratory areas needed for the program. The A.A.S. degree in industrial technology is meeting the needs of students and incumbent workers by providing a clear career pathway from an industry-related certificate to an A.A.S. degree and then to a baccalaureate degree. The new A.A.S. degree is meeting the needs of industry by encouraging students and incumbent workers who earn a technical certificate to pursue the additional education/training that offers the most benefits to the worker and the employer. That additional education focuses on areas often referred to as \"soft skills\", for example, communication, teamwork and critical thinking. The need for soft skills in the industry workplace is widely recognized and has been documented in a number of reports.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\"Preparing A New workforce for a Sustainable Economy\" was a renewable energy curriculum project at Illinois Valley Community College (IVCC).  The goal of producing model certificate programs for renewable energy technicians leading to a new and adaptable Associate in Applied Science degree in industrial technology was substantially met.\n\nThe objectives of the project were:\n\nTo develop a certificate program for wind energy technicians.  This objective was met through the development and offering of two wind energy certificate programs, a basic and an advanced.\nTo develop a broad-based certificate program for technicians in other renewable / alternative energy industries. This objective was met through the development and offering of a Certified Production Technician certificate which prepares technicians for entry-level biofuel process operation.\nTo develop an Associate in Applied Science degree in industrial technology, creating a career pathway from renewalbe/alternative energy certificate programs and other industry-related certificate programs to baccalaureate degree programs.  This objective was largely met.  The degree, named A.A.S. in Engineering Technology on the basis of industry feedback, has been developed and is pending state approval.  Ten industry-related programs, including the basic wind energy certificate, lead to the degree, which requires all students to  complete the Certified Production Technician certificate.\n\n\nThe project demonstrated its broader impact by addressing the growing need for renewable energy technicians and by promoting renewable energy to non-technician audiences in the College district and beyond.  Specifically:\n\nWind energy companies in the IVCC district advised in the planning and development of the wind energy courses and endorsed the programs that were developed.  One major recommendation was for two levels of wind energy technician certificates as better meeting their needs than the one certificate initially envisioned.  Based on assessments of workforce needs for other renewable energy industries, IVCC not only developed a broad-based certificate program that prepared students for entry level as biofuel process technicians, but also incorporated cross training for solar technicians into wind energy and electronics courses.\nResults of this project have been broadly disseminated to both technical and non-technical audiences at the local, state and national levels: \n\nHands-on presentations and workshops at national and state conferences demonstrated project results to university, community college, high school and middle school staff members.\nA graduate-level course for teachers encouraged and facilitated development and offering of renewable energy activities at the middle school through community college levels.  Teachers reported utilizing those activities in their classrooms.\nRenewable energy activities for use by non-technical teachers in middle school through community college were developed and assembled into two handbooks distributed at conferences and available online free of charge on two web sites established for this project, one on this project in general and one specifically on wind energy.\nProject activities were widely publicized by area media and at meetings of area civic organizations reaching a broad public audience and promoting renewable energy throughout the College district.\nThe construction and opening of a Community Technology Center, which houses a renewable energy laboratory, provided additional opportunities to showcase renewable energy programs and equipment.\n\n\n\n\nThe project was successful and demonstrated its intellectual merit by basing the curriculum on current research, which included building on the pioneering initiatives in renewable energy technician programs at other community colleges.  This project was also informed by lessons learned in two previous NSF grants at IVCC.  Additionally, the College made a major commitment to the development of renewa..."
