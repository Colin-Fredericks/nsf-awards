 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholarships are being awarded to outstanding junior and senior STEM majors in the College of Natural Science and the College of Engineering who desire to earn secondary school teaching certification in their discipline.  The institution has a state-wide partnership with high needs schools via the Alliance School Program that provides an immediate connection to place successful graduates where they are most needed.   There is an emphasis on recruiting students who are interested in teaching in rural schools.    Scholars receive annual scholarships of $10,000 with a $2,000 supplement during the senior year to cover the added housing and/or travel expenses for those placed in a rural school for their field experiences.\r\n\r\nThe university currently has a summer camp program for high school students. Internships to teach in the Summer Camps are available for freshmen and sophomore STEM undergraduates with an interest in teaching under the mentorship of experienced in-service STEM classroom teachers.   Student teaching interns are being recruited as potential scholarship recipients.  A cohort structure for novice teachers with certification in STEM disciplines is being provided for those who teach in high needs schools.  This structure includes induction mentoring by master teachers, professional development activities and networking.\r\n\r\nThirty-five to thirty-eight individuals are being awarded scholarships and forty freshmen and sophomores are participating as interns during the summer camps.",
