 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project is a Type III (C: A) partnership between the College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering (CNSE) at University of Albany, State University of New York (UAlbany), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee), and Marist College (Poughkeepsie, NY), an NSF PFI graduated grantee (0438561). This Collaboration for Leveraging Energy and Nanotechnology (CLEAN) focuses on specific efforts that include: 1) fostering of extensive information exchange amongst industry, university, and government stakeholders; 2) expanding knowledge transfer through the Nanotech Innovation in Renewable Energy (NIRE) efforts; and 3) creating a workforce development program based on industry needs. These activities, managed by the Energy and Environmental Technology Application Center (E2TAC) at CNSE, accelerate the integration of nanotechnology in alternative energy technologies among businesses located in the Tech Valley Region of Upstate New York. Drawing on cutting edge research in nanotechnology and the capability of many of the nation's leading advanced energy technology businesses that utilize nanotechnology, the project provides increased organization and coordination that is needed to share and communicate the industry's most pressing needs to academia and to transfer the most appropriate technologies from academia to industry.  \r\n\r\nThrough its outreach and Energy Innovation Camp, the project will present to the public and key stakeholders from legislators to high school students the importance, challenges, and opportunities of developing clean energy technologies. Through its Energy Test Farm, the project will provide an opportunity for workforce training and education by facilitating competency to develop, install, maintain, and service high tech energy related equipment such as solar cells, fuel cells, and energy efficiency devices through established training programs. The ability to provide this expertise to manufacturing and end-user organizations will serve to accelerate deployment of these new technologies. The project leverages significant physical and research infrastructure that is in place at CNSE to grow the regional economy. By 2015, New York's target is to supply 45 percent of its electricity needs through improved energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. Within the rich context of nanotechnology education and outreach at CNSE, this project focuses on applying nanotechnology to \"clean energy related applications\" and in so doing, it has the potential to make major contributions to New York's \"45 by 15\" program, one of the most aggressive and ambitious clean energy goals in the nation.  \r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) at UAlbany (lead institution) and Marist College; Private Sector Organizations: New Energy New York (NENY), Arsenal Business and Technology Partnership, Center for Economic Growth; and State and Local Government Organizations: Empire State Development (ESD), New York State Foundation for Science Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR),  New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and Saratoga Technology + Energy Park (STEP).",

The funding received assisted in marketing and expanding photovoltaic technology in the Capital Region through the establishment of a PV technology manufacturing consortium, specifically focused on next generation thin film solar technology.  Through the National Grid program, which leveraged CLEAN funding, CNSE held meetings, workshops and conferences regionally, nationally and even internationally to attract partners to the consortium (6 alone internationally across Europe and Asia).  In addition, CNSE developed marketing collateral and outreach programs to disseminate to further areas and organizations of interest.\n\nThese initial meetings, workshops and conferences laid the groundwork to develop the current Department of Energy (DOE)-sponsored U.S. photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) based in Albany, NY, featuring over 80 national and international companies focused on developing and deploying next generation photovoltaic technologies.  But for its  demonstrated success in managing programs for institutions such as the National Science Foundation, and the facilities and expertise at CNSE, highlighted and maintained through programs such as CLEAN program, larger-scale funding would likely not materialize, such as the initial investment that would lead to the eventual $57.5M DOE funding to establish the PVMC.\n\n\nDeveloping an Innovative Workforce to Tackle Tomorrow\u00c6s Energy Needs\n\nOutcome: Since its inception in March 2010, the Energy Innovation Camp, an initiative of the PFI program CLEAN, has provided hands-on learning and experimental activities to over 1,000 K-12 students annually around New York State.\n\nImpact/Benefit: With a focus on female, at-risk, and minority groups, CLEAN has worked to make the STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fun and approachable to students that have historically had low representation in STEM-based careers. \n\nExplanation: According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion.  The need for skilled workers in this area is expected to only become more acute over time.  \n\nThe CLEAN program has developed new and unique approaches to increase student interest and interaction in STEM areas.  Through classroom work, designed with local high schools, and hands-on laboratory activities at the CNSE\u00c6s Albany NanoTech Complex, students explore the promise and potential of nanotechnology to enable advanced technologies that will positively impact fields ranging from electronics, energy and the environment to health care, military and information technology, among many others. \n\nThroughout the year, students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that utilized CNSE\u00c6s state-of-the-art laboratories and world-class cleanrooms, exploring integrated circuit technologies through nanoscale patterning and fabrication; nanobiomedical applications, including innovations in  nanomedicine; clean energy technologies, such as solar cells, fuel cells, and ultracapacitors for energy storage; and nanoeconomics. \n\nSchools that have participated in previous years return again and again, signifying the valuable impact of the CLEAN program on..."
