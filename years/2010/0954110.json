New UHTC systems with enhanced oxidation resistance at high temperatures will enable the materials necessary for scientific discovery used in space exploration vehicles and new energy technology applications. As a complement to the research, a multi-objective education plan designed to engage and train underrepresented minorities in materials science and engineering technologies will also be an integral component of this project. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\r\nThe goal of the research is to investigate the fundamental oxidation mechanisms of novel multilayered UHTC systems, which is a problem in non-equilibrium reaction kinetics where the reaction process dynamics lead to new material formation dependent on the microstructure of the constituents. It is well known that UHTC composites such as ZrB2-SiC possess superior oxidation resistance over monolithic ZrB2 and SiC because the composite naturally forms a complex multilayer oxide structure in situ at high temperature. This research is driven by the need to further understand the formation of the complex oxidation resistant oxides in order to further enhance the oxidation resistance of multilayered UHTCs so they can be used in future aerospace vehicles and energy applications. This research will result in a new fundamental understanding of high-temperature oxidation mechanisms that will enable oxidation resistance in multilayered UHTCs processed using spark plasma sintering which are strongly dependent on specific microstructure, geometry, and environmental conditions. This project will train graduate, undergraduate and high school students in specialized techniques required for ceramic processing and oxidation measurements of UHTCs. The project team will also lead a summer research institute for undergraduate students called, the Southwest Materials Research and Training (SMaRT) Program. \r\n",
