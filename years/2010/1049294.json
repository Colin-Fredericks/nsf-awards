 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to explore some novel ideas on adaptive sensing and monitoring in wireless sensor networks. The focus will be on formulating monitoring methodology inspired by the natural immune system and agent technology, which could potentially lead to adaptive sensing and monitoring. To mimic adaptive immune response, mathematical models will be investigated to study the collaboration of immune cells and provide guideline for the design of such mechanisms in wireless monitoring networks. The project will look for an agent-based network framework to enable immune-inspired adaptive, self-organizing, and autonomous anomaly detection. Multi-objective optimization algorithms will be studied for the robust control of agent generation and distribution to enhance system responsiveness, anomaly detection probability, and network lifetime. Immune-network-theory-based algorithms will also be investigated for the unsupervised anomaly detection.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this research project will have a great impact on the current ability of adaptive sensing and monitoring. The anticipated adaptive immune response models could potentially allow a monitoring system to adjust the number and type of monitoring agents in response to the changes in monitoring conditions. Multi-objective agent generation and distribution strategies could provide a good balance across responsiveness, anomaly detection probability, and network lifetime. The immune-network-based anomaly detection could offer dynamic updates of a nominal behavior model due to environmental and operational changes. The outcomes of this project will offer clear societal benefits in advancing monitoring technologies for critical infrastructure, power grids, traffic systems, and military applications. The research results will be widely disseminated via the following mechanisms: Web, publication of papers, professional talks, and by incorporating materials into teaching. Educational opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students are integrated throughout the research program. The outreach efforts will impact rural, low income, and pre-college students.",
