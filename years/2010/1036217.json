The award is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the Chemistry Division, the Physics Division and the Division of Materials Research. \r\n\r\nStatistical mechanics is a cross-disciplinary field with practitioners coming from chemistry, mathematics, biology, physics, computer science and the engineering sciences. Every three years, this community assembles a major international meeting. These meetings are sponsored by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). This triennial series of meetings started in Florence in 1949 and continues to the present day. Starting with the 1986 meeting in Boston, the NSF has awarded travel grants to enable young investigators without other support to participate. This award will enable 12-15 graduate students and young researchers to participate in STATPHYS-24. A selection committee representing a cross-section of senior scientists has committed to undertake a fair selection of a balanced group of \"NSF Scholars,\" representing all disciplines of the statistical mechanics community and paying particular attention to qualified female and minority candidates. \r\n\r\nThe award will contribute to the scientific infrastructure of U.S. science by permitting young people to participate in a major international meeting. It will strengthen the ties of these young people to their peers from Australia and around the world.",

The Scientific Program included Plenary talks, Invited talks, Contributed talks, and a large number of Posters, and all attendees supported by this grant were encourage to attend as many presentations as possible.  The Plenary talks were given by senior scientists and often provided substantive overviews of a range of previous work done on a topic.  These were particularly useful for broadening the knowledge base of the young scientists in attendance.  The Invited talks concentrated on significant recent developments in research in statistical physics and provided students and postdocs with first hand, deep intellectual insight into important problems and the methods of solution.  The discussion following Contributed talks and at the posters gave young U.S. based scientists the opportunity to develop their skills at direct scientific exchange with others from very different backgrounds. \n\nThe program focused on eleven different topical areas:\n\nTopic 1\nGeneral aspects of statistical physics: phase transitions, critical phenomena, thermodynamics, networks and graphs, etc.\nTopic 2\nMathematical aspects: rigorous results, exact solutions, matrix models, SLE, combinatorics etc.\nTopic 3\nNonequilibrium processes: driven systems, transport theory, relaxation phenomena, random processes, fluctuations, large deviations etc.\nTopic 4\nQuantum systems: strongly correlated electrons, cold atoms, graphene, soft quantum matter, mesoscopic quantum phenomena, fractional quantum Hall effect, low dimensional quantum field theory, quantum phase transitions, quantum information and entanglement, etc.\nTopic 5\nFluids and soft matter: molecular and ionic fluids, metastable liquids, polymers, gels, liquid crystals, microemulsions, foams, membranes, colloids, granular materials, etc.\nTopic 6\nSurfaces and Interfacial phenomena: growth processes, wetting, surface effects, films, confined systems, etc.\nTopic 7\nNon-linear phenomena: dynamical systems, pattern formation, hydrodynamic instabilities, turbulence, chemical reactions, etc.\nTopic 8\nDisordered and glassy systems: percolation, spin glasses, structural glasses, jamming, glass transition, algorithmic problems, etc.\nTopic 9\nBiological physics: molecular motors, dynamics at the scale of the cell, spatio-temporal organization in biological systems, biological membranes, biopolymer folding, etc.\nTopic 10\nStatistical modeling of biological data: genomics, biological networks, evolution models, etc.\nTopic 11\nInterdisciplinary topics in statistical physics: applied networks, econophysics, social phenomena, information theory, traffic flow, etc. \n\nDuring STATPHYS24 the C3 commission of IUPAP awarded the Boltzmann Medal (for outstanding accomplishment in statistical physics) for 2010 jointly to:\nJohn Cardy, for his numerous seminal contributions to two-dimensional critical phenomena in statistical physics, including the development and application of conformal field theory, finite-size effects and percolation.\n\nBernard Derrida, for his major contributions to the understanding of disordered and of out-of-equilibrium systems, in particular through the random energy model, and through his breakthroughs in the asymmetric exclusion model.\n\nEach individual also presented a special Invited talk on their area of expertise.\n\nA complete list of abstracts is available online at: http://www.statphys.org.au\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David P Landau"
