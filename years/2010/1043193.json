 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel of undergraduate students, graduate students, and two members of the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) to the Annual Conference of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).   SACNAS was established over 30 years ago with the specific mission of encouraging Chicano/Latino and Native American students to pursue graduate degrees and obtain the advanced degrees necessary to have research careers and to teach the science professions at all levels.  The conference will be held in Annaheim, CA, Sept. 30 through Oct. 3, 2010.   NSHP is organizing three sessions at SACNAS: \"The Frontier of Nuclear and Particle Physics\"; \"Exploring the Universe\", and \"Astronomy and Astrophysics: The Next Ten Years\". The sessions organized by NSHP at each SACNAS meeting are meant for undergraduate students in physics and astronomy and are meant to serve as: 1) a way of introducing the students to some of the most interesting areas of research; 2) a way for students to ask the presenters about their research; 3) a way of introducing the students to successful minorities in their field; 4) a way for students to ask the presenters or other professionals when and where to apply for graduate schools.  This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
