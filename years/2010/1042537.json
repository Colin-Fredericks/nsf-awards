 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Parallel Reconfigurable Observational Environment (PRObE) supports research on future supercomputing architectures. PRObE provides a needed and unique infrastructure to the low-level systems research community to study scaling (number of threads, nodes, and processors per node) and other challenges facing future supercomputing architectures. This infrastructure fills a well known significant long standing research facilities gap in the nations capabilities by creating a very large shared resource for systems and low-level research that allows fault injection, power control, controlling the entire resource down to the hardware, and providing direct hands on control of the resource. \r\nThe unique capabilities of PRObE open up new opportunities for research and hands-on experimentation that is was previously not feasible in the academic community. Using PRObE the low level systems research community is developing an improved understanding of the systems-level challenges for high-end computing, and the creating effective techniques to address them.  PRObE creates new research opportunities for the academic community that has the significant potential to have a transformative impact on future supercomputing architectures.  \r\nPRObE  provides an internship program and an annual summer school for hands-on training for visiting students on HEC systems using the Probe testbed.  The proposed effort includes special attention to students from underrepresented groups, incorporating populations local to the New Mexico location.\r\nThe proposed infrastructure has the potential to facilitate the development of advances in basic knowledge required for the US to maintain its leadership positions in computing systems, data-intensive cloud computing, and data center automation.",
