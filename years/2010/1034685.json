The workshop primarily aims to enhance the education and professional preparation of graduate students and postdocs by providing them with an opportunity to present their work; to interact with their peers, established researchers in the field, researchers from industry and government labs, and program managers from the National Science Foundation; to hear about cutting edge research from plenary speakers; and to learn about cross-disciplinary topics of interest from keynote lecturers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nIn additional to the student participants, this workshop will bring together leading researchers in the (broadly interpreted) field of control, some of whom we intend to invite as plenary speakers and keynote lecturers. As such, the workshop will provide a forum for the much needed interaction between control theory and various cross-disciplinary application areas, resulting in a cross-polination of ideas and providing an impetus for interdisciplinary collaborations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will encourage a broad and diverse group of students to pursue research careers, by providing them with an opportunity to closely interact with leading researchers in the field in an intimate setting. Moreover, the unique opportunity to get to know and interact with program managers will be invaluable for these students and postdocs as they transition into independent junior researchers over the next few years.",
