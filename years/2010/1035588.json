 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to apply grammatical inference models recently developed in the field of linguistics and phonology, as a basis for abstraction, composition, symbolic control, and learning in distributed multi-agent cyber-physical systems. The approach is to map the system dynamics, specifications, and task interdependences to finite abstract models, and then describe the desired behavior of the system in an appropriate grammar that can be decomposed into local agent specifications. In this framework, the agents can learn the behavior of their environment by observing its dynamics, and update their specifications accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe proposed approach to learning in cyber-physical systems, which is based on grammatical inference at a purely discrete level, is a significant departure from current works. Following this approach, one can reason about large-scale processes resulting from event interdependencies between agents, without having to construct large product systems. To realize this plan, specific technical advances on modeling, abstraction, and control synthesis are proposed.\r\n\r\nQuestions related to formally factoring and composing heterogeneous systems are pervasive in the fields of formal languages and computational learning. There are also applications of commercial significance in the area of discovering new azeotropic mixtures based on documented pairs of compounds that are known to have the particular property. Proposed dissemination and outreach activities include the involvement of middle and high school students and teachers, integrated in existing NSF-sponsored programs at the University of Delaware and Boston University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The major research goal of the project was to develop a common theoretic basis for modeling, abstraction, control synthesis, and learning in cyber-physical systems.  This theoretical framework was rooted in formal languages and verification on one hand, as utilized in control design using formal software verification tools, and machine learning algorithms utilized in mathematical linguistics and phonology.  The reason that such synergy between these two disparate scientific fields is possible is because they share some fundamental mathematical underpinnings.   While hybrid systems modeling, abstraction and control are topics are within the general field of control, they now draw from formal language theory just as language learning, which is in the purview of theoretical linguistics and computer science.\nSpecifically for this project, we aimed at drawing from computational learning methods developed in the context of linguistics and phonology, to attack a problem of multi-agent coordination under the influence of adversarial interaction.  Instances of that problem are often found in emergency response, where the adversarial challenge that has to be faced can either act at random or purposefully, and models for the adversarial interaction constructed on the fly can be extremely useful in emergency response planning and control.  The hypothesis is that if we learn how to model and identify in real time physical processes that evolve based on deterministic rules, we can enable the rapid reconfiguration and adaptation of the plans of teams of emergency responders and provide them with increasingly more accurate models of the environmental phenomena they are up against.  This project attempted for the first time to adapt and port into the domain of hybrid systems modeling, abstraction, and control synthesis, machine learning techniques founded on formal methods rather than statistical learning theory.  Educational and outreach goals include the integration of research outcomes in the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, interdisciplinary intramural initiatives, and reaching out to local K-12 communities through established programs.\nOne key aspect of this novel integration of machine learning and symbolic control synthesis is that control is decoupled from learning.  In this context, learning takes the form of incremental system identification targeting the unknown environmental dynamics; control synthesis uses the learned model to predict environment behavior and decide on actions aiming at satisfying the system specifications.  Learning algorithms do not dictate control policy, but rather inform about the world in which the system operates.  As the world model is refined through the incremental learning process, whatever control methodology is being utilized is bound to become more effective, and in the limit match the performance expected if full knowledge about the environment dynamics were available. \nThe learning algorithms are developed in the context of grammatical inference, which is concerned with the identification of formal languages using finite representations of them, usually in the form of automata or grammars.  In this project, in particular, we investigated and addressed two different forms of uncertainty over environment behavior.  In one case, the environment dynamics are captured by a discrete probabilistic dynamical model, a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and our learning algorithms are tasked with identifying the transition probabilities of this MDP based on continuing observations of environment behavior.  In the second case, the environment dynamics are deterministic, still unknown, and in addition, adversarial.  In this case, our learning algorithms identify the actual structure of a discrete environment model that looks like a graph with controllable transitions (an automaton).  In both cases, the prior knowledge for the learner is the class of formal languages that mathematically express the environmen..."
