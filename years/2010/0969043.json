 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our Galaxy contains astrophysical systems that accelerate particles to energies beyond the reach of any accelerator built by humans. What drives these accelerators is a major question in astrophysics, and understanding these accelerators has broad implications. TeV photons are a key diagnostic of highly energetic particles. Most simply put, emission of a TeV photon requires that the emitting electron, proton, or other particle began at an energy of a TeV or greater. Observations in the TeV band are a sensitive probe of the most energetic physical processes occurring in a variety of Galactic objects. Detection of TeV emission from binaries systems containing a neutron star or black hole is an exciting, new, and unexpected result. \r\n\r\nWith this award, this group will conduct observations in the TeV band using the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to image flashes of Cherenkov light produced when highly energetic photons strike Earth's atmosphere. They will use VERITAS to study Galactic particle accelerators including jets from stellar-mass black holes and rapidly rotating, young neutron stars, supernova remnants, and unidentified gamma-ray sources. In addition, they will conduct multi-wavelength (X-ray/GeV/TeV) observations that are the key to understanding the particle acceleration process in these systems. They will operate and maintain the pointing monitor system and contribute to the operation of the VERITAS array. \r\n\r\nAs Broader Impacts, an integral part of the proposed activity will be the broad dissemination of information on very high energy gamma-ray astronomy to college and high school students and the general public making use of materials developed in the VERITAS education and outreach program being led by the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum. Presentations on gamma-ray astronomy and specific results from VERITAS will be made to high school classes and to the general public as part of the \"Hawk-Eyes on Science\" program of the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Iowa and at the Eastern Iowa Observatory and Learning Center (EIOLC) located near Cedar Rapids, IA.",
