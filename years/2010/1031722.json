 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advancements in nonlinear computer modeling, seismic hazard analysis, and performance-based engineering are enabling better scientific assessment of building collapse under large earthquakes and other hazards. However, while existing methods do a reasonable job at characterizing the average response of  buildings, they lack the resolution to evaluate how the performance is affected by inherent variability in building materials, design and construction quality assurance.  This project aims to address this limitation by developing and applying new methods and data to incorporate modeling uncertainties into computational methods to simulate the structural collapse of buildings, bridges and other structures. The project entails three main tasks: (1) developing statistics on the variability in materials, design and quality assurance by collecting published test data and other supporting information and case histories, (2) developing new strategies to efficiently incorporate modeling uncertainties into nonlinear dynamic simulation methods, and (3) to implement and exercise the new approach to assess the collapse safety of a set of archetype building structures.  The resulting methods will lead to fundamental advancements in quantifying collapse risk and understanding of factors that affect collapse safety of buildings. \r\n\r\nBy developing methods to accurately evaluate factors that affect building collapse safety, this research will enable improvements to building codes and design and construction practices that will lead to more economical and safe buildings.  The research products will also advance the state-of-art in performance based design methods that facilitate more rapid development and adoption of innovative new building technologies.  To facilitate technology transfer to other researchers and engineering professionals, the PIs will publish open-source software and data to an on-line web site. The research will involve and provide research training for two graduate doctoral students and undergraduate student assistants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn important challenge in earthquake resistant design of buildings and civil infrastructure is to design structural systems that are both safe, with a low risk of collapse under extreme earthquakes, and economical to build and maintain.   To address this tradeoff between safety and economy, building code requirements have been calibrated using a combination of observed performance of buildings in earthquakes, laboratory testing of structural components, nonlinear structural analysis, and seismic risk analysis.  Over the past two decades, nonlinear structural analysis and engineering seismology have been sufficiently developed to allow researchers to quantify the risk of structural collapse due to earthquakes.  In addition to these technologies to accurately simulate the highly nonlinear response of structures, the assessment of building system reliability requires data and methodologies to (1) characterize the large uncertainties in earthquake ground motions and the nonlinear behavior of structures, and (2) propagate these uncertainties through the nonlinear analysis and overall risk analysis.  These so-called system reliability aspects are essential for accurate analysis of collapse safety, and they have implications on other building code design requirements.  The main outcome of this research has been the development of robust system reliability methods to characterize the influence of structural modeling uncertainties on building system response from the onset of damage up through collapse from earthquakes.   \n\nA comprehensive framework methodology has been developed that provides a systematic procedure to (1) statistically characterize structural model parameters from laboratory tests, accounting for both uncertainties in the parameters and correlations between them, and (2) propagate the modeling uncertainties through the building system analyses using either simulation-based (e.g., Monte Carlo or Importance Sampling), moment-based (e.g., First Order Second Moment), or surrogate (e.g., response surface or neural network) methods.  To reduce computational demand of collapse risk assessment, a Bayesian approach is proposed and demonstrated to provide reliable results, compared to the more traditional frequentist-based approaches.  The proposed methods have been applied to assess the influence of modeling uncertainties on the structural deformation demands and collapse safety of reinforced concrete buildings subjected to extreme earthquakes.  Archetype building studies demonstrate that consideration of modeling uncertainties can increase the risk (mean annual frequency) of collapse by about 1.7 times, as compared to analyses that do not consider uncertainties. The reliability methods have also been applied to develop practical methods for evaluating provisions for earthquake resistant design, including methods for establishing (1) demand and capacity factors to limit the risk of failure in columns, connections and other critical force-controlled components of seismic resisting systems, and (2) building drift limits to limit the risk of collapse due to excessive deformations and geometric instabilities.  \n\nThe research findings have been published in two technical reports and several papers.  The developed methodologies and archetype studies have also been utilized by professional committees in the development of new earthquake resistant design provisions for national building codes and standards. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory G Deierlein"
