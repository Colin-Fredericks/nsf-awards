 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Emerging Scholars Program-REU will build on the 30-year record of success of Emerging Scholars Programs (ESPs), helping underrepresented freshmen and sophomores who graduate from those programs to prepare for the mathematics major, for future more advanced REU experiences, and for graduate school. St. Mary's College of Maryland boasts a thriving mathematics program and years of success in working with underrepresented groups early in their careers making it an ideal location to host twelve students for this six-week, summer REU. \r\n\r\nApplications for the program will be solicited from more than 30 ESPs around the country, specifically targeting underrepresented minority students who have excelled in the first two semesters of Calculus. Participants will attend morning seminars designed to prepare students for the rigors of proof-based mathematics courses, and will investigate research questions in Game Theory, Knot Theory, and Graph Theory during the afternoon. Additional social and academic activities will help prepare students for futures in mathematics and mathematics-intensive careers. The four goals of the program are to help these students 1) enroll in and succeed in proof-based math classes; 2) declare and succeed in math majors or minors; 3) apply for and attend REUs for more advanced students; and 4) attend graduate school in a math or a math-related field.",
