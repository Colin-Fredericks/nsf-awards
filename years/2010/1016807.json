 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern malware is used extensively in computer crime and cyber-warfare\r\nand poses a serious threat to the cyber-infrastructure of the United\r\nStates, at the military, civil, and corporate levels.  Malware can\r\nemploy a number of techniques to gain access to needed resources and\r\nto prevent detection, including hooking or modifying system calls,\r\nadding new system calls, inserting new kernel modules, and directly\r\npatching kernel code.  Furthermore, malware is increasingly stealthy,\r\nbeing both difficult to detect and to analyze, and current-generation\r\nschemes for detection, analysis, and mitigation will become\r\nincreasingly ineffective as the trend toward additional stealth\r\nincreases, with more esoteric infection vectors, complex packing\r\nschemes, polymorphism, and metamorphism being employed.\r\n\r\nThis proposal leverages emerging live digital forensics techniques, to\r\ncreate powerful techniques for malware detection and mitigation. These\r\nlive forensics techniques deeply analyze memory dumps and build\r\naccurate models of kernel and application structures that reflect the\r\nstate of the machine at the time of an investigation.  By integrating\r\nlive forensics techniques into a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and\r\ndeveloping hardware-supported introspection techniques to analyze\r\nsystem state, malware detection facilities can be created that prevent\r\nmalware from interfering with detection and mitigation strategies.\r\nThe proposal discusses a number of necessary tasks to support this\r\nresearch agenda, including the design of and development of a\r\nhardware-assisted VMM introspection architecture and deep, portable\r\nmodeling of kernel data structures and other guest VM state, including\r\nthe filesystem.  These modeling techniques can then be used for\r\nreal-time verification of critical kernel code, cross-verification of\r\nkernel structures, application state analysis, and protection of\r\ncritical system files. A novel aspect of the proposed research is the\r\nuse of commodity Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), protected by\r\nhardware directed-I/O virtualization, as malware detection\r\naccelerators.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is to increase the\r\ndepth, flexibility, and capabilities of introspected live forensics\r\nanalysis and to expand the scope of live forensics to the detection of\r\nsophisticated malware.  The proposed techniques expand\r\nstate-of-the-art in live forensics techniques, virtual machine\r\nintrospection, and kernel-level malware detection and will provide a\r\nfoundation on which to build even more powerful techniques.  The\r\nbroader impacts of the proposed work touch all sectors of society,\r\nsince individual citizens, as well as the law enforcement, military,\r\nand corporate communities all benefit from the deployment of more\r\nsophisticated malware detection mechanisms. The proposed work also\r\nenhances the existing curriculum in information assurance at the\r\nUniversity of New Orleans, since research results from this effort\r\nwill be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate courses,\r\nexposing students to an important area of study in which the supply of\r\npractitioners falls far short of the demand.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL\r\nhttp://www.cs.uno.edu/~golden/live-forensics.html.",
