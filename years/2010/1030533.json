 "awd_abstract_narration": "To be effective professionally the coming generation of scientists must learn to contribute within the global research environment and be globally aware scientists.  An understanding of how research is conducted in different cultures, how local culture affects science and engineering, and how one should communicate effectively internationally, is part of the necessary learning. A standard curriculum or US-based research experience can't teach this.\r\n\r\nThis program will support 5 advanced undergraduate researchers each summer for three years for an intense and advanced research experience at a National Laboratory in Japan.  Participants will be drawn from prior years' NNIN REU program. This assures that the students have a well formed baseline of research experience from which to build and that we have a reliable assessment of their potential. The foreign partners at the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan have proven to be most effective and willing hosts for our students. \r\n\r\nThis experience will come at a critical time in the participants' careers as they prepare for graduate school. Through this program they will advance their research skills, expand their knowledge in nanotechnology, expand their cultural horizons, and gain confidence that they can contribute effectively in a challenging international context, and be effective global scientists.",
