As past conferences have demonstrated, the conference will foster communications and collaborations among established researchers, young scientists and graduate students working in the fields of dynamical systems and differential equations. The funds will provide partial support for travel expenses of participants, especially for graduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and participants from under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences. This award is co-funded by the Applied Mathematics and Analysis programs.",

Each Conference takes place in a different region of the world to benefit most people.  The following five features make the Conference unique and outstanding. \n\n(1) Its high quality and broad coverage so that each participant will be able to find numerous stimulating talks; (2) its well-organized symposia that are participated by most of the leading experts of the world in the chosen areas; (3) its capacity of arranging each Conference to take place in a different region to benefit most people; (4) its organizer, AIMS, which is backed by thousands of supporters.  Its proceedings is also published by AIMS; and (5) its financial support for and broad participation by young researchers and graduate students.\n\nThe 8th AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications was held at The Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, May 25  - 28, 2010.
