 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of this study will be in the introduction of high frequency mobile Doppler radar technology to the VORTEX 2 field program.  This is a large field program entering its second field operations period in May-June 2010 involving multiple mobile platforms focused on the study of tornadic thunderstorms in the upper Great Plains region. This contribution to the field program will involve two Texas Tech University Ka-band (35 GHz) (TTUKa) radars. Observations with these radars will be used to address many VORTEX 2 objectives related to better understanding the nature of circulations in the near-tornado environment, in tornado cyclones, and in sub-tornado-scale vortices. Owing to the use of non-linear pulse compression, a first for mobile high-frequency radar, these radar systems feature higher sensitivity than other such radars. The fine angular resolution and high sensitivity of the TTUKa radars will provide previously unresolved detail and coverage of air motions at the tornado scale. Two primary observational objectives are (1) horizontal and vertical structure of tornado vortices, and (2) pre-existing vertical vorticity maxima prior to tornadogenesis. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the study will be manifested in several ways. Graduate and undergraduate students will be heavily utilized in the planning and execution of TTUKa data collection and the presentation of preliminary results at mission briefings. Some of these students have a background in fields other than meteorology (e.g., civil engineering, wind engineering, mathematics), and therefore have the opportunity to expand their knowledge base. Given the typical ethnic diversity of the student population at Texas Tech University, traditionally underrepresented groups will have the opportunity to contribute to the project, particularly those of Hispanic descent.\r\n\r\nOne ultimate goal of the proposed research is the improved understanding of tornado vortex structure, leading to advancement in understanding of hazards due to tornados. Another objective of the research is to improve tornado forecasts through the recognition of the influence of detectable variability in the pre-tornadic supercell environment on subsequent storm evolution. This increase in forecast skill is vital for the protection of life and property. Through the broad dissemination of research results in journal publications and conference presentations, all research objectives that are met will have significant impact in the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMuch of what we have learned regarding the structure of tornado vortices has derived from theory and simulation.   These studies have yielded useful insights across the Atmospheric Science and Wind Engineering communities regarding the distribution of tornadic winds in the near-surface layer, where the impact on man\u00c6s build environment is felt.  These studies have also shed light on the various maintenance mechanisms for tornadoes (i.e., once the tornado forms, how does it continue for long periods of time without disruption?).  \n\nComparatively, there has been a relative lack of direct observations of the near-surface layer of tornadoes.  These efforts are typically hampered by the technology available (e.g., radar systems with too wide of beams), the ability to safely achieve a location close enough to tornadoes, and the prevalence of rolling terrain with significant ground cover, which restricts the line of sight to the surface contact layer.\n\nDuring 2010, two high-frequency mobile Doppler radars  - the Texas Tech Ka-band (TTUKa) radars &ndash; were brought to the field as part of the Verification of the Origin of Rotation in Tornadoes (VORTEX2) campaign, with the specific charge of making measurements of low-level tornado structure.  Over the span of this season, and subsequent, smaller field campaigns in 2011-2015, data were obtained for a number of cases across the Plains region. \n\nThe analysis of these cases has yielded the following conclusions:\n\nSimilar to previous studies, the horizontal flow structure of tornadoes is very similar to that of a solid body, where wind velocity increases linearly out to the radius of maximum wind, \nSimilar to prior simulations, the depth of inflow into tornadoes scales well with the radius of maximum wind,\nContrary to most previous studies, it has been shown that a tornado can maintain itself, at least briefly, when winds are diverging in the lowest 200 m above ground layer, and\nConsiderable asymmetries are present in real tornado profiles, possibly owing to heterogeneity present on the storm scale, whether the air entering the tornado originates from the ambient environment, or is rain-cooled outflow air.\n\n\nThe investigators on this project have also combined TTUKa radar data with observations from other mobile in situ and radar platforms to produce analyses of thunderstorms prior to the genesis of tornadoes.  Surges within the rear flank downdraft, an area of subsiding motion typically found on the western periphery of supercell thunderstorms, were specifically studied to better understand their relevance to tornado formation.  It was found that the low-level rotation of the parent thunderstorm was responsible for the generation of these surges, which could in turn amplify the low-level rotation, as observed in great detail by the TTUKa radars in one VORTEX2 event.\n\nTraining and outreach have been a key component of this work.  Graduate and undergraduate students from Texas Tech University and the University of Michigan have been involved in the collection of radar data in the field.  The results from the project have been broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and have been integrated directly into the graduate and undergraduate Atmospheric Science curriculum at Texas Tech University.  The investigators also had the opportunity to demonstrate the TTUKa instrumentation and share outcomes of the project with an assortment of middle-school and high-school students from the region, particularly during the Hispanic Engineering, Science and Technology Week at the University of Texas-Pan American.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher C Weiss"
