 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experience in Computational Sciences\r\nPrincipal investigator: J. Moreno\r\nCo-Principal investigator: G. Allen\r\nSubmitting Organization: Center for Computation & Technology\r\nLocation: Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA\r\n\r\nThere is a national need to attract more students to careers in STEM\r\ndisciplines. In particular, computational science is a crosscutting capability which, combined with experiment and theory, produces the highest caliber research in science and engineering disciplines. Computational science will only fulfill its potential if advances in interdisciplinary education and training of the workforce occurs. \r\n\r\nThis newly established Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site at Louisiana State University (LSU) will combine individual training with student immersion in a multidisciplinary research group to provide a rich research experience in a computational science project.  Occurring over a nine week summer period, eight undergraduate students each year will be individually matched to a project among a diverse portfolio representing different aspects of computational science as well as a wide array of scientific disciplines. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the unique and highly valuable exposure to multidisciplinary research methods, training in the use of advanced computational tools and experience in the use of  multimedia collaborative tools for national/international teamwork, will better prepare these students for the future.  Engagement of students occurs both individually via mentoring and in group settings.  Both formal and informal approaches are included in project development and communication.  Project selection, followup mentoring and program feedback are designed  to broaden the student appeal, improve the program and to support sustained student interest in a research career.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this REU effort are threefold. The appeal of the projects to a wide array of undergraduate students has been carefully built into the program via exciting aspects of computational science, an international flavor and the inclusion of many scientific disciplines.  This appeal to a wide array of students is further enhanced by the program's focused effort to draw from underrepresented populations, an effort which builds on previous institutional successes.  Finally, the program has been crafted so that it can be readily replicated in other settings.",
