 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project studies the conditions under which judicial institutions that protect minority rights can emerge in majoritarian political systems. It responds to the puzzle: Why don't legislative majorities curb courts that prevent the implementation of enacted legislation when those majorities have the constitutional ability to do so? The research team proposes that judicial protection of minorities can emerge as an unintended by-product of majoritarian politics. Popular majorities support judicial review because courts benefit majorities by protecting them against \"corrupt\" or \"captured\" legislatures. Researchers test this theory using a controlled experiment that assesses whether respondents? evaluations of the US Supreme Court relative to the Congress are changed by reports of congressional corruption, news of judicial decisions that conform to subjects? preferences, or an interaction of these two treatments.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is valuable for scholars of political development and institutional design, especially in democracies with multiracial and multiethnic societies. The project also contributes to graduate education.",
