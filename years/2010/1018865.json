 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continuous evolution of the Web has made itself the primary\r\nknowledge source for many people. It has become an information\r\nrepository full of entities (material or virtual) and descriptions\r\nof their properties and relationships. In discovering and exploring\r\nthe entities that fascinate them, the users are in need of\r\nstructured querying facilities, coupled with text retrieval\r\ncapabilities, that explicitly deal with the entities, their\r\nproperties, and relationships.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this project, the PIs investigate a novel declarative query\r\nmechanism, entity-relationship queries (ERQ), for users to discover\r\nand explore the rich structured and entity-centric information on\r\nthe Web. The research objective is to produce general methods for\r\nefficient processing and optimization of entity-relationship\r\nqueries and automatic ranking of query results, and to\r\nsystematically develop a query engine for such queries. The\r\nmethodology is to exploit the evidence of the co-occurrence of\r\nentities and keyword constraints, through the integration of DB and\r\nIR methods. A systematic approach will be taken to produce automatic\r\nranking function formulation method, efficient entity-centric index\r\nand index selection methods, and top-k query processing algorithms.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research results will have broader impacts on the higher\r\neducation system, high-tech industries, the scientific community,\r\nand the general public. The educational goal of the project is to\r\nbe achieved by integrating research and educational efforts through\r\nthese activities: broadening database curriculum; involving\r\nunder-represented students and undergraduates in research;\r\noutreach; and publicly releasing the online demo, software,\r\ndatasets, publications, and course materials.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page:\r\nURL: http://idir.uta.edu/erq",
