 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas is a key component of the coupled ice-atmosphere-ocean system and a driver of meridional ocean circulation, yet information about sea ice conditions in the past is very limited. The goals of this proposed study are two-fold. The first is to use archived surface sediments collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas to develop quantitative measures of seasonal sea-ice extent and duration. This will be achieved through analysis of diatom morphology, assemblages and the IP25 biomarker of ice-associated diatoms from a suite of over 200 surface sediments collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas spanning 0-12 months/year of sea ice. The second goal is to apply sea ice reconstructions using the calibrated diatom assemblage methods and IP25 analysis to a suite of six archived cores that form a latitudinal transect through the Bering and Chukchi Seas. The PIs aim to quantitatively reconstruct Late Pleistocene and Holocene seasonal sea ice extent at centennial-scale resolution. These efforts will be corroborated with independent biomarker-based evaluation of surface water temperatures. The successful completion of the project will result in a rich, multi-proxy data set that will be used to evaluate the sea ice and sea surface temperature history of the Bering Strait region. The results of this project will be relevant to global climate modelers as well as paleoecologists, paleoclimatologists, and paleoceanographers interested in regional- to global-scale forcing issues. The broader Arctic science community would benefit from the proxy development proposed. The project would support two full-time graduate students and a summer undergraduate research assistant in each year of the project. The PIs and students will also continue to develop curriculum modules designed to introduce 5th through 8th grade students to the topics of global and Arctic climate, marine sedimentation, ecosystem adaptation to changing environments, and the classification of organisms.",

Sea ice is vitally important to how the Earth system works, therefore it is increasingly important to put this decline in the context of natural variability.

Specifically improvements in diatom-based proxies and the molecular biomarker, IP25, have allowed quantitative reconstructions of Arctic sea ice. \n\n            Diatoms are microscopic algae that live in the surface waters of the world\u00c6s oceans.  Different types of diatoms live in specific surface water habitats that change with ocean temperature, salinity (saltiness), and amount and duration of sea ice cover.  As geologists, we can learn about how surface conditions have changed in the past looking back tens of thousands of years by examining what remains (hard parts and organic matter) can be found at the sea floor today.  What is found on the sea floor today provides a glimpse of what might get preserved in the deep ocean sediments to tell us about today\u00c6s surface water conditions.  Using this modern data set for calibration, we can go back in time and reconstruct sea ice and surface water changes that reflect natural variability.  Relating changes to past changes in climate, we can better understand how sensitive the Arctic is to warming, like that we see happening today because of the excess greenhouse gases produced by human\u00c6s use of fossil fuels.\n\n            The research we have done will provide the science community and the public with new information concerning how to interpret fossil diatom assemblages and organic matter in ancient sediments to understand the sea ice history and water mass history of Bering Straits region.

We also can show that fossil diatoms assemblages provide important information that complements what we can measure from lipids  (literally fatty acids) extracted from ancient organic matter.  So both approaches are needed to recreate the best information and we have developed new novel ways to get accurate data.  Our work shows us that during the last glacial ice age about 20,000 yrs ago, the deeper Bering Sea had as much as 9-10 months of sea ice in contrast to just zero to one or 2 months today.
