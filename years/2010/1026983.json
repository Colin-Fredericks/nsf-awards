 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\nEconomics is a science of models. Econometrics, the principal empirical tool of economics, relies on the close integration of statistics with economic theory. Its ultimate aim is to understand causes, not merely correlations. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research is a philosophical study of how theoretical and statistical models (including models used to measure economic phenomena) interact to produce causal knowledge of the economy. It focuses on a number of issues including the following: When models that approach the same data from a variety of perspectives truly conflict, how different levels of models of the same phenomena (data models, causal model, theoretical models) are related, what standards and procedures allow economists to choose ones that are correct and useful for practical applications, and how models should be used to answer? What would happen if? Questions that is central to formulating economic policy. The study?s importance arises from the mutual illumination of the philosophical and economic perspectives. The aim is to better understand econometrics as it is practiced and to practice it better.\r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nGeneral accounts of scientific explanation and scientific inference studied in the philosophy of science will be related to the concrete applications of applied economics. Conceptual clarification should promote more effective econometrics and allow some general lessons from econometrics to be absorbed by other sciences. The philosophy of science should itself be enriched through a deeper understanding of inference and explanation in a particular science. A deeper understanding of its empirical methods can only improve the utility of economic analysis in the design and conduct of public policy (e.g., of the continuing financial crisis or healthcare policy), since the effective use of econometrics is essential to giving good advice, soundly based in empirical evidence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEconomists are model builders.  The models built by empirical economists (econometricians) are meant to make substantive claims about what is really happening in the economy.  Yet, different models present apparently different views about how the economy works and how policymakers may intervene to make it work better.  A key issue for a genuine science of economics is to understand and resolve the conflict among models.  This research starts with the idea that what is most important are the causal claims embedded in models &ndash; the claims that actions in one part of the economy &ndash; e.g., by policymakers &ndash; may influence things that we care about such as unemployment or income. \n\nThe research provides a formal account in the language of economists and econometricians of the causal structure of a model.  One part of the research shows that it is possible for models to take different perspectives on the economy, and yet not fundamentally conflict.  Sometimes this is because models focus on different subparts of the economy.  Sometimes it is because they focus on different degrees of detail.  In other cases, however, models genuinely conflict and what we want to know is which &ndash; if any &ndash; are correct.  This is a question of comparison of models to data and, importantly, to each other.  The principle of comparison, which is known as \"encompassing,\" asks statistically whether one model can explain all the empirical success of the other as well as additional features of the data.  If a model is encompassed, it may be rejected.  However, pairs of models may both have some empirical success and yet neither encompass the other.  In that case, there is a better model that combines features of the two.  The research explores a process in which better models can be constructed through systematic comparisons of competing models with empirical data. \n\nA second part of the research addresses the problem of how policymakers should use models to guide policy through formulating alternative scenarios and using the model to see how they would work out.  The research shows that this is essentially a problem of adequately representing in the model the causal structure of the economy and the points at which effective intervention is possible.  The key difficulties are being able to identify genuine causes and to understand when the environment is sufficiently similar that the same model can be used to answer \"what-would-happen-if\" questions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin D Hoover"
