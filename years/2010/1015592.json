  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor this research, I attempted to build and model a polymer-clay nanocomposite and begin looking at the interfacial interaction between the clay and the polymer.  This particular research required that I build individual structures (montmorillonite unit cells, polymer components and surfactants).  Putting these components together, it was hoped to begin exploring the interactions that would occur, in particular exploring if the epoxy reaction could be simulated using an \"distance annealing algorithm,\" that is to say, can reacting atoms be simulated using a distance criteria.  All individual components were minimized for energy to make sure that they would be in the most stable structure which enables the simulation to complete more quickly.  Also, in order to accurately predict what would occur at the molecular level, the force fields used had to be modified.  Cygan\u00c6s ClayFF force field was selected as the necessary forcefield to accurately simulate hydrated clays.1\n\nThe desired results were not obtained.  This in part was due to the fact that there were several unforeseen software issues that arose during the experimentation.  The project was a little too ambitious for the ten week project.  The individual components were successfully built and energy minimized (using the generic CVFF force field).  However, the superior ClayFF force field could not be incorporated into the Material Studios due to software issues that were not resolved until after the project time had passed.  Modification of the LAMMPS simulation software was successfully completed thanks to the help of Dr. Greathouse of Sandia National Laboratories.\n\nSo, the future work will now include minimizing the MMT structure with the ClayFF, compare the results from Material Studio with my LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation software, and building the annealing algorithm.  Once all this is done, initial material properties can be obtained and compared to my experimental results.  Once all that is accomplished, then coarse graining of the system can begin.\n\nReference\n\nR. Cygan et al., J. Phys. Chem.
