 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fullerton Mathematics Teacher and Master Teacher Fellows (FULL MT2) project brings together a partnership serving high-need, primarily Latino-serving school districts in the greater Orange County, California area. Partnering institutions include two Hispanic-serving institutions -- California State University-Fullerton (CSUF) and Santa Ana College (SAC) -- and two school districts -- Anaheim Union High School District and Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District -- in collaboration with the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and the Math and Science Teacher Initiative of the California State University system. The project is preparing two cohorts of ten (20 total) Teaching Fellows in mathematics, and one cohort of ten Master Teaching Fellows with priority given to mathematics. Teaching Fellows are being recruited from among mathematics majors transferring to CSUF upon completing community college degrees at SAC, mathematics majors at CSUF and nearby universities, and mid-career changers with STEM backgrounds seeking to become teachers of mathematics. These Teaching Fellows are completing a teaching credential in mathematics and a Master of Science degree in Secondary Education with an emphasis in Teaching Foundational Mathematics. Following mentored student teaching and completion of the degree, Teaching Fellows continue to work with the Master Teaching Fellows and the project leadership team for two to three years during the induction period, to continue to develop their teaching effectiveness and leadership capacity. During this period, professional development takes place quarterly, and focuses on classroom management, use of technology, curriculum development, and best practices in teaching. Master Teaching Fellows are serving as mentors to the Teaching Fellows during their student teaching, and faculty from both of the higher education institutions are supervising this process. Master Teaching Fellows are being supported to complete National Board portfolios in partial fulfillment of the requirements for National Board Certification. They are also serving as new teacher mentors and district and college/university liaison leaders, and are supported in developing skills as master teachers, teacher mentors, district and community leaders, and college and university liaisons, through a series of professional development workshops and mentored practice. STEM faculty from both higher education institutions are extensively involved through instruction in graduate level programs, professional development, and mentoring of the Fellows. The evaluation is studying the impact of the FULL MT2 program, as compared to teachers not in the program, on the recruitment and retention of teachers; on several measures of teacher quality, including pedagogical and content knowledge, teaching self-efficacy, and the performance of the teachers' students on standardized assessments; and on the Master Teaching Fellows' attainment of National Board Certification. Results and outcomes are being shared by the Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows, as well as by the project team, at local, regional and national conferences and through publication venues.",
