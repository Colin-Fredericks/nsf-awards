Groebner bases provide an essential tool for computation in algebra, especially in solving systems of multivariate polynomials. The primary decomposition theorem was proved by the late chess Master Emanuel Lasker in 1905 for polynomial rings and Emmy Noether in early 1920s for general Noetherian rings. Primary decomposition is a crucial step in computerizing schemes in algebraic geometry, yet it is still a big challenge to provide efficient algorithms for reasonable sized systems of polynomials.
