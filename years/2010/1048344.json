 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT ABSTRACT \r\n?Counting Van Gogh and Vermeer? \r\n\r\nAutomated thread counting algorithms, in development since 2007 by Professors Rick Johnson \r\n(Cornell University) and Don Johnson (Rice University), are poised for a profound impact on the \r\npractice of technical art history. This work is a pioneering effort in the emerging application of \r\nsignal and image processing to the analysis of paintings. The approach is based on the utilization \r\nof spectral analysis of x-rays of paintings. X-rays can display the periodic intensity pattern due \r\nto the greater thickness of the lead white ground between the canvas threads. With the addition \r\nof innovative application-speci&#64257;c signal processing, local peaks in the spectrum of the x-ray data \r\ncan reveal the numbers of threads per centimeter, i.e. a thread count, separately for (nearly) ver- \r\ntically and (nearly) horizontally oriented threads. Such thread counts have been used previously, \r\nbut their manual acquisition proved too costly to be done thoroughly. The introduction of the \r\ncapability to assemble previously unthinkable thread density and angle pattern maps of high de- \r\ntail across the entire surface of a painting leads to correlation-based identi&#64257;cation of canvases \r\nsharing the same pattern in thread density variations. Such weave maps and matches can now be \r\nassembled across all of the paintings on canvas of a single artist or school, thereby signi&#64257;cantly \r\nextending the art historian?s capabilities in, for example, dating and attribution. \r\nThe scale, breadth, and depth of such thread-counting projects represent a bold leap in the \r\ncapabilities of technical art history. This grant supports the analysis phase of the &#64257;rst projects \r\nof such grand scope: the thread counting and subsequent weave matching among (i) all of the \r\npaintings by Vincent van Gogh (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010) and (ii) \r\nall of the paintings by the Delft School during the career of Johannes Vermeer (for which data \r\ncan be obtained by the end of 2010). This grant places Professors Rick and Don Johnson in \r\nthe center of the data fusion, data analysis and database creation activities that are scheduled \r\nto occur in Amsterdam during the spring of 2011. The archives being established of thread \r\ncount reports, including weave density maps providing &#64257;ngerprints for weave matching and angle \r\nmaps for characterizing cusping, form a groundbreaking resource at a time when museums are \r\njust beginning to address the technological and cultural barriers to technical data sharing among \r\nmuseums and collaborating researchers outside the museum. This project is part of a long-term \r\neffort that aims to expand the utility of thread counting from x-rays to all suitable oil paintings on \r\ncanvas, and to photos of unlined backs of old master paintings and of the raw canvas, for example, \r\nof the modern color&#64257;eld painters and of densely-woven, multi-pattern fabrics prominent in the \r\ndesign and decorative arts.",
