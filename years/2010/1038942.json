 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports the third in an international symposium series on the topic of combinatorial search. The intellectual merit of this project stems from the sharing of new results, ideas, and problems across the many areas in AI, robotics and other fields where combinatorial search is used. Broad impact comes not only from this intermixing but from having a single locus of activity for efforts in combinatorial search, one that we expect to become known in the wider community as the place to look when one wants a snapshot of the latest developments in the area.  The 2010 symposium is being held on July 8-10, 2010, in the vicinity of and just prior to the AAAI-10 conference in Atlanta, Georgia. NSF funding supports authors of oral and poster presentations, as well as invited speakers.",
