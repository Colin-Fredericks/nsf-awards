The unit will be used to obtain rapid chemostratigraphic information from organic-rich mudstones. The new instrument will primarily be used to prioritize samples for more detailed laboratory analysis. Samples will be screened in the field and from a core repository. The analytical goals are to match geochemical characteristics with sedimentology and stratigraphy - with emaphasis on the Permo-Triassic Boundary in the Panthalassic and Tethyan Oceans and the Barnett Shale. The PI intends to survey rock outcroppings in order to prioritize subsequent laboratory analyses. Of particular interest is determining mudstone chemostratigraphy. The instrument will support undergraduate and graduate students, the PI and internal/external collaborators. The PI routinely uses analytical instrumentation in geochemistry coursework. This acquisition will support research training for underrepresented groups. The instrument will be housed in the UT Arlington (UTA) Geoscience Building when not being used in the core repository or in the field. \r\n\r\n***",
