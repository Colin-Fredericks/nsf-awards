 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Connection One-Communication Circuits and Systems Research studies conducted by the Arizona State University site (lead). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\t\r\nThe focus of this proposal is on the development of reliable self-healing sensor network radio and mixed-signal analog/digital readout system design.  The chip is to be eventually fabricated. As a result of this work there would be models and software for system-level characterization of radio and mixed-signal readout chains along with hardware modules, software for system and circuit level compensation, and software for global decision making. The project takes a global view from the sensor interface to the RF domain for a reliable operation of the components. The PIs are well qualified for this work having experience in reliability radio transceiver design, system and circuit level test, and circuit calibration and compensation. Computer clusters and the Wireless Integrated Nanotechnology center at Arizona State University will be helpful for assembling integrated circuits and printed circuit boards.\r\n\r\nDeployment of sensor networks into remote, hard-to-reach areas for data collection and analysis can have a profound impact to improve the lives of many. These systems hold great promise to increase capabilities in terms of predicting and preventing from impending dangers, such as radiation, air and drinking water pollution, and failures in infrastructure, such as highways and bridges. Successful outcomes of this research will enable the production of miniature and intelligent sensor systems with high yield, lower cost, and long lifetimes.   The proposed work is a continuation of the ongoing activities within the center, and as such it directly benefits the center for its lifetime.",
