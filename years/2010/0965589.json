 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tall fescue is one the most important grassland species in the US; it withstands drought, disease and herbivory, exhibits an unusually long growing season, and has adapted to a broad range of environmental conditions. Many of these characteristics derive from a mutualism between tall fescue and a fungal endophyte that was first discovered in the mid-1970s. This project will synthesize the abundant research on tall fescue that has occurred since the fungal mutualism was discovered. The resulting monograph will be produced digitally, as a web book, will be available worldwide to a very broad audience, and can be updated easily as new findings become available. \r\n\r\nThe monograph will serve as an important research, teaching, and extension resource, providing information for plant geneticists, physiologists, pathobiologists, extension specialists, genetic engineers, animal geneticists, nutritionists, toxicologists, agricultural economists, and veterinarians. Synthesis of the past 30 years of research and the opportunity for continuous updating of the latest developments make this project important to tens of thousands of potential users.\r\n",
