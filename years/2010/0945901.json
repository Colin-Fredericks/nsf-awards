Specifically, the degradation of MTBE will be investigated and the project will then look at byproduct formation.  Additionally, optimizing the system by adding oxygen as an electron acceptor and H2O2 as an alternative method for degrading MTBE will be explored.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development and commercialization of a portable system to degrade organics.  There are a number of potential applications for this technology ranging from groundwater remediation to military applications to recreation and other portable uses.\r\n",
