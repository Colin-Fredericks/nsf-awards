Toward this end the CCMP is convening the Chesapeake Modeling Symposium 2010 as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different developer and user groups. ChesMS'10 is the second symposium convened by CCMP. ChesMS'08 focused on highlighting and communicating new and innovative Chesapeake ecosystem open source models and building the existing library of available models and tools. ChesMS'10 expands on this by continuing to showcase new modeling efforts while also demonstrating how new and existing models can be applied to aid in Management, Research, and Restoration decision support.  By bringing together the model developer and user communities at the symposium, they hope to foster greater intra group understanding and communication.  This will lead to more product-focused model development and a more intelligent use of these models. Funding is sought to support travel costs for two invited plenary speakers and funds to defray a portion of registration costs for students.  The plenary speakers are established leaders in model development and access while the student stipends ensure affordable access and networking for new modelers, critical for continued student exposure and maturation, model development, and more importantly, application throughout the basin.",
