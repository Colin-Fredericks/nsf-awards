 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration of the Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) and Georgia State University to develop a set of 7 web-based learning modules for high school and early undergraduate students.  The learning modules have at their core video vignettes on specific topics in the geosciences and global change derived from 20 years of workshops held at AGCI and archived in 1200 hours of video.  The archive consists of scientists from around the world in an interdisciplinary setting presenting and discussing their research. The modules are organized around the seven research themes of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (atmospheric composition, climate variability and change, global water cycle, land use and land cover change, global carbon cycle, ecosystems, and human contributions and responses). Along with the specific content goals, the archive will also be used to illustrate the nature of science through scientific discourse, science as a human endeavor, and contain common themes such as scale, change, and systems consistent with overall goals of scientific literacy. The specific activities are to: (1) identify the parts of the archive that satisfy selection criteria; (2) map the material to standards/benchmarks and FAQs (e.g. IPCC 2007) associated with Earth system science; (3) produce modules that include the digitized video vignettes (of archival and new video) combined with visuals, voice-overs and profiles of the scientists; (4) pilot test the modules with high school and undergraduate students; and, (5) disseminate web-based modules informed by the formative and summative evaluation.  The modules will serve student populations that infrequently have the opportunity to meet and interact with scientists. The modules will further student understanding of the process of science, gain a sense of scientific careers, and how basic science is applied in understanding Earth and complex topics such as climate change and its significance to society.",
