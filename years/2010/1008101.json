The\r\nobjectives are (i) to extend the investigator's results for the\r\nnumerical inversion of the Laplace transform beyond the\r\nnoise-free case, (ii) to develop new approximation methods for\r\nthe numerical inversion of the vector-valued Laplace transform,\r\n(iii) to show that the inversion of the Laplace transform\r\ntogether with the theory of finite elements provide a solid\r\nfoundation for the numerical approximation of solutions of\r\nevolution equations of convolution type, (iv) to apply the\r\napproximation methods to problems arising from transport in\r\nmultiscale porous materials, and (v) to provide research\r\nexperience for undergraduate students.  The main idea is that\r\napproximation methods for the shift operator semigroup on the\r\nspace of continuous and exponentially bounded functions with\r\nvalues in a general Banach space translates into approximation\r\nmethods for the inversion of the Laplace transform of these\r\nfunctions. \r\n\r\n     Evolution processes arise in many scientific problems, such\r\nas fluid flows, image processing, mechanical systems, relativity,\r\nmathematical finance, and mathematical biology.  These processes\r\nare described by the solutions of certain integro-partial\r\ndifferential equations.  However, in most of these cases, the\r\nsolutions cannot be calculated explicitly because either they\r\ncannot be found or they are not obtained in a plain algebraic\r\nform.  Thus, in order to obtain an accurate description of the\r\nevolution process, one needs to develop accurate approximations\r\nto the solutions of these equations.  The scalable methods\r\nrecently developed by the investigator and his collaborators\r\nconcerning the Laplace transform provide accurate approximations\r\nto solutions of integro-partial differential equations of\r\nconvolution type.  The principal investigator further develops\r\nand implements new approximation methods, and uses these methods\r\nfor the accurate description of different evolution processes. \r\nUndergraduate research experience is provided to students by\r\nusing the different methods to approximate the solutions of\r\nproblems related to transport in multiscale porous materials,\r\nlike oil and gas exploration, or controlling underground sources\r\nof pollution such as high-level radioactive waste and\r\ngeologically stored carbon dioxide.",
