 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to engineer a rapid and ultrasensitive microsystem that has the function of efficient preconcentration, and rapid as well as ultrasensitive detection using magnetic nanoparticles. This project utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to study the nanoparticle-enhanced preconcentration and detection, and its integration to the microfluidic device. Microreactor concept for the mixing unit will be used to predict and characterize the seperation efficiency, considering the magnetically active mixing and transport in the preconcentration unit. Magnetic nanoparticle will be used as label to amplify detection signal for miniaturizable Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection.\r\n\r\nThe integrated sensing microsystem has the prospect of producing low-cost, rapid, and hand-held devices for the practice of diagnostic medicine, the identification of biological weapons, the control of food safety and environmental pollutions, and basic life sciences research.  The layered architecture of integrated research and mentoring for a continuum of students from middle school to graduate students will advance awareness of bionanotechnology to middle school teachers/students through Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program. It will also provide opportunities to recruit and retain underrepresented students, with a focus on female students.",
