 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nResearch objectives and approaches.  The objective of this research is to develop probabilistic methods for active sensing with tunable chemosensors.  The approach is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process, whereby the system takes sequential sensing actions to identify a chemical target.  The investigators will develop algorithms to adapt sensor tunings on-the-fly for two types of scenario: target discrimination and background rejection. These algorithms will be validated on two tunable sensor technologies (metal-oxide chemoresistors and infrared interferometers) combined with tunable preconcentrators. \r\nIntellectual merit. Active sensing has received minimal attention in chemosensors, where most work has focused on off-line optimization.  Likewise, chemometrics techniques assume that a full spectrum of the chemical is available.  In contrast, the proposed work argues that only the most informative wavelengths/features are needed, and that these should be selected dynamically.  This research will lead to agile systems that can adapt sensing parameters on-the-fly in response to their environments. The work will also provide a better understanding of active sensing across a range of scenarios (e.g. static vs. dynamic stimuli) and sensor characteristics (e.g. specific vs. cross-selective).  \r\nBroader impacts.  For a number of applications, from quality control to environmental monitoring, there is a need to rapidly detect, identify and quantify volatile compounds.  The proposed methodology generalizes to a large class of chemical detectors, and may enable the development of power-aware networks of chemical sensors.  The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students; since 2001, the PI has supervised 45 senior-design projects involving over 140 students.",

Specifically, we developed \"active sensing\" algorithms that could tune the instrument/sensor selectivity on-the-fly, based on information from previous measurements.  The approach is best illustrated in analogy to the traditional parlor game of \"twenty questions.\"  This is a two-person guessing game in which player 1 thinks of an object, and player 2 must guess its identity by asking a sequence of YES/NO questions to player 1.  The best strategy for player 2 is to select the next question based on information gathered thus far (from previous questions).

In our case, we let the active-sensing algorithm select the proper operating temperature for the sensor, and how that temperature should be changed over time.  The second platform was based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy. When a gas is exposed to IR light, some of the light\u00c6s wavelengths (i.e., colors) are absorbed by the gas, and this absorption profile is unique to each chemical.  Therefore, one can discriminate among different gases by measuring how much of the IR light is trans..."
