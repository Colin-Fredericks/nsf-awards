 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 7.0 Earthquake in Haiti has mobilized the entire world to support\r\nthe relief effort, especially through novel uses of the cyberspace.  \r\nEven though the earthquake damaged much of the communication \r\ninfrastructure in Haiti, Haiti's Internet connectivity is robust \r\nbecause most Haitian Internet Service Providers use satellite, rather\r\nthan the damaged undersea fiber optic cable link, to connect to the \r\nInternet. Consequently, relief workers, regular citizens, and \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGO's) have used Tweets extensively \r\nto spread and share information about the needs, events, and relief \r\noperations.  However, these tweets are not easily aggregated into \r\nmeaningful topics for ease of delivery to people who critically need \r\nthe information. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to develop and \r\ndeploy, in collaboration with an NGO coordination body (NetHope), \r\na reusable text message-based infrastructure that classifies and \r\naggregates multi-lingual tweets and text messages about Haiti \r\nrelief operations by topics and regions so that they can be easily \r\nsubscribed by NGO's, survivors in Haiti, and their friends and \r\nfamilies. The research project leverages existing software \r\ndeveloped for entity extraction and topic classification so that the \r\nsystem can be developed and deployed quickly to respond to the time \r\ncritical needs at Haiti.  \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of the system includes\r\nfeedbacks from NetHope as well as quantitative metrics about the\r\nusage and performance of the system.  The intellectual merit of the \r\nresearch is developing integrated engineering solution to automatic \r\nidentification of topics and geo-location from short-messages \r\nutilizing contextual information, which lays important foundation \r\nfor designing the next-generation information infrastructure for \r\nemergency response and disaster management.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTweets and short text messages have been generated in large volume during extreme events such as the Haiti earthquake and the Fukishima nuclear disaster.  While many of these short text messages contain useful information for assessing damages and identifying needs of survivors, they are not well-organized to allow critical information to be easily aggregated so that they can be acted upon by relief workers in a timely and effective way.\n\nEven though text documents such as scholarship publications and news articles have been successfully classified by computers, tweets and short text messages remain difficult for computers to classify automatically because they contain much less words.  To solve this problem, this RAPID project uses a novel method to classify short text messages about Haiti earthquake (collected by Ushahidi http://haiti.ushahidi.com) into categories meaningful for relief workers.  A key novelty of the method is that it clusters words based on the similarity of the frequency of their occurrences in different categories.  This method is shown to perform better than other existing methods. \n\nThe second contribution of this RAPID research is the identification of organizational barriers for NGO\u00c6s to adopt microblogging as trustworthy information for disaster relief, and a proposed social-technical solution for addressing such barriers.  These results can contribute to policy changes that facilitate information sharing and coordination among NGO\u00c6s by better leveraging the information in tweets in short text messages.\n\nThe RAPID project also provided a unique interdisciplinary education and training experience for a diversified group of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post doc, working with six faculty mentors.\n\nA cloud-based infrastructure for large-scale streamline processing of text messages during extreme events has been developed.  Further information and publications of RAPID project can be found at http://emerse.ist.psu.edu.  The web site also displays tweets streamed from several NGO\u00c6s and the results of classifying them in real-time using the novel tweet classification method mentioned above.   The software that implements this method for classifying tweets is publically available for download in SourceForge.net under the name \"Abstraction-based short text classification\".\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Yen"
