 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean acidification has been identified as a top priority in oceanographic research, and is a topic of broad societal relevance because of the potential impacts on ocean ecosystems and link to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This award funds a workshop aimed at enhancing interaction among researchers studying the chemical, biological, and physical consequences of past carbon cycle perturbations and their effects on the oceans. The key topics to be addressed are: 1) Physico-chemical changes in the paleocean, 2) Biological consequences of ocean acidification, 3) Confidence in biogeochemical proxies, 4) Suitable time intervals and study locations, and 5) Future goals of paleocean acidification. Participants will cover a broad range of disciplines in Cenozoic paleoceanography and marine carbonate chemistry, and also include researchers with specific expertise in one or more of the focus areas of the workshop. The workshop will stimulate the integration of the geological with other aspects of NSF's newly launched Ocean Acidification program. The results of the workshop will be published in the scientific literature, and the organizers will work with science journalists to disseminate information about ocean acidification to the public.",
