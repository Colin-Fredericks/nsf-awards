 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort of the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) at Rutgers University, Perth Amboy Public Schools, Elizabeth Public Schools, Long Branch Public Schools, and Open Minds, LLC with the overarching goal of improving the readiness of dual language learners (DLL) for kindergarten.  Based on research indicating that very young learners can accomplish more than we have expected of them and that inquiry-based science programs and literacy programs are mutually supportive, especially for English language learners, the project is designing,  implementing, and studying the effects of workshops for 48 teachers of 3 and 4 year-olds in three urban school districts.\r\n\r\nThe project will monitor the extent to which teachers adopt and implement recommended instructional approaches and the impacts of the professional development experience on their attitudes and knowledge.  The data will provide preliminary answers to three questions about the professional development model: 1) Does the PD experience enhance teacher knowledge and classroom interactions around mathematics and science? 2) Does it enhance classroom supports for dual language learners? and 3) Does the PD experience produce results confirming that math and science experiences can contribute to, rather than detract from, language development and literacy learning for all students?\r\n\r\nThe key outcomes of the project will be insights into the effects of integrated mathematics, science, and literacy instruction for very young children and, potentially a model for teacher professional development that encourages such content integration.",

Many young children in the United States who are members of groups at risk for lack of school readiness &ndash; e.g., dual language learners (DLLs) &ndash; often start preschool behind their peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and then stay behind. High quality early educational experiences can help, but many early childhood educators do not feel well-prepared to teach STEM. Our project, SciMath-DLL, was born to address this gap. We aimed to increase preschool teachers&rsquo; skills, abilities, and confidence in teaching STEM to all children, including DLLs. We believe this will lead to greater learning for all children. The two main goals of the SciMath-DLL project were to: 1) develop and refine an innovative preschool professional development model to support STEM instruction for all children, including dual language learners (DLLs), and 2) to collect evidence of its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The SciMath-DLL model was built on current best-practice thinking in early STEM teaching and learning and early childhood professional development by experts in early STEM learning, teaching, and development along with educators and school district leaders. During the first year of this 4-year study, we designed the three-pronged approach to supporting teachers. The first prong is creating district-wide or multi-district hands-on workshops. The second is establishing professional learning communities (PLCs) or workgroups in which teachers within centers support each other&rsquo;s STEM practice, facilitated by coaches.
