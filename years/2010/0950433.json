Prof. Geiger's research program focuses on the application for the first time of a unique spectroscopic method, named the Eisenthal chi(3) method, to study the adsorption of metal cations on mineral surfaces. The Eisenthal chi(3)method is uniquely sensitive to the interfacial potential and can be viewed as an Optical Voltmeter. If successful, the study will provide environmental scientists with a new and widely applicable tool for studying ion adsorption on mineral surfaces. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of interfacial phenomena in complex environmental systems. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for trainees desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.\r\n",
