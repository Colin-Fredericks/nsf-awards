 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Geographic Television will develop a television series (tentatively titled \"Aqua Kids\") and transmedia program to introduce preschoolers and kindergarteners to the wonders and value of water.  The goal is to empower young children's innate sense of inquiry and increase early environmental literacy by motivating young learners to make discoveries with water, inside and outside their homes.  The grant would allow the National Geographic project team to: 1) research cutting-edge practices for teaching early learners environmental literacy and water principles; 2) convene content and creative advisors; 3) test one storybook and animatic (animated storyboard) with the  target audience and their parents; 4) strategize best ways to create a transmedia project that capitalizes on emerging digital platforms, reaches audiences most in need, and takes advantage of National Geographic resources, including National Geographic's  ongoing global water conservation outreach missions.  Insight Research Group will conduct formative evaluation using the animatic and interviews with parents to help identify barriers to extend the television experience with their children to outdoor activities and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe project partners include Project WET, a youth water education project, NOAA's Office of Marine Sanctuaries, USDA Forest Service, the National Park Service as well as a number of museums and Think It Ink It Publishing.\r\n\r\nThis Pathways Project will allow the project team to complete the groundwork necessary to create an innovative new multiplatform educational media resource. The Water Show will inspire outdoor science play, build inquiry and social skills and create a vital foundation for caring and respecting the most valuable natural resource, water.  Fostering early appreciation for how Earth's \"green parts\" are wholly dependent on its \"blue parts\" is foundational for subsequent scientific learning and instrumental in building lasting respect for living systems and natural resources.",
