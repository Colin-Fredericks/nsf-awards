 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a novel self-assembly technique for fabricating nanoscale photonic and electronic devices. The approach is to use a single strand DNA designed to be self-assembled into a two-dimensional ?nanobreadboard? where nanoparticles such as quantum dots and metal nanoparticles are positioned precisely within a few nanometers of each other.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  In this project, a number of nanoscale devices such as a beamsplitter, modulator, and photodiode, with varying degree of synthesis complexity will be investigated. These devices will be designed with the computational program recently developed by the PIs. The project will address three research objectives: 1) design staple DNA strands and synthesize two-dimensional DNA nanobreadboard suitable for device assembly, 2) study the binding of functionalized nanoparticles on DNA nanobreadboard, and 3) experimentally characterize optical and electric properties of proposed devices using spectroscopy, time-of-flight, and pulsed I-V measurements.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  A major educational focus will be on graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary field. Research results will be incorporated into the Nanoscience/Nanotechnology courses recently developed, catering to the local industry?s need for engineers with a broader knowledge in nanotechnology and materials science. Underrepresented and underutilized groups will be recruited to the project. Students will present at annual outreach events ? Boise State Day at the State Legislature and NanoDays at the Discovery Center of Idaho. The research will have a transformative impact on the field of nanoscale integrated devices. It lays the foundation for new device technologies beyond those that have matured.",
