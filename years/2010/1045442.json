 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical merit\r\n\r\nThis project is the organization and teaching of a five-day short course for graduate students and other early career scientists on the opportunities and challenges in the processing and analysis of much increased volumes of time series data.  The primary goal is to inspire a new set of leaders who are more able to exploit the large volumes of data coming from the NSF's EarthScope program. The emphasis of the short course is on seismic data from USArray.  The short course is held at Northwestern University in August of 2010 and builds upon and draws from an earlier short course on these themes, which was held in the summer of 2009. The PIs are designing and delivering the program in collaboration with USArray and IRIS and a small number of guest instructors. The course takes place in a computer laboratory in the main library of Northwestern University. The curriculum includes lectures followed by hands-on exercises, and finishes with student group projects carried out during the five days.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThis project directly addresses issues of human infrastructure through workforce development. The top short-term goal of this project is training of the next generation of seismologists in 1) the use of the best current generation data analysis tools and 2) feeling empowered to further develop the tools currently available to the seismological community.  This project represents a community-based approach to specialized educational content. We intend to collect and share the student projects through a student-designed and -maintained wiki. Course materials will be also organized and posted to the web in collaboration with the Education and Outreach Program of the Incorporated Research Institutions or Seismology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant was completely devoted to supporting an educational program for PhD students, post-doctoral scholars, and early career scientists.  The project was  focused on a one week, short-course held at Northwestern University in August of 2010.   The topic of the course was state-of-the-art data processing methods for handling the large quantity of seismic data being produced by the Earthscope USArray project.   The course was jointly supported by the Education and Outreach program of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, a nonprofit consortium of institutions involved in seismology research.   Instructors for the course were solicited from the community to produce the widest range of expertise available.  Instructors came from 5 different universities and all IRIS programs.   The course was taught in a computer cluster at Northwestern University to allow hands on experience with current generation computer software used in seismology.  Approximately thirty students from 2nd year graduate students to early career scientists participated in the course.  Content from the course can be found at the following web site produced by IRIS:  http://www.iris.edu/hq/es_course/.  At the conclusion of the week students gave presentations on a final project they worked on during the week.  IRIS staff worked with the PIs to prepare a questionaire to assess the results of the course.  Student opinions were very favorable and we also obtained excellent suggestions used to improve the course in the future.  Perhaps the best testimony for the success of the course was that IRIS now plans to hold this course every other year for the forseeable future.  The first of these was held in 2011 (see above web site).   The next is planned for 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary L Pavlis"
