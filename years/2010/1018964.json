 "awd_abstract_narration": "Authentication is a quintessential problem in computer security.  However, most commonly used authentication mechanisms suffer from a variety of shortcomings.  Passwords, the most common authentication mechanism, are vulnerable to replay attacks.  Physical authentication tokens overcome some of these problems; however, they face deployment and compatibility obstacles.\r\n\r\nRecently, advanced mobile devices have become widely available.  These devices provide new hardware capabilities, such as MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) radio, a variety of sensors, and hardware authentication modules.\r\n\r\nWe investigate how to take advantage of hardware capabilities in advanced mobile devices to design better authentication mechanisms.  We are focusing on three types of hardware capabilities. First, certain mobile devices authenticate to their networks via built-in hardware modules.  We investigate how to leverage such existing authenticating infrastructure for other authentication tasks, such as authenticating users to websites.  Second, mobile devices have MIMO radio transceivers.  We investigate how to use these transceivers to pair nearby mobile devices without requiring the user to enter shared secrets into the devices.  Finally, many advanced mobile devices have sensors, such as accelerometers.  We investigate how to design gesture-based user authentication using accelerometers.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will be highly visible.  Most current authentication mechanisms have various security, usability, and deployment problems.  Our new mechanisms overcome many of these problems.  Since these mechanisms are based on hardware capabilities that are increasingly common in mobile devices, they can be deployed to billions of mobile users to make their authentication tasks easier and securer.",

This project investigates how to take advantage of these capabilities to provide novel security services. We have made several discoveries along these directions.<br /><br />Web authentication that is both secure and usable remains a challenge. Passwords are vulnerable to phishing attacks, while physical tokens face deployment obstacles. We propose to leverage the authentication infrastructure of cellular networks to enhance Web authentication. We design WebCallerID, a Web authentication scheme that uses cell phones as physical tokens and uses cellular networks as trusted identity providers. Since WebCallerID requires no user participation during authentication, it prevents security mistakes by users. WebCallerID also prevents rogue websites from replaying authentication assertions or stealing users' identities. WebCallerID contributes another factor to multi-factor authentication systems.&nbsp; We have implemented a prototype of WebCallerID using the OpenID framework. WebCallerID involves three components: relying parties, a cell phone, and an OpenID server inside a cellular network. The OpenID server queries user profiles from the AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server, which handles the authentication of the cellular device.<br /><br />Most personal wireless devices require secure connection between them. While it is easy to securely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challenging to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior association. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme that securely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting multiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neither shared secrets nor out-of-band channels (e.g., audio, visual, keyboard, etc.) between the pairing devices. It only requires that the receiver has multiple antennas and that the sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our scheme is based on the propagation characteristic of the wireless signal that the power of the received signal is inversely proportional to some exponent of the distance between the sender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves very close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can observe a large difference between the signal strength measured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender would be unable to induce such a large difference. We validate our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. We discuss the factors that may affect our scheme --- including antenna gain, received signal strength (RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath effects --- and how to mitigate them.
