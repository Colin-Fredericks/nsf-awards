  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nWales is known historically as an important whaling village during early contact times and it is of particular archaeological interest because of its proximity to Siberian Eskimo areas only 31 km across the Bering Strait. The substantial size of contact period Wales -- consisting of at least 500 individuals -- and early historic accounts indicate that the village functioned as a primary socioeconomic center in northwest Alaska in early contact times (Harritt 2003).  Historically Wales people hunted bowhead and gray whales, as well as walrus and seals. The three main Wales sites are located within the modern community.  The Hillside Site is situated on the edge of a bluff at the base of Cape Mountain; and, Kurigitavik Mound and the Beach site are situated on the Cape Prince of Wales beach ridge system.  The sites also have Inupiat names.  They are designated Agianamiut for the Hillside Site, Kiatanamiut for the Beach Site, and Kashigatavik for Kurigitavik Mound. Kurigitavik was abandoned in late precontact times. In the case of the historic Kiatanamiut and Agianamiut factions inhabiting the locality at close quarters, each is a distinctive social unit, based on the historic self-distinctions and contact-period accounts.  Prior analyses indicate that the late prehistoric inhabitants of Kurigitavik Mound also comprised a distinctive societal entity, with a language dialect distinctive from that of the inhabitants of the Beach and Hillside sites. \n\nThe on-going analyses of the artifact collections from the three sites are focused on distinguishing differences between artistic designs and styles of the artifacts from the sites, and examining the types of animals that were hunted to determine if there are differences in the species that were used, The artifacts that were made and the animals that were used by the inhabitants of each site therefore reflect their distinctive histories, social and cultural characteristics and their preferences.\nIntellectual merits of the work include reporting the results of the field work of seven field seasons and analysis of social interactions, socioterritorial organization, and subsistence economies in a large whaling village. The new data will be evaluated based on comparisons between datasets including: the historic sociospatial units; the data from a geomorphological analysis; new radiocarbon dates produced by the project; and new artifact collections and other information.  The project is also shedding light on Siberian influences on Wales inhabitants. The results will therefore illuminate the cultural relationships between the inhabitants of eastern Bering Strait, during a period of prehistory when major changes occurred in the cultural development the historic Eskimo including the development of Inupiat social and territorial organization, subsistence patterns and technology.  The faunal analyses have yielded insights into the types of prey species that were exploited in a whaling settlement.  The results that have emerged provide an increasingly clear picture of the role whaling played in the late prehistoric  whale hunting cultures against the backdrop of other prey species that were utilized.  The new information therefore illuminates the cultural context of modern whaling by Alaska Natives. \nThe broader impacts of the project include clarifying the origins of the Kurigitavik people. They are now believed to have been  speakers of some dialect of Siberian Yupik, whereas the late prehistoric inhabitants of the Beach Site and the Hillside sites spoke a dialect of Inupiat. The prehistoric interactions between the occupants of each of the sites who lived adjacent to one another relate closely to the same types of interactions between groups in historic circumstances, and to those of modern societies, in which enclaves of immigrants exist in a larger society.  The results of the investigation of the prehistoric Wales inter-ethnic social interactions will therefore inform future studies of ..."
