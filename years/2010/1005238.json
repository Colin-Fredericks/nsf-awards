 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site program will focus on biorefining research.  The development of sustainable and renewable energy supplies represents one of society's greatest challenges.  Biofuels are widely regarded as a key component of a new energy economy.  The 12 undergraduate students will pursue fundamental investigations of issues related to conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals.  Projects will include research in feedstock science and engineering, biochemical conversions, thermochemical conversions, and engineering or reaction, separations, and solids-handling processes needed for numerous biorefining applications.  An additional focus of this REU site program will be integration, both across disciplines and across four different institutions.  These institutions include the University of Colorado, Colorado State University (CSU), the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the research activities, the REU participants will be involved in educational seminars, cultural programming and social activities to foster the cohort experience. The undergraduate students will be required to participate in weekly research group meetings of the faculty advisor, participate in a weekly NSF-REU group seminar program where each will give a five minute presentation on research progress and challenges to his/her NSF-REU peers, present a poster at the completion of the summer program and write a final research report.\r\n\r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\r\nA major goal of the REU Site program is to actively recruit women and minority participants and to encourage these students to pursue careers in engineering and science research.  Participants will also be encouraged to present their research at national conferences and will be financially supported to do so.",
