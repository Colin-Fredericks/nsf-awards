The original network was funded through previous NSF/EAR support.   The upgrade will include acquisition and field deployment of four new dual frequency GPS receivers and radio modems.  The upgrade will completely replace remaining single frequency receivers in the Sierra Negra network with dual frequency receivers with greatly enhanced on board memory.  The upgraded CGPS network will allow for continued observations of one of the most active basaltic volcanoes in the world.  The dynamics of this volcanic system allows for an extraordinary opportunity to learn more about the interplay between magma intrusion and surface deformation.  All of the GPS data collected by the Sierra Negra network will continue to be freely accessible through the UNAVCO data system in near real time.  \r\n\r\n***",
