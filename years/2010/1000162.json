 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award provides funding for the development of a novel approach to grow superconducting thin films on metal substrates with prefabricated nanorods. The approach consists of prefabricated nanorod growth on single-crystalline-like buffer film on flexible metal tape followed by epitaxial superconductor film growth by Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) on the buffer film. Three approaches will be investigated in this program to prefabricate nanostructures on single-crystalline-like buffer templates. The key factors that affect density, dimensions, morphology and orientation of nanorods on the buffer templates will be determined so that the nanorods can be controlled in a predictable manner. The science of epitaxial growth of the superconducting film on an underlying substrate through a maze of nanorods will be studied. The pinning effectiveness of these superconducting films will be evaluated to determine and control the impact of prefabricated nanorod defect structure.\r\n \r\nA successful outcome of this program will enable superconducting thin film tapes with significantly improved critical current in high magnetic fields compared to the state-of-the art. Additionally, by separation of nanodefect growth from the epitaxial superconductor growth process, it is expected that growth rate limitation problems that exist in today's technology can be resolved. The expected significance of the program is the creation of a transformative processing science leading to robust manufacturing of superconducting tapes by industry, which in turn would yield a commercial product with much better performance, uniformity and consistency. A successful outcome of this program can result in a broad and positive impact in the field of superconductors which provide solutions to a wide spectrum of problems in energy as well in medicine, transportation, particle physics and chemical research. Furthermore, the program can broadly enable a stronger understanding of nanostructures in thin film materials as well MOCVD process science.",
