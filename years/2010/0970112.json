 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research on ultrasonic vibration-assisted (UV-A) pelleting of cellulosic biomass in order to enable cost-effective manufacturing of cellulosic biofuels. Specific research tasks include (1) investigating effects of ultrasonic vibration on pelleting mechanisms, (2) testing a hypothesis of the underlying mechanism of how UV-A pelleting can increase pellets? strength and durability, (3) investigating mechanisms through which UV-A pelleting enhances sugar and ethanol yields, and (4) testing the hypothesis that UV-A pelleting can result in improved pretreatment procedures. These tasks will be conducted over a wide range of biomass types including sorghum stalks, switchgrass, wheat straw, corn stover, Miscanthus, and grass clippings.\r\n\r\nResearch results will provide the knowledge needed to overcome some technical barriers that have hindered large-scale manufacturing of cellulosic biofuels. Large-scale manufacturing of cellulosic biofuels will greatly benefit the U.S. economy, energy security, the environment, and society in general. This research features a unique collaboration across manufacturing engineering, biological engineering, and industry. This collaboration provides excellent synergy for project resources, ensures the relevance of the research to industry, and expedites technology commercialization. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will have a positive impact on engineering education at Kansas State University, an EPSCoR institution.",
