 "awd_abstract_narration": "1049535 \r\nWilcox\r\n\r\nThis proposal explores the possibility of developing a Nitrogen-Selective Membrane for CO2 Carbon Capture, which is a problem of immense scope and value to national interests. Instead of trying to separate CO2, which lacks the driving force of concentration, the focus is on a selective-nitrogen (N2) technology that takes advantage of the driving force of N2 in the flue gas stream. This technology requires a catalytic dense membrane in which N2 dissociates across the surface and then diffuses through the membrane as atomic N. Group V metals such as vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta) have experimentally been shown to diffuse atomic N at similar rates to atomic hydrogen (H) in palladium (Pd), at very high temperatures, similar to those of the post-boiler conditions of a coal-fired power plant. Catalytic amounts of ruthenium in particular may be necessary to speed the dissociation of the N2 molecule at the membrane surface.\r\n\r\nIf the above separation were to prove feasible, the longer term studies would involve coupling a H2 purge on the permeate side of the membrane to attempt to convert the dissociated N atoms into ammonia at atmospheric pressure. The dissociation step is apparently rate limiting for NH3 production, and the species that is diffusing through the membrane is the atom. I would like the PI to try at least one experiment in the confines of this EAGER proposal to show proof-of-concept for NH3 generation.\r\n\r\nThis project will have great appeal to the student who will work on it. The opportunity to work on such a novel, yet easy to understand project, with such potential value in the global management of CO2 is quite attractive.",
