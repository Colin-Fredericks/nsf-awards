 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Donghui Zhang of the Louisiana State University (LSU) will carry out research to develop new polymerization methods for N-substituted-N-carboxyl anhydrides.  Zhang will study the kinetics and mechanism of the ring-opening polymerization of N-substituted-N-carboxyl anhydrides mediated by nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbenes.  Various cyclic and linear block copolymers will be prepared and the types of aggregates that they form in solution will be studied.  The educational plan focuses on incorporating concepts from the research project into courses at LSU and on improving LSU K-12 outreach programs, including ChemDemo and \"You Be the Chemist.\"  This work will broaden the array of biologically related polymers that scientists can use to develop new polymers and materials.  Besides developing new methodologies, the proposed research will enable researchers to create biomimetic polymers that could find application in bioimaging and biomedical technologies.",
