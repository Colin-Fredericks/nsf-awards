Begun in 2000, the Million Book Project has scanned over 1.6 million books in China, India, Egypt and Australia and made great strides in research areas relevant to large-scale, multi-lingual database storage and retrieval. Project partners intend to continue to work together on issues related to human computer interactions, usability, automatic metadata detection and correction using artificial intelligence, intellectual property, machine translation and summarization, improving and providing centralized access to metadata, long term data storage and access issues, diversity and education.  Funding provided by the National Science Foundation has attracted international partners and matching funds exceeding $100 million U.S. dollars.",
