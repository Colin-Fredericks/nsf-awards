 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects are the most numerous and diverse animals on the planet and, as they grow from a hatchling to an adult, body mass may increase 200 to 10,000 fold. Although increasing mass must be supported by more oxygen, the insect respiratory system (the tracheal system) increases in size only when the insect molts. The overall goal of this research project is determine how growing insects match oxygen supply to increasing oxygen demand. Several mechanisms are possible. For example, larger insects may have more or larger tracheae or they may breathe faster. In addition, larger insects may change cellular or gene expression patterns that alter oxygen supply or demand. To characterize changes in respiratory structure and function, the studies will employ tools from molecular biology and whole animal physiology. The results of these studies may help to develop non-pesticide methods of insect control, as manipulation of atmospheric gases is increasingly important for controlling insects in grain storage, greenhouses, and museum collections. In addition, understanding the relationship between oxygen supply and demand will help to explain the appearance of gigantic insects in the Paleozoic era, as increased oxygen supply is hypothesized to have driven this phenomenon. \r\n\r\nContributing to this research, undergraduate researchers from North Dakota State University and Mississippi Valley State University, a Historically Black University, will participate in a summer research program. Students will assist in data collection at NDSU and accompany the principal investigator to Argonne National Laboratory to image the insect tracheal systems using synchrotron x-rays at the Advanced Photon Source. This educational component will increase participation of underrepresented students in research and will help recruit students to science careers. An online mentoring group will provide support to students and provide a means for assessing the efficacy of this program. Together the scientific components and educational components of this research program serve to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSociety relies heavily on insect services (e.g, pollination, detritus removal), while at the same time reviling many insect behaviors (e.g., disease vector, crop pestilence).  As such, understanding their basic biology is critical.  Although we know a lot about the endocrine control of molting, we understand little the initial triggers and their consequences.  Furthermore, we understand little about how body size is controlled.  One possible link between molting and body size is the respiratory system that provides oxygen to all tissues.\n\nThe insect respiratory system is composed of openings in the body wall, spiracles, that branch into tubular airways, tracheae.  Branching tracheae supply oxygen directly to cells.  As insects age from hatching to adulthood, their bodies may grow 200 to 10,000 times their original mass.  This increase in body mass is necessarily accompanied by an increase in oxygen demand.  However, the tracheal system may only increase in size when insects molt.  This research program focused on testing the central hypothesis that throughout juvenile growth and development, the insect tracheal system changes such that oxygen delivery matches oxygen demand.  To characterize changes in respiratory structure and function occur across multiple levels of organization, these studies used tools ranging from molecular biology to whole animal physiological techniques, such as x-ray imaging and respirometry. \n\nAcross instars, tracheal structures grow in size, and older insects were able to use abdominal pumping to increase respiration.  In addition, levels of hypoxia inducible factor increased with age in caterpillars.  Within an instar, in both grasshoppers and caterpillars, oxygen demand was greater than oxygen supply.  In grasshoppers, using x-ray imaging, air sacs were found to be compressed at the end of an instar.  In caterpillars, using x-ray imaging, tracheae were found to stay the same diameter in both the head and hind regions.  After molting, the new, underlying respiratory structures are large enough to delivery adequate oxygen.  In fruitflies reared in normoxia, those nearing the end of the third larval instar also expressed hypoxia inducible factor, suggesting that insects hypoxic near the end of an instar maybe widespread throughout the Insecta.  \n\nThis project contributed to the establishment of an ongoing summer undergraduate research program, focused on providing opportunities especially for females from underrepresented groups and those from primarily undergraduate institutions.  This program started with only two students each summer from Mississippi Valley State University, a Historically Black University.  Students assisted in data collection at NDSU and accompanied the principle investigator to Argonne National Laboratory, where x-ray imaging is performed.  Now the program has expanded to 7 &ndash; 10 students per year.  Last summer, of the seven participants, all were female, one was a non-traditional student, and three were from groups underrepresented in science. \n\nThis research is significant for several reasons.  First, it may be directly applicable to development of non-pesticide based methods of insect control.  For example, manipulation of atmospheric gases is a growing method for insect control in grain storage, greenhouses, and museum collections, as well as being used in commercial storage of mass-reared insects.  Second, this research can help to understand why insects molt at a given time.  If tissues are hypoxic, then it may be a signal that it is time to shed the old tracheae and replace them with larger ones.  In addition, climate change may alter atmospheric gas composition, and understanding how physiological systems, such as the respiratory system, may be affected is critical.  Lastly, understanding the relationship between oxygen supply and demand may help to explain the appearance of gigantic insects in the Paleozoic era, as increased oxygen supply is hypothesized to have driven this phenomenon.
