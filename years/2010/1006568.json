A new generation of high energy density power packs is needed. In this project, the unprecedented ability of vanadium diboride to release an exceptional 11 electron per molecule yields an energy density substantially greater than that of lithium or zinc, and provides the opportunity to greatly enhance the energy density of power packs.  Today's batteries and fuel cells deliver only one or two electrons per molecule. Remarkably, the 11e- storage capacity of vandium diboride is released over a flat, favorable, singular discharge voltage.  Little is known regarding the limiting mechanisms of this unusual process. The unique electrochemical properties of VB2 will be explored in this project. This GOALI project is a collaborative university-industry effort to understand the unusual and promising redox storage process of new energy dense, multi-electron materials for batteries and fuel cells.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: In this project, the unprecedented ability of vanadium diboride to release an exceptional 11 electron per molecule will be explored to greatly enhance the energy density of power packs. This VB2 charge density is substantially greater than that of conventional battery anodes based on lithium or zinc. Remarkably, the 11e- storage capacity of vandium diboride is released over a flat, favorable, singular discharge potential plateau.  Little is known regarding limiting mechanisms of this unusual process, and the unique electrochemical properties of VB2 nanoparticles will be explored in this project. This research, provides the first foray into the nano-domain of VB2 (anodic) electrochemistry. Stabilizing zirconia coated nanoparticle architectures will be studied to facilitate this unusual 11 electron anodic process and to formulate in a library of new VB2 nano-composites. A fundamental understanding of these processes will be developed towards the transformative goal of a new generation of power packs with several fold higher capacity than existing batteries and fuel cells. Cell configurations will be optimized to maximize the capacity of a VB2/air energy storage cell. This GOALI project is a collaborative university-industry effort to understand the unusual and promising redox storage process of new energy dense, multi-electron materials for batteries and fuel cells. The George Washington University (GWU) postdoctoral scholar and graduate and undergraduate researchers participating in this project will be trained in state-of-the-art fundamental electrochemistry at GWU and have the special opportunity to gain experience in the industrial R&D workplace through visits each year to the industry liason, Lynntech, Inc.",
