 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nojirimycins (NJs) are nitrogen analogs of common sugars, in which the nitrogen atom is found in the ring, in place of the endocyclic ring oxygen.  The NJs are found in some soil dwelling bacteria (Bacilli and Streptomyces) and in some plants.  The initial and notable observation about NJ and various homologs are that these compounds often exhibit selective and potent inhibition of glycosyl hydrolases and glycosyltransferases.  Despite over 40 years of recognition, the biosynthesis of these important natural products remains undefined to date, apart from knowledge that glucose is the biosynthetic precursor.  Further, the reason or reasons for the NJ's occurrence in Nature remains unknown, but their function as inhibitors of glycoside hydrolase/transferase enzymes suggests that these compounds may serve as part of a complex chemical ecology of soil bacteria, plant host and other interacting species via perturbation of glycosylation states.  The studies set forth in this project seek to identify the complete set of genes coding for the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) in the bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus.  The genes will be cloned and expressed in E. coli for production of recombinant biosynthetic enzymes.  The enzymes will be characterized in terms of their substrate specificity and other steady state kinetic parameters.  Finally, knockout strains of B.amyloliquefaciens will be produced and compared to wild type strains in microcosm experiments with pea seedlings and plant pathogens and perturbations in the populations as a function of the presence of DNJ will be identified.  A correlation between DNJ production and changes in the microbial ecology of the rhizosphere would provide new evidence for the natural function of the nojirimycins.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe research project will involve undergraduate and graduate students, and provide them with a multidisciplinary research training experience.  An important part of the project will include outreach to secondary schools. Floridian secondary school science teachers will be recruited to participate in summer research.  The teachers will be provided the opportunity to develop learning/teaching modules based on their research experience that can be brought back to the classroom.  The science developed in this research project may have broad impact in terms of providing new catalysts for \"green\" synthetic reactions, and provide new insight into manipulating interactions among members of microbial communities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Azsugars are related to the common sugars such as glucose but they contain a nitrogen atom in place of an oxygen atom, and this substitution gives the azasugar the ability to have a positive charge on it.  Azasugars have a number of functions including their function as templates or \"chemical chaperones\" to help misfolded proteins fold properly and as inhibitors of enzymes that process sugars for digestion.  Despite their importance in natural processes, the way they are made in cells was unknown.  Our research project was dedicated to determining the way in which azasugars were made in certain soil bacteria, to ultimately help us understand why Nature uses these interesting compounds in the rhizosphere (the region around plant roots).  (Figure 1) We used genomic analyses to identify three  of the genes involved in creating the biosynthetic machinery for azasugars.  We then synthesized the genes and expressed them to produce purified enzymes.  We have studied the chemical and kinetic mechanisms of these enzymes and found in one case an unusual behavior for a nitrogen transferring enzyme called a transaminase.  This enzyme may be useful to help us synthesize vitamin B6 compounds in an inexpensive way.  We studied an enzyme called an aminomannitol dehydrogenase and discovered it had a specificity for nitrogen containing sugars that had not been reported before.  Another finding is that the azasugar biosynthetic genes do not appear to be all grouped together in the same place in the bacterial chromosome, making our work much more challenging than if they were all grouped together in the same place.  We are now looking in other places to find what we hypothesize are the remaining two genes and their encoded enzymes that would complete the family of five required to synthesize the azasugar deoxynojirimycin.  Further, we have used our genomic information to find what is likely azasugar production in Chitinophaga bacteria previously unknown to make azasugars, suggesting that the ecology of some soil bacteria includes a general theme involving azasugars, that we speculate involves preventing competitor species from obtaining sugars as food.  This is important because the basic research here could ultimately translate into improved agricultural practices, as one example.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicole A Horenstein"
