 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, in partnership with several universities and a science advisory committee of distinguished international researchers in physics and astronomy, is producing \"The Matter of Origins,\" a two-part experimental program that engages the public in explorations of the nature of beginnings and the physics of the origin of matter.  Act I takes place in a theater where audiences will experience a dance performance illuminated by video and a vivid soundscape.  Act II takes place in an adjacent space where audiences, who will be seated with scientists, historians, philosophers, and religious leaders, can participate in facilitated dialogue about the nature of origins in an immersive environment that incorporates dance, projected images, and provocative questions.  The program will be implemented around the country, initially at four universities, with possible expansion to additional venues.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this EAGER project are (1) to develop an innovative model for using dance, digital media, and structured dialogue to attract and engage public audiences in science content and processes and (2) to explore how artistic practices may have broader applications with respect to science learning and research.  The intention is to explore how science can be represented in the art and in the experience and not simply interpreted into abstract choreographic expression with a program note.  The program elements and outcomes will be evaluated by researchers from Michigan State University who will study impacts on the public and on participating professionals - dancers, scientists, etc.  Dissemination of results will be to professional communities in the sciences, arts and informal science education.",
