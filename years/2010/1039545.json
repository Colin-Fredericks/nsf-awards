 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Meshing Roundtable was created in 1992 to form a focal point for discussing mesh and grid generation and related topics. The International Meshing Roundtable is organized by Sandia National Laboratories, and thus has always taken place within the United States. This conference is the only U.S.- based conference with a sole focus on mesh and grid generation. Other potential topics for discussion at the meeting include: computational geometry issues for meshing, parallel meshing, mesh adaptation, analysis\r\nof meshing algorithms, and applications of meshing including computer graphics, geometric modeling, biomedical applications, etc.\r\n\r\nThe 19th International Meshing Roundtable will be held October 3-6, 2010 in Chattanooga, TN. The conference will include short courses, a keynote talk, a banquet with a speaker, three invited talks, presentation of conference papers, presentation of research notes, a poster session, a professional development session targeting students and postdocs, and a reception.\r\n\r\nThis award supports student and postdoc participation in the conference. In particular, NSF support will be used for student/postdoc conference registration and travel, and for professional staff support.",
