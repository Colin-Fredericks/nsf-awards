 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding written sentences in a language learned at a later age is different from processing sentences in one's native language. This project aims to clarify what underlies this difference by testing to what extent a language learner's problems with sentence processing are related to 1) the lack of detailed word knowledge and rapid access word-level information, and 2) the reader's ability to suppress irrelevant information in general. Native speakers and second-language learners will be closely compared. The proposed project is a collaboration between the University of Florida (USA), the University of Utrecht (The Netherlands), and the Universidad De La Laguna (Spain), and will test native speakers of English, native speakers of Spanish, Dutch learners of English, and English learners of Spanish. \r\n\r\nResults from this project may lead to a better understanding of how second-language learners comprehend written language and why certain individuals experience more problems than others when learning a second language. Outcomes of this project may inform research on language education and intervention techniques. This will ultimately benefit minority populations learning English as a second language, as well as populations with language impairments. Finally, the project will be integrated into the linguistics curriculum at University of Florida and will create international research opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience with psycholinguistic and electrophysiological research. \r\n\r\nThis work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and the Office of International Science and Engineering",
