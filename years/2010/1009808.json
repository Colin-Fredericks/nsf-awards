Ruane. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this RET in Engineering program is to provide professional development of STEM leaders (10 elementary and pre-service teachers per year for three years, 30 in total) through research experiences and instructional innovations.  It will involve diverse groups of K-12 teachers in STEM teaching in biophotonics, 2) immerse teachers in interdisciplinary, supportive biophotonics research groups, 3) train teachers to plan and conduct classsroom teaching based on biophotonics, and 4) connect teachers with local researchers, research faculty, NSF REU students, GK-12 fellows and faculy from two Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) as well as regional STEM networks.",
