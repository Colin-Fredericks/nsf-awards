 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become increasingly clear that the impact of anthropogenic CO2 on the global oceans may have severe consequences to a wide variety of organisms and food webs. Reduced pH and carbonate saturation states have been shown to cause reduction in calcification rates in aragonite producing corals and pteropods. Recent investigations indicate that the aragonite saturation horizon in the North Pacific has measurably shoaled in the last two decades. Because the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 can affect all aquatic systems, studies must be conducted as synoptically as possible. This can be most effectively accomplished through the wide-scale use of in situ sensors\r\n\r\nInvestigations into carbon system dynamics are seriously hampered by the inability to measure total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) in situ. While the capabilities exist to measure pH, CO2 fugacity (f CO2), and pCO2 in situ, such parameters strongly co-vary and therefore carbon system parameters derived from these values are subject to much greater error than those calculated using one of those terms and either total alkalinity (AT) or CT. The proposed work builds on the decade-long development and deployment of the in situ Spectrophotometric Elemental Analysis System (SEAS), as well as the development and field testing of the bench-top MICA (Multiparameter Inorganic Carbon Analyzer). The project will involve development of a total carbon capability on the SEAS platform through modeling, design, and lab tests of a new optical cell; configuring and calibrating SEAS for CT measurements; and field testing/ground truthing in a local harbor.\r\n\r\nThe PI's request funding to: (1) Develop, test, and refine an optical cell that will facilitate measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in situ; (2) conduct a series of laboratory tests to optimize the CT method for use on the SEAS instrument; and (3) conduct field tests using SEAS-CT and SEAS-pH instruments at Bayboro Harbor. While the objective of the proposed work is to develop an in situ instrument capable of performing CT measurements in a moored configuration, equilibration on the scale of two minutes should allow the development of an in situ profiling capability as long as the profiling rate is sufficiently slow.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nTo be able to use in situ platforms will enhance the regional and global understanding of relevant environmental issues related to climate (air-sea exchange of CO2 and the ocean's role in the atmospheric uptake) as well as the effect of the increased CO2 in the ocean such as ocean acidification. Good including graduate. The proposed activity will contribute to the advance of knowledge through the mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, which is clearly effective since the Principal Investigator was herself a graduate student in this group. A minority graduate student involved in the Bridge to the Doctorate program will also participate to the project. The proposal has huge potential for broader community collaboration and the proposers give examples of recent partnerships. This will be of great benefit for society since the fate of anthropogenic carbon can then be better predicted for future scenarios of various CO2 emissions, which will directly influence the decision on climate mitigation strategies.",

Higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere result in higher levels of carbonic acid in seawater. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the ocean has absorbed about a quarter of the anthropogenic (human-generated) carbon dioxide that industrial and manufacturing processes have added to the atmosphere, resulting in a 30% increase in surface seawater acidity. Scientists study the effects of ocean acidification on global ecosystems and seek to predict how increasing acidity levels will affect marine organisms and ecosystems in the future. Studies of ocean acidification, which are conducted over vast areas for a wide range of time periods, require high-resolution underwater (in situ) carbon-system sensors that can provide information on short-term variability and long-term change.\nUnder a National Science Foundation grant, a team of marine scientists and engineers developed an underwater instrument for measuring the total concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater. This instrument, along with a second sensor that measures ocean acidity (pH levels), collects data that provides a basis for calculating the concentrations of all forms of inorganic carbon in seawater.  These calculations allow marine scientists to determine levels of carbonate saturation, a key indication of how much energy an organism must expend to make its calcium carbonate shell. Certain organisms, such as clams and oysters, cannot grow shells when carbonate saturation states are too low. Low carbonate saturation states in the Pacific Northwest have resulted in large-scale declines of natural and farmed clam and oyster larvae.\nMembers of the development team tested the new DIC sensor in Tampa Bay in the Gulf of Mexico and in Florida Bay, at the southern tip of Florida. Measurements from the DIC instrument samples (collected at a rate of approximately fifty per hour) were compared to measurements from samples that were collected by hand and analyzed in a laboratory. The data showed that the DIC sensor measurements were accurate and precise, and that the sensing component was highly resistant to the biofouling that generally affects underwater instruments in biologically dynamic regions. The instrument development project included graduate student participation, and instrument testing was facilitated by research colleagues from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lori R Adornato"
