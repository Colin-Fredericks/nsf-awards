 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a laser-scanning inverted confocal microscope for research and research training in cellular, molecular and developmental biology at the College of William and Mary.  A wide range of research and research training initiatives at the college of William & Mary use the new confocal microscope for research on topics that include:  stem cell development, sex determination, protein traffic control in cells, plant evolution and development, and DNA repair mechanisms.  The new system capabilities allow for imagining of cellular dynamics within tissues at near-real time, and facilitate the utilization of new techniques that enable cutting-edge research and research training.  Through research collaborations with faculty and students at regional institutions and other outreach initiatives where confocal microscopy has been an important training tool, the William and Mary Biology Department provides modern research and research training to students who might otherwise not have this opportunity.  The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.        \r\n \r\n",

Roggero and L. Allison &ndash; Fall 2011, 21 students; Fall 2012, 28 students), (b) two-part summer lecture and demonstration series on \"Light Microscopy\" presented to undergraduate research students, graduate students, and a broad group of faculty working at W&amp;M this summer (taught by M. Wawersik -- 35 students), (c) a graduate class workshop on confocal microscopy (Bio 646, Nuclear Structure &amp; Gene Activity; taught by V. Roggero and L. Allison -- 4 students), (d) demonstration of uses for confocal microscopy in biological research given to Virginia State Delegate Michael Watson (R) (presented by M. Wawersik, M. Saha &amp; E. Bradley), (e) undergraduate class demonstration on confocal microscopy (Bio 419, Plant Development &amp; Physiology taught by E. Engstrom; 4 students), and (f) training of undergraduate and graduate research students on how to use the laser-scanning confocal system for their research (18 undergraduate and 1 graduate students). Additional students who are working in collaboration with trained users are also gaining exposure to use of confocal microscopy systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Wawersik"
