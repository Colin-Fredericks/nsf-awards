McNamee\r\nUniversity of Texas, Austin\r\n\r\nWhy do Mexican Americans have patterns of first marriage and divorce similar to whites, but lower rates of remarriage? One explanation is that people with higher socio-economic status have higher marriage rates and lower divorce rates than people with lower socio-economic status. However, Mexican Americans marry at rates comparable to non-Hispanic whites and divorce at slightly lower rates. Some have argued that Mexican American marriage is supported by their cultural orientation towards familialism. However, this is inconsistent with patterns of remarriage for Mexican Americans who remarry at rates significantly lower than non-Hispanic whites. This study investigates the unexplained race and ethnic variation in remarriage using: 1) the National Survey Family Growth, 2) the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, and 3) 30 in-depth interviews of 15 Mexican American and 15 non-Hispanic White recently divorced women living in Austin, Texas. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  It is well established that the wellbeing, particularly economic wellbeing, of adults and their children is positively associated with marriage, including remarriage. Therefore, a better understanding of racial/ethnic differences in martial transitions has potential practical and therapeutic importance for assisting professionals and families in navigating post-divorce transitions.",

Another potential explanation was that Latinas are more likely to have children, a status associated with lower remarriage rates. We found that motherhood status did not help to explain Latina&rsquo;s lower remarriage rates, but the negative association between having children and remarriage is stronger for foreign-born Latinas. In fact, among women with no children, remarriage rates of foreign-born Latinas are no lower than for white women. Additionally, we investigated the role of attitudes towards remarriage. While prior research found that Latinos have more positive views about marriage and this buoys their marriage rates despite economic disadvantage, it may be that among the divorced Latinos have no more positive attitudes toward marriage than whites because the most pro-marriage Latinos will remain married.

The parents of white women were generally supportive of their daughter&rsquo;s post-divorce relationship decisions and many encouraged their daughters to start dating.

Latinas reported that parental disapproval derived from their parents&rsquo; attachment to the first marriage and their religious beliefs about divorce.
