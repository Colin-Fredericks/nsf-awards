Input options for logistics, research activities, cost attributes and energy and emission options will be processed in the model.  Solutions will be expressed in costs per year, carbon footprints, and operations and logistics strategies.  The project will be assisted by a graduate student for two years and upon graduation the knowledge acquired  will transfer to the industrial, governmental, and public world.  Attempts to recruit a student from a minority or underrepresented group will be undertaken.",
