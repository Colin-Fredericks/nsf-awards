 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project, DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking (DISSECT), builds on the fundamental role computing has gained within all traditional sciences. The driving force of the project is the infusion of principles of computational thinking in traditional scientific disciplines, creating new opportunities for scientific discovery and for stimulating learning of STEM. The project seeks to develop a collaborative model among NMSU, K-12 schools, and local school districts, to foster the development of a new generation of well-rounded computer scientists (the GK-12 fellows), capable of carrying their research to a broader scientific arena, and with the communication and leadership skills necessary to operate outside their specific CS discipline. Through an innovative collaboration model with K-12 teachers and NMSU faculty members, the GK-12 fellows' scientific exploration will develop in novel educational modules and activities, which will play a vital role in enriching and revitalizing the general STEM content of K-12 curricula. The project proposes to introduce computational thinking as the tool to achieve these results. In the long term, the exposure to computational concepts will train students in foundations of CS. The project will play a vital role in the enrichment of middle/high school STEM teachers. Short term efforts will develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in K-12 students; long term, it will play a part in alleviating the shortage of skilled computing professionals in the United States.",

The tenets of DISSECT are: <strong>(1) </strong>The core concepts of <em>Computational Thinking </em>are implicit in many scientific disciplines and can be effectively extrapolated, thus enabling the learning of CT as a part of the learning of other scientific disciplines; <strong>(2) </strong>CT enhances the teaching of traditional scientific and mathematical content, with effective modeling strategies, alternative representations, and opportunities to present expert thinking and exploratory problem solving.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Computer scientists have found themselves increasingly operating in interdisciplinary research, and modern CS research is often guided by problems from other scientific disciplines. While this perspective is gaining momentum, this broader picture and societal impact of CS is often missed in the focused pursuit of a traditional CS degree. Graduate students in CS are frequently: <strong>(a) </strong>not trained in maintaining a broader vision of CS research, losing sight of how their research can be transformative in other domains; <strong>(b) </strong>not equipped with skills to communicate research ideas to audiences non-technical or from a different scientific background. With this perspective in mind, the goal of DISSECT was to realize interventions to develop the research, pedagogical, and communication skills of graduate students in CS and related disciplines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In DISSECT, <em>graduate fellows </em>are paired with middle or high school science (and even non-science) <em>teachers</em>, with the goal of investing one semester working together in the development and deployment of new modules for targeted K12 courses. The modules explore the science content through the lenses of CT and computational methods. These modules are tested in the classroom, revised, and if circumstances permit, retested the following semester with a new class. Once finalized, these modules are posted on the DISSECT website. As of June 2016, modules for 6th grade science, 8th grade science, 8th grade language arts, middle school agriculture, HS chemistry, HS forensics, HS zoology, HS English literature, and HS computer science have been created. Frequently, teachers have limited access to computers in the classroom and graduate students need to create activities that teach CT without the use of computers. The experience allows the graduate students to learn to communicate scientific content to diverse audiences and gain experience in teaching at different levels. Furthermore, DISSECT requires the CS graduate students to nurture a broader view of their research and explore the application of a focused CS research methodology (e.g., sensor networks) to enhance solutions of traditional science problems (e.g., environmental modeling). DISSECT has engaged 31 graduate fellows and 18 middle and high school teachers (many of them serving the program for several years). The project has contributed to over 70 research publications, new research collaborations among graduate students, 11 MS and 4 PhD degrees. The activities led several graduate students to revise their priorities, by embracing the importance of CS education and STEM education.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The program has developed an array of resources, including CT professional development workshops for teachers, training materials for graduate students focused on inquiry based pedagogy and NM school standards, and a network of schools and teachers committed to promoting CT training.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Broader Impacts: While the primary emphasis of DISSECT was on the pedagogical and communication training of graduate fellows, the project impacted over 1,800 middle and high school students in the classrooms served by the graduate students. The students were exposed to a broad range of CT concepts &ndash; from data analysis to algorithmic thinking to actual programming. The project has contributed to the development of a cadre of K12 teachers who are skilled in teaching science through CT, and who have adopted CT as a problem solving technique. We have close to 100% adoption of the developed modules beyond the tenure of the teachers in DISSECT.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The program has demonstrated impact on students&rsquo; ability to recognize and use concepts drawn from CS (assessed using observations and pre/post-tests). The results confirm a significant improvement in proficiency in computing, even when concepts are embedded in non-science courses; for example, Figure 1 shows some statistics derived from Fall 2014 science courses, assessing ability to (1) recognize and (2) define CT concepts, and change in interest towards (3) CS and (4) jobs in computing. The changes were statistically significant, indicating that the modules developed increased CT knowledge and interest in CS.&nbsp;Figure 2 shows our best paper award at IEEE FIE 2015 &ndash; discussing embedding of computational thinking in English literature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Enrico&nbsp;Pontelli</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939770660_Screenshot2017-03-3023.53.10--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939770660_Screenshot2017-03-3023.53.10--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Some experimental results Fall 2014\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939770660_Screenshot2017-03-3023.53.10--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Some experimental results Fall 2014\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Recognition, definitions, Difference of CT Related Likert Questions paired t test results</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Enrico Pontelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Enrico&nbsp;Pontelli</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Some experimental results Fall 2014</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939841198_14692193_1282864278413644_7206397738901797637_o--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939841198_14692193_1282864278413644_7206397738901797637_o--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Best Paper Award\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0947465/0947465_10017936_1490939841198_14692193_1282864278413644_7206397738901797637_o--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Best Paper Award\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Best Paper award at IEEE Frontiers in Education 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Enrico Pontelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Enrico&nbsp;Pontelli</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Best Paper Award</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
