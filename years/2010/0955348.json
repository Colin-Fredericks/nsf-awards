 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nSemiconducting nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) are tiny ?balls? of material with exciting optical and electronic properties that can be controlled by changing the size of the NQD and other parameters. They are relatively easy to incorporate into devices, and have already proven their utility as fluorescent markers for biological imaging.  NQDs are being used in photovoltaics, energy efficient lighting, and photodetectors, though the electronic properties of NQDs are sensitive to their immediate surroundings. This Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to understand electronic properties of nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) in environments relevant to functional optoelectronic devices.  This will be done by using a scanning probe microscope that can investigate individual NQDs, measuring the charge, current, and location of the NQDs in a variety of environments, leading to improved device design. Furthermore, this project aims to increase general science literacy and motivate the female undergraduate students at Mount Holyoke College to pursue careers in science, by engaging undergraduates in hands-on research projects and developing a first year seminar.  The seminar seeks to excite the students about present-day research and to educate both science majors and interested non-majors about how science ?happens? by reading and discussing recent popular coverage of scientific discoveries and debates. \r\n\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis Faculty Early Career Award supports a project seeking to understand electronic properties of nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) in solid state structures, in particular an understanding of charge transport on and off NQDs.  The research project will focus on the use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) to locally probe NQD arrays, as well as isolated and aggregated NQDs deposited on a variety of materials and embedded in organic semiconductors.  Scanned gate techniques, electric force microscopy, and conductive SPM can spatially reveal variations in electrical properties of nominally identical areas, illuminating the role of the local environment and imperfections of fabrication on microscopic and macroscopic properties.  Furthermore, this project aims to increase general science literacy and motivate the female students at Mount Holyoke College to pursue careers in science, by engaging undergraduates in hands-on research projects and developing a first year seminar.  The seminar seeks to excite the students about present-day research and to educate both science majors and interested non-majors about how science ?happens? by reading and discussing recent popular coverage of scientific discoveries and debates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur daily electronics consist of traditional crystalline semiconductor materials like silicon.  Non-traditional semiconductors, like organic materials and arrays of nanocrystals, offer potential benefits like cheap fabrication and the ability to make flexible screens and solar panels.  However, these non-traditional materials are generally not crystalline and have relatively poor electronic properties.  Defects and interfaces impact the motion of charges inside these materials by creating trap states, locations that can capture a charge and restrict its motion.  The flow of current through these materials can be dominated by these trap states. \n\nSupport for this project enabled the development of a new technique to investigate how charges move through functioning electrical devices made from materials with many trap states and is complementary to other techniques that study the energy of trap states.  The technique uses the atomic force microscope, a system that brings a nanoscale probe close to the surface of a material and can record spatial information about material and device properties.  By selecting the right geometry for a device and carefully applying voltages in the correct ranges, we are able to measure the injection and extraction of charges into the semiconducting thin film.  We have demonstrated the ability to record the population and depopulation of trap states.  Using the atomic force microscope also allows us to study how the behavior changes in different areas of the device.\n\nWomen continue to be under-represented in physics and engineering, with only about 20% of the bachelor\u00c6s degrees in physics awarded to women.  Thirteen undergraduate women contributed to the outcomes of this project; five of the six who have graduated are pursuing PhDs, and one is employed as an engineer.  The award also supported the development of a first year seminar for the female undergraduates at Mount Holyoke College, Science in the Media.  The course discusses current events in science, often with guests who are researchers in the field or professional science communicators.  Data show that student attitudes towards science change throughout the semester, particularly among those who are not planning to study science coursework in college. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Aidala"
