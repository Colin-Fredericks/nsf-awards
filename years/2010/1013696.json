 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project addresses unintended shark catch in commercial fisheries by creating an advanced fishing hook material that is repellent to sharks and not repellent to market-valuable fish. In the commercial longline fishing industry, it is not uncommon to capture more sharks than target fish. Unintended shark catch, or \"bycatch\", results because a baited hook is equally attractive to both fish and sharks. If unwanted sharks can be selectively repelled, the target fish catch can be maximized, allowing the industry to remain sustainable, profitable, and eligible for incentives from fishery regulators. To address this selective fishing requirement, the proposed technology combines two known shark repellent technologies directly into a fishing hook: Magnetism and electropositivity. These repellents affect the shark's unique electrical sense and are not detectable by tuna and swordfish, which lack the electrical sense. The proposed technology is transparent to fishermen because it will not require external power and will not change the shape, function, or handling of a standard hook. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this research are the training of new scientists and increased understanding of shark behavior and shark repellent materials. By identifying compounds with selective shark repellent activity, marine biologists will have an enhanced understanding of the behavioral differences between sharks and fishes. Technological understanding will be advanced identifying surface treatment techniques for metals used in marine environments. These techniques will provide direction for future shark-repellent coatings for marine aquaculture and marine infrastructure.",

Unwanted shark catch, or \"bycatch\", is a major problem in any longline fishery that uses hooks and is not trying to catch sharks. A baited fishing hook cannot tell the difference between a shark or a tuna, and either can be hooked. Shark bycatch on longlines results in damage and loss of gear, reduced catch of marketable fish, risk of injury to fishermen, and expenditure of time to remove the dead or dying sharks.

SharkDefense addressed this critical need by innovating a hook technology that combines two shark repellents into a fishing hook. The product is called the SMART Hook&trade; (Selective Magnetic And Repellent-Treated Hook). The SMART Hook is magnetic and is coated with a metal that acts like a battery when it contacts seawater, but the hook requires no power source.

Additional experiments with large lemon sharks in the Florida Key found a 60 percent reduction on baits eaten using commercial-sized SMART Hooks. Larger SMART hooks were able to incorporate more magnetism and shark-repellent metals, which likely accounts for their higher percentage of reduction.
