 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop entrepreneurship training material for universities, governments and non-government organizations. Such organizations have an interest in accelerating the creation of technology-driven entrepreneurial enterprises, and have a history of establishing programs to train technologists for entrepreneurship. To be successful, these teams must learn to operate cohesively, establish a thoughtful and implementable business strategy, obtain needed resources, and execute on the strategy. This research project aims to provide an instructional framework to maximize these goals by enhancing the existing assessment tools, building a simulation test-bed of entrepreneur 'games' and testing these simulations and the educational program with sample groups. The end product will be a tested program including assessments, feedback, and a single simulation which will be piloted several times using grant funding for data collection and refinement. \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes will impact small early-stage companies from pre-funding through to venture capital funding.  Such organizations are typically cash-strapped, and will be unable to pay out of their own pocket to attend workshops and purchase software that are not directly focused on each of their core technologies. However, companies are willing to attend workshops to improve entrepreneurial skills when those are sponsored by other organizations. Such types of organizations have both a vested interest in creating more viable high growth companies, both from an economic development and licensing revenue perspective, and they both have funding that they have been willing to put to work delivering programming to prospective entrepreneurs",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPI Experiential Learning (\"PIXL\") takes a data-driven approach to management training, coupling sophisticated analytical tools with realistic activities to ensure that people learn by doing.  At the core of our offering is a sophisticated web-based business simulation, where teams of participants get to experience running a business and competing against other teams in the program.\n\nWe draw upon academic research in the fields of leadership, strategy, group dynamics, organizational behavior, and social psychology to help people learn about themselves, how they work with others, and how they can grow as leaders of an entrepreneurial company.\n\nThe foundation of our instructional philosophy is that for most effective learning, students need:\n\nRelevant, targeted feedback that is specific to themselves and their behaviors\nClassroom instruction to integrate this feedback and to understand its implications on team performance and interactions\nStructured experiences where students can practice new behaviors and put what they\u00c6ve learned to use\n\n\nUnder this Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant, PIXL used those principles to develop an innovative combination of educational tools to teach people to more effectively use business knowledge in real-life situations.  Data collection, distribution, and simulation exercises are now all web-based; the program itself is modular and can be delivered in almost any combination of in-person or distributed format.  Depending on modules and learning outcomes targeted, programs can be as short as two hours or as long as two days &ndash; or spread across weeks, such as during an academic semester.  PIXL\u00c6s business model has been to obtain revenue from a combination of licensing software, fees associated with program administration, and charging for program facilitation and teaching.\n\nSpecific project outcomes funded by this grant include:\n\nDeveloped a web infrastructure for the collection of assessment data, simulation and interaction data, and the return of assessment feedback and simulation results to groups and individuals.\nDesigned a series of 3 simulation scenarios specific to experiences a technology entrepreneur might experience.\nConducted mini-seminars to test the simulation scenarios in a non-automated, instructor-led format; in addition to smaller test groups, hundreds have completed revenue-generating PIXL programs using the simulation and modules developed in the Phase 1 project.\nRefined simulation scenarios based on results of mini-scenarios.\nFollowed up with participants using the web infrastructure to collect data on training impact and performance.\nEnsured that the design was highly scalable and enables future distribution across a variety of delivery methods.\nDesigned a \"mixed motive environment\" enhancement to create an additional set of potential group conflict dynamics that represent real-world conflicting motives in teams.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tom Schryver"
