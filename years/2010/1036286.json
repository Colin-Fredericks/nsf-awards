The T-STEM II project seeks to 1) improve undergraduate STEM research infrastructure; 2) increase the number of students joining a graduate program in STEM within one year of graduation; and 3) increase the enrollment of African American male students in STEM disciplines. To achieve these goals VSU will: establish an Office of Undergraduate Research to strengthen further the undergraduate research foundation; create an Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program that will train graduates to become life-long learners and skilled communicators; conduct a Summer Research Institute to improve students' ability and enthusiasm in conducting in-depth scientific research; conduct GRE preparation to prepare students for admission to graduate programs; have High School Internships to improve participants' knowledge of research in STEM; and conduct a Pre-college Institute to improve students' knowledge on applications of STEM in real life.\r\nThe project includes strategies and activities to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning; broaden participation of underrepresented groups; and enhance infrastructure for research and education.",
