 "awd_abstract_narration": "OSSD is a scientific membership society with a mission to enhance the knowledge of the biological basis of sex/gender differences by facilitating interdisciplinary communication and collaboration among basic scientists and clinical scientists from diverse backgrounds. The main objectives of the Annual Meeting are to: 1) advance the understanding of sex differences throughout the organism; 2) explore the role of biological sex differences across the lifespan; 3) highlight research from top scientists in a variety of biological fields; 4) facilitate the establishment of collaborations among national and international scientists who are interested in the molecular, genetic and hormonal bases of biological sex differences; and 5) grow the scientific community interested and involved in sex differences research by encouraging and supporting the participation of New Investigators who will present talks and posters. Importantly, this grant will support the travel expenses for four New Investigators whose research will be highlighted on the opening day of the conference in the Elizabeth Young New Investigator Symposium. Presenters will gain experience in preparing and delivering a talk at an international meeting. This opportunity should lead to enhanced career opportunities for the New Investigators as well as provide an incentive for other trainees.  Additionally, the OSSD is committed to rewarding students and post-doctoral trainees for their intellectual involvement in the field of sex differences.  Travel and Poster Awards are given based on the scientific merit of the research, the effectiveness of the presentation, and the role of the trainee in initiating and carrying out the research. The symposia and poster presentations will enhance the knowledge of those studying sex-based biological differences by highlighting new discoveries and by facilitating communication and knowledge-sharing among diverse fields of study.",
