 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has three distinct but inter-related themes, each building on the next through an integrated physiological systems approach. Initially, the lab will explore, for the very first time, the embryonic interactions of two major systems - the cardiovascular system (CVS) and the renal system - and how their developmental plans are codependent upon each other as the vertebrate embryo develops. Also to be investigated is the developmental onset of the normal regulatory interactions between the CVS and renal system, including determination of developmental periods of greatest sensitivity to external stressors- the so-called \"critical windows\". Third, the enigmatic field of delayed phenotype alteration -so-called \"fetal programming\"- of the CVS and kidneys will be explored.  The hypotheses will be tested by applying environmental and/or pharmaceutical stressors to the embryo and then assessing the physiological changes in the embryo and adult bird.  The experiments will also begin to identify underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that manifest in structural and functional modifications.  This work transcends the typical \"intrasystem\" approach of most studies of structure/function relationships in developing vertebrates. Indeed, it represents one of the first experimental programs to look across - rather than just within - physiological systems in the developing vertebrate embryo.  This study will greatly improve the understanding of the development of the embryonic CV and renal systems, and when and how these systems first begin their interactions, making important advances in the ontogeny of physiological regulation between, rather than just within, systems. An enhanced understanding of embryonic physiology in vertebrates - especially phenomena like developmental plasticity and particularly fetal programming - is a vital prerequisite for the eventual development of corrective procedures for congenital defects in human fetuses and even embryos. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive state-of-the-art training in the Developmental Physiology and Genetics program at the University of North Texas and interactions with researchers at the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico will provide them with important cultural and international perspectives.",
