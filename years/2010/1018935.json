 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award targets the study of the theory of qubit coherence protection combining passive (dynamical decoupling) and active (quantum error correction) techniques. The dynamical decoupling is very frugal as it does not require any additional qubits to work; it will be used at the level of physical qubits as the first stage of coherence protection. For several solid-state qubit implementations, this may suppress the decoherence rate to be dealt with by the quantum error correction by an order of magnitude or more, thus dramatically reducing the hardware requirements. The PI plans to analyze the effectiveness of such a combined coherence protection scheme over long time intervals, when compared to the correlation time of the environment using both analytical and numerical techniques.",
