 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to support US participants traveling to the Summer School on Hodge Theory that will take place at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy, from June 14 to July 3, 2010. The objectives of the Summer School are to give an overview of modern Hodge Theory with an emphasis on integrating the geometric and algebraic aspects and on highlighting the increasing interest on the arithmetic/geometric aspects of the theory. The hope is to present to students the overall framework of the subject and to introduce them to promising areas for future study and research. Thus this summer school on Hodge Theory will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to enter one of the most active areas of current research in algebraic geometry. \r\n\r\nHodge theory is an important area of differential and algebraic geometry with deep connections to many fields of mathematics and physics. Hodge theory has involved techniques drawn from algebraic, arithmetic, analytic and diff\u000berential geometry, as well as from topology and partial di\u000bfferential equations. This summer school on Hodge Theory will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to enter one of the most active areas of current research in algebraic geometry.",
