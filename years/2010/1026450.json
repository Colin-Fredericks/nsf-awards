Sophisticated magnetic field observations are required to improve our scientific understanding of dynamic stars and their atmospheres, and such measurements, in turn, depend upon advanced polarimetric techniques.  \r\n\r\n\"Solar Polarization Workshop 6\" will continue a long-standing series of international workshops that bring together experts to discuss how developing topics in theoretical astrophysics, atmospheric modeling, and sensitive instrument technology can help promote our fundamental physical understanding of solar polarization and stellar magnetic fields.  This meeting will be convened near the eventual site of the future Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) and will thus help focus community planning on how to optimize this new instrument to advance our understanding of the solar atmosphere and its application to other stars. Students and young researchers who represent the next generation of solar physicists will be supported to attend.",
