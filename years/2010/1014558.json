The workshop will be held in October 2010 in San Jose, Costa Rica and will be co-funded by the Division of Earth Sciences and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The meeting will focus on:  (a) scientific issues that derive from the unique tectonic environment of the region, (b) strengthening the regional infrastructure and academic community for seismological research, and (c) generating products with immediate regional societal benefits.  Participants will include researchers from universities and geophysical observatory networks, students, national policy experts, and emergency planners from the US, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.  The workshop will be organized by Dr. Ray Willemann from Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) in collaboration with Drs. Marino Protti, Richard Robertson, and Gerardo Suarez from the Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica, the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago, and the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma in Mexico, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe activity will bring together a diverse community of researchers, graduate students, practioners, and policy makers from the United States and Latin America.  Outcomes from the workshop will lead to new insights regarding developing hazard mitigation systems, seismograph networks, and data sharing mechanisms in the region.  Additionally, new interdisciplinary projects of interest to NSF, USAID, and the participating countries are expected outcome of this workshop.",
