 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than thirty years, oceanographers and atmospheric scientists have studied dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) because they form the basis of a biogeochemical system that transfers sulfur from the oceans to the atmosphere, affecting the Earth?s radiation balance and climate. Through these studies, we have learned that DMS and DMSP also significantly impact the ecology and chemistry of the oceans. The intensive effort to understand the marine biogeochemistry of DMS(P) has revealed that their cycling is much more complex than first imagined, but it has also caused us to largely overlook a highly interesting and important component of the DMS(P) cycle, namely acrylate, a product formed from the degradation of DMSP via DMSP lyase. Surprisingly little is known about acrylate concentrations, fluxes, or impacts in the oceans, even though concentrations and fluxes should at times be substantial, especially during blooms of DMSP-rich algae that are common throughout the world?s oceans and often harmful or toxic. \r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry will conduct a three-year laboratory and field study to examine several fundamental aspects of the marine acrylate cycle. The main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to determine the kinetics and wavelength dependence for the photolysis of acrylate in contrasting oceanic waters; (2) to determine cellular and dissolved acrylate concentrations in axenic algal cultures and evaluate how these concentrations change in response to nutrient or light stress and growth stage; and (3) to determine dissolved and particulate acrylate concentrations, photolysis rates, and biological loss rates in contrasting oceanic water through participation in two Gulf of Mexico research cruises.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Results from this study are expected to significantly improve our fundamental understanding of the marine acrylate cycle and its impact on the biogeochemistry of the upper oceans. The project will establish and foster research and educational collaborations for these students, especially the graduate students, through several avenues including participation at national and local meetings, mentoring, preparing for and delivering college-level lectures, and presentations made to the general public at forums such as Syracuse?s Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science.   Two graduate students and a visiting Chinese scholar will be trained as part of this project, along with several undergraduates.  Finally, the PI will participate in several activities to promote and foster education including serving as an NSF STEM mentor, co-coordinating Chemistry Day at the NY State Fair, giving oral presentations at local K-12 schools, and mentoring SUNY ESF Environmental Science and Chemistry students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A wide range of algae in the oceans contain copious quantities of the compound dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP).  The DMSP-containing algae include nearly all harmful algal bloom (HAB) species that are responsible for massive toxic blooms that occur in coastal waters throughout the world.  Remarkably, in many of these algae,  DMSP constitutes a disproportionately large percentage  (up to 20%) of the  total carbon content.  For many algae, DMSP can be enzymatically degraded to dimethylsulfide (DMS) and acrylate. \nThe sulfur-containing compounds, DMS and DMSP, have been studied intensively for over 30 years owing to the potential importance of DMS in indirectly regulating the Earth\u00c6s climate.  Investigations into ocean-atmosphere cycling of DMS has led to a greater understanding about the marine sulfur cycle as it relates to the production of DMS and related compounds including DMSP and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).  Dimethylsulfide and DMSP concentrations can be high during marine algal blooms, and acrylate concentrations are expected to be high as well, since DMS and acrylate are produced in equal amounts from the enzymatic degradation of DMSP.  It is therefore very surprising that virtually nothing is known about the production and fate of acrylate in the marine environment.  Acrylate is a reactive compound that scientists hypothesize to be part of antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant systems.  Acrylate may also be produced by algae to provide protection against  grazing, and acrylate is a carbon source for both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.  Acrylate also degrades in seawater when exposed to sunlight.  Thus, acrylate is expected to significantly influence the chemistry and ecology in sunlit oceanic waters, but up to now there has been little supportive evidence. One key limitation has been the lack of a sensitive method to measure acrylate in seawater. \nWe developed an extremely sensitive method to measure acrylate in seawater that is from one to four orders of magnitude more sensitive compared to published techniques.
