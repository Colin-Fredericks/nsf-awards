 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Atmospheric Chemistry program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS) will support the research project of Prof. Jesse Kroll of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Prof. Kroll and his students will study the mechanisms of oxidation of organic species in the environment using an environmental chamber at MIT and a flow reactor at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). A highly innovative feature of the study is the direct and controlled formation of alkylperoxy and alkoxy radicals by the photolysis of radical precursors like alkyl iodides and alkyl nitrites . Alkylperoxy and alkoxy radicals are key intermediates that are directly relevant to the formation and evolution of atmospheric organic aerosol, processes of central importance to global climate and human health. \r\n\r\nThe project will greatly improve our understanding of the oxidation mechanisms central to a number of key environmental issues, such as the degradation of pollutants and the production of secondary species, leading to the improved prediction of their rates and environmental impacts. In particular, the insights into the chemistry underlying the formation and evolution of atmospheric organic aerosol will inform policy on aerosol-climate and aerosol-health interactions, two of the major environmental issues confronting policymakers around the world. The study will provide excellent opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students at MIT to work on a cutting edge research project in environmental chemical sciences.",
