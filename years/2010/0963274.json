The Departments of Biology and Chemistry at Southern Oregon University recently established an undergraduate research facility dedicated to study in the interdisciplinary fields of biotechnology.  This award will enhance the research and research training capabilities of the Biotechnology Research Center and develop it as a state-of-the-art facility for faculty and students to conduct cutting-edge research. The Biotechnology Research Center is a supportive environment at SOU for undergraduate students to learn to use molecular methods and to understand the application of these techniques to diverse research questions. The Center houses equipment and supplies needed for research using molecular methods, provides functional bench space, and serves as a forum for interaction between faculty and students working on diverse projects that share some methodology. This award will enable SOU to purchase and install up-to-date fixed equipment and facilitate renovations to modernize the lab space. It is an integral component of numerous student research projects and provides research training to dozens of upper-division biology and chemistry students through specific courses.  Thus, the Center is an invaluable facility in helping SOU train tomorrow's scientists.\r\n\r\nRenovating the Center will correct deficiencies in basic research and safety needs. Specifically, this project includes the upgrade and/or installation of a fume hood, DNA extraction room, microscopy space, vacuum lines with HEPA filtration, distilled water, safety shower and adequate bench space. SOU will then provide a modern, safer research environment for SOU's growing body of students interested in the fields of molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry.",
