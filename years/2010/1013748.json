 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives and approaches of this project are focused on examining fluid flow at small scales. As the idea of scaling up microfluidics systems to millifluidic counterparts gains greater scientific attention, as opposed to the significant body of work scaling down to nanofluidics, this work focuses on a simple two-dimensional approach for micro- and milli-fluidics to create three-dimensional chemical profiles using single-layer microfluidic modules. Not only can a three-dimensional pattern be created, but with simple changes in the planar configuration, the three-dimensional chemical pattern can be controlled including through the speed of the fluid and the height of the channels. Future larger-scale fluidic experiments may have limitations due to resulting non-obvious three-dimensional profiles, which are dependent on basic parameter choices.\r\n\r\nThe society benefits are that findings from this project will be transformative and result in high-risk/high-payoff by expanding possibilities in areas such as embryonic development and optofluidics. This work will also have an impact in fields from small scale chemical mixing to developing future therapies through understanding disease related biological systems as well as to researchers in engineering, microfluidics, millifluidics, cellular stimulation, mixing layers, optical imaging, and chemical fabrication approaches. The education effort is to build an education and training pipeline for preparing future leaders in engineering and science. This will be accomplished through work with kindergarten to 12th grade students as well as graduate students. These efforts will include working with Pittsburgh's Lincoln Technology Academy, which is in one of the most academically challenged neighborhoods in Pennsylvania.",
