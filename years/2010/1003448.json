 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is: 1) To develop and field test wind turbine technician training materials, simulation modules, and a supporting remote laboratory for wind turbine technology. Multimedia learning materials are to be aligned with industry standards and deliverable via the Internet to supplement and complement the current curriculum; 2) To integrate the developed materials, modules, and the remote laboratory into two-year college wind technology programs to sustain workforce development in the field of wind power, with three community colleges as evaluation sites; and 3) To disseminate the materials, modules, and the remote laboratory nationwide via the NSF/ATE National Center for Manufacturing Education, the National Engineering Technology Education Clearinghouse, and ATE TV. The proposed professional development workshops for two-year college faculty members are to provide an additional channel for dissemination.\r\nThe co-PI will identify technician programs aimed at or serving under-represented populations in the Northern Illinois area and make in-person presentations to the faculty of these programs aimed at making them aware of the potential uses of the modules.",
