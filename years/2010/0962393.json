 "awd_abstract_narration": "A scientist from Florida State University and one from the University of Hawaii will participate in the final two cruises of the CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography program to sample critical regions of the oceans of particular oceanographic significance and have not been previously sampled during this program.  The first section will be S4P in 2011 which will sample a large normally inaccessible High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region between 160\u00b0E and 110\u00b0W and involve at least three meridional sections into Antarctic coastal waters as well sampling along a zonal transect at roughly 67\u00b0S.  The second section is the reoccupation of A16S between ~3\u00b0S and 55\u00b0 S, currently scheduled for 2013 and will complete the Atlantic section.  Water samples will be collected at approximately every other station occupied by the regular CLIVAR team, sampling 12 depths to 1000m.  The samples will be analyzed on-board for dissolved iron and aluminum, nutrients, and salinity.  Additional samples will be stored, acidified, and analyzed on shore for manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  In collaboration with the U.S. GEOTRACES steering committee, seawater samples will be collected for shore-based determination of other trace elements and isotopes by other investigators.  In addition, the researchers plan to continue the daily-integrated aerosol and event-based rainfall sampling, using existing CLIVAR aerosol and rainfall sampling equipment, as well as the high-volume aerosol sampling equipment and automated rainfall collectors recently purchased for use in the U.S. GEOTRACES program.  This will allow us to provide subsamples to the U.S. and international \"aerosol community\".  The aerosol samples will be analyzed for ultrapure water soluble, seawater soluble, and total trace elements using shore-based ICP-MS.  Rain samples will be filtered (for samples greater than 200mL volume) and filtered and unfiltered subsamples will be stored frozen for shore-based major ion analyses and ICP-MS trace element analysis.\r\n\r\nAs regards broader impacts, availability of the trace metal dataset acquired as part of the CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography program will advance our knowledge of global biogeochemical cycles and will improve coupled biogeochemical models.  Results from the study would be included into class lectures.  One postdoc and one graduate student from Florida State University and two postdoc from the University of Hawaii will be supported and trained as part of this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe availability of dissolved iron (Fe) in the surface waters of the ocean plays an important role in biological processes, including completely limiting the growth of organisms in some areas.  There is also evidence to suggest that during ice-ages increases in the amount of biological production as a result of increased Fe addition to surface waters from enhanced deposition of mineral dust blown off the continents might have been partly responsible for the dramatic decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that were recorded during that period. However, our understanding of the processes that control the availability of dissolved Fe in the surface waters of the ocean is not well understood.  Our project was part of a large global survey of the oceans (CLIVAR) that is being undertaken to assess how much variation there is in the oceans over decadal time scales and thus enabled us to obtain samples for determination of both dissolved Fe and aluminium (Al) in the context of a much larger oceanographic program that produces data for many other ocean properties.  In addition to dissolved Fe we determined dissolved Al because we can use the concentrations of this element in surface waters to calculate the amount of atmospheric mineral dust that has entered the surface ocean.  This is of interest because mineral dust also contains significant amounts of Fe and thus the deposition of mineral dust is an important but largely unquantified route for adding dissolved and Fe to the remote surface waters of the ocean.  Our results from this project show that in the Antarctic region which we sampled during the CLIVAR S4P cruise (177?E to 73?W along 67?S) the amount of mineral dust deposition is extremely low, of the order of 30 to 200 mg m-2 yr-1, amongst the lowest observed in the world's ocean. \n\nWe also find that the dissolved Fe levels in the surface waters of this region are extremely low reflecting this very limited atmospheric input and explaining why this region is one in which the biological productivity is limited by the availability of Fe.  We also could see from our data that the initial values of dissolved Fe in the western most part of our work, the Ross Sea, were continuously removed from the water column along the eastward advective flow path of the Antarctic Circumpolar current.  This finding is consistent with satellite images that show the lowest standing crops of biological material in the upper waters of this region around Antarctica.\n\nIn our South Atlantic cruise (CLIVAR A16S) we determined the same parameters from 4?S to 60?S along ~30?W.   One of our major findings was that we did not find any evidence that mineral dust from the Patagonian Plateau is deposited in the surface waters of the South Atlantic to the east of South America, as has been previously suggested by many modelers.  In fact our estimates of mineral dust deposition drop dramatically at 18?S from 1000 mg m-2 yr-1 to less than 400 mg m-2 yr-1 and continue to drop throughout the S Atlantic reaching as low as 140 mg m-2 yr-1 at 40?S.  We did however find that both the surface and deep the waters south of South Georgia appear to have an additional source of dissolved Al as values rise in this basin.  We speculate that hydrothermal vents in this tectonically active region may be partially responsible for this enrichment.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher I Measures"
