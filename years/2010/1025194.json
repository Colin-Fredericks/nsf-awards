 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific Collections International is an organization devoted to the international and interdisciplinary coordination of object based scientific collections, and to increasing the scientific and societal impact of scientific collections. The organizational design and development is being guided by an international Steering Committee as an initiative of the Global Science Forum. As part of the planning and development process leading to the official launch of Scientific Collections International at the end of 2010, the Steering Committee is organizing an international workshop at the Belgian Royal Institute of Natural Sciences for 8 and 9 February 2010. The workshop will bring together representatives of collections based organizations and the users of collections in varied disciplines, including but not limited to biomedicine, earth and planetary sciences, biodiversity, physical anthropology, ethnology, and archaeology. The National Science Foundation is providing funds for a contingent of two US speakers, five US participants from a range of disciplines that rely on scientific collections, and six delegates from developing countries. This award is being co-funded by the Biological Research Collections Program, the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure.",

Collections reside in museums, zoos, herbaria, research institutes, living culture collections, and highly specialized repositories for ice cores or frozen tissue and DNA.  Scientific collections preserve the reference specimens and samples that corroborate published research findings and they provide study material for future generations.  Many fields of applied research such as agriculture and environmental protection also rely on reference collections.  \n\nScientific collections are used intensively within their respective disciplines and databases of the specimens and samples in these collections are designed to address scientific questions in that particular field.  However, the biggest research challenges often require the integration of data from different disciplines.  Global change research draws data on seasurface temperature from microfossils in deep-sea sediment cores and atmospheric chemistry from ice cores, but additional data reside in fossil plant and animal collections, ancient soil samples, anthropological specimens, and other types of collections.  Making these diverse sorts of collections more accessible to and usable by a broader range of researchers is the challenge being addressed  \"Scientific Collections International\" (SciColl; see www.scicoll.org), an initiative launched by the Global Science Forum of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nNSF provided support for a first SciColl international conference that was held at the Royal Belgian Institute for Natural Sciences in Brussels in February 2010.   This first SciColl conference was attended by 85 participants from 35 countries and a wide range of scientific disciplines.  Thanks to unanticipated discounts and contributions, remaining funds were used to support a follow-up conference held at the Melbourne Museum in Australia in February 2011, attended by 42 participants from 16 countries.\n\nThe Brussels and Melbourne conferences have produced a concrete plan of action for the first three years of SciColl's operation.  SciColl would convene workshops, working groups and symposia devoted to four large interdisciplinary research challenges, and how diverse scientific collections can contribute to their solution.  They are:\n\nGlobal      climate change and ocean acidification:  The Natural History Museum      London proposed to lead SciColl's efforts to expand the types of data used      to test models of climate change and to predict its impact.\nFood      security:  The Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed to coordinate      SciColl activities that would promote an ecosystem approach that      would bring together collections and researchers in plant breeding;      climate models; biosecurity and quarantine; sustainable farming practices;      soil types; marine pests, fisheries, aquaculture, and other fields.\nThe      causes and effects of human migration: Australia and New Zealand proposed      to create a social network for information exchange on human migration      research with the goal of assembling material on best practices for:      sharing samples and data; specimen preservation techniques; policies on      ethical research practice, access and benefit sharing; and cooperation      with researchers in arts, humanities and social sciences.  \nZoonotic      diseases and human health: The majority of human diseases involve      transmission from host animals, so biomedical research could benefit from      data derived from natural history museums, wildlife, livestock and      veterinary research collections as well as culture collections and      biomedical material.  Institute Fiocruz, Brazil proposed to organize      a SciColl conference on this topic.\n\n\nSciColl's program of work would have two important side-benefits. Engaging different resea..."
