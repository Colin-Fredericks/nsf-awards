The HIS will enable wavelength scanning from 400 to 2500 nm allowing non-destructive materials imaging in both laboratory and field settings. The HIS will be applied to understanding materials by developing spectral image libraries under laboratory and field settings. It will be instrumental in understanding and modeling seasonal changes in materials using field-based observations. In addition the HIS system will be used to ground truth satellite and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data. Applications for the HIS include crop residue modeling, water quality measurements and modeling, forest species identification and differentiation, lithography and dopant research, understanding lithography, lake core mapping and understanding urban infrastructure. The HIS is proposed for additional STEM research outside the geosciences to include dye and fabric detection and classification, wetland modeling, plant stress analysis, invasive species and wildlife monitoring and modeling, and art restoration and conservation. This effort will establish a capability serving a broad range of disciplines and departments at an undergraduate university. Impacts will span research, education, training, commercial partnerships and infrastructure. Summer workshops will provide outreach to K-12 students. Eight classes from Geography, Biology, Earth Science and Environmental Studies and the Physics Departments will be directly supported. The PI will have overall responsibility for administering the instrumentation. A 20%-time research associate will be allocated to oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance. Existing newly-renovated space will be used to house and store the instrument. The University has committed to purchase a four year extended warranty for the system. \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
