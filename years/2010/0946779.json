 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors David F. Wiemer, James B. Gloer and Lynn Teesch from the University of Iowa will acquire a high resolution gas-chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) capable of carrying out experiments with electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) sources. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) isolation and structure determination of bioactive natural products from fungi; 2) studies of manganese-mediated coupling reactions for the synthesis of natural products; 3) studies of Pd(II)- and Ni(II)-catalyzed synthesis of aminoglycosides and other biologically active carbohydrates; 4) studies of dearomatization approaches to the synthesis of carboxylic and heterocyclic natural products; and 5) characterization of synthetic terpenoid phosphonates and schweinfurthin analogues.\r\n\r\nGC-TOF-mass spectrometry is an important technique for obtaining accurate molecular weights on large molecules, with high sensitivity. Use of a GC-TOF mass spectrometer with easily exchanged ionization sources is a standard technique for the study of chemical reactions. The instrument is capable of using volatile or semi-volatile samples that can be introduced through the gas chromatograph. An autosampler will accommodate multiple sample experiments. Solid samples will be introduced either on the heated direct insertion probe or on the direct chemical ionization probe. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry, natural products and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
