 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Georgia is awarded a grant for the acquisition of an NEC NLITE 6 GHz Microwave Radio system that will handle all communication services between the UGA Marine Institute at Sapelo Island (UGAMI)  and the mainland link to telephone and Internet services.  This equipment will greatly increase research productivity and learning opportunities for resident and visiting scientists and classes. The UGA Marine Institute supports resident Research Scientists, visiting research programs with affiliated university faculty and NOAA programs, graduate and undergraduate student research, college level educational field programs, and outreach for public education in marine systems.  Established in 1953 by UGA and R.J. Reynolds, Jr., the Institute occupies over 100,000 sq. ft. of buildings, the majority of which were formerly part of a farm complex dating to the early 1930's. UGAMI has multiple labs, offices, a 150-seat auditorium, a library, and an indoor salt water wet lab facility with tanks and running seawater. UGAMI also maintains a small fleet of boats for research, and on-island housing for resident and visiting scientists, class groups, and essential staff that include 25 residential units and 2 dormitory-style buildings (45 beds).  This award will result in stable, reliable communications and data transfer for all at UGAMI, as well as the face-to-face video collaborations and seminar interactions that are particularly important for research at a remote field station such as UGAMI; a necessity in today's research environment. For further information about UGAMI, see the institute's web page at http://www.uga.edu/ugami/.",
