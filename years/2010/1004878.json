 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Angela K. Wilson and Robby A. Petros at the University of North Texas for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support eight students per summer in a ten week program.  The majority of the research projects focus on topics in computational chemistry.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the development of embedded composite methods (Wilson); (2)  the combinatorial synthesis of protein-decorated nanoparticles for potential use in targeted drug-delivery (Petros); (3)  the computational study of terminal metal carbide complexes (Cundari); (4)  the physicochemical study of salvation (Acree); (5)  the computation of electronic structure and reactivity in organometallic complexes (Borden); (6) the computation of accurate electronic potential energy surfaces to develop a better understanding of fast gas-phase reactions, like those taking place in chemical vapor deposition (Marshall); (7) the acquisition and analysis of microwave spectra of interesting small molecules (Cooke); and (8) studies of the synthesis and properties of silver nanoparticles (Omary).     In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including a quantum chemistry \"Bootcamp,\" industrial outreach trips, and instruction in technical writing and scientific ethics.  \r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in computational chemistry to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",
