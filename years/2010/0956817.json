 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to improve the quality of on-demand job matching by applying data mining and machine learning techniques to natural language descriptions of job requests, worker reviews, and transaction history. The project will enable lasting job matches by predicting the needs, preferences and constraints of workers and human resource managers. Currently available methods of job matching rely primarily on keyword search, corporate personality assessment tests, or fixed ontologies. Such systems lack comprehensive learning and therefore have difficulty matching workers with jobs. This project approaches job matching with a bias-free learning model that learns from hiring successes, trains on real-world data, and adapts to new job verticals.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project is a matching technology that optimizes workers' and employers' strengths, discovering matching opportunities overlooked by traditional search technologies. Online reputation-building through performance reviews can improve workers' ability to market themselves. The global matching technology permits nearly every skill to become marketable by matching workers with all features from every available job request. Natural language processing techniques, developed in the course of this project, have the potential to broaden the appeal of cell phone text-messaging as a comprehensive job-searching tool. Furthermore, the contextual approach to learning about workers and employers enables trends to be identified among  users, and has far-reaching commercial implications in fields as diverse as medical research and e-commerce.",

The algorithms developed under this grant serve as the foundation for PatientScope&trade;, a software that helps the healthcare industry gain in-depth understanding of the living experience of patients worldwide.\nBillions of conversations between patients take place on social networks, forums, and blogs. PatientScope aims to understand and quantify these patient experiences as they are reported - automatically, in-depth, and on the Internet scale. Capable of answering a wide range of patient-centric questions, the depth and precision of PatientScope analysis far surpass the capabilities of social listening tools used by the healthcare industry today.\nIn contrast to competing software solutions, PatientScope avoids reducing the rich, multifaceted patient experiences to shallow sentiment scores or volumetric counts of product names.

The robustness of PatientScope insights suggests that the voice of the patient stands to become the leading determinant of essential healthcare knowledge, from monitoring treatment performance and product defects to aligning pricing and sales strategy with the perceived advantages over competing medications.\nThree main technical goals were achieved during this Phase II project:\n \n\nIdentify and acquire very large sets of healthcare-related text content\nScale and adapt NLP techniques to process very noisy healthcare datasets\n\nPerform analytics that address both coarse- and fine-grained information needs\n\n\nPatientScope addresses two key needs of healthcare industry stakeholders:\nAdverse Event Detection: trained to automatically identify adverse events reported across the Internet, PatientScope reduces (and in some cases eliminates) the costly process of manually monitoring safety events across social media.

Pharmaceutical companies use PatientScope to perform targeted analysis of treatment performance (e.g., effectiveness, risk areas) and public perception (e.g., expense, accessibility), pinpointing opportunities in a transparent and cost-effective fashion, and facilitating quick, data-driven response.\nThe three advantages of using PatientScope are:\nBroader Coverage: PatientScope covers over 18,500 healthcare products, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as supplements and vitamins.\nHigher Accuracy: PatientScope removes the majority of Internet SPAM and irrelevant chatter (i.e., posts unrelated to personal healthcare experiences). Elimination of irrelevant posts ensures high quality insights, and serves as a key differentiator vis-a-vis alternative methods for monitoring patient chatter.\nDeeper Insight: Monitoring concepts - instead of words - allows PatientScope to deliver clear, differentiated data, identifying patients that are diagnosed with a disease, suffer from a symptom, or are prescribed a treatment.
