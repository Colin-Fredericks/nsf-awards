 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at developing constructive methods and algorithms for computational analysis of systems of partial algebraic difference-differential equations (PADDEs) and description of their solution sets. Such systems arise in a wide variety of problems in mathematics and its applications including mathematical physics, automatic control, dynamical systems, mechanics, molecular chemistry, and cellular biology.\r\n\r\nThe key research objectives of this project are: (1) development of the theoretical foundation and algorithms for difference-differential elimination, in particular for decomposing solution sets of systems of PADDEs into unions of \"simple\" sets; (2) extension of the constructive methods of difference-differential algebra to the computational analysis of systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with group action (this is of special interest for applications, since the solutions of fundamental systems of PDEs governing physical fields must be invariant with respect to certain group actions); (3) elaboration of methods and algorithms for computation of dimension polynomials that express Einstein's strength of a system of PADDEs. Such algorithms, in particular, will allow one to choose optimal (in the sense of A. Einstein) systems of PDEs for mathematical models of physical processes.\r\n\r\nThe main methods and approaches to be used include the characteristic set technique, which will be extended to rings of difference-differential polynomials, generalized Groebner basis method for difference-differential modules, the technique of univariate and multivariate dimension polynomials, and decomposition methods for PADDEs.\r\n\r\nDespite the over sixty-year history of algorithmic approaches in differential and difference algebra, initiated by J. Ritt, E. Kolchin, R. Cohn and recently expanded by M. Bronstein, X. Gao, P. Hendrics, and M. Singer, among many others, there are no computational methods efficient enough to allow one to determine structures of solution sets of systems of algebraic difference-differential equations in many cases of interest. The proposed activity will result in the improvement of the existing algorithmic methods for PADDEs and more general systems of partial differential equations with group action, development of the constructive theory of difference and difference-differential ideals and, as a consequence, creation of new computational techniques for analysis of partial difference and difference-differential equations and their solution sets.\r\n\r\nThe research will develop algorithms and computational techniques that will be of use to analysts, physicists, engineers, and scientists in many other fields where the theoretical description of processes involves algebraic differential, difference, or difference-differential equations. The resulting algorithms will be the basis of code appearing in symbolic computation computer packages used in education and research in mathematical physics, automatic control, mechanics, biology, and in many other areas as well.  The educational component of the project also includes an interdisciplinary   program that will involve mathematics, computer science, physics, and engineering majors in training and research with the active use of computer algebra methods.",
