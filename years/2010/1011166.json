The program is educating graduate students for careers in emerging fields that demand a new type of workforce with solid and in-depth background in applied and computational mathematics, as well as effective business and communication skills. This program uses graduate faculty with demonstrated records to educate students in both the classroom and the workplace.  This faculty has created a carefully designed and extremely thorough curriculum that includes 9-credits in each the topics of (1) data analysis, (2) mathematical modeling, and (3) business and communication skills.  As part of the program students also complete a 3-credit internship.  The core courses are broken into 1-credit modules, which are easy to be upgraded or replaced and include \"real world\" case studies. The research and internship experiences provide students opportunity to analyze and solve \"real world\" problems. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the program includes (1) increasing the participation of female students and students from under-represented minorities in graduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines and (2) preparing graduate students for careers in business, industry, non-profit organizations, and government agencies with a strong foundation in applied and computational mathematics, as well as business and communication skills, to succeed in those careers that demand a broadly inclusive, well-trained science and engineering workforce.",
