 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will investigate a novel mechanism by which cold-adapted fishes of the Southern Ocean sense and respond to elevated temperatures. It is hypothesized that sub-lethal heat stress may induce cell cycle arrest and/or programmed cell death through apoptosis. The study will use genome-enabled technologies to examine the environmental control over gene expression in Antarctic species and will build direct mechanistic links between the expression of a specific signaling pathway gene and heat-induced changes in cells. Prior results support the hypothesis that heat stress results in cell cycle arrest and, in some cases, programmed cell death in Antarctic fishes. If so, this represents a novel, modified version of the well-conserved cellular stress response found in essentially all other species and suggests that warming ocean temperatures may have profound cellular and physiological impacts on these extremely stenothermal species.  The P.I. conducts outreach activities with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, will be involved in developing a science curriculum for the Native American Youth and Family Center (NAYA) Early College Academy in Portland, and supports the educational and professional development of both undergraduate and graduate students at Portland State University.",

These fish are among the most temperature-sensitive species on Earth and therefore are signal species for understanding the impacts of climate change. The research conducted under this award demonstrated that exposure to temperatures as small 2-4 degrees above normal averages for the local habitat can cause cell death and reproductive anomalies. It also demonstrated that there has been a rapid shift in fish species composition at our sampling site, which coincided with the maturation of an industrial fishery for the Antarctic toothfish &ndash; a key predator in the region. We hypothesize that the removal of this top predator has had a cascading effect on the smaller fish species, which make up an important part of the diets of penguins and seals. To date, the project has produced two published papers and three papers in review, with more in preparation. The award supported the PhD dissertations of two graduate students and the Master&rsquo;s thesis of a third. Seven undergraduate scholars gained hands-on research experience in the PI&rsquo;s laboratory, helping to process and analyze samples. While in Antarctica the PI taught a course in the Natural History of Antarctica, with real-time lectures via the internet (Skype) to undergraduates at Portland State University. The project was also strongly focused on outreach activities. During the course of the field seasons, members of the team presented K-12 educational outreach over the web, interacting with third graders at Place Bridge Academy, a K-8 magnet elementary school in Denver, Colorado, fifth graders at City View Charter School in Hillsboro, Oregon, and to Rieke Elementary School, a K-5 school in the Portland Public School District. Upon return to PSU, the PI invited a group of high school STEM students to PSU for a presentation on Antarctic fishes and global climate change.
