 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the fundamental issue of dynamic bandwidth provisioning services is investigated. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the theoretical aspects of multi-domain routing and to develop novel techniques that will substantially improve the performance of multi-domain networks. The proposed solutions will assist in the successful deployment of computer services across multi-domain networks. In particular, this project will develop novel algorithms for QoS-guaranteed routing. The goal is to evaluate those algorithms through use of multiple kinds of GENI resources.\r\n\r\nThe obtained results will be expected to generate a strong interest in the network community at large for QoS-guaranteed routing in multi-domain networks. They will also generate significant impacts on computer network research through a better understanding of the theoretical issues of multi-domain routing for the design of future Internet architectures.",
