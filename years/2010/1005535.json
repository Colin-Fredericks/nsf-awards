 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to facilitate the development of the scientific and technical expertise in asphalt pavement engineering necessary to sustain the new energy economy of the 21st century.  Energy and environment play a significant role in the quality of life, world?s economic growth, and stability. The main goal of this workshop is that newly built or rehabilitated roads have to be sustainable, cost-effective and energy saving during construction and service. This workshop will initiate a new education effort designed to train the next generation of technical workers and researchers in the asphalt area.  The merit lies in the selection of the attendees - Group one will be selected based on the fact that they have experience in energy, environment, ecology, and sustainability research but not necessarily in asphalt pavement. Group two will be from the asphalt area. Such interaction will lead to the discovery of energy efficient, environment friendly sustainable pavements in near future.\r\n\r\nThis study may lead to world construction materials recovery and savings through the development of sustainable pavements which is of particular concern in rapidly developing countries such as China. The ideas and opinions of the researchers from two countries namely USA and China will be disseminated through the workshop Website, which will benefit a broader scientific society and engineers.",
