 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop formal verification tools\r\nfor human-computer interfaces to cyber-physical systems. The approach\r\nis incorporating realistic assumptions about the behavior of humans into\r\nthe verification process through mathematically constructed \"mistake\r\nmodels\" for common types of mistakes committed by the operator during\r\nan interactive task. Exhaustive verification techniques are used to\r\nexpose combinations of human mistakes that can lead to system-wide\r\nfailures.  The techniques are evaluated using case studies involving\r\nmedical device interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of verifying human-machine interfaces requires new\r\napproaches that combine rigorous formal verification techniques with\r\nthe empirical human-centered approach to user-interface evaluation.\r\nThe research addresses challenges of integrating empirical user-study\r\ndata into formal game-based models that describe common types of \r\noperator mistakes. Using these models to detect subtle\r\nflaws in user-interface design is also a challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that a poorly designed interface will enable harmful\r\noperator errors, which remain a major cause of failures in a wide\r\nvariety of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.  This project will\r\nautomate user-interface verification by detecting likely defects,\r\nearly in the design process. Open source verification tools will be\r\nmade freely available to the community at large.  The ongoing research\r\nwill be integrated into a set of graduate-level computer science\r\ncourses focused on the theme of \"Safety in Human Computer Interfaces\".\r\nResults from the project will also be integrated into educational\r\nmaterials for the ongoing eCSite GK12 project with the goal of\r\npromoting awareness of user-interface design issues amongst high\r\nschool students.",
