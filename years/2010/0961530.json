 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides start up funding for the establishment of a Research Data Center in the Atlanta Metro area.  Research Data Centers provide academic researchers with secure access for research that uses confidential data from the Census Bureau.  \r\n\r\nThe new RDC is housed in a secure site at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and is sponsored by a consortium of institutions including Georgia State University, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the University of Georgia.  The Centers for Disease Control will also contribute to the funding and management of the RDC.  The center will be open to researchers from anywhere in the United States; the location makes this RDC especially attractive to researchers in a large multi-state area. This Research Data Center will join a national network of Census RDCs.  Each is operated by a hosting academic institution and each provides secure access for qualified researchers.\r\n\r\nA large and broad community of researchers will use this RDC, including researchers in Economics, Public Health, Sociology, Management, Demography, and Geography.  The projects undertaken by these researchers will provide a variety of broader impact, including improvements in the Census Bureau's data programs and assistance to the CDC as it considers whether or not to adopt the sample frame of the Census Bureau's confidential American Community Survey for the National Immunization Survey.",
