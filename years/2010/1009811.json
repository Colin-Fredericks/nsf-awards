 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to perform detailed modeling of the secondary anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum caused by the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect.   The work will involve both analytic and numerical techniques to investigate in detail how the information contained in the shape of the thermal SZ power spectrum can be used to shed light on the intra-cluster medium, especially in clusters of galaxies at high redshifts and of low masses.  The results of this project will be incorporated into an emulation tool that will aid cosmological parameter estimation from observations of the SZ power spectrum. This tool will be made publicly available. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to museums and planetariums.  Products of the simulations will be made public for use in research and classroom settings.",
