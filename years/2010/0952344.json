 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fish have a remarkable ability to detect the strike of a predator by sensing water flow with receptors within the skin. The major aim of this research project is to understand the mechanics of this sensory system, known as the lateral line, in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio). This will be achieved by using a novel combination of mathematical modeling, behavioral experiments, and flow visualization techniques developed for aeronautical engineering. These approaches will consider how the shape of the body and the direction of a stimulus influence the ability of a fish to evade a predator. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance understanding in two major areas. First, this work will establish the mechanics of a sensory system that is critical to the ecology of a broad diversity of aquatic animals. Second, this work will define relationships between mechanosensory inputs and behavioral outputs in a major model system for neuroscience. This will inform our understanding of how vertebrate behavior is affected by the integration of mechanosensory information. \r\n\r\nThis research project will also involve outreach and education. The investigators propose a novel K-12 educational program in collaboration with local schools and the U.C. Irvine Department of Education. The PI and his students will also participate in a number of outreach programs at U.C. Irvine that are designed to enhance involvement of minority researchers and education to underserved local schools.",
