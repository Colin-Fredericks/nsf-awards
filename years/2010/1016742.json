 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although theoretical results predict that significant gains can be\r\nachieved from node cooperation, current wireless systems are exclusively\r\nbuilt on point-to-point communication, where transmissions are separated\r\nin time, frequency, or space. Before cooperative techniques can be\r\nimplemented, two key questions need to be addressed: How do they perform\r\nin the context of a larger network, and how do they perform in actual\r\nexperiments?\r\n\r\nThis project aims at providing answers to both these questions by\r\ncombining theory and experimental work. On the theory side, the\r\ninvestigators use a rigorous analytic approach that combines tools from\r\nstochastic geometry and information theory. The stochastic geometry\r\napproach permits statements about ensembles of networks, rather than\r\njust a single fixed network geometry, which is often more tractable and\r\nleads to more general results. On the experimental side, performance\r\nmeasurements are taken on small cooperative networks of software\r\nradio devices. They are used to derive analytical models that can be\r\nused at higher layers in the protocol stack and to determine the overhead\r\nand control traffic required to set up the cooperation.\r\n\r\nBased on the insight gained from both theory and experiments, novel\r\ncooperative protocols for wireless networks are derived.\r\nIt is expected that the project will enable significant improvements in the\r\nperformance of wireless systems, thereby helping to overcome the\r\nspectrum scarcity. The results are be disseminated in form of conference\r\nand journal articles, tutorials, and short courses, and some ideas will\r\nhopefully lead to patents.",

To come to that conclusion, novel analytical techniques were developed, mostly based on stochastic geometry, in combination with information and queueing theory. In terms of network modeling, new point process models were proposed for the node locations, since in cooperative networks, independence between concurrent transmitters, as implied by the ubiquitous Poisson point process model, no longer holds.
