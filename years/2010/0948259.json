 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Frank J. Black has been granted the NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at Princeton University. The research will contribute to the understanding of how the amount and forms of trace metals (Mo and V) in soils and leaf litter influence the activity of free living nitrogen fixing bacteria, and how these bacteria tailor their strategies for metal acquisition to adapt to different soil environments.  The research to be conducted aims to understand (1) what forms of vanadium and molybdenum are found in soils and leaf litter where nitrogen fixation occurs, (2) how available these different forms are to nitrogen fixing bacteria, and (3) which mechanisms developed by bacteria to acquire these metals are more effective under different soil conditions.  Bacteria have developed various approaches to acquiring iron in soils even from normally unavailable forms, and this research will test how effective bacteria are at acquiring molybdenum and vanadium under similar conditions.  \r\n\r\nPlant growth and CO2 utilization in many ecosystems is limited by the availability of the nutrient nitrogen.  Some soil bacteria are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and make it bioavailable, but in order to do so they require a combination of the metals molybdenum, vanadium, and iron.  These metals are often in short supply in soils (e.g., molybdenum), or are bound in forms not readily accessible to bacteria (e.g., iron).  The low availability of these metals in soil environments is a potentially important control on nitrogen fixation, and in turn on the productivity of entire ecosystems. Teaching and educational outreach activities associated with the project will include helping to design and teach the laboratory section of a freshman seminar course using inquiry based techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlant growth, photosynthesis, and CO2 utilization in many ecosystems are limited by the availability of the nutrient nitrogen.  Some soil bacteria are able to fix nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and make it bioavailable, but in order to do so they require a combination of the metals molybdenum, vanadium, and iron.  These metals are often in short supply in soils, or are bound in forms not readily accessible to bacteria.  The low availability of these metals in soil environments is a potentially important control on nitrogen fixation, and in turn on the productivity of entire ecosystems. \n\nSummary of Results and Major Findings of this Research\n\nNitrogen fixation rates by free living bacteria have been shown to be highest in the surface layers of soils.  This is where we found the lowest concentrations of the required metals molybdenum, vanadium, and iron, suggesting it may be difficult for these bacteria to acquire enough of these metals to fulfill their growth requirements.\n\nConcentrations of vanadium in bulk soils were highly correlated with those of both iron and aluminum, suggesting that there may be similarities in the cycling of these metals in soils.  However, on the micro scale, vanadium was only correlated with iron.\n\nOur analysis showed that the vanadium exists in a number of different forms in soils, and can be found bound to a number of different compounds.  Some of these forms are likely only stable for relatively short periods of time.  This diversity of vanadium of forms may be good for microbes that need it to grow since some of these are likely more bioavailable than others. \n\nNot all vanadium in soils is bioavailable and easy for bacteria to take up and use.  In some soils where the total concentration of vanadium was quite high, only a very small fraction of this vanadium was easily exchangeable and likely bioavailable.  This is in contrast to other soils that had much lower total concentrations of vanadium, but most of this vanadium appeared to be in forms that would be easy for bacteria to acquire.  So high total concentrations of V do not indicate an abundance of bioavailable V.\n\nSoil bacteria that need to acquire vanadium, molybdenum, and iron in soils have developed ways to help them acquire these metals.  One method involves the production and excretion of organic compounds that are able to bind these metals and make them easier to acquire.  We found that the effectiveness of these different compounds is influenced by the chemistry of the soils, such as soil pH.  Some of these compounds were found to be good at mobilizing molybdenum at high pH, while others are good at mobilizing iron at low pH.  This information helps explain why the bacteria produce multiple compounds for this purpose, and helps us better understand the role of each of these individual compounds.\n\nWe also found that the different compounds excreted by soil bacteria to mobilize metals and make them more bioavailable work in different ways.  Some of these compounds mobilize the metals indirectly by dissolving the minerals the metals are bound to.  However, others bind directly to the metal of interest and help detach it from the mineral surface\n\nSummary of Broader Impacts\n\nI assisted a science teacher at a middle school in inner city Trenton, NJ, that serves predominantly African American student.  Together we designed and taught new geoscience related lessons.\n\nI developed new curriculum based around the biogeochemical cycling of mercury in the Everglades for a freshman college seminar course, a course I co-taught each spring term.  This curriculum is still in use, and provided the model for a new May term offering this year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Frank J Black"
