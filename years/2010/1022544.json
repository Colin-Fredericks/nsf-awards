 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This award supports the development of an Arctic Oceanographic Data Discovery and Visualization System that complements those already available for the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans. The effort focuses on geological and geophysical information of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas extending south to 60\u00b0N. A significant component of the effort will be the processing, for the first time, of a  large volume of multibeam echo-soundings acquired by the USCGC 'Healy' into digital elevation models and multiple-resolution tile sets. These data will be supplemented by water column data, sub-bottom reflection profiles, deep-sea sediment drilling results and seabed sediment sampling, as well as geophysical measurements of magnetic and gravity fields. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Undergraduate students will be integral to the multibeam data processing. The data and information will be efficiently and effectively displayed and delivered via Web services for the benefit of researchers, educators, students and the general public. The established, non-proprietary Web applications, 'GeoMapApp' and 'Virtual Ocean', that are the backbone of the effort do not require expert skills, and, as a result, are appropriate tools for teaching and outreach. The project will develop 'mini-lessons' and outreach materials that exemplify the educational possibilities of 'GeoMapApp' and 'Virtual Ocean'.",
