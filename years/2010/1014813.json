This project develops new fields of 3D quantitative microscopy in two important contrast modes that bridge a gap between clinical diagnosis and medical research. In addition, the technology of 3D image processing from quantitative CT imaging for disease diagnosis is being applied to microscopy in a unique collaboration.\r\n\r\nTextbooks of cell biology depict a cell as flat with two-dimensional features. If disease diagnosis is 3D and more quantitative and sensitive to disease onset, then these textbooks will likely change to more accurately represent the cell anatomy. Teaching students on cellular structures and functions may be significantly changed due to advancements of true 3D microscopy.  Providing cytologists and molecular biologists with quantification tools will result in earlier diagnosis of lethal diseases like lung cancer and improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.",

A number of cells are examined for each patient in order to find cells with cancer identifying abnormalities.  This research builds on our previous experience in the analysis of 3D chest X-ray CT images to diagnose lung cancer by measurements on pulmonary nodules to discover robust computer methods for the new OPTM technology.\n\n \n\nThe major research outcomes are: (a) a method to partition a cell image, (b) a method for quantitative volumetric measurement that is more precise than is possible with 2D microscopy, (c) a method to measure chromatin content comparable to flow cytometric methods, and (d) development of an initial cell classification system that can identify abnormal cancer cells from normal cells.
