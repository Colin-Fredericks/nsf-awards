Based on abstracts submitted for presentation, the 12th Conference is planned for 300 technical participants, apparently because the location, costs and timing are quite attractive. \r\n\r\nThe award provides funds for travel for as many needy US academic researchers as possible?of the order of ten--given the modest travel support provided. It is likely that high air fares to Asia on US carriers will limit the funds for each individual to less than needed. Those supported would include only presenters of invited lectures and young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support. No request is made for local expenses, meeting organization costs, or for non-US participants.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This Conference will gather the most important international researchers on the vital area of properties and phase equilibria for product and process design to review progress and to uncover the next generation of problems and their potential solutions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Global state-of-the-art in this important area will be articulated and advanced. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaborations. Knowledge in some of these areas would have impact on energy production / manufacturing of fuels, and process safety and reliability.  One timely topic may deal with conditions for the formation, storage, and control of methane hydrates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This grant was for travel to the 12th International Conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design held in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China from May 16-21, 2010.  After being held in the United States in 2004 and Europe in 2007, this triennial conference returned to Asia.  There were highly desirable interactions between academic, industrial and government workers in this vital area for the design of chemical products and processes.  The meeting attracted 240 technical participants from 43 countries.  This was the broadest representation in this series of conferences initiated in 1977, indicating an expansion of interest in the people and subjects, including the location.\nFor this meeting the plenary sessions consisted of 18 invited talks and 27 selected contributions.  The poster sessions displayed 177 papers with very lively discussions.  Also two workshops were presented: DL_POLY: engineering molecular dynamics on hpc; Trends, alternatives, future; led by Ilian Todorov, CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, UK, and Quantum computation and force fields; led by Huai Sun, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. \nThe Conference produced an important collection of 46 peer-reviewed research papers in the Proceedings, published as Volume 302 of the international journal, Fluid Phase Equilibria, http://ees.elsevier.com/fpe/.  Details of the International Organizing, International Advisory, and Local Organizing Committees, as well as Sponsors are given in the Preface to the Proceedings.  In addition to the $20,000 from NSF, over $55,000 was received from industry and over $48,500 from international governmental and professional organizations.   The support by NSF evidently provided stimulus for others to fund the Meeting.\n\nThe NSF grant was used for 14 US academic researchers to travel to the conference site, including 8 invited plenary speakers and 6 young research workers (advanced graduate students), all of whom would not have been able to attend without NSF support.  The requests for the US academic participants and young researchers exceeded the NSF grant funds by 30%.  The decision was made, as in the past, to support all eligible contributors and young researchers but to limit the amounts and allocate Conference funds to cover the necessary balance. The total amounts provided were higher than for past conferences because the travel costs to China were significantly more than to Europe or North America.  All travelers used US carriers when available. No NSF funds were used for organizers of the conference.\n There was unanimous expression of significantly positive influence of the experience, especially from the young researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John P O'connell"
