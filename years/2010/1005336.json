 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of empirical likelihood methods has attracted much attention in many areas of statistics. This proposal develops new procedures to overcome the computational burden in applying these methods to inference problems in different settings such as: estimating equations, stationary sequences, high-dimensional data, Pickands dependence functions in multivariate extreme-value distributions and  copulas in risk management. A practical obstacle in using empirical likelihood methods is the computational issue due to the high dimensional data, the large size of nuisance parameters as well as dependence in the data. The investigators intend to develop new methodologies to overcome the computational problems and  extend the scope of the potential applications.\r\n\r\nThe new research results can be applied to economics, insurance, finance, risk management and other social sciences that require effective tools for exploring nonlinear dependence among multivariate series and to increase the complexity of the models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLikelihood approaches play a significant role  in statistical inference. As a nonparametric likelihood method, empirical likelihood method has shown to be very effective in quantifying uncertainty and testing hypotheses.  Although empirical likelihood method has been applied to many fields such as regression models, biased sampling, censored data, time series and high dimensional data,  it has a difficulty in dealing with nonlinear functionals. In this case a so-called jackknife empirical likelihood method is proposed recently.  This project  develops efficient empirical likelihood method and jackknife empirical likelihood method for i) reducing computation in estimating equations with nuisance parameters; ii) interval estimation of linear time series models without distinguishing whether the sequence is stationary or near integrated;iii) constructing intervals for copula and tail copula either nonparametrically or parametrically; v) testing  high dimensional mean and covariance with the asymptotic limit independent of dimension; vi) testing whether underlying distribution follows from a particular parametric family without any ad hoc method to obtain critical values.  These new methods are easy to implement, and empirical study shows that they are  powerful too.  The investigated subjects are important in modeling financial data and analyzing risks, for example, estimating equation is the common modeling technique in econometrics, copula and tail copulas are the standard tool in modeling dependence and tail dependence in risk management.  This project results in 20 journal publications in statistics and econometrics.  This project not only supports the PI to present results in conferences and seminars, but also support a student to attend  conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/19/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Liang Peng"
