 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis project involves the renovation of the Drexel University Microfabrication Facility (MFF).   Parts of the facility will be renovated to the standards of Class 100 and Class 1000 clean rooms.  While the MFF houses a number of micro-fabrication and nano-fabrication instruments acquired through recent Major Research Instrumentation awards and other sources, the existing MFF is a low-dust environment rather than a true cleanroom and this limits the types of research that can be done there.\r\n\r\nThe renovated facility will be used for research in the areas of micro- and nanofluidics, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems and Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems, bioreactors, tissue engineering, biomechanics and biophysics, biosensors, lab-on-a-chip technology, surgical engineering, neuroengineering, optoelectronics, solar cells and alternative energy, colloidal suspension dynamics, and novel nanoelectronic devices, all of which require micro- and nanofabrication.\r\n\r\nThe facility provides research infrastructure. The facility will be used by researchers from both Drexel and the wider Philadelphia region.  The project will support the research of a number of young faculty members from several different engineering departments.  The users of the renovated facility will include undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral research associates.  The MFF will be also be used in  a number of outreach programs, including training and mentoring K-12 teachers and students from the Delaware Valley region.",

The renovated Microfabrication Facility will have impact on Drexel\u00c6s education and outreach programs as well.  Lab classes of several existing courses will be held in the renovated cleanroom facility allowing students to have hands-on experience with diverse microfabrication techniques.  The renovated Microfabrication Facility will also benefit Drexel\u00c6s diverse outreach programs such as NSF-supported Research Experience for Teachers (RET), Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and NSF GK-12.  The proposed infrastructure improvements to the MFF will permit faculty to offer more hands-on practical instruction in microfabrication. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hongseok Noh"
