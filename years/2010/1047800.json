 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin is awarded a grant for a workshop entitled \"Cyberinfrastructure and the Dimensions in Biodiversity - Planning for Success,\" that will gather community input to define a vision, technical requirements, procedures, and approaches for the development of cyberinfrastructure (CI) supporting integrative research in biodiversity sciences.  The workshop will convene an interdisciplinary group of scientists with CI expertise representing biology (including genetics, genomics and metagenomics, taxonomy and systematics, ecology), earth sciences, informatics, computer science, along with government agency and non-governmental organization representatives.  The focus will be on identifying the requirements for software, middleware (as well as underlying standards and frameworks), computational capability, and other CI that will be needed or leveraged to support data-intensive research in an interoperable and integrated information environment.  The outcomes of the workshop are intended to provide a set of community derived recommendations and lead to development of further strategy with an ultimate goal of providing improved support, usability, and sustainability of CI resources in biodiversity research community; one that is nimble, adaptable, and responsive to inevitable changes in the research and IT landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe issues to be covered in this workshop address a broad cross-section of research in biological diversity.  The discussion of CI in this context also has potential applicability to other data intensive science. Ultimately, the use of biodiversity information made available through an interoperable and integrated information infrastructure is likely to achieve broader applicability, use, and re-use.",

Workshop participants represented a broad spectrum of discip-lines, ranging from cyberinfrastructure, informatics, and computer science to biodiversity, biology, and environmental science, and provided excellent insights into the major cyberinfrastructure needs of biodiversity science.\n \nFor CI developments in general the importance was emphasized to strike a balance between satisfying specific needs of DoB projects and leveraging of existing developments in the larger biodiversity informatics community.

A coordinated effort with input from DoB projects can improve design and coding quality leading to broader applicability of fewer and better tools. Standards and best practices need to be agreed upon in a community process that ensures participant buy-in. \nLeveraging existing initiatives (DataNet, iPlant, etc). \nSustainable data and tools repository that provides state of the art curation approaches making data and tools discoverable, easy to access, integrate and use. \nRepeatability of analyses will require publication and extensive documentation of data and analytical procedures, preferably in a standardized approach that allows repeating of analyses by others. \nAccess to advanced computational cycles; although the computing power is available it is currently not easily accessible for most scientists and standardized procedures need to be developed which should make the underlying hardware transparent to the user. \nWorkforce training is needed on several levels (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) for scientists to know what tools are available, use them effectively and communicate requirements to software developers. \nCI sustainability needs to be achieved in two areas.

As this issue influences several others mentioned, it is also the most important one. Several examples of more successful organizations are for example the US-LTER program, UNIDATA, NCBI, ESIP, EOL.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/201..."
