 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a comprehensive observational and analytical program to examine the dynamics and source waters of the relaxation flows in a coastal upwelling system on the central California coast. Autonomous vehicles, high-frequency radars, moorings, and drifters, will be used to acquire pressure, density, and velocity data relevant to the relaxation flows. The data will be used to determine spatial scales of the flows, cross-shore density structure, cross-shore and alongshore velocity fields, pressure gradients, and the region of contact with the sea floor.  Aspects of the research include:  1) to evaluate the roles of barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradient forcing, 2) to identify regions where ageostrophic flows dominate the cross-shore and alongshore momentum balances, 3) to determine source waters for the relaxation flows, and 4) to examine the inner shelf circulation response to wind relaxations over an extensive coastal region (the northern part of the Southern California Bight) by analyzing extensive regional data sets collected over many years.\r\n\r\nWind relaxations are common features of coastal upwelling systems worldwide, and have impacts on  alongshore and cross-shore transport of water-borne materials such as larvae, nutrients, terrestrial runoff, and buoyant pollutants like oil. This study will clarify the role of relaxation flows in the recruitment of intertidal and sub-tidal organisms by revealing details of the near-shore flow structure. The observational plan advances capabilities of state-of-the-art autonomous and Lagrangian platforms and sensors. \r\n\r\nA post-doc and undergraduate students will be trained. Opportunities will be created for marine ecology graduate students to conduct field experiments focused on the ecological consequences of relaxation flows.  This research will build on, and leverage, existing regional ocean observing infrastructure and it will increase the capacity for oceanographic studies at two universities.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>This project examined how changing winds along the California coast generate ocean currents that flow along the coastline. Typically winds blow strongly southward along California&rsquo;s coast to produce currents that also flow southward. These currents form the California Current System and are part of a large, clockwise circulation pattern in the North Pacific Ocean. Similar currents flowing toward the equator along the eastern sides of ocean basins occur in the South Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Together they are called eastern boundary current systems.</p>\n<p>Most studies of ocean circulation along the California coast have focused on times when southward winds prevail because these cause deep waters to rise to the surface near shore in a process called upwelling. Upwelling is very important because it supplies nutrients to surface waters which in turn support highly productive ecosystems. These ecosystems benefit society by supporting productive fisheries. Similar productive fisheries are found in the other eastern boundary current systems.</p>\n<p>But southward winds and upwelling are not the entire story of ecosystems along the California coast. In this project we focused on times when winds weaken and cause currents near shore to reverse and flow northward, or poleward. In contrast to upwelling conditions that bring cooler waters, these poleward-flowing currents bring warmer waters to nearshore areas. The warm waters accumulate behind coastal headlands such as the one formed by Point Conception and Point Arguello in southern California. After winds relax these waters flow around the headland and move poleward. The Pt. Conception-Pt. Arguello headland is particularly large so the poleward flows are very strong here. Similar poleward flows occur in the North Atlantic along the coast of Portugal where the warm waters originate in the Gulf of Cadiz.</p>\n<p>These reversed currents are important because they transport many small marine animals and their larvae northward along the coast. As they travel, many of these animals find suitable habitats on shallow reefs or closer to shore in tide pools and estuaries. They remain behind after southward winds and currents return. In this way reversed coastal currents bring southern species northward along the California coast to support the diversity of coastal marine ecosystems found here.</p>\n<p>A goal of our project was to measure the size of these flows, to learn how they propagate, and to determine the flow patterns they produce. An interesting feature of these flows occurs near shore. On the inner part of the poleward currents, there is often well-defined front end or &ldquo;nose&rdquo; that moves along the coast at about a walking pace, typically 10 to 30 kilometers (6-19 miles) per day. This is unlike most ocean currents that are continuous with no clearly defined front end. On a human scale the poleward currents are large. They extend offshore up to 30 kilometers offshore (18 miles) and can be hundreds of kilometers long as they move northward along the California coast.</p>\n<p>In the nose regions of these currents, seawater flows toward coastline in wide curving arcs. The seawater in the currents brought to the coastline is noticeably warmer than the waters they displace, up to 4 &deg;C (7 &deg;F). If you were swimming in the ocean, say off a beach on the central California coast, during the arrival of one of these flows would notice such a large temperature increase. You might also notice yourself being gently pushed toward the shore.</p>\n<p>The large headland formed by Points Conception and Arguello that was the center of our study area is shown in Figure 1. The headland shifts the orientation of the coastline from roughly north-south to east-west. When upwelling winds prevail, warm water is found to the east and south of Pt. Conception in an area called the Southern California Bight. Figure 2 shows the pattern of surface currents during 5-9 June 2012 (black arrows) when strong, upwelling winds were blowing toward the southeast along the coast (red arrows). This is a typical summertime current pattern in the region. Water temperatures were cold along the coast north of Pt. Arguello, about 10 &deg;C (50 &deg;F). Figure 3 shows currents a few days later when winds relaxed during 10-11 June.&nbsp; Current patterns shifted dramatically. Southward currents near Pt. Conception and Pt. Arguello now turned westward and northward as they flowed up the central California coast. The surface current patterns of Figures 2 and 3 were observed using a network of oceanographic radars (small yellow triangles). We observed many such changes in current patterns during our study.</p>\n<p>We also studied the pattern of changing atmospheric conditions that give rise to wind relaxations. To do this we used winds measured from NOAA meteorological buoys and from satellites. The wind relaxations observed in our study area are part of a very large atmospheric pattern that evolves over about a 10-day period along the west coast of the U.S.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/28/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Libe&nbsp;Washburn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1031893/1031893_10035582_1480352653146_Fig_1_site_map_no_bathy.eps--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1031893/1031893_10035582_1480352653146_Fig_1_site_map_no_bathy.eps--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
