 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will utilize active- and passive source seismic techniques, using short period and broad band OBSs, respectively, in the Mariana forearc, trench, and outer rise, in order to image the distribution of upper mantle serpentinization. This study will address a central question regarding the importance of serpentinite for understanding subduction zones. The research will quantify the flux of water subducted by upper-mantle serpentinite, and explore the relationships between serpentinization and seismicity in the outer forearc and outer  rise. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This study has much relevance to arc magnatism and will help quantify the hydration state of the earth's mantle, thus addressing a primary goal of the Subduction Factory initiative of the MARGINS program. The project provides educational support for several graduate and undergraduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n     This project employed marine seismic imaging techniques to place constraints on the water cycle at the Mariana subduction zone.   The amount of water returned to the earth's mantle at subduction zones is largely unconstrained due to uncertainties in the degree of mantle hydration, which usually occurs in the form of serpentinization of mantle peridotite.    Evidence for widespread hydration, in the form of faulting allowing water to penetrate the incoming plate and lower uppermost mantle seismic velocities, has been found at several other subduction zones, but a comprehensive study employing both active and passive marine seismic imaging methods has not been attempted.  \n\n     We deployed 20 broadband ocean bottom seismographs (OBS) and 65 short period seismographs and hydrophones to carry out the imaging as well as detect small microearthquakes.  In addition, the R/V Langseth airgun source was used to shoot to the OBSs.  Results from Rayleigh wave tomography using ambient noise and earthquake waves reveals extremely low upper mantle shear velocities extending to depths of 25-30 km in the incoming plate, beginning about 80 km seaward of the trench axis.   Anisotropy analysis show very strong azimuthal anisotropy just seaward of the trench, with fast axes oriented trench parallel.  We intrpret these low velocities and anisotropy as the result of serpentinized mantle, as well as the effect of water filled faults and cracks.   Very low shear velocities are also found in the mantle forearc beneath the serpentine mud volcanoes, which we also interpret as serpentinized mantle.  \n\n  The ocean bottom seismographs recorded a large number of small and moderate sized earthquakes associated with the bending of the incoming plate.   The earthquakes begin 80-100 km seaward of the trench axis and increase in intensity approaching the trench.   The maximum depth of extensional earthquakes in the incoming plate is 25-30 km below the seafloor, consistent with the depth extent of the slow velocity anomaly determined by the Rayleigh wave tomography.  Taken together, these studies show that the depth extent of hydration of the incoming plate and the total amount of water subducted at the Mariana trench is greater than previously estimated.   If this result is typical for other subduction zones, estimates of the amount of water entering the earth's mantle at subduction zones must be revised upward.   One uncertainty is the amount of water contained in water-filled cracks as opposed to water in the form of serpentine minerals.   Water in cracks will be more easily expelled at shallower depths, whereas water will remain in the hydrous minerals until the slab temperature exceed the stability field of serpentine. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas A Wiens"
