Palmer (Indiana University)\r\nSenior Scientist: Tracey A. Ruhlman (University of Texas at Austin)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant cells contain genomes in three distinct compartments, the mitochondrion, nucleus and plastid.  The mitochondrial and plastid genomes originated by incorporation of an earlier bacterial cell into another. Over time, thousands of genes transferred among these genomes and now there is extensive communication among the compartments.  This interaction has resulted in considerable conservation and stability of the genomes across the evolutionary tree of plants. The flowering plant family Geraniaceae, which includes Geranium and other common plants, represents a novel exception to this high level of conservation because both mitochondrial and plastid genomes have experienced remarkably accelerated rates of change in both gene content and order and rates of nucleotide substitutions. The cause of these accelerated rates is unknown, but may be directed by genes encoded in the nucleus. This project investigates the basis for this accelerated evolution with the aim of understanding how genomes within a single cell can influence one another and co-evolve over time. The project will sequence the DNA in mitochondrial genomes and will sequence the genes expressed in the nucleus and mitochondria of 16 members of the Geraniaceae and two related families. These data will be compared to plastid data for the same species to elucidate the mechanisms of inter-compartmental crosstalk and co-evolution in plant cells. The goals of this project are to determine the extent of genomic upheaval in the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of the Geraniaceae and to identify the correlated changes in the nuclear genome that have driven this instability. The results are expected to improve significantly our understanding of the mechanisms of how genes are exchanged across different compartments within all plant cells.  \r\n\r\nThe topic of genome evolution within cells is ideal for teaching students about how genomes evolved, interact and contribute to plant growth and development. The project will work with high school science students by offering summer research internships at each institution. For teacher training, workshops will be offered each year and specific teacher training modules will be developed in cooperation with public service groups, such as the Texas Natural Science Center and the Wonderlab Museum of Science in Bloomington, IN. The genomic resources generated by this project will be important for further genetic work with this horticulturally valuable plant family, which is estimated to generate $4 billion in sales annually on a worldwide basis.  Ultimately, identifying the sources of rapid evolution in the Geraniaceae could provide genomic tools for understanding and potentially manipulating organelle genomes in other crop plants. These resources will be made available to the scientific community and the public through the creation of a project website (accessible via http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/ib/faculty/jansen.htm) and by depositing the data in long-term sequence databases at GenBank.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Geraniaceae has a major commercial impact with an estimated worldwide market of approximately $4 billion annually.  The most important genus, Pelargonium (commonly referred to as geranium), is widely used in the horticultural, cosmetics and herbal-medicine industries.  The Geraniaceae is also an excellent non-model plant group because it displays a number of deviations from the normal rules that govern evolution of genomes.  Using next generation sequencing this project performed comparative bioinformatic analyses of the three plant genomes in the mitochondrion, nucleus and chloroplast (plastid) to better understand the patterns and causes of highly accelerated rates of change in these genomes.  The overarching goal of the project was to improve our understanding of the coordinated changes essential for plant development and growth across these three genomes.\n\nThe project generated a large data set of organelle (mitochondrion and plastid) genome sequences for 110 species of Geraniaceae and close relatives and 27 nuclear transcriptomes.  These data are publicly available and form a valuable genomic resource for other scientists.  The project also resulted in 35 papers that are published, in press or in review.  Notable findings in these publications include the detection of a strong correlation in evolutionary rates of nuclear encoded sigma factor genes and plastid encoded RNA polymerase subunits suggesting a plausible explanation for plastid genome incompatibility.  Correlation between nonsynonymous substitution rates of plastid targeted DNA replication, repair and recombination (DNA-RRR) genes and plastid genome (plastome) complexity supports the hypothesis that aberrant patterns in angiosperm plastome evolution could be caused by dysfunction in DNA-RRR systems.  Such findings demonstrate the corordinated evolution of the nuclear and plastid genomes.  Additonal, findings revealed that there has been rampant horizontal gene transfer into mitochondrial genomes of two genera of Geraniaceae, Geranium and Monsonia, from a diverse assemblage of eudicots including many transfers from parasitic plants and showed that the presence or absence of the plastome inverted repeat does not affect the stability of this genome.  \n\nThe project had considerable training and outreach activities.  Four PhD students worked on the project and were trained in bioinformatics, genomics and molecular evolution.  Three of these students have completed their doctoral degrees and have moved on to postdoctoral positions.  Four postdoctoral fellows were also trained as part of the project.  Many undergraduates were provided a research experience.  At the University of Texas at Austin PI Jansen and co-PI Ruhlman developed an undergraduate research stream in genome evolution as part of the Freshman Research Initiative in the College of Natural Sciences.   Co-PI Mower participated in the Sunday with a Scientist program at the University of Nebraska State Museum.  The labs at both the University of Texas and Nebraska hosted local high students for research internships.  This included a two-week summer camp in molecular biology and genomics for students from three high schools held on the UT-Austin campus.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert K Jansen"
