 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the Web is playing a more and more important role in our lives,\r\nit has become criminals' preferred targets. \r\nWeb-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security \r\nconcerns. We believe that the root cause of many of these attacks\r\nis the Web's current access control models: they are\r\nfundamentally inadequate to satisfy the protection needs of today's web.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to re-design the access control models\r\nfor the Web to fix the security problems at the fundamental level. \r\nWe target two essential components of the Web infrastructure: browser and database. \r\nWe have designed a generic access control model for web browsers\r\nto enforce the browser-side access control needs of web\r\napplications. The model replaces the web's current Same Origin Policy (SOP) model,\r\nwhich is the culprit of many of the security problems. The success of this task \r\nwill help significantly reduce the number of security problems at the browser side.\r\nWe have also designed DAC-DB, a Discretionary \r\nAccess Control (DAC) model for database to automate the enforcement of DAC in\r\nweb applications. With this model, web application developers can be liberated \r\nfrom implementing the complicated and error-prone security enforcement logics. \r\nBoth access control models are designed based on the well-established security principles.\r\nTo help disseminate our results, we will implement our designs \r\nfor open-source web browsers and databases, and persuade the web\r\ncommunity to adopt our models. The outcome of this research will also\r\nbe converted to hands-on labs to enhance students' learning in\r\nsystem security.",
