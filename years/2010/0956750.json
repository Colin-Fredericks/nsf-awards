 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyberbullying -- harming others using technological communication methods -- is a recent addition to the arsenal of bullies, and it is predicted to increase internationally as availability of technology expands.  Researchers around the world have begun to investigate this phenomenon in order to understand its prevalence, dynamics, relationship to conventional bullying, differences among gender and ethnic groups, and characteristics of those involved in cyberbullying as bully, victim, or both. The research to date has suffered from the absence of a common definition of cyberbullying. Without a consistent definition, findings from one study cannot be compared to those of other studies. In addition, there are no standardized measures used by researchers to collect data. Finally, the lack of a 'best practice' standard for research methods in this field means that individual researchers or research groups may be approaching the problem in less productive ways.\r\n\r\nThis award will fund an international meeting of cyberbullying scholars to address three basic issues: definition, measures, and methods of conducting research on cyberbullying. The event will bring together prominent researchers from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia to collaborate and focus on these important questions. With a common definition, sound measurement practices, and established methods for future research, the field of cyberbullying will advance more quickly. A thorough understanding of the problem is a necessary foundation upon which to build effective prevention and intervention programs, and this conference will establish the groundwork for research to construct that understanding. In addition, the United States (a latecomer to bullying research) will establish itself as an important leader in this emerging field.",
