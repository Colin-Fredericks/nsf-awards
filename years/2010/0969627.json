The goal is to develop a support network for success based on national and established campus best practices.  Major components of the project are: 1) fostering success in lower-division mathematics, 2) a summer interdisciplinary team experience after the first year, and 3) career awareness activities.  \r\n\r\nMany of the additional degrees are expected to be earned by underrepresented students given that the institution is designated as Hispanic-serving.  In addition, CSUN serves a region in which a majority of college-bound students are economically disadvantaged and are the first generation to pursue a college degree.",
