 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to hold a two day workshop on health systems engineering and leadership. While a few pioneering health systems engineering (HSE) programs in academia have focused for decades on engineering delivery processes and operations, it is only in recent years that the enormous potential contributions of HSE are beginning to be widely recognized. The result has been an explosion of healthcare delivery research activities and education programs across academic units, especially those specializing in industrial, systems and related branches of engineering. Rather than each of the HSE academic programs evolving alone, it is time to create a leadership community where ideas can be shared and collaborations formed on both HSE research and HSE education. This workshop will begin this network-building by convening a select group of leaders from 25-30 of the most prominent HSE academic research and education programs in a two-day Healthcare Systems Engineering Research and Education Leadership Workshop at the University of Arkansas (U of A) in Fayetteville on May 20-21, 2010. The workshop will include breakout groups to build a vision for advancing the broad missions of HSE research and education, and what specific next steps should be pursued. \r\n\r\nIf successful this workshop will provide a definitive roadmap to a newly energized and cohesive HSE community accelerating its research contributions to improve cost, safety and effectiveness of healthcare delivery, while preparing the HSE leaders of the future to continue and extend those achievements. A formal written report and website and will also disseminate widely the collected program information submitted by attendees and add accounts of discussions on education, student viewpoints, and a continuing forum.",
