 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the published research results about immersed finite element\r\n(IFE) methods deal with 2nd order elliptic interface problems. This project \r\nplans to extend the research on developing and analyzing IFE methods for \r\ninterface problems to more sophisticated partial differential equations such \r\nas the Stokes system and the linear elasticity system which are of great \r\nimportance in many applications of engineering and sciences. The proposed \r\nresearch consists of three key modules which complement each other. The first \r\npart is to develop new IFE functions and integrate them into modern finite \r\nelement techniques for solving Stokes and linear elasticity interface problems. \r\nThe intent is to find suitable IFE functions locally in interface elements \r\nthat can handle interface jump conditions required by the interface problems \r\nand other conditions such as the inf-sup stability condition required by the \r\nfinite element formulations to be used. The proposed research will result in \r\nefficient and robust IFE methods with an emphasis on DG formulations that \r\nsimplify local h-, p-, and hp- refinements on Cartesian meshes. The second \r\nmodule is the theoretical analysis of IFEs, starting from their interpolation \r\napproximation capabilities and deriving error bounds for IFE solutions. The \r\nchallenges are that the traditional analysis techniques have a limited use \r\nhere. For example, using equivalent quotient norm in the scaling argument \r\nleads to an estimate for IFE interpolation useless for further deriving \r\nestimate of IFE solution unless it can be shown that the constants in the \r\nerror bounds are independent of the interface. Also, 2D and 3D IFE methods are \r\nessentially non-confirming methods whose error estimations are often more \r\ncomplicated. The third module is about the applications of IFE methods. In \r\naddition to improving the IFE solver for the particle-in-cell simulator, this \r\nproject will investigate the applications of IFE methods to be developed to \r\nmulti-fluid Stokes flow problems and the multi-material shape/topology \r\noptimization problems involving the linear elasticity.\r\n\r\nThe IFE methods to be developed in this project can provide new and efficient \r\nsimulation tools that can use structured/Cartesian meshes to solve challenging \r\ninterface problems involving multi-scale and multi-physics with nontrivial \r\ninterfaces in many areas of engineering and science, including flow problems, \r\nelectromagnetic problems, shape/topology optimization problems, to name just a \r\nfew. This research project will proceed in harmony with the development of IFE \r\nsoftware packages to verify and support the theory, and address complex and \r\nrealistic problems from a variety of disciplines. This strategy will enable \r\ntheoretical innovation to become practice much more quickly than traditionally \r\npossible. The proposed research projects will have a great potential to impact \r\non numerical simulations in the design/research of ion-propulsion engines for \r\ninterplanetary deep space travel, optimal packaging of electronic devices, \r\nefficient and better image reconstruction in computer tomography, non-\r\ndestructive/non-invasive detection of suspicious materials in security check, \r\ndesign of optimal shapes for lighter and stronger structures, and many other \r\napplication areas of great federal interests.",
