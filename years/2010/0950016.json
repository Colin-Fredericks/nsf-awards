 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological nitrogen fixation is the process through which organisms convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere to a form that can be used in other biological processes. Because biologically available nitrogen often limits plant growth, nitrogen fixation is a critical process that can influence ecosystem productivity, species composition, and food web interactions. The importance of nitrogen fixation has been studied in many terrestrial ecosystems, however this process has been relatively little studied in streams, which have often been thought to be limited by the availability of phosphorus rather than nitrogen. Topography, stream flow, and species composition and interactions will be examined as potential factors that limit nitrogen fixation in stream networks in the western United States; high resolution digital elevation data will be tested as a source of topographic information for these analyses. The results of this work, in combination with parallel efforts linking light and hydraulic regimes to digital topographic models, will facilitate the development of predictive maps that place the controls and consequences of biological nitrogen fixation into the physical and rapidly changing environmental context of river networks. \r\n\r\nResearch opportunities and training will be provided to science and science education undergraduate students at the lead liberal arts institution, a women's college, by combining the liberal arts learning environment with access to the philosophies and lab facilities of large research groups. The opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists will provide a diverse group of women first-hand experience in field ecology and the scientific process, encouraging many to pursue professional opportunities in science and science education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNitrogen fixation provides a direct link to the reservoir of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) gas and therefore has great potential to influence productivity, species assemblages, and food web interactions in stream ecosystems, especially in unpolluted streams with low nitrogen input from other sources.  Nitrogen-fixing organisms are capable of transforming readily available nitrogen gas into a form available for their own growth and also fuel productivity of other organisms in the ecosystem.  To date, however, nitrogen fixation has received little attention in stream networks and its role in river ecosystems and the factors that control its impact remain largely unknown.  Furthermore, controversy remains over the relative role of river-derived versus atmospheric nitrogen in driving marine primary production.  Nitrogen fixation in rivers likely enhances near shore productivity; however, improved estimates require better knowledge of how short, but intense proliferations of nitrogen-fixing species influence the amount of nitrogen, as well as how much of this nitrogen is ultimately transported from rivers to the ocean.   Our work in northern California has helped us to better understand how nitrogen-fixer community dynamics influence the input of nitrogen to river networks and the potential consequences for river-ocean-atmosphere interactions along the margins of continents. \n\n The high rates of nitrogen fixation we observed in this study suggest that this is an ecologically important process in the South Fork Eel River drainage network in northern California, where human-derived nitrogen inputs are low.  Rates of nitrogen fixation were on par with the highest published in the scientific literature from stream ecosystems and indicate that up to 85% of the nitrogen needed to support observed rates of algal production could be supported by this process.  While nitrogen fixation rates were high, they varied among nitrogen-fixing species and areal rates were lower in free-living cyanobacteria species than in nitrogen-fixing diatoms.  Overall, nitrogen fixation rates were strongly related to light, temperature, and nutrient availability, but also to the timing of spring floods.  Biomass and biovolume of nitrogen-fixers was significantly reduced in 2010 (in contrast with previous years), while free-living cyanobacteria species were more heavily represented in the algal community.  The dominance of free-living cyanobacteria in 2010 was likely related to the lack of spring floods that year, which allowed for high densities of grazing insects to reduce the proliferation of more highly edible nitrogen-fixing species in the community, including diatoms.  In contrast, many free-living cyanobacteria species are largely inedible and persisted throughout the 2010 growing season, in contrast with previous years where spring floods reduced the densities of grazing insects in the river and nitrogen-fixing diatoms dominated the nitrogen-fixer community.   These results have strong implications for the ultimate fate of nitrogen that enters rivers through nitrogen fixation, as nitrogen contained in highly edible species (e.g. diatoms) may support the growth and productivity of grazing insects and enter river food webs (supporting fish as well as terrestrial consumers), while nitrogen contained in non-edible (e.g. free-living cyanobacteria) species is more likely to be exported to downstream ecosystems, including marine environments.  These results indicate that nitrogen cycling pathways in river ecosystems may differ as a function of the dominant nitrogen-fixing species, and their relationship with light, temperature, and variable climatic conditions.  \n\nThis project provided opportunities for a postdoctoral associate to mentor undergraduate students, participate in co-teaching experiences, and learn a number of new techniques in aquatic biogeochemistry and interdisciplinary watershed science.  It has also provided research training for five undergraduate..."
