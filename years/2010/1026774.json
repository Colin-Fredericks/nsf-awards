The program involves collaboration with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), the College of Science (COS), and the College of Engineering (COE) at the institution as well as participation in research projects at partner institutions such as TAMU-Kingsville.  \r\n\r\nThe TAMUS LSAMP BTD Program aims to increase the pool of science, technology, engineering or mathematics STEM PhDs among underrepresented minorities (URM) in STEM fields and to create a cohesive community of graduate students across different disciplines within the university. \r\n\r\nThe program benefits society by providing opportunities and activities at the graduate levels that lead to educational and career enhancements of graduate students. The TAMUS LSAMP BTD program will also enhance the infrastructure of research and education by advancing pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees at alliance institutions.",
