 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study improved computational algorithms for\r\nmodel reduction of complex fluid flows.  This research will have two\r\nmain thrusts, new closure models and a parametric modeling framework.\r\nThe investigators will investigate closure for models that are based on \r\nthe proper orthogonal decomposition.  This component of the research \r\nwill leverage current developments in large eddy simulation along with \r\ntwo-level algorithms for efficient computational implementation.  The\r\nfact that the closure models follow from both mathematical and physical \r\narguments will allow for a methodology that generalizes to physical \r\nsettings other than fluid flow.  A new globalization methodology that\r\ncombines more accurate local models with an interpolation framework\r\nto evaluate the models in parameter space will also be studied.  The \r\nlocal model improvements are provided using flow sensitivity analysis \r\nand basis functions are constructed using a multidimensional Hermite \r\ninterpolation method.   The investigators will emphasize problems in \r\ngeophysical fluid dynamics as well as flows with free convection.\r\n\r\nThis research will expand the applicability of computationally\r\nefficient simulations to a wider class of fluid flows.  The availability\r\nof dramatically faster simulations is important to many engineering \r\napplications including optimization and control of fluid flows, data\r\nassimilation and uncertainty quantification.  Therefore, the research \r\nconducted in this project has direct application to a wide range of\r\nproblems that include data assimilation in climate and weather modeling \r\nas well as simulation, optimization, and control of energy efficient buildings.",

The developed algorithms are very efficient though require parametric derivatives of the simulation.  Software was developed to calculate this derivative information by applying operator overloading to Matlab programs was developed to aid this study and is freely available at (https://github.com/jborggaard/AD_Deriv).\n\n\nApplying the traditional POD/Galerkin approach to mildly turbulent flows requires additional terms to stabilize the model.  The most common approaches either modify terms in the coefficient model or add additional dissipative terms.  Our approach was to develop and test a physically motivated modeling strategy based on the success of large eddy simulation (LES).  Specifically, we demonstrated success with both the dynamic subgridscale model (DSM) as well as the variational multiscale model (VMS).  This lead to superior ROMs without the need to \"tune\" model parameters.  Truncation of the POD basis played the role of LES filtering and the two models (DSM and VMS) achieved more accurate ROMs for complex 3D mildly turbulent flows.  Studies included flow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 1000 and Rayleigh-Benard convection at a Reynolds number of 6800.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey T Borggaard"
