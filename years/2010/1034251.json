In the natural knee, joint mechanics provide insight into musculoskeletal function and are used to assess pathologies. In the implanted knee, resultant post-operative joint mechanics contribute to the success of TKR, which is influenced by implant design and component alignment. The most significant source of uncertainty in prior knee mechanics studies is patient-to-patient variability, yet it remains the least understood. Subject specific models developed from imaging data provide the fidelity required to accurately represent anatomical structures. To then account for variability within a population, statistical shape models have been created to characterize the modes of variation across subjects. Current state-of-the-art analyses have developed shape models of individual bones, but have not considered shape models with multiple structures like a joint, nor integrated shape models into joint mechanics prediction. Accordingly, the objective of this proposal is to develop a computational methodology for the population-based evaluation of natural and implanted joint mechanics considering inter-subject geometric, property and surgical variability. The specific aims are:\r\n-{nTo characterize geometric variability in a population of subjects with a statistical shape model of the structures of the knee.\r\n-{nTo evaluate variability in natural and TKR-implanted knee mechanics in a population using a probabilistic platform combining the statistical shape model with uncertainty in mechanical properties, e.g. ligament stiffness, and surgical parameters, e.g. alignment of a TKR component.\r\n-{nTo identify relationships between geometric variability and natural joint mechanics and between component alignment, geometric variability, and implanted joint mechanics using a novel combined probabilistic and principal component analysis technique.\r\n  The project will develop the statistical shape model of the knee from magnetic resonance image datasets from the Osteoarthritis Initiative and perform probabilistic finite element assessments of joint mechanics in natural and implanted knees under a simulated deep flexion loading condition.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity\r\n  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is in the novel development of a statistical shape modeling of the knee joint and the creation of a novel integrated framework where the effects of geometric and other uncertainties on joint mechanics can be holistically assessed. The population-based predictions can address concepts of form and function in the natural knee and provide insight into interdependencies between patient geometry and TKR component alignment and their impact on knee mechanics.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts resulting from the proposed activity\r\nThe broader impacts are related to the dissemination of the findings by creating a website to allow the statistical shape model of the knee to be downloaded by other researchers and the publication of the newly developed methodologies. Additionally, based on the highly visual and relevant nature of the project, interactive curricular components will be developed, implemented in the Making of an Engineer outreach program which promotes engineering and the sciences to underrepresented minorities, and made publicly available to assist teachers in creating and carrying out science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curricula.",

The most significant source of uncertainty in knee mechanics is patient-to-patient variability, yet it remains the least understood.  Accordingly, the objective of this project was to develop computational methodologies to describe anatomic variability and enable population-based evaluations of natural and implanted joint mechanics.\n\nIn this project, a statistical shape model was created to characterize variation in the anatomy of bones, cartilage and soft tissues of the knee for a group of 50 subjects representative of the population.  Our work uniquely described multiple structures of the joint and their relative positions.  The quantitative description of anatomy can inform the design and sizing of TKR implants.  In addition, the statistical shape model has been integrated with physics-based analyses to assess natural and implanted joint mechanics in larger populations of subjects.  The approach utilized an efficient, automated workflow to generate models of virtual subjects with the fidelity required for realistic predictions, thus, enabling population-based evaluations for 100s and 1000s of subjects instead of a few.  Using a computational approach provides the opportunity to identify potential issues that may arise for a given combination of patient anatomy and implant, and will lead to implant designs that are more robust to patient variability.\n\nLastly, by describing the anatomy of the knee, the statistical shape model is well suited to investigate the complex relationships between the shape of the articular surfaces and the motions and loading at the joint.  The project identified specific aspects of the knee geometry (radius of the condyles) and congruency between structures (how the shape of the patella matches the trochlear groove of the femur) that impacted the amount of rotation and the location of contact. These insights can establish functional norms, support the diagnosis of diseases and influence surgical treatments. \n\nThe intellectual merit of the project is in the novel development of a statistical shape model of the knee joint and the creation of an integrated framework where the effects of geometric and other uncertainties on joint mechanics can be holistically assessed.  The population-based predictions can address concepts of form and function in the natural knee and provide insight into interdependencies between patient geometry, TKR design and alignment, and knee mechanics.  This project has led to the publication or submission of 4  journal articles and 10 conference abstracts.   Importantly, the modeling work has been shared with the research community via the SimTK.org website for biomechanics model sharing.\n\nThe broader impacts of this study are the creation of open-source computational approaches to advance the design of joint replacement implants, the engagement of 140+ middle and high-school students interested in science and engineering, and the training of university students (4 graduate and 6 undergraduate) with skills to perform biomechanical simulation.  Biomechanics educational modules were developed and delivered in the Making of an Engineer outreach program, which promotes engineering and the sciences to underrepresented minorities.
