Associated with the GRC-PPS is a weekend-long Gordon Kenan Research Seminar, which features attendance limited to graduate students and post-doctoral associates, allowing for scientific interaction in a nonthreatening environment. \r\n\r\nThe 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Plasma Processing Science will feature a comprehensive program that will highlight the most cutting edge scientific advances in low temperature plasma science and will explore the applications of low temperature plasma technology relative to many grand societal challenges. Fundamental science sessions will focus on plasma kinetics, plasma surface interactions, and recent trends in plasma generation and multi-phase plasmas. Application sessions will explore the impact of plasma technology in renewable energy and the production of fuels from renewable feedstocks, plasma-enabled medicine and sterilization, and environmental remediation and waste treatment. The conference will bring together in informal atmosphere leaders in the field with junior investigators and graduate students. The special format of the Gordon Conferences, with programmed discussion sessions and ample time for informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, will provide for a fertile atmosphere of brainstorming and creative thinking among the attendees.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nPlasmas technology, a focus of the GRC-PPS has recently been identified as an area of national importance in the National Research Council-sponsored report \"Plasma 2010.\" In its tradition of being a forum for the exchange of cutting-edge ideas and knowledge in the area of plasma processing science, the GRC-PPS will bring together a diverse spectrum of attendees limited in number to around 140 to facilitate ample opportunities for interpersonal contacts among participants. The 2010 GRC-PSS and the associate Gordon Kenan Research Seminar will focus on some of the most cutting-edge issues of plasma processing science. Discussions will focus on the intersection of plasma processing and many of the societal grand challenges as defined by the National Academy of Engineering.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nFunding is requested from NSF to continue with the tradition of active participation of junior scientists by providing partial support for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers for travel expenses and registration fees to attend the GRC-PPS. The unique format of the Gordon Research Conferences with few (twenty-two) invited talks, limited attendance, and ample time for interactions will provide junior scientists with ample opportunities for discussions and networking. Particular emphasis will be placed on encouraging student and post-doc participation from a broad range of institutions. The GRC-PPS will be widely advertised in the plasma community and the participation and application for travel support by junior scientists will be strongly encouraged. Given a sufficient number of applicants, travel grants will be limited to a maximum of two per research group, and four per institution.",
