 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humbolt State University Marine Laboratory is awarded a grant to renovate a  wet lab facility to facilitate maintenance and improve reliability of the recirculating seawater system, provide improved configuration of tanks for research studies, provide improved seawater system drainage, provide a safer work environment, and provide improved displays for visitors and educational outreach. Humboldt State University Marine Laboratory (HSU ML) supports a diversity of marine research and education programs, with a focus on upper division and graduate level instruction and research. Constructed in 1964 at an original size of 7,400 sq ft, it was expanded to 16,200 sq ft in 1975. The HSU ML has instructional classrooms- laboratories, offices for faculty, affiliated scientists and graduate students, and other specialized spaces. A recirculating seawater system provides high quality filtered and chilled seawater to classrooms, and supports a 3,000 sq ft wet laboratory, a set of six rectangular public display aquaria, a large circular tank with small public viewing window, and a \"touch tank\". A marine naturalist maintains an active K-12 education program and an estimated 12,000-15,000 visitors tour our facility each year.",
