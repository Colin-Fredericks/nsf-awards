The primary objectives are: (1) to develop a mathematical framework and computational tools for the quantification and analysis of shapes; (2) to integrate these computational models with machine learning and statistical inference methods to enable new discoveries, transforming imaging data into biological knowledge; (3) to deliver novel quantitative methodologies for shape analysis that start from a biological premise, rather than a purely geometric one. The aim is thus not only to quantitatively describe shape, but to develop methods for linking morphological variation to its underlying biological causes.  To ensure that the project focuses on methods that are most promising to biology with significant breadth of application, model and tool development will be guided and supported by a set of diverse case studies, ranging from the sub-cellular to organismal scales. \r\n\r\nShape represents a complex and rich source of biological information that is fundamentally linked to underlying mechanisms and function. However, shape is still often examined on a qualitative basis in many disciplines in biology, an approach that is time consuming and prone to human subjectivity. While ad hoc quantitative methods do exist, they are often inaccessible to non-experts and do not easily generalize to a wide variety of problems. The inability of biologists to systematically link shape to genetics, development, environment, function and evolution often precludes advances in biological research spanning diverse spatial and temporal scales, from the movement of molecules within a cell to adaptive changes in organismal morphology. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new suite of widely applicable quantitative methods and tools into the study of biological shape to address the significant need for consistent and repeatable analysis of shape data.",

They also play important roles in controlling many basic cellular processes such as signal transduction. A remarkable property of mitochondria is that they undergo frequent shape change as well as active movement, presumably to meet the changing needs at different locations inside cells. Indeed, abnormal shape and movement of mitochondria often indicate dysfunction. There is extensive research evidence indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the onset and progression of many human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u00c6s disease and Parkinson\u00c6s disease. Currently, however, biological studies on mitochondria are limited by the lack of computational techniques and software tools for characterizing their shapes and shape changes.
