 "awd_abstract_narration": "A tandem repeat (TR) is any pattern of nucleotides which occurs as repeating, consecutive copies along a DNA molecule. Often, the pattern copies are not identical. A TR can be polymorphic, that is, it can be different across individuals in a population: 1) the number of copies may be different, 2) the arrangement of non-identical copies may be dfferent, and 3) the copies may contain different small mutations. TR variants are known to affect important biological processes, such as chromatin structure, gene plasticity, gene expression, and disease states, so their discovery is crucial for correctly understanding complex bio-molecular interactions. While a conservative estimate suggests that 100,000 human TRs may be polymorphic, until recently, genome-wide study of TR polymorphism, in humans and other organisms, has been too difficult and costly, with the result that the true extent of polymorphism and its effects are unknown. New genome sequencing technologies offer the first real opportunity to fill in the details of TR diversity. These technologies sequence millions of high quality, short DNA fragments in a single\r\nexperiment. Current sequencing projects are producing many billions of reads rich in TR variant information. Yet, current read mapping algorithms,\r\nwhich attempt to assign each read to its proper location on the reference genome, are not designed to detect TR variants. \r\n\r\nThis project has three central goals: 1. Algorithm Development; 2.Genome Studies; 3. Variation Curation in a public database. Strategies will be developed to accurately and efficiently map TR-containing reads to reference genome TR loci. Anticipated algorithmic developments include: 1) Optimization of tree-based alignment, for use when millions of short, disjoint sequences must be aligned to each other. The reads and references can each be merged into separate Patricia tree data structures and alignment computed between tree nodes, thereby eliminating redundant computation in the prefixes of the two sequence sets. 2) Production of space-saving, Burrows Wheeler transforms (BWT) of the most redundant tree parts by employing approximate shortest common superstrings (SCS) for the two sequence sets. 3) Development of an efficient Four-Russians style block computation for edit distance alignment in the trees by exploiting redundancy inherent in the small alphabet and block input scores, 4) Development of a bounding computation for edit-distance based on efficient, bit-register computation of longest common subsequence (LCS) alignment, and 5) Parallelization of all algorithms for further efficiency with multi-core processors, Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) bit-register computations, and highly parallel graphics processing units (GPUs).  Data from six recently published whole human genomes, two human centenarian genomes, and the 1000 genomes project will be analyzed to discover TR variants. An internet-accessible, public database and analysis platform for curation and display of TR variants will be developed.\r\n\r\nThe TR variant discovery software and all data sets produced will directly enhance the infrastructure for TR diversity research in genome biology, genome evolution, and comparative genomics. The software and data will be freely available to the research community through a high capacity website maintained in the PI's lab at Boston University. The PI will participate in a variety of activities that link research and education and support participation by members of underrepresented groups, including provision of opportunities in research for graduate and undergraduate students, participation in high school enrichment and curriculum development projects, and editorship of an international journal engaged in the dissemination of bioinformatics research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe major research goals of this project were:\n1) to develop computer software to detect human genetic variation using data from high-throughput DNA sequencing experiments.  \n2) to use the software to conduct a preliminary analysis on publicly available data from several human genomes.\n3) to make the results available through a public database.\n\nThe major research outcomes of this project were:\n\n1) Development of an efficient software program, VNTRseek, which detects genetic variation in human genomes using high-throughput DNA sequencing data.  The variations are copy number changes in DNA tandem repeats, a type of repetitive sequence found in all DNA genomes.  The variants are known as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs).  This is the first program specifically designed to systematically find VNTRs across a genome in this very high-volume data.  An example of the type of copy number variation detected is shown in the first attached figure.  In each panel of that figure, the top blue and red block represents the reference allele with 4.1 copies (blue is the consensus sequence, red lines are the copies with any differences from the consensus shown, green is the flanking sequence on each side of the repeat).  Each of the subsequent light blue and red blocks (going down) represents a single read mapped to the locus.  From left to right panels, five individual genomes are revealed to have alleles with copy number equal to 4, 2, 3, 2, and 3.  Thus, this is a VNTR because the number of copies varies in the population.\n\n2) Publicly available data from eight human genomes were processed using VNTRseek and a total of  7378 VNTR loci were detected.  Previously, only a few hundred were known.  This analysis paved the way for the processing of over 350 additional human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project.  That analysis is on-going as of the writing of this outcomes report.  An example of one the analyses on data from the James Watson genome is shown in the second attached figure.\n\n3) Several new, highly-efficient computer algorithms were developed for computing sequence alignment for biological DNA and protein sequences.  These algorithms use bits in computer words to represent values in a calculation of the score when aligning (comparing) two sequences.  The higher the score, the more similar the sequences.  In the new calculation, the bits are combined with logic operations such as AND and OR to give the results.  This results in a significant speedup over existing algorithms (see the third attached figure).  Some of these algorithms use a special type of computer instruction called SIMD (single instruction, multiple data).  These SIMD instruction result in even larger speedups.  Since alignments are frequently used when working with biological sequences, these algorithms offer tremendous reduction in computing time for common tasks. \n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe major educational goals of this project were:\n1) to provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student research.\n2) to support participation by members of underrepresented groups.\n3) to participate in high school enrichment and curriculum development projects.\n\nThe major educational outcomes of this project were:\n\n1) Research training opportunities in bioinformatics:\ni) Dissertation research training for two Boston University (BU) bioinformatics PhD students (both members of groups underrepresented in the computing sciences)\nii) Eight-week research rotation opportunities for three first-year BU bioinformatics PhD students.\niii) Research training for one BU female undergraduate student. \n\n2) Invited lectures by the PI at six short courses (two-weeks each) in bioinformatics sponsored by the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and the Institut Pasteur.  The lectures included theory and practical lab sessions in how to analyze high-throughput DNA sequencing data and how to detect genetic variation.  The audience in each course was 20 gra..."
