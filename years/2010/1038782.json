Interactions among the participants and the general audience will provide opportunities for international collaboration.  The symposium consists of 16 invited and nine contributed presentations organized in four half-day sessions.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe symposium particularly aims at better understanding of ionic, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, electron donor-acceptor, and pi-stacking interactions at the nanometer scale which determine interfacial self-assembly processes in bioengineered materials, energy conversion and storage materials, as well as in polymer nano-composites.  The co-sponsorship of two ACS Divisions, Polymeric Science and Engineering and Computers in Chemistry, will bring experimental and computational/theoretical communities closer together.  The significant fraction of international speakers will transfer more knowledge to the U.S. and support the exchange of ideas on an international scale.",
