 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to develop fundamental understanding of a robust nanomanufacturing technology that combines the simplicity and cost benefits of bottom-up self-assembly with the scalability and compatibility of top-down microfabrication.  Spontaneous organization of colloidal nanoparticles with diameter smaller than 100 nm is of great scientific interest and considerable technological importance in developing practical devices with unprecedented electronic, optical, magnetic, and mechanical properties.  The research has three objectives: (1) elucidate the basic mechanisms by which unusual nonclose-packed nanoparticle assemblies form during a simple spin-coating process, (2) assemble ferromagnetic nanoparticle arrays for ultra-high density magnetic recording, and (3) develop ultra-sensitive chemical and biological sensors by using periodic metallic nanostructures.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this work will lead to significant breakthroughs in a wide spectrum of fields ranging from magnetic recording media to biosensors.  The scalable assembly of colloidal nanoparticles will advance many other areas not covered by this proposal ranging from highly efficient solar cells to bio-microanalysis, where the creation of large-area periodic nanostructures is important.  The closely integrated educational plan focuses on developing several outreach activities to educate K-12 students as well as general public on fascinating biomimetics and bottom-up nanomanufacturing.  An educational display for the Florida Museum of Natural History's \"Butterfly Rainforest Center\" will be created to disseminate the fascinating nanostructures and the associated unique functionalities found on morpho butterfly wings and butterfly eyes, along with how to mimic these nanostructured coatings using nanoparticle self-assembly.  Direct participation of high school students from underrepresented groups in the research program will be sought through a successful program at the university.",
