 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop the theoretical foundations of robust \r\ncyber-physical systems. Robustness is the property ensuring that slight \r\nperturbations in the cyber, physical, or in the interaction between the cyber and \r\nthe physical components, e.g., noise in sensor measurements, causes only slight \r\nchanges in the system execution. While it is theoretically possible to enumerate \r\nall possible faults that can occur in a cyber-physical system and to design \r\nsoftware components that correctly handle all such faults, the resulting \r\nspecifications would be unwieldy and difficult to understand or verify. Instead, this \r\nproject investigates the design of software components that guarantee \r\nrobustness of cyber-physical systems with respect to unmodeled faults. The \r\napproach consist in abstracting and generalizing several key ideas from robust \r\ncontrol theory to cyber-physical systems. \r\n\r\nThe project's intellectual merit is divided in two parts. The first part consists in  \r\ndefining a notion of robustness for cyber-physical systems relying on finite-state \r\nabstractions of the physical world retaining metric information about physical \r\nquantities. The second part consists in developing the methods and tools for \r\nautomatically synthesizing software modules enforcing desired specifications in a \r\nrobust manner. \r\n\r\nThe tools and techniques developed in this project will significantly enhance our \r\nability to produce robust cyber-physical systems and thus have a broad impact in \r\nseveral application areas transcending computer science and control \r\nengineering. Moreover, the broader impact of the proposed research is amplified \r\nby explicitly addressing the lack of robustness in legacy software through the \r\ndevelopment of robustifying software patches. To enhance the transfer of the \r\nresearch results to industry, the PIs and the Electrical Engineering Office of \r\nIndustrial Relations will host a workshop for the local industry on robust cyber-\r\nphysical systems.",
