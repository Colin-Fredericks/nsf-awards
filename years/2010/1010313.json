 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to fabricate anti-reflective coatings (ARC) for solar energy applications.  The approach is to use a convective and evaporation-induced assembly to deposit organized nanostructures and create sub-wavelength quasi repeating structures at lower cost than the repeating structures from photolithography.  In this project, a Microreactor-Assisted Nanomaterial Deposition (MAND) system will be developed for solution-phase synthesis and large-scale manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to demonstrate a microreactor technology that can produce various films with defined structures and low cost.  One of the major applications could be anti-reflective coating in solar systems to reduce light reflection and improve energy harvesting.",
