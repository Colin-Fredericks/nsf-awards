 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this investigation, an innovative and corrosion free decked bulb-T beam bridge system will be studied. The new side-by-side decked bulb-T beam bridge system consists of (a) decked bulb-T beams prestressed and reinforced with non-corrosive strands (carbon fiber reinforced polymer, CFRP), (b) integral transverse diaphragms post-tensioned with unbonded CFRP, and (c) an integral wearing surface. This investigation consists of a number of phases that will be carried out on four full-scale decked bulb-T beams and on one bridge model. Service load, cracking load and ultimate load carrying capacity of the new beams will be determined. Finally, the developed decked bulb-T beam bridge system will be tested and evaluated. A comprehensive finite element analysis will be conducted.\r\n\r\nThe combination of newly developed CFRP with high strength concrete in the decked bulb-T beam bridge system will enhance its capacity, durability, and life-span as well as reduce the cost of maintenance. Introduction of this innovative bridge system will deliver a cost-effective infrastructure system to meet America?s present and future needs. Interaction with composite and construction industries as well as with state engineers and concrete precasters will be a significant benefit to the highway bridge industry and to LTU students. This project requires multidisciplinary research, in new materials, structural engineering, instrumentation, load analysis, computer simulation and construction and bridge economics.",
