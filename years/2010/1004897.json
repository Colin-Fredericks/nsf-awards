 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Joseph A. Heppert and David R. Benson at the University of Kansas for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus primarily on interdisciplinary projects at the interface of chemistry and other disciplines.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the synthesis and study of azulene-based organometallics relevant to molecular electronics ; (2)  the high-resolution microscopy studies of model biological membranes; (3)  the study of intermediates in manganese-mediated oxidation reactions; (4)  the capture and stimulation of macrophage cells for the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species ; (5)  the spectroscopic study of nano-confined solvents; and (6) the green synthesis of functionally interesting molecules via decarboxylative coupling.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a wide range of professional development activities, from the exploration of careers in industry through site visits, the development of communication skills through written and oral reporting of research results, and through innovative continued professional development activities via social networking tools.  Students will be recruited from a large number of institutions in the region, including a number of schools that are minority-serving.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The research projects supported at this REU site are in interdisciplinary areas of chemistry -- areas where much of the exciting growth in the chemical enterprise is taking place.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study (graduate school), and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis NSF-REU award provided direct support for 30 undergraduate students to engage in cutting edge chemical research at the University of Kansas during the summers of 2010-2012.  Consistent with our program goals, all of these participants were from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI\u00c6s) from across the United States and Puerto Rico.  Joining this cohort were four additional domestic PUI students who were supported by individual faculty research grants, and one KU student. We also hosted a participant from Germany, who was supported by the American Chemical Society International REU (iREU) program and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). \n\nA key component of the KU Chemistry REU experience is a Career Enhancement Program that combines career options discussions, a professional development symposium, and interactive seminars on emerging opportunities in interdisciplinary research.  Career options discussions during the 2010-2012 seasons included sessions with former REU students who are currently in the KU Chemistry graduate program, KU faculty members, and a chemistry professor from a PUI.  Career options discussions were also included in field trips to Deciphera, a small pharmaceutical company in Lawrence, KS, and to the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, MO.  This series was rated good or excellent by nearly all of the 2010-2012 participants in anonymous end of summer online surveys.  In causal remarks to the site director, several students noted that each panel discussion opened their eyes to entirely new career considerations. \n\nThe seminar series on emerging opportunities in interdisciplinary research were designed to introduce the participants to scientific and technological topics that are at the forefront of modern research.  KU faculty members with interest in these areas offered \"big picture\" presentations, emphasizing current successes and challenges.  Subjects in this seminar series included \"Green Chemistry\", \"Chemistry in the Hydrogen Economy\", \"Drug Discovery\", \"Mass Spectrometry, and \"Microfabrication in Chemistry.\"  This seminar series was also generally well received by the students, with 72% rating it good or excellent in the 2012 survey.  \n\nIn addition to the educational and professional development activities outlined above, each student gained crucial experience in oral and written communication of her or his research accomplishments. All students gave oral presentations about their research goals and progress at a mid-summer symposium, and reported their final results in poster format at an end-of-summer multi-disciplinary symposium attended by all summer researchers at KU.  To date, seven papers that include research performed by students supported by this award have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  Several other manuscripts are in progress.  In addition, 13 of the 30 participants supported by this award presented their work at regional or national American Chemical Society meetings or at PITTCON. \n\nResults of our anonymous online surveys indicated that the students made substantial gains in thinking and working like a scientist, and in developing useful skills.  The survey data further indicated that the students developed strong relationships with their research mentors (93% excellent; 7% good) and with research group members (57% excellent; 43% good), and had positive experiences overall (93% excellent; 7% good).  The 2012 survey further revealed that our program significantly increased the likelihood of attending graduate school for 72% of the participants.  Similar results were obtained in the 2010 and 2011 surveys.\n\n      Information about the 30 students supported by this award can be found on our REU web site (http://www.chemreu.ku.edu/alumni).  Of these 30 students, 18 are presently in or will soon be entering a Ph.D. program in chemistry or a related field, and several others have indicated that they plan to pursue gra..."
