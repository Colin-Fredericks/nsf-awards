 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor David Forbes at the University of South Alabama for a research project that will develop a method of creating sulfur ylides that are useful in forming carbon-carbon bonds and three-membered rings. This is a commonly used reaction in organic synthesis but is usually difficult to get good yields consistently. Professor Forbes has proposed a process that overcomes this limitation, and has found a way to improve reactions that have been reported in this area, which could lead to the development of new processes. Increased understanding of these key processes would provide a new method of high utility that can be used in a wide range of organic syntheses. The major goal of the proposal is to render this methodology catalytic in the sulfide promoter, making the methodology more atom efficient and opening avenues for chiral catalysis. This research is likely to lead to processes that are of great value to synthetic chemists and will have a significant impact on the chemistry community.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Forbes will perform research that addresses a long-standing problem in the potentially useful area of organocatalytic synthesis: that of catalytic sulfide-mediated methylene transfer using non-dangerous chemicals. This versatile and potentially environmentally benign methodology would have industrial applications of economic and environmental benefit. Broader impacts involve the training of undergraduate students in chemistry, outreach to local high school chemistry teachers through the Alabama Science in Motion (ASIM) Program, and ongoing collaborations, especially with industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFederal Award ID 0957482 primarily focused in the area of synthetic organic chemistry.  A large component was dedicated toward the development of new synthetic methods.  Long-term objectives were to apply these methods toward the construction of biologically and medicinally important compounds.  The success of the program was heavily dependent upon the involvement of motivated and talented undergraduate research students as our program is best classified as a PUI.  Our research activities are in the areas of asymmetric catalysis and synthetic methodology.  Our research program is a blend of both applied and basic research.  The total number of participating members on this award was 30 - two graduate students (MS), two technicians, 16 undergraduate students, one post-doc, four collaborators, four high school student, and one consultant.  With their involvement, we have had success in presenting our research and educational activities at local, regional, national and international venues and publishing our findings in peer-reviewed publications with most if not all of those part of my group as co-authors.  The research-oriented presentations and publications as a result of this award since 2010 have primarily focused on our sulfur-ylide technology studies.  This has changed over the past few years as my involvement with one of my collaborators has grown and fortunately has been coupled to another NSF sponsored award (NSF REU).  Its focus has been the targeting compounds of biological importance.  As each chapter in the development of S-ylide technologies has resulted in the preparation of system of biological and medicinal importance of late, this new area of work elevates our activities as we are now more integrated as part of a team while keeping with our research agenda of preparing and testing materials of biological and medicinal significance.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Forbes"
