 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to understand the build-up and release of stress along active fault zones require detailed studies of individual faults and placement of those results in a physical framework consistent with our knowledge about rock mechanics. One particularly intriguing fault zone behavior that has been observed with increasing frequency in recent years involves the interplay between aseismic slip and seismic swarm activity. Slow fault slip has been observed to trigger earthquake swarms in a variety of tectonic environments including subduction zones, volcanic systems, and continental strike-slip faults such as those in close proximity to population centers in Southern California.\r\n\r\nOne region that provides a prime environment to study seismic swarms and aseismic creep is the Imperial Valley/Salton Trough in Southern California. Seismic swarms, large (Mw>7) earthquakes, and transient episodes of fault creep are all frequent occurrences along the plate boundary faults within the Salton Trough. The Salton Trough offers a prime opportunity to examine the interplay between these varied types of fault activity, since so many of them are observed within a relatively small geographic area, which also has had very detailed geologic studies and contains one of the world?s densest seismic and geodetic station networks. Detailed studies of aseismic and seismic events offer an opportunity to connect physical properties of the fault-zone such as rock type, depth, and temperature with rock-mechanical properties such as frictional stability, and will allow us to better understand the temporal evolution of seismic hazard associated with individual fault zones.\r\n\r\nWe propose a combination of an active source seismic study of the 2005 swarm's primary fault zone, and a more detailed analysis of the existing seismic and geodetic data. The core of our effort is a one-week seismic survey using the high-res profiling techniques developed by the USGS-Menlo Park group that will provide constraints on the details of fault-zone geometry and rigidity structure. These results will be used to improve our studies of the 2005 swarm. The combination of these studies will allow us to study the relations between rock-type, rigidity, thermal structure and frictional stability. Because shallow creep and earthquake swarms are general properties of major faults in the Salton Trough, our results will provide inputs to physics based earthquake hazard models in the region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany faults are able to accomodate tectonic plate motion without undergoing large earthquakes.   Instead of storing up energy and releasing it  in a matter of seconds in a large earthquake, they slide past eachother relatively slowly in a process known as aseismic creep.   Our study focused on a recently discovered fault in Southern California, the Kalin Fault, located just south of the Salton Sea.  In 2005 this fault underwent the equivalent of a M 5.7 earthquake, without the shaking.  This rapid episode of aseismic creep resulted in a large surficial scarp that allowed the fault to be discovered.\n\nTo learn more about the Kalin fault we performed an active source seismic investigation that involved setting off hundreds of very small explosions and recording the soundwaves on arrays of seismometers that were deployed across the fault.    The experiment took about 2 weeks to conduct and involved the training of ~7 graduate students from Cornell, MIT, and Scripps in seismic field work.  \n\nThe major findings of our work is that the boundary between the portions of the Kalin fault system that slip aseismically and those that fail in earthquakes coincides with where the sedimentary rocks of the Salton Trough have been altered by hydrothermal fluid flow from the volcanic/geothermal system located near the southern edge of the Salton sea.   The mineralogical alteration allows the fault to produce earthquakes in regions that would normally be to hot to sustain rupture.  \n\nOur findings have significant implications for seismic hazard in the Salton Trough as the Kalin fault has a fairly fast slip rate (likely &gt;1 cm/yr).  Our seismic imaging of the subsurface has clarified which portions of this fault system are likely to fail in large earthquakes and which are not.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/23/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey J Mcguire"
