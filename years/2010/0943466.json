 "awd_abstract_narration": "0944307/Conway\r\n\r\nThis award supports a project to use the Roosevelt Island ice core as a glaciological dipstick for the eastern Ross Sea.  Recent attention has focused on the eastern Ross Embayment, where there are no geological constraints on ice thickness changes, due to the lack of protruding rock \"dipsticks\" where the ice sheet can leave datable records of high stands. Recent work has shown how dated ice cores can be used as dipsticks to derive ice-thickness histories. Partners from New Zealand and Denmark will extract an ice core from Roosevelt Island during the 2010-2011 and 2011-12 austral summers. Their science objective is to contribute to understanding of climate variability over the past 40kyr. The science goal of this project is not the climate record, but rather the history of deglaciation in the Ross Sea. The new history from the eastern Ross Sea will be combined with the glacial histories from the central Ross Sea (Siple Dome and Byrd) and existing and emerging histories from geologic and marine records along the western Ross Sea margin and will allow investigators to establish an updated, self-consistent model of the configuration and thickness of ice in the Ross Embayment during the LGM, and the timing of deglaciation. Results from this work will provide ground truth for new-generation ice-sheet models that incorporate ice streams and fast-flow dynamics. Realistic ice-sheet models are needed not only for predicting the response to future possible environments, but also for investigating past behaviors of ice sheets. This research contributes to the primary goals of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Initiative as well as the IPY focus on ice-sheet history and dynamics. It also contributes to understanding spatial and temporal patterns of climate change and climate dynamics over the past 40kyr, one of the primary goals of the International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS).  The project will help to develop the next generation of scientists and will contribute to the education and training of two Ph.D. students. All participants will benefit from the international collaboration, which will expose them to different field and laboratory techniques and benefit future collaborative work.  All participants are involved in scientific outreach and undergraduate education, and are committed to fostering diversity. Outreach will be accomplished through regularly scheduled community and K-12 outreach events, talks and popular writing by the PIs, as well as through University press offices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe key outcome of this project was a new, annually-dated ice corerecord from the Eastern Ross Sea area, at the location of RooseveltIsland.  From this record, inferences can be made regarding local andregional climate.  Our collaborators in New Zealand led by NancyBertler have led the ice-core analysis which has resulted in amanuscript in late-stage review: \"The Ross Sea Dipole - Temperature,Snow Accumulation and Sea Ice Variability in the Ross Sea Region,Antarctica, over the Past 2,700 Years\" in Climate of the Past.  Inthis paper we show that for most of the past 2,700 years, the easternRoss Sea was warming with increased snow accumulation and perhapsdecreased sea ice extent. However, West Antarctica cooled whereas thewestern Ross Sea showed no significant temperature trend. We refer tothis pattern as the Ross Sea Dipole. Notably, during the Little IceAge, West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea experience colder thanaverage temperatures, while the eastern Ross Sea undergoes a period ofwarming. From the 17th Century onwards, this dipole relationshipchanges. Now, all three regions show signs of warming, with snowaccumulation declining in West Antarctica and the eastern Ross Sea.  \nThe primary Dartmouth contribution to this project has been thecollection and analysis of 3 key records:  borehole temperatures,borehole Optical Televiewer (OPTV) logs, and a suite of measurementsmade by an Automated Weather Station (AWS).  \nBorehole temperatures:  We deployed a digital borehole thermometer andmeasured temperatures in the main Rosevelt Island borehole over twoseasons.  These temperature measurements allow us to make directinferences about past temperatures at the surface, as the changes insurface temperature are propagated downwards in the ice by diffusion.These data have led to a successful undergraduate thesis which is nowin preparation for publication to a peer-reviewed journal.  Inaddition to the ability to invert for paleotemperatures at RooseveltIsland, the existing temperatures are important for any modelingeffort to succeed, since the viscosity of ice varies with temperature,over several orders of magnitude in normal conditions.  \nOPTV logs: We logged the optical properties of the borehole wall withan Optical Televiewer (OPTV) which produces an unwrapped image of theborehole wall throughout the entire depth of the borehole.  Byidentifying misible landmarks on each log, we can determine verticalstrain at the ice core site.  This vertical strain is importantbecause it is driven by divergence, or ice flow away from the site,and is an extra check on our horizontal strain network.  \nAWS records: We deployed an Automated Weather Station which loggedhourly measurements of air temperature, wind speed and direction, andin particular, snow and firn temperature to a depth of 20 meters.These firn temperatures allowed us to determine the thermaldiffusivity of the firn at Roosevelt Island, and to measure the annualcycle of temperatures and how those temperatures propagate down intothe ice sheet.  Additionally, our AWS data have been important as anancillary data stream for other analyses which need air temperature,surface snow temperature, and wind speed and direction.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Hawley"
