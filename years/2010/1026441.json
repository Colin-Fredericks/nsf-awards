The equipment is critical to the rapid processing of large-scale data and simulations in support of projects in bioinformatics, environmental modeling and neuroscience.  These research projects utilize algorithms and methodologies that require multiple compute processors and large memory.\r\n\r\nExamples of the expected outcomes of the research that will be carried out with the aid of these computers are: prediction models for soil moisture fields under current and future climatic conditions; stochastic models for the dependence of fluid flow on the geometry of rock fractures; new methodologies for mapping ground-level aerosol in large metropolitan areas based on satellite data; the creation of an automated disease diagnosis system from data in public repositories; and further understanding the role different regions in the brain plays in processing visual information.",
