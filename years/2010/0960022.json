It will enable in-depth, fundamental research and position UML among the leaders in nanomanufacturing and plastics engineering research. While a few ongoing research projects will benefit from the requested system, several new programs that have been hindered by this lacking capability will be initiated. In addition, the acquisition will strengthen UML?s fast-growing research areas in nanomedicine, biomedical devices, and bioengineering. Last but not the least, collaborations with nearby universities and local companies will be enhanced. Examples include tooling for cost-effective nanomanufacturing systems, high speed AFM tip arrays for high-rate nanomanufacturing, and nanoparticle drug delivery systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: The requested equipment will immediately impact research by more than 20 faculty members from nine departments. Graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students as well as industry professionals will benefit from programs incorporating the FIB system. A unique \"machining\" program will be piloted with the Nashoba Valley Technical High School and extended to local technical high schools. In addition, UML has long-standing ties with industry and flexible arrangements for equipment use.",
