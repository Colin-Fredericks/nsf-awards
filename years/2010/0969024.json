 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to study vibration and health monitoring of spinning cyclic symmetric rotors with flexible bearing and housing supports. There are three specific goals.  The first goal is to develop a mathematical model to predict ground-based vibration response of a spinning cyclic symmetric rotor with flexible bearing and housing supports. The basic idea is a component mode synthesis allowing the rotor and housing to assume arbitrary geometry. Also, the model will be validated experimentally. The second goal is to develop an efficient algorithm to speed up calculations of the ground-based response. The basic idea is to reduce the order of the governing equation through use of \"balanced modes\" that do not present coupling between the rotor and the housing. The third goal is to study the feasibility to monitor rotor health via vibration signatures of the housing and bearings.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of the research is cyclic symmetric rotors, which appear very often in rotary machines, such as jet engines and refrigerator compressors.  Every rotary machine consists of three basic components: a rotary part (rotor), a stationary part (housing), and multiple bearings that connect the rotary and stationary parts.  When a rotor consists of N identical substructures repeating themselves in the circumferential direction, the rotor is called \"cyclic symmetric.\"  Examples of cyclic symmetric rotors include wind turbines and propellers.\r\n\r\nTraditional vibration analyses of cyclic symmetric rotors assume (a) no bearing and housing supports and (b) rotor-based formulations.  Recent industrial needs, however, challenge the validity of these two assumptions. With increased material and fuel costs, aviation industry seeks to reduce weight and rigidity of engines, thus increasing coupled rotor-bearing-housing vibration.  With increased maintenance costs, industries seek to monitor ground-based machine response to evaluate the health of high-speed rotary systems.  The proposed research will not only broaden the knowledge on cyclic symmetric rotors by removing the two major assumptions, but also provide the industry with fundamental understanding to advance its products.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research is to study vibration and health monitoring of spinning cyclic symmetric rotors with flexible bearing and housing supports. Such systems appear very often in rotary machines, ranging from jet engines to compressors.  In this research, we have made significant breakthroughs to achieve the following goals.\n\n \n\nFirst, we develop a mathematical model to predict ground-based vibration response of a spinning cyclic symmetric rotor with flexible bearing and housing supports.  Measuring ground-based response of the spinning rotor is an industrial trend, because it is easier to implement and more reliable.  Interpretation of the measured data, however, is difficult because an accurate mathematical model is not available.  We adopt a method called \"component mode synthesis\" to successfully predict the ground-based response of the spinning rotor.  The uniqueness of the model is that it allows the rotor and housing to assume arbitrary geometry, thus making this model very general and universal. \n\n \n\nAccording to the model, these spinning systems will present instability at specific spin speeds.  Also, significant vibration, known as resonance, will appear with specific frequencies that can be accurately predicted.  Most importantly, the model has been validated via experiments.  Calibrated experiments have been conducted to predict ground-based response of a cyclic symmetric rotor with bearings and housing.  The measured results are then compared with the predictions from the mathematical model.  The experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions.\n\n \n\nBased on the mathematical model, we have also studied the feasibility to monitor ground-based response of the spinning rotor to evaluate structural health of the rotor-bearing-housing systems.  The study shows that cracks or damage in the rotor will affect the shapes of rotor vibration (known as \"mode shapes\").  As the rotor spins, the change of mode shapes generates a signature of special frequencies.  Monitoring these special frequencies can serve as an avenue to evaluate structural integrity of the rotating system.  Calibrated experiments have also been conducted to confirm the feasibility of this approach.\n\n \n\nReal rotors are never truly cyclic symmetric due to manufacturing tolerance, wear, and damage.  As a result, a slight mistune is always present in terms of stiffness and mass distribution of the rotor.  The slight mistune results in a peculiar phenomenon called \"mode localization.\"  When it occurs, vibration will localize at one part of the cyclic symmetric rotor instead of being evenly distributed throughout the rotor.  Mode localization could potentially cause rotor failure under high-cycle fatigue.  Despite many years of research, researchers are not able to identify the root cause of the phenomenon of mode localization.\n\n \n\nIn this funded research, we have also studied mode localization in-depth and gained significant insights why the phenomenon occurs.  For mode localization to occur, it is necessary that the following two conditions be met: (a) there is a group of vibration modes in the tuned system with nearly identical natural frequencies, and (b) the vibration modes in the group must encompass all possible wave numbers in the circumferential direction.  When mistune is present as an add-on, condition (a) allows the modes to linearly combine themselves enabling a drastic change in mode shapes when mistune is introduced, while condition (b) ensures enough wave numbers in the circumferential direction to enable mode localization.\n\n \n\nThroughout this research, the principal investigator has educated 2 PhD students.  The research fund also sponsored one undergraduate student to travel to Taiwan for a summer intern and research experience. To disseminate research results, we have published one journal paper and five conference papers. Two other journal papers are currently under review.  Research results were also publicized annually in Universit..."
