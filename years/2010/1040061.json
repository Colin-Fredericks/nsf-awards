 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary: Electron-Beam Lithography (EBL) System has revolutionized the field of nanotechnology for artificially fabricating nanostructures and studying their properties. EBL system is capable of writing resist patterns with accuracy and control down to about 20nm. With advance of nanotechnology and miniaturization of devices, EBL is emerging as a potential tool for manufacturing various nanodevices used in multidisciplinary fields. Unlike other available instruments EBL is precise with higher spatial resolution and fast considering its cost and user-friendly operation. This will be a unique facility in the Norfolk State cleanroom focusing multidisciplinary research in the areas of bio-chemical sensors, magnetic tunnel junctions for high density memories, semiconductor based wave-guides for communication and devices for energy generation and storage. The instrument will be operated out of the Norfolk State University (NSU) Micro- and Nanotechnology Center (MiNatC), an excellent facility for advanced device fabrication for commercial applications as well as providing a center for excellence in teaching and training in advanced electronic nanotechnology. Acquisition of the e-beam lithography system will not only strengthen major ongoing research and educational efforts in nanomaterials and nanotechnology at NSU but also will directly impact many undergraduate and graduate students; over 70% of them belong to the minority groups underrepresented in the fields of Engineering and Material Science. The addition of EBL will greatly increase the participation of NSU and the surrounding community in the national nano initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\nLayman Summary: Electron-Beam Lithography (EBL) System produces artificial nanostructures which are about 20 nm wide. With advance of nanotechnology and miniaturization of devices, EBL is emerging as a potential tool for manufacturing various nanoscale devices used in multidisciplinary applications. EBL is very user-friendly and produces precise nanostructures cost-effectively. This will be a unique facility in our cleanroom focusing multidisciplinary research in the areas of bio-chemical sensors, high density memories, semiconductor based wave-guides for communication, and devices for energy generation and storage. The proposed instrument will be operated out of the Norfolk State University (NSU) Micro- and Nanotechnology Center (MiNatC), an excellent facility for advanced device fabrication for commercial applications as well as providing a center for excellence in teaching and training our students in advanced electronic nanotechnology.
