 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nThe objective of this research is to develop advanced distributed monitoring and control systems for civil infrastructure. The approach uses a cyber-physical co-design of wireless sensor-actuator networks and structural monitoring and control algorithms. The unified cyber-physical system architecture and abstractions employ reusable middleware services to develop hierarchical structural monitoring and control systems. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this multi-disciplinary research includes (1) a unified middleware architecture and abstractions for hierarchical sensing and control; (2) a reusable middleware service library for hierarchical structural monitoring and control; (3) customizable time synchronization and synchronized sensing routines; (4) a holistic energy management scheme that maps structural monitoring and control onto a distributed wireless sensor-actuator architecture; (5) dynamic sensor and actuator activation strategies to optimize for the requirements of monitoring, computing, and control; and (6) deployment and empirical validation of structural health monitoring and control systems on representative lab structures and in-service multi-span bridges. While the system constitutes a case study, it will enable the development of general principles that would be applicable to a broad range of engineering cyber-physical systems. \r\n\r\nThis research will result in a reduction in the lifecycle costs and risks related to our civil infrastructure. The multi-disciplinary team will disseminate results throughout the international research community through open-source software and sensor board hardware. Education and outreach activities will be held in conjunction with the Asia-Pacific Summer School in Smart Structures Technology jointly hosted by the US, Japan, China, and Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur society is facing a critical challenge of protecting our aging civil infrastructure from natural deterioration and hazards such as earthquakes.  Smart structures equipped with monitoring and control systems offer a promising approach to enhance the resilience and safety of our civil infrastructure.  Wireless structural monitoring and control systems in particular are gaining significant interest because of their flexible installation at low lost.  This research made major advancements in the state of the art of smart structure systems.  First, we proposed a cyber-physical systems approach to co-design the wireless (cyber) and structural (physical) aspects of wireless structural monitoring and control systems, resulting in drastically enhanced structural system performance and efficiency.  Second, we designed a suite of wireless monitoring and control systems and demonstrated their efficacy and efficiency through realistic experiments ranging from damage localization on a full-size highway sign truss to cyber-physical simulations of structural control systems for buildings and bridges.  Finally, we developed the open-source Wireless Cyber-Physical Simulator (WCPS) to support high-fidelity simulations of wireless control systems by co-joining the wireless and structural dynamics in an integrated environment.  We further released the first benchmark model for wireless structural control as open source software.  The availability of WCPS and the benchmark model will accelerate the design and evaluation of wireless structural control systems in the civil engineering community.  This research will facilitate the transformation of our civil infrastructure to smart structures that can be autonomously monitored and controlled leading for higher levels of safety and resilience to hazards.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chenyang Lu"
