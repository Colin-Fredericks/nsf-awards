 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop nanoparticle-based lubricant additives to enhance Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) in high-energy grinding.   Nanoparticle-based lubricant additives for specific applications will first be synthesized.  Then a special system to deliver tribofilms at the tool-workpiece interfaces for selective lubrication will be developed.  This technology is expected to significantly reduce friction and heat generation at the machining interface, resulting in excellent surface finish and reduced thermo-mechanical damage while maintaining surface integrity of machined parts.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide nanoparticle-based lubricant additives and a delivery system for reduced cost, improved quality, and increased energy saving in a broad range of aggressive machining applications.  This technology will also facilitate the replacement of re-circulating lubricant systems, which are sources of variation and significant waste streams.",

In current practice, MQL is not widely used in these applications due to oil starvation /burnoff, consequent poor tool life and machined surface integrity. The goal was to improve MQL oil delivery and durability by designing and synthesizing nanoparticles (nanolubricant A, C, and D) integrated with environmentally safe organic agents, and then understanding their behavior at machining interface. The project execution was undertaken by a team of researchers from NanoMech (expertise - nanomanufacturing), academia (expertise &ndash; nanotechnology and machining), and their key manufacturing industry collaborators.
