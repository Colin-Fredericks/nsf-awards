 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) entitled \"NUE: Using Peer-to-Peer Support to build NEMS and Consider SEE Implications of Nanotechnology\", under the direction of Dr. Sumita Pennathur, is to prepare a new generation of well-rounded and educated engineers who are skilled in using cutting-edge nanofabrication tools and processes to build nanoscale systems (such as NEMS) and nanoscale devices.  To do this a set of three new courses and a modification to an existing course will be developed. Two of the courses will increase a UCSB undergraduate's ability to build nanoscale devices and systems (NEMS), and the third, a new course will focus on their communication skills.  Also proposed to be implemented is a high school education program that pairs high school students with undergraduate mentors who are enrolled in the NEMS class to enhance the communication skills of UCSB engineers.\r\n\r\nThe UCSB program will accelerate advances in nanotechnology via educational pathways across a broad range of sciences.  Intensive, hands-on training in nanofabrication techniques building NEMS and through research experiences will prepare engineers for this exciting field.",
