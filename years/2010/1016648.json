 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent cancer genome sequencing projects and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have underscored the principle that complex phenotypes like cancer or disease susceptibility do not result from single DNA sequence variants in the same gene in all individuals.  Rather, the inherited or somatic variants responsible for these phenotypes affect multiple genes in cellular signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways.  New genome sequencing technologies are now providing measurements of these sequence variants in large numbers of samples, while other technologies are measuring whole-genome networks of interactions between genes. There is an urgent need for computational techniques to identify pathways, or groups of genes, that are associated to a phenotype.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop robust algorithmic and statistical techniques for four challenges in the analysis of DNA sequence variants in the context of known and novel gene-gene interactions. (1) Incorporating prior knowledge of gene interactions.  This project develops a diffusion model to determine subnetworks of a genome-scale interaction network that are enriched for genetic variants across multiple samples.  (2) Deriving robust statistical tests to overcome multiple hypothesis-testing problems in network analysis.  Biological interaction networks containing tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges have an enormous number of subnetworks that might be enriched for variants.  This proposed work will design techniques to evaluate multiple candidate subnetworks with rigorous bounds on the false discovery rate.  (3) Performing de novo identification of gene groups without an interaction network. The proposed work will examine combinatorial approaches to extract subsets of altered genes without prior knowledge of their interactions.  These approaches will leverage the increasingly large number of sequenced samples that are becoming available.  (4) Implementation of algorithms for evaluation on biological data from two applications: (a) somatic mutations identified in cancer genome sequencing studies, and (b) rare genetic variants in human association studies.  These applications will be conducted in collaboration with two biomedical research groups.  \r\n\r\nAlgorithms developed in this proposal will be implemented and released as open-source software for use by the biological and medical community. The project will partially support the training of graduate students, and undergraduates will be involved in implementing proposed algorithms.  Finally, research from this project will use incorporated as pedagogical examples in multiple undergraduate and graduate courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIdentifying the genetic variants responsible for particular phenotypes, or traits, is one of the greatest challenges in biology. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have transformed genetics by providing comprehensive measurements of all the germline, or inherited, variants in an individual\u00c6s genome, or all the somatic variants that arise during the lifetime of an individual and lead to cancer and other diseases. Application of these technologies to large number of human genomes and cancer genomes has shown that complex phenotypes like cancer or disease susceptibility are not the result of single genetic variants, but rather by combinations of variants in multiple genes.  Analyzing these combinations is not a straightforward task, as there are typically an exponential number of possible combinations that must be considered.  Thus, computational approaches are needed to help address this challenge.\n\nIn this project, we developed several computational approaches to identify and characterize combinations of DNA sequence variants that are associated to particular phenotype.  Our algorithms used a variety of strategies.  For example, in one approach we used prior knowledge of biological interactions between genes, represented in the form of an interaction network.  We developed approaches to find connected subnetworks of this large network that contained genetic variants in more individuals than expected by chance.  In another approach, we did not use any prior biological knowledge of interactions, but rather relied a statistical pattern of anticorrelation between genetic variants.   \n\nOne of the primary applications of our algorithms was to help address a key challenge facing current cancer sequencing projects: distinguishing the driver mutations response for cancer from passenger mutations that accumulate by chance during the lifetime of an individual.  Several of the algorithms developed in this project were applied to large cancer sequencing datasets in collaboration with cancer researchers.  This analysis revealed combinations of putative driver mutations, and these results were published in leading scientific journals.  In addition, we implemented the algorithms developed in this project into user-friendly, open-source software packages that are available to researchers. \n\nThe algorithms that we have developed are not specific to applications in biology.  For example, our approaches could also be adapted to analyze other types of network data, such from social networks or information networks (e.g. the Internet).   \n\nFinally, this project supported the research and training of multiple undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.
