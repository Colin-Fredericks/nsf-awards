 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds ongoing curatorial activities at the Marine Geology Laboratory at the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University (OSU/COAS). The repository's mission is to archive and distribute geological samples, predominantly sediment cores, rocks, nodules and sediment trap samples, for scientific research and education. It was established in 1972 and since that time 14,870 meters of sediment samples, 10,185 rock samples, 2,200 deep-sea manganese nodules, 1,597 sediment trap samples, 693 plankton tow samples, and other materials have been archived and described with continuous NSF funding. In the past three years, the collection of sediment cores has grown by over 550 m and more than 34,488 samples were distributed to scientists, educators, and museums throughout the United States and around the world. Funding is requested to support ongoing operation and maintenance, and to work toward the long-range vision of the new repository management team. In addition to serving the marine geoscience community, the repository is involved in a variety of education and outreach activities for students and the general public.",
