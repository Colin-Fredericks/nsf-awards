 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications (BMSA) is a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences.  Through studies and workshops, the Board's 20 pro bono experts help to ensure that the nation's decision making is based on strong mathematical analysis and reliable computational simulations.  BMSA reports issued in 2009 documented best practices in uncertainty management for remotely sensed climate data; identified needs of the U.S. forensic science enterprise, including new statistical research; reviewed NSF's program in Vertical Integration in Graduate Research and Education; and documented technical capabilities necessary for the regulation of systemic risk in the financial sector. \r\n\r\nThe current grant will enable to Board to launch and oversee new studies on mathematical foundations of verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification; enlarging the toolkit for analysis of massive data; preparing the mathematical sciences for the coming decades; and evaluating the macroeconomic effects of our aging population.  Funding will also support BMSA efforts to build stronger ties between the mathematical sciences and other communities of science, engineering, and public policy, through Board meetings and the activities that are initiated at those meetings.",
