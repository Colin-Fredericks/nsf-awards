Connolly and Nathan Goodale of Hamilton College will acquire and operate a high-performance Beowulf-style computing cluster.  This computing cluster will enable faculty in the departments of chemistry, physics, biology and anthropology to employ cutting edge computational technology in their research labs and classrooms. Research projects to be investigated include studies of the eukaryote tree of life, development of new tools for the study of dark energy, studies of infrared galaxies, examination of ribonuclease catalysis and a survey of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors.\r\n\r\nA computing cluster is a group of linked computers that work in concert to achieve vastly more computational power than the individual machines.  These clusters make it possible to solve complex problems in areas such as molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analysis that require extensive computational power.  The computational infrastructure made available by this award will be used in sophisticated research projects and in courses across a variety of disciplines introducing numerous undergraduate students at Hamilton College to scientific computing.",

We are using a variety of methods for analysis from portable X-ray fluorescence to measure the elemental composition of stone and mathematical models of morphology to examine potential evolutionary relatedness.  With both types of analyses we are able to gain valuable insight into how humans used stone technology in the past.  Archaeology majors at Hamilton College have greatly benefited from the HPC facilities.  Four of the six students that have been part of the Goodale group are either attending or have been accepted to graduate school and one other has a teaching fellowship for the 2013-2014 academic year. \n\n \n\nChemistry\n\nOur work has focused on understanding how small molecules, i.e. drugs, interact and bind with their protein targets.
