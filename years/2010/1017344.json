 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project revolves around tumbling which is an exciting area of robotic locomotion that takes advantage of ground-body interactions to achieve high mobility on smaller scales when compared to conventional methods.  Additionally, the required hardware complexity to produce such locomotion is very low.  In this respect, tumbling can be viewed as a minimalistic approach to producing miniature mobile robots capable of traversing complex and dynamic terrains.  Due to the nature of tumbling however, the added mobility comes at the price of increased control complexity.  The minimalistic nature of tumbling robots generally results in underactuated systems that exhibit nonholonomic constraints which greatly complicate the motion planning problem.  Additionally, tumbling often involves time-varying supports and sliding contacts with the ground.  Ultimately, this research views tumbling as a largely unexplored yet promising area of research.  This work addresses the intricacies of tumbling locomotion. Specifically, we are developing general planning algorithms for tumbling robots and identify important design characteristics of tumbling robots that lead to simplified control.  \r\n\r\nSeminars and workshops to bring together practitioners, end-users, researchers, and policy makers will be organized to have the maximal impact. Web-based dissemination of the algorithms and rapid prototyping/simulation tools ensure that the results of this project reach all communities. Students trained in this project participate in the US FIRST competitions, summer mentoring programs for high school students, summer schools in robotics, and other outreach programs.",

The Adelopod (built as part of this grant) is a tumbling robot that utilizes its arms and consecutive somersaults to move about in land. One big challenge for the Adelopod is its path planning on land. While tumbling proves an effective way to overcome obstacles that are large relative to its size, path planning is very challenging and an ongoing problem. The Adelopod moves by transitioning between the different stable configurations and polygonal faces on its shell. An effective motion planner for a tumbling robot should leverage this characteristic to predict the robot motion, rather than try to fit the robot motion to the incompatible wheeled vehicle model or fit any weighted Euclidean cost to generic changes in position and orientation. Using gait patterns for path planning is a useful formulation since it harnesses both the discrete and continuous traits of tumbling locomotion. While holding a given contact point set, the robot axis of rotation, position, orientation and velocities for the above sustains continuous changes, while upon a change in contact point set or initiation of tumbling there is a sudden, discrete change in the aforementioned states. Predicting motion between jumps in contact points is reliable since the motion is limited by the shape of the body. Defining the nodes of the state transition map simply based on contact point set and actuator position is a natural classification, inherent to the robot design since those are the stability points. If the nodes had been defined based on the orientation of the body and arms, the 3-axis orientation and the arm angles, each of these states would have to be discretized in order to do so. In addition to creating a much larger number of states, the interpolation between the orientation states would not necessarily be accurate and the robot would not necessarily even be stable from these node points. The methods for analyzing the state of a tumbling established in this work set up a useful framework for novel investigations in tumbling navigation. Tracking the position of the center of mass, its motion across the resting face, and the deformation of the resting face lends useful feedback data. In order to develop a state transition map, many more experiments will have to be conducted where the robot begins from every possible starting configuration and actuation direction, with reasonable resolution in starting angle of the actuators. The quantity of new data will require more autonomous methods of pattern recognition for grouping gaits, wherein the distance between different gait patterns will have to be assessed in order to create a grouping. A method utilizing the procrustes distance and K-means was partially developed to this end, where two gait curves have a low distance if only a very small deformation is required to superimpose them. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to define control for any tumbling locomotion. The system developed till now is not sufficiently general to this endeavor, a more complete formulation of tumbling locomotion would require analysis of different casing shapes and their effect on locomotion. The chosen experimental setup is amenable to this variation.. Though in our current work the role of the orthographic projection was only as a means of deciphering the axis of rotation, the importance of this projection will be more clear when terrain is involved. The position of the center of mass within the projection polygons gives insight into the forces acting on the robot at a given point in time. The closer the robot center of mass projection is to the axis of rotation, the closer the robot is to an unstable tumbling event. Once the center of mass crosses the pivot axis, the robot will fall onto that polygonal face or onto whatever actuator is impeding such motion. Toward applying these navigation techniques to a physical robot, investigation needs to be made into useful forms of feedback to update the position estimation for the physical system. Feedback could be provided by video of the tumbling robot from an outside observer that finds a pose estimate that can be used along with the current ground plane projection estimate to rectify the robot pose estimate using Kalman filtering or other methods.
