 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sensor Signal and Information Processing (SenSIP) consortium at the Arizona State University (ASU) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled \"Net-Centric Software and Systems\" which currently is a multi- university Center comprised of the University of North Texas (lead institution), and the University of Texas at Dallas. The mission of SenSIP at ASU is to develop signal and information processing foundations for next-generation integrated multidisciplinary sensing applications in biomedicine, defense, energy, and other systems. \r\n\r\nASU requests funding for becoming a third site of the NSF Center for Net-Centric Software and Systems under the leadership of Professor Andreas Spanias. ASU will bring to the existing Center much needed complementary capabilities in the areas of digital signal and image processing, multimedia systems, sensor networks, information theory and wireless communications. The proposed site will enable the creation of new capabilities in sensor signal processing and will bridge the gap between sensor development and large scale sensor deployment; and, is uniquely positioned to promote industry research, education, scholarship that will integrate well with the existing Net-Centric I/UCRC umbrella. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will advance the development of signal processing and communication technologies for sensing systems. The proposed research activities at this site are expected to lead to inexpensive, compact, and reusable sensors for industry applications of relevance to medicine, sustainability, entertainment, and defense. The proposed site has several dissemination programs and established structures for recruiting students from underrepresented groups, involving undergraduate students in research, and mechanisms to create and package online modules with interdisciplinary research and education content.",
