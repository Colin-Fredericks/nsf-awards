 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to strengthen K-8 geoscience education in the state of Georgia through the use of an innovative but underutilized weather science and safety curriculum, the Red Cross Masters of Disaster (MoD) curriculum. The principal investigators are conducting a series of week-long professional development workshops in the summer of 2011 and 2012 for approximately thirty (30) science teachers in each of three selected county groups (Bibb, Brantley/Glynn, and Calhoun) of Georgia that are socio-economically and climatologically vulnerable to severe and extreme weather conditions. The workshops focus on teaching teachers about the Red Cross MoD weather science and safety curriculum for K-8 students. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the workshops will determine impact on teacher learning, and eventually on what students learn, how much they learn, and what knowledge they take home with them when teachers deliver the MoD curriculum after attending the workshop. Smaller scale versions of these workshops, offered for the past two years at the University of Georgia with support by a Teacher Quality grant, have indicated that these workshops have much promise in increasing science teacher's weather and climate literacy.  It is expected that this project will provide useful data on the effectiveness of the MoD curriculum to increase students' knowledge of weather science and safety and to promote a culture of weather safety in students and their families.",

The weather workshop website describing the project can be found at this web address:  http://www.weathersafety.net.  Our objectives in the this training were to educate teachers about weather science and safety using the Master of Disaster (MoD) curriculum, to build their sense of confidence in providing weather science and safety instruction to their students, and to assess the teachers\u00c6 increases in weather science and safety knowledge as a result of attending the workshop.  The data we collected about the workshop effects indicated that teachers did feel more efficacious about providing weather science and safety instruction to their students and did make gains in their knowledge about the science and safety of lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods.  In addition to the workshop training, we wanted the attending teachers to both share the MoD curriculum with their teacher colleagues and to teach the curriculum to their students.  We gave teachers additional copies of the MoD curriculum kits to share. \n\nWe observed a portion (13.6%) of the teachers who attended the workshop in their use of the curriculum at their schools one to two years after their workshop participation.  The teachers utilized the curriculum well, making use of its educational features and components.  With regard to sharing the curriculum with teachers other teachers, our follow-up survey showed that 26 teachers indicated that they discussed the curriculum with a total of 203 other teachers.  Thirty two teachers who responded to our tracking indicated that they provided 178 MoD lessons on lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods (approximately 5.6 lessons per teacher) and used the MoD curriculum somewhat to much in their lesson delivery.  Taken together, the teachers estimated that they provided direct instruction to 2465 Georgia students.  The teachers estimated that they their colleagues used the curriculum to reach another 3096 students, for a total of 5568 students who were exposed to the MoD weather science and safety curriculum.  The performance by a sample of 291 students on comprehensive tests of the science and safety aspects of lighting, tornadoes, hurricanes, or floods i..."
