Working in close collaboration with the University of Kentucky?s Center for Visualization, the Principle Investigator at this primarily undergraduate institution will conduct research in to develop advanced computational models for deteriorating images on unstable and disintegrating media. A successful solution will produce a framework to non-destructively acquire and preserve vast collections of photographic records created from the early 1900s to the 1950s.  At the same time, it will provide economic alternatives to memory institutions and research institutions that rely upon the content of the photographs for a variety of scholarly purposes.",

This includes the estimated original photographic content, before deterioration made this impossible with normal scanning techniques, and removing distortions due to the change in shape of the negatives.  Results of this non-destructive restoration pipeline have been presented at the Library of Congress and professional historical document venues.\n\nAs part of the findings of this project, a new 3D scanning technique has been developed for materials that can transmit light.
