 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test the hypotheses that mountains have endemic biodiversity in reptile and amphibian fauna because they i) facilitate speciation at a given geographic scale because of topographic and environmental complexity, and ii) provide opportunities for increased population persistence and isolation under climatic fluctuations. This research combines field work in poorly explored highland regions of Brazil, collection data, species distribution models, comparative phylogeography, studies of microhabitat use, and physiological experiments. While generating new and much needed data about a poorly known tropical region and its fauna, this project expands and tests the generality of a process-based method of biodiversity prediction formalized in the PI's postdoctoral work on lowland diversity in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThis project will inform research priorities and conservation in montane regions of the Brazilian Atlantic forest hotspot and provide important baseline data for assessing responses to future climate change. Education and training opportunities to CUNY undergraduate and graduate students will encourage students from underrepresented groups to participate in this project. Collaborations between US and Brazilian institutions will be strengthened and will lead to new advances in science and conservation in Brazil and the tropics.",

Why are they so special? Environmental factors known to influence the number of species that a region can hold (such as environmental complexity, area, energy, and humidity) cannot explain why montane regions are so uniquely diverse. To begin answering this question, we combined extensive field work in the mountains of the threatened yet megadiverse Brazilian Atlantic rainforest (Fig. 1), DNA sequencing, and forest modeling to understand the distribution and the genetic diversity of 11 species of montane amphibians and reptiles found nowhere else in the world. Our study organisms included the delicate glass-frogs in the genus <em>Vitreorana</em> (Fig. 2), and the lizards <em>Placosoma</em>, <em>Colobodactylus</em>, <em>Heterodactylus</em>, and <em>Caparaonia</em>. Through field excursions to previously underexplored areas, we inventoried the amphibian and reptile fauna of more than 10 distinct localities and collected specimens of all local species. These field trips discovered four species new to science (two examples in Fig. 3). With the locality data that we gathered, combined with the DNA information collected from field specimens, we were able to solve an important piece of the puzzle of why mountains are so unique: our data indicate that these montane regions have been very stable, from a climatic perspective, over the last 120,000 years (Fig. 4); this allowed the local fauna to persist, and diversity to accumulate, over time. Today, each one of these mountains holds unique genetic lineages that merit research and conservation, as shown by our DNA analyses (an example in Fig. 5).</p>\n<p><br />We also documented the prevalence of pathogens that may threaten some of the montane fauna in Brazil. More specifically, we focused our attention on the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, which has been tied to amphibian population declines worldwide. Our findings show that pathogen loads are strikingly different between the montane southern forests (where they are considerably higher) and the mid-elevation forests of the north. These results indicate that the montane forest frogs may be at higher risk of chytrid-related declines, and pinpoints priority regions for research.</p>\n<p><br />On a topic particularly important in the face of global warming, we established a protocol to measure how Brazilian montane and lowland species respond to present-day temperature changes.

Our results showed that the montane species are able to tolerate more frigid conditions relative to the lowland species, yet both have similar critical maximum temperatures &ndash; especially after acclimation.
