 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid wireless network combining ad-hoc network and infrastructure network increases the throughput capacity of wireless networks. In spite of the tremendous technological advances in hybrid networks over the last few years, few routing protocols have been provided particularly to fully exploit the dual-faceted nature of hybrid networks. For reliable routing, routing schemes depend on reputation system to choose trustworthy relay nodes. However, most traditional reputation systems are not sufficiently effective and efficient. This project is devoted to the research of highly efficient and reliable routing to increase the capacity of hybrid wireless networks by synergistically leveraging the dual-faceted nature of ad-hoc and infrastructure networks. The project has four components:  (1) Distributed three-hop routing mechanism (DTR). DTR avoids the fundamental problems in the previous routing approaches; (2) Integrated global reputation and account management system (GRAM). GRAM relies on a hierarchical structure for efficient global reputation information collection and query; (3) Locality-aware P2P-based infrastructure (LP2P). LP2P is innovatively constructed and integrated into the hybrid network for efficient operation of DTR and GRAM; (4) Theoretical framework and analysis. A theoretical framework will be established to investigate the impact of different factors on the proposed mechanisms, and on the network capacity and performance. Understanding and insight gained as a result of this project will be disseminated through technology transfer to industry partners, in addition to publication and software release channels.  The multi-disciplinary nature of this research also lends itself to cross-disciplinary education and well-rounded training of students. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
