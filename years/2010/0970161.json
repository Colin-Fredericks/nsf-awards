 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Casimir force acts between two bodies placed in empty space (vacuum). According to the laws of modern physics the vacuum is not an absolute emptiness, but is filled with an infinite number of virtual particles. The Casimir force results from the modifications of the properties of these virtual particles due to the presence of the two bodies.  Thus its value and nature is critically dependent on the shape and geometry of the bodies. The last five years have seen rapid theoretical advances in the area of the dependence of the effect on simple geometry, motivated in part by our demonstration of the lateral Casimir force for sinusoidally corrugated surfaces (gratings). For such gratings, the diffraction-like coherent scattering effects of the virtual photons cannot be predicted by standard theories which merely add up the effects of  small sections of the interacting bodies. Our objectives are to completely map the coherent scattering of virtual photons in the lateral Casimir force with both sinusoidal and saw toothed (blazed) gratings. Many applications for such lateral Casimir forces for bringing about noncontact lateral translations in nanoscale gears and rack and pinion systems have been predicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI has been involved with many synergistic activities of broader impact.  He has mentored two K-12 students, 12 undergraduates (7 minority), 8 graduate students and 6 postdoctoral fellows in lab research.  Funding for mentoring one minority undergraduate and graduate student is requested. UCR is a minority institution. The PI's research is published in leading journals and has also been reported in many public announcements. The PI has developed teaching modules for high school and community college students as part of a NSF funded project. He has co-organized five workshops.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nReduction of Residual Electrostatic Forces in Casimir Force Measurements by In Situ Ar Ion Bombardment\n\nStudies of the Casimir force have undergone rapid progress, due to its importance in fundamental physics as well as nanotechnology.  The archetypal Casimir force originates from modifications of the quantum zero point photon spectrum due to the presence of two perfectly conducting  ideal metal plates, whose separation sets the allowed modes.  Alternatively, the Casimir force can be described as the retarded interaction of charge and current fluctuations induced by photons.  In going from ideal metal plates to normal metal plates, early theoretical approaches neglected the imaginary terms in the permittivity.  However the use of the complete properties of real material boundaries which include finite dissipation for zero point photons scattering from free electrons have now been realized to lead to both puzzling theoretical and experimental inconsistencies. The precision of the experiments have steadily improved challenging our understanding of zero point photon scattering from real materials.  Primarily, experiments for distances below 1 micron  have consistently shown that inclusion of material losses are not in agreement.  Experiments largely above 1micron report agreement with theory including material losses. A key difference in the room temperature Casimir force at the different length scales is the role of thermal photons which play an increasing role at larger separations.  This disagreement raises a fundamental question on the nature of zero point photon scattering from real materials as compared to that of thermal photons.\n\nVarious factors such as the use of approximations and the role of roughness have been ruled out as the cause of the disagreement. Residual electrostatic forces due to patch potentials have been suggested as another possibility to explain the discrepancy.  Precision experiments of the Casimir force have required that the residual potential between the two surfaces V&shy;_0 be independent of separation to confirm the negligible role of large surface adsorbates.  Surface adsorbates are commonly removed in situ by use of ions directed at the surface.  In this review period we proposed and demonstrated the use of an Ar+ ion gun to in situ clean the interacting Au surfaces and reduce the residual electrostatic force.

Low beam voltage was chosen in order to reduce the effect of mixing of elements as well as the etching effect that higher-energy ions could cause.
