 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nFunds are provided to renovate research space in the Brown Hall Science building at East Tennessee State University. The proposed renovations will increase safety, security, and energy efficiency in the laboratories of a large number of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics and Astronomy. This aging building serves the instructional, research and research training purposes of these three departments, and much of the research conducted in the building occurs in space that was not originally designed for that purpose. The renovations will consolidate three faculty computer research laboratories and a number of instrument facilities in one part of the building. It will involve three components, namely, (1) consolidating computer research laboratories on the first floor of the south wing of the building and installing additional and isolated electrical circuits, additional HVAC equipment and appropriate temperature alarms, and emergency power for these, as well as for instrument rooms in the same part of the building; (2) reassignment of biology and chemistry research laboratories within the building and renovation to install needed facilities, such as fume hoods, controlled heating and lighting, and, where necessary, emergency power; and (3) upgrading of fume hoods and casework, including chemical-resistant countertops in a number of research laboratories. These improvements will contribute to the continued productivity of a minimum of 20 faculty members in the three departments, as well as their postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate research.",
