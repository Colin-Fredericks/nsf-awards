 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental evidence supports the idea that seed oil composition, the relative proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in seed oils, has adapted to temperature such that the melting point of the seed oil is lower in plants that live in colder climates. The aim of this research is to determine the genetic basis of adaptive differences in seed oil composition and tie them to specific ecological selective pressures. Using genetic and molecular techniques, the individual genes underlying the variation in this complex trait will be identified and the adaptive value of different alleles tested. This project will be one of the first to identify the genetic variation responsible for the evolution of a complex trait.  \r\n\r\nPlant oils are one of the most energy rich forms of organic carbon; they are widely utilized for human nutrition, industrial products, and biofuels. Understanding how oil composition has evolved in response to temperature may help us engineer oil composition for industrial purposes such as improving cold temperature performance of biodiesels and reducing unpalatable fatty acids in food products. Evolutionary knowledge of seed oil composition led to the discovery of low saturated fat wild sunflowers, which were used to produce commercially available low saturated fat sunflower lines. This project will provide undergraduates with research opportunities in evolutionary genetics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeed oil composition, the relative proportions of the fatty acids in seed oils, determines the melting point of the oils.  Seed oil melting point may affect the way a seed germinates under different temperatures, which in turn could affect the relative fitness of the plant, particularly if it is in strong competition with neighbors.  One hypothesis suggests that during competition at different germination temperatures, a trade off exists between total energy stores in a seed and the rate at which that energy can be used.  Saturated fatty acids provide more total energy per carbon to the seed but increase the melting point of the oil, so they should be favored at higher germination temperatures.  In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids have less energy per carbon but should be more readily accessed at lower temperatures due to their lower melting points. \n\n \n\nAs predicted by the hypothesis, seed oil composition varies geographically; seed oils for plants at higher latitudes where it is cooler have lower melting points&mdash;primarily from increasing their proportion of unsaturated fatty acids&mdash;than oils for plants from lower latitudes.
