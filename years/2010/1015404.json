  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWireless Monitoring of Bridge Cables\n\nAuthor: Jeffrey D. Bergman\n\n \n\n            Modern infrastructure relies heavily on bridges to ease the transportation of people and goods across river, gorges and other obstacles.  As such monitoring the health of bridge systems is crucial to maintaining safe and reliable transportation systems.  Current methods for monitoring bridge health are primarily based on visual inspection by trained inspectors; a practice that can suffer from a high degree of subjectivity.  Thus, sensors are now being deployed on bridges in order to improve the objectivity of the inspection process.  However, the high cost of traditional wired data acquisition systems (DAS) has lead to the development of wireless data acquisition systems to provide low cost sensing on large structures.  This project looked specifically at using the iMote2/SHM-A system, a commercially available wireless DAS, to indirectly monitor the tension in the inclined cables of cable stayed bridges.\n\n            The indirect monitoring of cable tension is carried out in the following manner.  First, ambient vibration data is collected from a sensor, typically and accelerometer, located on the cable.  This data is then processed using a fast fourier transform and peak picking algorithm to extract the natural frequencies of the cable.  Finally the natural frequency is combined, along with other parameters such as cable length, weight and sag, with formulas for estimating cable tension based on taught string theory.  For the purposes of this project a series of equations developed by Zui were used for tension estimation.\n\n            This research was carried out at the National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering located at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan.  This location was chosen for the research project to coincide with several tests being carried out on a bridge cable test bed by the Dr. C.H. Loh, allowing for collaboration in performing tests on the iMote2/SHM-A DAS.  Prior to the tests several weeks were spent gaining a familiarity with the iMote2/SHM-A software which was provided for research purposes by the Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project.  During this time an attempt was made to program the iMote2/SHM-A system to automatically estimate the tension in a cable.  This attempt was unsuccessful, however, and cable tension estimation was instead done in post processing.\n\n            The test bed for these experiments consisted of a single steel cable connected to a reaction wall at one end and supporting a cantilevered truss on the other.  This system was designed to mimic the dynamics of an inclined cable on a cable stayed bridge.  For the purposes of this experiment the iMote2/SHM-A system was collocated with a wired DAS on the cable with both systems oriented to monitor the vertical acceleration of the cable.  A load cell was also placed on the cable in order to directly monitor the tension in the cable.  The data collected from a series of induced free vibrations in the cable was then used to estimate the tension in the cable and compare the result to the average tension of the cable as recorded from the load cell.  The opportunity was also taken at this time to compare the data from the wireless iMote2/SHM-A system with that from the wired DAS.\n\n            Overall this research project was fairly successful.  Both the wired DAS and the iMote2/SHM-A system were successfully able to estimate the tension in the cable within three percent of the average tension as measured by the load cell.  In addition, comparison of the iMote2/SHM-A data with that of the wired DAS showed that the two data sets matched well but not perfectly with the differences being most likely due to calibration and conversion errors.  Thus, despite the failure to develop a working automated tension estimation program for the iMote2/SHM-A system the project showed that it was a viable system for estimating the tension in inclined cables.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey D Bergman"
