 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: Development of very high speed nanoscale magnetic devices in which current induced spin torque is used to initiate and control ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: In antiferromagnets the sublattice moments are coupled via strong exchange fields that cause the frequencies of the spin-wave modes to be in the 1.0-3.0 terahertz range, and, consequently, spin dynamics in antiferromagnets evolve on sub-picosecond time-scales. Antiferromagnets offer the promise of increasing the operating speeds of magnetic devices by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The proposed research aims to develop a new family of nanoscale magnetic devices, such as oscillators and switches, in which current induced spin torque is used to initiate and control spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic spin valves. The research proposed here is transformative and would not just open new doors for ultrahigh speed nanoscale devices but also contribute significantly towards the understanding of the fundamental material science and spin physics of antiferromagnets.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed project will support the research of two graduate students and two undergraduate students at Cornell University and provide a rich set of areas for graduate student research. The PI will introduce a new 2-3 credit hour freshman/sophomore level course related to nanosciences with the goal of attracting freshmen/sophomores to related disciplines. The PI and the graduate students will participate in Cornell's K-12 outreach efforts by developing an introductory workshop on nanostructures, with a laboratory component, for high school students. Under a USAID international development program the PI will help organize teacher training workshops in Pakistan.\r\n\r\n.",
