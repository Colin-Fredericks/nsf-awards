 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how four different terrestrial ecosystems from the southwestern US, from high desert grassland to subalpine prairie, respond to increased temperature and altered precipitation, using experimental treatments that simulate the expected future climate in 100 years. These treatments have been imposed for nearly a decade and are planned to continue for a decade more, creating a long-term climate change experiment across multiple ecosystem types. The goals of this project are to test whether the initial responses of these ecosystems to simulated climate change are consistent over time, or whether they change over time as the ecosystems adjust to the new climatic conditions. The responses that will be documented include plant growth, carbon cycling and storage, and soil release of greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. \r\n\r\nThis project is important because climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems, but also because these ecosystems affect climate. Therefore, how ecosystems respond will influence the pace and trajectory of future changes in the climate system. The project fills a key knowledge gap, because long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change are especially important for understanding the future climate, but these responses are difficult to document, requiring experiments that last for decades. The project will integrate global change research with science education through provision of competitive undergraduate internships. Outreach activities organized through local conservation organizations will place this research in a broad context accessible to the general public.\r\n",

Are their responses consistent over time, or do they change, initially responding in one way, and later responding in another way? And why might these changes over time occur? This project examined these questions using a unique and simple approach of transplanting ecosystems down in elevation, exposing them now to their future climates. The main advantage of this approach are that it is realistic, exposing both above-ground and below-ground parts of the ecosystem to the novel climate, and that it is cost-effective, requiring far less funding to support in the long term. This project examined responses of four ecosystems to long-term climate change treatments from 2002 through 2015. The project's main finding was climate change initially boosted plant growth, but the effect declined over time (see the third figure). This occured because the climate change treatments altered the types of plant species that were present in the plots, and because climate change altered nitrogen cycling - but both of these responses took time to develop. The change in plant species took time, because of the lifespan of the plants involved, and the pace at which they're able to move from one place to another. The change in the nitrogen cycle took time, because ecosystems store large quantities of nitrogen that cycles at different rates, so it takes a while for the nitrogen cycle of the whole system to catch up to rapid change in climate that occurred at the beginning of the experiment. These changes hold valuable and important lessons as we consider how ecosystems respond to climate change, and how those responses shape the future of the atmosphere and climate system.
