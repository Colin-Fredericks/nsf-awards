The physics underlying this process is the diffusive transport of two distal polymer segments to a common location (\"looping\").  Most polymer theories predict that polymer looping reactions do not follow traditional kinetic models, but these predictions have not been fully tested experimentally.  The goal of the proposed research is to characterize semiflexible polymer looping dynamics, using DNA as a model experimental system.  In particular, the PI will test a recent theoretical prediction that semiflexible polymer looping is amenable to a simple description based on Kramers rate theory.  This simple description would greatly facilitate predictions of looping kinetics in practical biopolymer design applications, such as the kinetically-determined processing of DNA nanoparticles for non-viral gene therapy.  Two independent methods of measuring polymer looping rates are proposed.  In the first, a fluorophore will be attached to one end of the polymer and a quencher to the other.  Looping kinetics can then be determined from loop-mediated fluorophore quenching, measured via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS).  The second method uses kinetic competition between looping and a second-order capping reaction.  The proposed research will characterize semiflexible polymer looping, culminating in a model that details the influence of polymer structure on the looping rate.  This deepens our understanding of segmental motion in semiflexible polymers and extends a widely used biopolymer model into applications involving looping.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  A major goal of this project is to train students to think about how polymer physics can be used in interdisciplinary applications such as biomaterials design and molecular biology. The PI has recruited two talented graduate students into the laboratory, and it is expected that the laboratory will soon contain a mix of students at different levels.  The PI is a mentor in the \"Horizons Program\" for at-risk students at Purdue and hopes to attract some of his mentees into his lab.  He will also continue to recruit and retain underrepresented minorities through mentoring, lab tours, and programs supported by the College of Sciences at Purdue University.  In the past, the PI was a director of a mentoring program in a 100% minority public middle school in East Cleveland, Ohio.  He plans to continue outreach with middle school-aged students in West Lafayette, Indiana.  The PI is currently developing an outreach laboratory designed to introduce concepts of \"bottom-up\" materials design to middle school-aged students.  The idea is to challenge the students to design \"co-polymer sequences\" out of macroscopic magnetic and non-magnetic \"monomers\" that are capable of self-assembling into structures, such as loops, knots, and cubes. Modest funding is included in the budget to purchase the materials to make these demonstration kits.  When not in use, the demonstration materials will be made available to K-12 teachers through the department's Physics Outreach Resource Room.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn order for a chemical reaction to take place, the participants in the reaction must first arrive at the same location.  For instance, in order to oxidize (burn) methane, each molecule of methane must literally bump into a molecule of oxygen.\n\nBecause of the requirement that reactants first bump into one another, molecular motion sets an upper limit on how fast chemical reactions can occur.  This limit is called the \"diffusion-limit\".  The diffusion-limit can be used, for instance, by an engineer who is optimizing a reaction to know when the reaction cannot be sped up anymore.\n\nA diffusion-limit for reactions occurring in simple solutions---for example, pure water---was determined in 1917 by a scientist named Marian Smoluchowski.  The \"Smoluchowski limit\", as it has come to be known, has proved extremely useful for interpreting chemical reaction rates in simple homogeneous solutions.  A severe limitation of Smouchowski's limit, however, is that it cannot be applied to complex, heterogeneous environments.  Included in the category of heterogeneous environments are biological environments, such as the inside of a living cell, and industrially important polymer solutions.\n\nThe goal of this project was to extend Smoluchowski's theory to include complex environments such as polymer solutions and biological environments.  This was accomplished through a combination of pen and paper theory, computer simulations, and model laboratory experiments.  These efforts were rewarded in 2013 when we completed a theory that defined the diffusion-limit in heterogeneous environments.\n\nWe expect our theory to impact primarily two communities.  Firstly, biologists are just now learning how to measure reaction rates in living cells.  We expect our theory to be of immediate use in helping to interpret their measurements.  There is also a group of scientist known as \"Systems biologists\" that seek to integrate networks of chemical reactions into holistic descriptions of an individual's physiological state.  Such networks are expected to play a key role in predictive, personalized medicine. A key difficulty in Systems biology is the unknown reaction rates.  The theory that we developed can predict these unknown reaction rates and help make Systems Biology possible.  Thus, while our focus was on the fundamental connection between diffusion and reaction rates, our work will benefit society by addressing a technical barrier to personalized health care.\n\nIn addition to our scientific accomplishments this project was an important platform for training the next generation of scientists.  In total four graduate students were supported by this project, three of whom obtained a PhD in 2014 and one of whom obtained a MS degree in 2012.  In addition, five undergraduate students participated in this project, including one student who's work was published in a peer-reviewed journal.  These students have now gone on to take positions in engineering fields, to attend graduate schools, and to research positions in other laboratories.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian A Todd"
