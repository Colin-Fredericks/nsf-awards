 "awd_abstract_narration": "The summer institute on Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) facilitates a rigorous and productive dialogue between theoretical and empirical analysis in political science. While many political scientists are skilled at developing intricate theoretical models of important political phenomena, insufficient attention to the manner in which such efforts can inform empirical work can limit the relevance of this research to important social phenomena. On the other hand, scholars armed with a dataset and a statistics package, but bereft of precise and logically coherent theory, may be unable to provide credible accounts of cause and effect. The EITM research approach is based on the premise that attention to the logical relationships between theoretical models and empirical work can produce improvements in both. Such approaches are inherently more advanced than the courses most departments currently staff. The EITM summer institutes provide participants with unique opportunities to learn and pursue innovative research practices. \r\n\r\nTraining at each institute includes significant teaching and research components, providing students a high degree of individualized interaction with a far wider and deeper array of EITM mentors than are available at any individual institution. Mentoring opportunities and interaction with advanced researchers are repeatedly cited in student evaluations as a primary strength of the EITM Summer Institute. Together, the proposed institutes will create a direct positive impact for over 125 students and 75 junior and senior faculty, their current research, the generation of new research agendas, and human resources, increasing the intellectual capital of the scholarly community as a whole. Other benefits include the dissemination of improved research and internet-based course materials such as EITM syllabi, lecture notes, homework exercises, demonstrations, replication datasets, and working papers. Such activities can increase the social relevance of scientific research.",
