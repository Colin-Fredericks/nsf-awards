The student's participation will be via the 'Symposium on Undergraduate Research'. The students will present the results of their research and discuss these with each other.\r\n\r\nOne broader impact is the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions. A third impact is the networking among these students that will be so vital to their future careers as professional scientists. Also, this meeting encourages them to continue along such a career path.",
