 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe project consists of an upgrade to part of the campus network and to the campus' network connection to the Starlight facility.  This upgrade is designed to support computer science research in networking, visualization and data-mining, primarily at the University's National Center for Data Mining and Electronic Visualization Laboratory.  To that end, the upgraded connection to Starlight will be implemented with 100 Gigabit-per-second networking infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nThe renovation will facilitate research on the development and use of cloud computing and cloud data storage. Developing data management and computing services that scale to very large datasets is a fundamental research problem, as is developing services for visualizing and collaboratively analyzing these datasets.   The renovated network will also provide researchers on campus with remote access to a new magnetic resonance imaging system as well as facilitating participation in the analysis of data from the Large Hadron Collider.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing infrastructure for research, the renovation is likely to enable students from under-represented groups to participate in advanced research, since approximately half of the National Center for Data Mining's Ph.D. students come from underrepresented groups and almost half of the supported research assistants in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory come from underrepresented groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) upgraded its network infrastructure to support larger data sets for research, computation and visualization between UIC and worldwide collaborators.  Through this grant, UIC created a 100 gigabit/s connection to StarLight, one of the largest aggregation points for global research &amp; education high-speed networks in the world.  Additionally, UIC improved connectivity between the east and west sides of campus and extended the high-speed research network to laboratories throughout UIC, which has increased research collaboration inside and outside of UIC.\n \nUIC worked with StarLight, I-WIRE and University of Chicago to make sure its state-of-the-art new network equaled the most advanced research and education networks being developed in the greater Chicago area, the nation, and the world.  As a result, our 100Gbps equipment is housed in the I-WIRE network rack at StarLight, and it matches the Ciena 100Gbps network equipment at University of Chicago. Discussions are ongoing to ensure that these collaborations continue in the future.\n \nMany departments are taking advantage of the new research network.  The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) is a beneficiary with two connected clusters, including the production server for the CAVE2 virtual reality project, a server, and another dozen research hosts, some 56 machines will be connecting at 10Gbps each through access switches to the network.  The Department of Pathology has a lab being installed in College of Medicine West Tower (CMWT) with a video wall that can be connected to EVL and other laboratories throughout the campus. There is a genomics project handling very large data sets that is operating between laboratories in Center for Structural Biology and CMWT.   About two-dozen computers in Science and Engineering Laboratory and Science and Engineering South from the Departments of Physics, Biology and Chemistry are connected as well.  Future projects include collaboration between the Electronic Visualization Laboratory and Library of Health Sciences, and an extension to the College of Dentistry clinics.\n \nAs a specific example of the value of this new network, the Electronic Visualization Laboratory can connect to faster networks for its visualization display systems. EVL\u00c6s new CAVE2 System, completed in October 2012, is a hybrid system that combines the benefits of both scalable-resolution display walls and virtual-reality systems to create a seamless 2D/3D environment that supports both information-rich analysis and virtual-reality simulation exploration at a resolution matching human visual acuity. It is approximately 24 feet in diameter and 8 feet tall, and consists of 72 near-seamless passive-stereo off-axis-optimized 3D LCD panels, a 36-node computer cluster, a 20-speaker surround audio system, a 10-camera optical tracking system and uses the new network to connect to the outside world. For more information, see http://www.evl.uic.edu/core.php?mod=4&amp;type=4&amp;indi=824.\n \n\nThese collaborations are intended to support the UIC scholarly research themes of community disparities, biomedical discovery, and urban resilience and the global environment.   The new network capabilities will allow UIC to advance the study of population health, science and technology education, predictive life science, genetics, genomics, global change, healthcare delivery, and sustainability.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael H Hites"
