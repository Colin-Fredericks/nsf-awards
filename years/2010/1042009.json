 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Michael J. Rose of the California Institute of Technology as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Rose will develop water-splitting catalysts in a collaboration between the laboratories of Prof. Harry Gray and Prof. Nate Lewis.  The goal of the research is to make efficient catalysts for solar fuels conversion, from earth-abundant elements.  In addition, the PI will collaborate with other catalyst experts at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.   For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with teachers and students at John Muir High School in Pasadena, CA to develop hands-on activities for young people -- demonstrating the connections between chemistry and energy.  These activities are being carefully designed to align with California State High School Science Standards.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Rose is aimed at developing alternative technologies to replace fossil fuels.  The particular catalysts that Dr. Rose is investigating do not rely on precious metals, and are likely to have a greater chance of being incorporated into viable, economical approaches at generating fuel from sunlight. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Rose are aimed at enabling the best and brightest young people to pursue careers in science.",
