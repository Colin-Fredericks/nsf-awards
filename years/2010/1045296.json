 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal explores effective solutions to RAM scraping attacks in \r\nthe context of data management workloads. Recent studies identify   \r\nRAM scraping attacks, wherein an adversary installs malware to steal\r\nmemory resident data, as one of the major causes of data thefts in\r\nenterprise information systems. Proposed research explores \r\nnew vulnerabilities introduced by RAM scraping and develops\r\npractical solutions that offer the right blend of security against such\r\nattacks while keeping performance degradation (due to cost/overhead of\r\nsecurity scheme) within acceptable limits. The research team will explore \r\nrealistic attack scenarios, model adversarial capabilities and constraints \r\nfor typical DBMSs (e.g., small duration repeated attacks, effects of \r\nbuffering and data lifetime, presence of concurrent queries, bandwidth limits,\r\n etc.), design criteria of a risk-aware query optimization that can account\r\nfor a variety of disclosure risks emanating from RAM-scraping malwares;\r\nand develop optimization techniques that simultaneously optimize performance \r\nand reduce disclosure risks. Proposed research also explores the threat of\r\nRAM-scraping attacks for the emerging cloud-based data processing frameworks \r\nlike MapReduce.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research represents the first attempt\r\ntowards a new direction of research , viz. mitigating impact of RAM\r\nscraping attacks in the context of DBMS workloads, that has not been\r\naddressed by the database research community at large. The proposed\r\napproach of redesigning a query optimizer to explore tradeoffs between\r\nperformance and disclosure risks represents a significant innovation in\r\nquery processing and memory management in the database management area.\r\nFurthermore, exploration of RAM scraping attacks in MapReduce style\r\ncloud-based data processing frameworks represents new innovation in cloud\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The results of this EAGER grant will help launch a new line\r\nof research within database security community ? viz., risk aware database\r\nmanagement that balances data exposure risks from RAM scraping attacks with\r\nperformance degradation in a variety of adversarial settings. The proposed\r\nresearch could also make a significant impact on the DBMS vendors and data\r\nservice providers in the emerging cloud computing framework.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~projects/privacygroup/projects.html",
