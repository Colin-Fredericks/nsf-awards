 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) proposes to incorporate surface analysis to civil engineering applications through the use of advanced research equipment and analysis methods. Fundamental research is required to develop measurement, analyses, and implementation tools for surface characterization in civil engineering, where the significant effects of surface texture on system response has been recognized, yet research has been limited. The instrumentation (optical interferometer) will be used to conduct fundamental surface analyses using multiple scales and approaches, representing the first time that surface texture will be determined or correlated to engineering performance for the majority of the test materials. Guidelines will be developed for surface analysis. Recommendations will be provided for production of processed natural materials and manufacture of synthetic materials for desired surface characteristics. Advancements will be enabled in modeling of civil engineering systems with unique surface knowledge that will be obtained. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will improve fundamental understanding of mechanics and micromechanics associated with engineering applications through quantifying surface characteristics with significant new knowledge generated. Significant advancements will be possible in the analysis of interface behavior, fiber inclusions, and pre-, in-, and post-service analyses and forensics for a wide variety of materials through integrated experimental and numerical analyses. The proposed instrumentation will add extensive research capabilities; provide opportunities for advancing ongoing research and enabling new research; add unique capabilities to the research infrastructure to attract external funding; and foster inter- and intra-department collaborations. The proposed activities will provide research training opportunities for a diverse group of faculty and students; attract underrepresented groups (female, first-generation college, and Hispanic students, who constitute a significant percentage of the Cal Poly student body) to engineering; and integration of state-of-the-art research into learning modules for use at Cal Poly (with some of the U.S.?s largest undergraduate engineering departments), other U.S. universities, and internationally.",
