The symposium brings together scientists from around the world in a retrospective and prospective on the use of logics, particularly temporal logic, in computer science.  Amir Pnueli received the Turing Award for his seminal work in temporal logics and computer science. The symposium provides a singular opportunity for faculty, students, and industrial researchers to hear from researchers who are shaping the future of their fields. It is open to all who wish to attend, and video recordings of the talks are made available online for those who are unable to attend in person.",
