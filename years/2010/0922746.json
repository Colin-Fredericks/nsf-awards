Nettleton, and Adah Leshem-Ackerman (Iowa State University)\r\n\r\nCollaborator:  Pietro Spanu [Imperial College (UK)]\r\n\r\nPlant diseases are among the greatest detriments to crop production worldwide.  The plant immune system plays a crucial role in preventing infection by responding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effector proteins delivered by the pathogen.  This project focuses on the well-characterized barley-powdery mildew pathosystem to address fundamental questions in susceptibility and host resistance. \r\n\r\nThe project will build upon the recent discovery of a new monocot-specific family of cysteine-rich peptides, designated blufensins.  Blufensin1 (Bln1) negatively regulates plant defense during fungal infection.  BLN1 is predicted to be secreted, and contains both structural and sequence similarities to knottins, small disulfide-rich proteins characterized by a unique \"disulfide through disulfide knot.\"  The project team will perform comparative analysis of host (barley) versus nonhost (maize and rice) interactions with powdery mildew that define the interactome of cereals with this important fungal pathogen.  Plants silenced for Bln1 will be interrogated by Barley1 GeneChip transcript profiling to identify significant new genes in the regulation of host innate immunity. Complementary investigations will be carried out with international collaborators that lead the powdery mildew genome sequence consortium to isolate powdery mildew effectors, which will then be used to identify important plant targets that promote or suppress defense.  For this, the project will employ a new Xanthomonas type III secretion delivery vector to determine function in plant cells.  Characterization of effectors will be carried out in all three cereals to identify and compare plant genes that govern host and non-host interactions.  High-throughput reverse genetic tools will be utilized to functionally characterize genes identified via the Bln1- and powdery mildew effector-based approaches.  Data will be integrated into PLEXdb (http://plexdb.org/), the unified gene expression resource for plants and plant pathogens, for genetic and regulatory network analysis. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts will be achieved by integrating into the project training and mentoring for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and NSF/NIH CSBSI summer interns in Bioinformatics. International research exchanges in powdery mildew effector prediction (UK) and functional analysis (USA) will enhance the experiences of graduate students and postdocs.  In addition, underrepresented and underserved students in secondary science education will be engaged by partnering with the Des Moines School District to implement a biology classroom module on Gene Expression and Segregation Analysis in agriculture and human health.  Public access to all project data will be fostered through the PLEXdb on-line relational database for gene expression for plants and plant pathogens as well as NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  Thus, this project will promote research, education, and dissemination of results to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of agricultural scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGenomics research helps defeat plant-pathogenic microbes \n\nCrop loss caused by disease remains one of the greatest agricultural challenges in both developed and developing countries.  Pathogenic fungi, viruses, bacteria, insects, and nematodes parasitize agronomic and horticultural crops, as well as commercial and recreational forests.\n\nTo address this challenge, we selected the interaction of the crop plant, barley, with the powdery mildew fungus, to decode the molecular mechanisms of host immunity, with the long-term goal of translating the knowledge gained into building disease resistant plants and increasing global food security.  Diverse species of powdery mildew fungi infect greater than 9,650 plants, but barley and wheat, two agriculturally important grain crops are among the most important that suffer yield loss.  In this model host-pathogen interaction, outcome is determined by the plant response to fungal effector proteins, which enable the pathogen to evade defenses and colonize the host.  Disease is forestalled by the action of barley resistance (R) genes, designated Ml, that respond to corresponding pathogen effectors. Both the 5-Gigabase barley and the 130-Megabase powdery mildew genomes have been sequenced, enabling systems-level analyses.  \n\nThis strategy led to the discovery of the novel blufensin family of cereal-specific peptides, and demonstration that Blufensin1 is a negative regulator of plant defense.  Further investigations identified genes involved in nuclear import and the secretory pathway as being regulated by Blufensin1, plant processes that are critical to the genetic brigade that is activated when fungal pathogens establish their feeding structures in the host. \n\nWe also demonstrated that barley microRNA Hvu-miR398, is regulated by the powdery mildew resistance protein, MLA, plus additional members of its interacting complex.  This unique regulatory element controls the chloroplast copper/zinc superoxide dismutase protein, Hv-SOD1, which then influences barley cell death to halt progression of disease.  This discovery established a previously unrecognized role for microRNAs as regulators of plant defense and was recently featured as the March 2014 cover article for the peer-reviewed journal \"New Phytologist\" http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12598/full .\n\nIn nature, conserved mechanisms regulate many plant-pathogen interactions, and copies of the MLA protein have been shown to govern resistance mechanisms against other important diseases, such as spot blotch and stripe rust in barley, Ug99 stem rust in wheat, and nematodes in rice, thus, these discoveries will lead to broadly applicable control strategies.\n\nOn the pathogen side, genomic and proteomic studies have identified about 540 powdery mildew effector candidates.  A small number of these have been characterized but the molecular mechanisms by which they manipulate host processes are still poorly understood.  We studied 50 of these effector candidates and found eight that are important for development of haustorial feeding structures in the barley host cell.  Some of these genes encode proteins unique to powdery mildews while others show varying degrees of conservation across fungal taxa, illustrating a broader connection between parasitism and fungal ecology.
