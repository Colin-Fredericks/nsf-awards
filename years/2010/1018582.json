The primary intellectual contributions of this project lies in bringing together a diverse set of researchers from across a range of disciplines, all of which intersect around interactive systems for health and wellness. This workshop enables both in-depth discussion with a small group of senior-level individuals and the development and encouragement of a broader range of scholars. Bringing together these researchers during the workshop and during the conference poster session will facilitate interdisciplinary dialogs, creating an environment for critical intellectual exchange. There are short and long-term benefits from supporting this workshop. Focused discussions among senior researchers and practitioners are likely to lead to recommendations for the future directions of research, funding, policy, and education related to systems design of interactive systems for health and wellness. Further, bringing together early stage doctoral students with more senior researchers and practitioners will generate important new research projects and develop the future generation of researchers in this topic. In the long-term, addressing the complex interplay between human, organizational, and technological systems in healthcare has the potential to impact quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health systems throughout America.",
