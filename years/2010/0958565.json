 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is motivated by the need for robust and intelligent clinical procedure of 'catheterization' which is widely used in medical communities. In this research, the fundamental framework to develop active catheters using an electro-active polymer called Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC). The research work includes the design and fabrication methodologies of robotically controlled IPMC catheters as well as shape controls needed for use in complex passages. The research results will be disseminated in technical conferences and workshops as well as prototype demonstration. Knowing that the catheter based medical therapy/diagnosis is one of important medical technologies and all existing catheters in the market are based upon human operations, this active catheter technology will pave the way to a new biorobotic medical tool that can significantly contribute to improving quality of life.",

Feedback control schemes have been developed to demonstrate feasibility of the tube type IPMC for catheterization.  \n\nBroader impacts: Our development of a control model for time dependent end tip displacement of the tube type IPMC will likely to make a considerable impact on a robotic endoscope system for therapeutic and diagnostic reasons.  The robotic catheters can potentially play a pivotal role in the market for medical devices and surgical intervention.  Through this grant, we were able to contribute to build a unique research facility for motion controls for small robotic structures at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).  This will extend UNLV\u00c6s unique research capability in microsystems and soft robots.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Woosoon Yim"
