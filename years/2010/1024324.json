 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project will investigate the English spoken by American Indians in the New York City dialect area to better understand their creation of a pan-Indian ethnolinguistic identity. More generally, this project uses technological and methodological innovations to explore the relationship between language and different levels of identity, particularly as expressed through socially salient phonetic variation. The research will take the study of American Indian English (AIE) out of rural isolation and into the city, where over half of all American Indians live today. Previous scholarship, mostly based on fieldwork from the 1970s in rural communities, claimed that each tribe had a particular version of American Indian English, and borrowing between varieties did not occur. More recent scholarship on similar communities challenges these conclusions. The proposed study will add new evidence to better understand this debate. \r\n\r\nBecause urban Indians are more likely to identify as a single panethnic group, the hypothesis is that they are developing pan-Indian English features, as opposed to the tribe-specific features found in past studies of rural Indian communities. The more integrated that speakers are in the panethnic network, the more likely they are to use the same features of American Indian English. At the same time, those speakers with a strong attachment to their New York identity are expected to use New York City English features to a greater extent. Twenty-five adult speakers who are integrated into the New York City American Indian social network will be interviewed. The phonological features to be examined using instrumental sociophonetic analysis include one traditional feature of New York City English, namely the raising and in-gliding of  the vowel in \"caught\", and two features suggested to be spreading among varieties of AIE: a distinctive prosodic rhythm, and the replacement of the voiceless oral stops /p, t, k/ with glottal stops.",

I was particularly interested in how the creation of a pan-Indian identity would affect language use. However, I determined, with the backing of my dissertation committee, that Jersey City, New Jersey, would be a better community in which to address these questions. While I framed the original grant as a study of a newly formed ethnic community (pan-Indian urban New Yorkers) within a sociolinguistically well-studied location (New York City) so as to study how the formation of an ethnic group affects language, I found that the questions that concerned me most involved the intersection of ethnicity, place, and region. This focus is better served by looking at a geographically marginalized population. Therefore, I shifted my field work to Jersey City, a city of 250,000 people across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan and a geographically close part of the New York metropolitan area.

The Jersey City African Americans and West Indians were the most likely to depart from the NYCE model, which is somewhat in line with newer research. These findings suggest that the relationship between language and place is a complex one. The history of Jersey City suggests a life and identity separate from New York City until very recently, yet some of its speakers share intricate linguistic features with their counterparts across the Hudson.
