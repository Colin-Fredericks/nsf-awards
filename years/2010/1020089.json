 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project transforms an already-useful and innovative curriculum to reach a wider population of students and teachers than anticipated. The curriculum to be transformed effectively builds on a base of core science and math concepts to bring important current science to high school, using a case-based approach that incorporates authentic scientific inquiry. The Biocomplexity and the Habitable Planet curriculum engages high school students in the science of coupled natural and human systems, exploring the complex fabric of relationships between humans and the environment at all spatial and temporal scales. The curriculum is designed to provide material for a year-long capstone course in ecology and environmental science, or two individual modules for semester-long electives. \r\n\r\nPilot and field tests provide preliminary evidence that this material has produced significant student learning. External evaluation during the pilot has yielded two important findings: 1) Teachers have confronted a much more heterogeneous student population than expected at the capstone level. This offers the opportunity to expand the potential audience for the curriculum. 2) Though the previous project has provided supports for teachers and students that address the innovative pedagogy and novel content of the curriculum, this unexpectedly large heterogeneity provides an exciting opportunity to conduct design research to develop effective new curricular scaffolding and contextual supports. In collaboration with CAST, TERC has identified strategies for a transformation and extension of the materials in order to create an enhanced electronic curriculum infused by the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). \r\n\r\nThe project will result in the following deliverables: \r\n1. An e-text based on two of the most requested Biocomplexity units, to provide the following UDL scaffolds: a) Contextual supports for student work with complex quantitative and visual data that include structured data sets, smart graphs, smart images, and other scaffolds to support data analysis; and b) Reading supports, including highlighting tools, embedded glossary, and careful linking of visual and textual data. \r\n2. Multimedia resources for students on challenging core science ideas and on techniques of scientific argumentation, and teacher materials that provide both content and pedagogical support, for all four units. \r\n3. Study and assessment materials for all four units, including a study guide, test items, and glossary. \r\n4. A research article on the effectiveness of contextual supports for scaffolding student understanding of complex data. \r\n5. A white paper for curriculum developers including guidelines for scaffolding student work with complex data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiocomplexity  Project outcomes\n\n \n\nBiocomplexity: Transforming an Innovative High School Curriculum with UDL Scaffolds and Multimedia Resources undertook to transfer an upper-level, capstone course called Biocomplexity to an electronic format using a tool developed by CAST to provide a number of supports for students with a range of different learning styles or disabilities.  \"UDL\" stands for \"universal design for learning,\" and CAST's system has been developed to exemplify the best practices and most effective supports for diverse learners.\n\n The project was ambitious, because the material constituted a year-long course, and it included considerable amounts of new science.  Moreover, the curriculum was case-based:  the students learned the science content and practices in order to propose and argue for a solution to a land-use problem that included both human/social issues and ecological/biological questions. \n\nThe implementation of the UDL version of Biocomplexity was indeed a transformation.  Much of the text had to be revised or rewritten, to fit a Web format.  Supplementary materials (glossary, student response items with prompts, highlighting, long descriptions of all graphics, and so on) had to be written.  A navigation through the curriculum had to be designed, implemented, and tested for quality assurance.   Many new assets were developed, including more than 20 podcasts, several animations, and teacher  PowerPoints for all lessons.  Third-party video assets  and additional graphics were found and permissions obtained.  \n\nA principle area of exploration was ways to scaffold students' interpretation of complex images such as maps, photographs, tables, or graphs.  Our primary aim was to find ways to incorporate some ways that a professional might look at such an image so as to identify data relevant to a question under investigation,  and ignore (for the time being at least) irrelevant elements of the image.  Several mechanisms were developed to assist the student in separating \"signal\" from \"noise.\"   Some of these mechanisms were as simple as formatting a data table to clarify the relationship of data to variables.  Some were more complex and demanding to create, such as highlighting an area on a map or photograph, such that the highlights could be clicked to open and present background information or other guidance to help the student interpret the image.  Drawing tools enable students to annotate an image, and to delineate areas to focus on, perhaps subdividing the image experimentally to examine sub-elements of the complex whole.\n\nWe tested the UDL version of full units curriculum with student focus groups, then in two classrooms (one in PA and one in LA).  In addition, portions of the units were used in local classrooms in MA, which enabled us to observe student use, and the teacher's role.\n\n In these tests, many of the UDL features showed promise across a range of students, though the complexity of the interface presented a challenge for some students.  More important, our field test teachers gave us valuable information about the challenges of using an electronic text in the classroom:  Is the text \"teaching\" the course?  Is the course suitable for self-paced work?  What is the role of the teacher?  We are analyzing data on these questions at the time of reporting, and will publish them in the coming months.  This aspect of our research is likely to be of wide interest to educators , curriculum designers, policy makers, and even publishers, at a time when electronic texts are becoming more widely used, and more sophisticated &mdash; but not necessarily providing an overall improvement in learning, as compared with text books or other kinds of materials.\n\nFinally, our research suggests that in creating electronic texts, especially those with built-in student supports, there are real tensions in designing for inquiry science, which demands that students work out their reasoning (both in small groups and as indiv..."
