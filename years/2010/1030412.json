IEEE PerCom is the premier technical forum in the rapidly emerging and important area of pervasive computing and networking. Graduate student participation in a key conference like IEEE PerCom is extremely important part of graduate education and would help motivate students to engage in research in a variety of pervasive computing aspects. The European venue for the conference will further help US students to interact with European researchers. The grant primarily supports students who will not be able to a attend the conference otherwise.",
