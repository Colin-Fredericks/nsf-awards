 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continues the development of a new class of wireless miniature smart sensor labels that continuously track and record exposure to the environmental conditions, and directly store the sensed data in digital CMOS non volatile memory (NVM) without requiring any battery. These CMOS-sensor chips are able to track temperature (-50\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C), humidity (5% to 100% RH), and shock/impact (50g to 250g), in a total volume of less than 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 0.7mm. The CMOS-sensor chip can be embedded in a standard passive radio frequency identification (RFID) inlay to form a fully integrated multi-sensor environmental condition tracking wireless device that is able to be deployed in a scalable RFID network. A multi-faceted innovative approach in MEMS devices and digital non-volatile memories enables the proposed CMOS-sensor chip. The temperature and humidity sensors fabricated and micropackage processes developed in Phase-I successfully demonstrate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the proposed wireless smart sensor labels. The outcome of the proposed effort meets the form factor, functionality, and price-point requirements of embedded and widely-dispersed sensing, in a broad range of applications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is on several existing industries, larger and more significant impacts on new markets and industries to be formed around this innovative and powerful technical ability. We believe that the existing live/bio material delivery segment can generate up to $500 million yearly sales for Evigia based on our technology directly reducing up to $1.4 billion of vaccine potency destruction each year, and saving up to $150 million yearly of blood plasma being destroyed during transportation. Commercial delivery logistics of sensitive/high-value goods and fresh produce is another large existing market where we can bring direct benefit up to $5 billion yearly in the US based on our smaller, lower cost, batteryless solution being included to monitor shipping quality in a far larger fraction of all packages being shipped in the US. The underlying technology of the proposed effort could be also potentiality employed in development of a broader family of advanced systems including improved diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) which affects millions of Americans annually through sports and other accidental injuries.",

The sensor array elements extract some of the energy for their operation directly from the change in the sensed parameter such as temperature change, humidity absorption, and mechanical impact.  This dramatically reduces electrical energy requirements for sensor operation enabling battery less operation.  The multiple-sensor arrays are fabricated using MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) and semiconductor manufacturing process resulting in low-cost miniature mass produced sensor chips operating wirelessly.   \n\nThe sensor chips developed in this project are able to track temperature (-50C to 70C), humidity (5% to 100% RH), and shock/impact (50g to 250g), in the size of 3mm x 3mm x 1mm (volume smaller than an apple seed).  These sensor chips can be embedded in standard passive radio frequency identification (RFID) inlay to form a fully integrated multi-sensor environmental condition tracking wireless device\n\nThe sensor chips and smart labels developed in this project provide the functionality, performance, price points and form-factors that are demanded in large existing markets such as live/bio material delivery and vaccines, and commercial delivery logistics of sensitive/high-value goods and fresh produce.
