To counter this trend, the project develops contextualized lessons in math with the aim of enhancing student math skills. This project will test whether increased content relevance boosts course retention and academic progress. Based on work at several institutions, the project seeks to improve pedagogical approaches, course design, female and minority student participation, and course articulation at this college and with the region's fourteen local high schools. The work will focus on applied math in five career technical areas (CTE) to 1) develop a one-term community college and a year-long high school math course with contextualized algebra and geometry concepts; 2) conduct an in-depth summer math institute based on the curriculum for regional high school, community college, and industry teaching professionals; 3) integrate the math course into all CTE college curricula; and 4) use the course for dual credit that satisfies State of Oregon diploma requirements as a third-year high school math course.",

The premise of this course development and pedagogical derivation was to create a math course in a sequence of math skill development with a contextualized approach in an attempt to make the math relevant to students in career technical programs.  The raditional math sequence secondary to post-secondary level leads\nto Calculus. However, a relatively small percentage of students go on to\ntake and more significantly, use calculus in everyday work applications. \nAt RCC Associate of Applied Science degree level, CTE students need to be able o use critical thinking to problem solve the functions and real world\napplications of their technical trade.  The traditional Algebra I level\ncourse, MTH60, was taught in the abstract, meaning by formula on the page or hite board only.  MTH63 looks at real-world problems such as calculating\nthe volume of a load of gravel and the number of wheel barrow loads needed\nto distribute the gravel.  The algebraic formula is derived from the\nsituation challenging the students to think through the variable values\nand solve for the unknown.  This math textbook was developed in\nconjunction with RCC CTE faculty who gave Gardner (PI), problems\nthey have regularly in Construction, Manufacturing, Electronics, Diesel,\nand Welding labs.

This\ncontributes to student persistence and to their general self-esteem. \n\n\nThe impact on high school students was similar but divergent as well.  The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) changed the math requirements for high school graduation several years ago.  As of 2014 all high school students will need to take Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II to receive their diploma.  The math specialist at ODE reviewed the RCC MTH63 curriculum and determined that this course could be considered a third year math and therefore an alternative to Algebra II. Several high schools that..."
