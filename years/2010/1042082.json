The effort built on the successes of a previously-funded NUE program at CCNY by extending the accessibility to Nanotechnology Education to the two community colleges.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nStudent Impact\n\nThe project has provided a learning experience to 102 undergraduate students. 33% of the students were students from underrepresented minority groups and 33% were female students. Students involved in the courses at HCC and BCC learned about nanomaterials and nanotechnology, they developed better writing skills, were able to perform literature searches, were interested in continuing a career with emphasis in nanotechnology and transferring to CUNY City College, and agreeed that Nanotechnology is the technology of the future.\n\nCourse Development\n\nDuring the duration of the grant, the following courses were developed and implemented at Hostos Community College: Nanotechnology Workshop and CHE 299 Introduction to Nanomaterial - Independent Study Course and at Bronx Community College: CHM20 Introduction to Nanoscience Course. The BCC course has been adopted as a fulltime elective course. In addition to the course and workshop development, Nanomaterials nuggets were developed that can be used in other science and engineering lectures to generate interest in the newly developed courses.
