 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contributes to the exciting field of geo-stream processing. \r\nSpecifically, an integrated real-time geo-stream processing and monitoring \r\nsystem called AegisDB will be built and the research environment and results \r\nwill be leveraged to stimulate learning at the K-12, undergraduate, and  \r\ngraduate levels. \r\n\r\nThe AegisDB system includes a Geo-Stream Algebra which uses a data-type-\r\nbased approach as opposed to a traditional tuple-based approach for \r\nrepresenting and querying geo-streams. The STREAM data types of the \r\nalgebra unify static data, traditional streams, geo-streams from fixed \r\nlocations, and geo-streams that move. The proposed Aggregate Algebra \r\ngeneralizes the operator GROUP BY to generalized aggregations (GAs) \r\nand bridges the fundamental gap between point observations from sensors \r\nand spatio-temporally continuous phenomena.  Several novel \r\nspatial-centric operator optimization techniques are proposed, \r\nwhich include a velocity-based filtering that utilizes the physical \r\nlimitations of most moving objects and a spatial-coverage-based query \r\ncombination that combines geo-stream queries based on \r\ntheir intended spatial coverage.\r\n\r\nThe proposed AegisDB system will transform the ways to define and monitor \r\nmore sophisticated spatio-temporal events for alerting purposes. The result is \r\nthe significantly improved realtime access to important spatio-temporal events \r\nrelated to our lives by professionals and the general public. The system will \r\nbe critical for important domains including transportation, environmental \r\nscience, hazard monitoring, and emergency responses.  \r\n \r\nThis project has strong education and outreach components.  Environmental \r\nmodels for K-12 teachers and students using real-time environmental datasets \r\nwill be designed. An informal session on how to collect, store, and distribute \r\nenvironmental data will be presented through the Family Fun Science \r\nSaturday events of the Elm Fork Education Center of UNT. A course module \r\non geo-stream processing will be developed. Women and minorities will be \r\nrecruited into the research project. Undergraduate students looking for \r\nresearch opportunities will be mentored. \r\n\r\nFor further information concerning this project see the project web page: \r\nURL: http://www.cse.unt.edu/~huangyan/AegisDB/",
