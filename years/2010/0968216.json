 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCBET-0644968 Putnam  The project will investigate the relationship between capillary morphogenesis and the mechanics of the extracellular matrix where the cells are seeded (in three dimensions). The research will provide important information on the influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics on capillary morphogenesis and provide with a well characterized three-dimensional environment where to study the role of mechanics in cellular behavior (differentiation). The project will study the role of cell mechanics and ECM mechanics on capillary morphogenesis at the macroscale using fluorescence microscopy and sectioning and at the molecular scale using inhibitors to key molecules in the myosin light chain phosphorylation.    \r\n\r\nThe research will have a high impact to the field of tissue engineering by providing information on how vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds can occur and how better  designs can be developed for tissue engineering scaffolds  taking into account the stiffness of the material.  In the long term, the success of the proposed research activity could enhance the understanding of the endothelial matrix's mechanical role in capillary morphogenesis, which will have impact in the study and treatment of human diseases.\r\n\r\nThe project has five different educational objectives and involves graduate, undergraduate, high school and middle school students in tissue engineering learning. One important goal is to develop on-line web modules that contain video of laboratory demonstrations generated by undergraduate and graduate students. The web based modules have the potential to reach wide audiences and are  valuable to tissue engineering teaching. \r\n",
