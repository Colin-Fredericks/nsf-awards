The effort is resulting in an advance in online learning by combining and extending technologies that are in place and in use.  The browser extension appears as a button in the browser and is available from any web page.  The mini-portal includes (a) key terms relevant to the content of the page and the user's educational level, (b) \"apps\" such as Jmol, Mathlets, and Physlets that can be used to explore topics on the page, and (c) pointers to colleagues and friends who have recently looked at the same page or related topics. Rolling over a term brings up a definition and clicking on a term retrieves relevant NSDL resources.",
