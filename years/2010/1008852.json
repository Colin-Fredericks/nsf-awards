The physical problems considered are the\r\nRayleigh-Benard convection at large Prandtl number and/or small\r\nEkman number regime, and a few related simplified models.  In\r\nparticular, the methodology developed is applied to numerically\r\nquantify an important physical long-time statistical quantity,\r\nthe averaged heat transport, in a few convection models.  The key\r\nissue here is the design, analysis and implementation of schemes\r\nthat are efficient and convergent (in the sense that the\r\nstationary statistical properties of the discrete system converge\r\nto those of the underlying system).  Approximating long-time\r\nbehavior of large complex systems is a well-known challenge\r\nbecause small errors could accumulate and amplify.  Additional\r\ndifficulties related to multiple scales (induced by large Prandtl\r\nnumber, small Ekman number, large Rayleigh number), and\r\ngeneralised dynamical system (such as the 3D Boussinesq system)\r\nare also addressed.  Suitable random perturbations of the fluid\r\nsystems are considered in order to ensure convergence to the\r\nphysically relevant long-time behaviour. \r\n\r\n     Quantifying long-time statistical properties is of great\r\nimportance in applications.  Besides well-known applications in\r\nclassical turbulence theory, it is also extremely important in\r\nclimate studies because the predicted climate is the long-time\r\nstatistical behaviour of the underlying climate model.  The\r\nmodels to be investigated, although far from practical climate\r\nmodels, share several important mechanisms that are crucial to\r\nrealistic climate models, such as energy-preserving nonlinear\r\nadvection, rotation, convection, dissipation/damping and forcing. \r\nA clearer understanding of long-time statistical behavior in this\r\nsetting helps us better understand many geophysical fluid\r\nphenomena, and provides guidelines for accurate numerical study\r\nof climate changes.  The project also provides abundant\r\nopportunities for graduate students, including student from\r\nunderrepresented group, to participate in the modeling, analysis,\r\nand computation of many physically motivated problems.",
