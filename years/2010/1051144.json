The Framework calls for standards that are organized around learning progressions (LPs) that address \"big\" ideas in science that go across grades. Through a series of workshops, CPRE will develop four hypothetical LPs that will serve as a critical tool to states, districts and instructional developers as they plan for using the new standards. The work will be conducted by STEM education learning researchers with participation by state science supervisors. A well-qualified advisory board will review the quality and utility of the hypothetical LPs. The project will be widely disseminated through the CPRE network to all 50 states.",

The two concepts are: understanding the structure, properties, and transformations of matter and understanding the flow of matter and energy in living systems. These descriptions draw on research on learning and teaching science to lay out the pathways students might be expected to follow to master these concepts. These resources describe the developmental changes taking place in students\u00c6 understanding of fundamental ideas in science as they attempt to learn them over the course of their elementary and secondary school experiences.

There is research from the learning sciences that can inform the design of these instruments, but typically it is not shared with teachers and other key stakeholder within the education system.
