Coherence-scale phenomena are prominent in, for example, field-effect transistors while anharmonicity affects transport at interfaces separating hard and soft matter. The long-term goal of this project is to enable and advance pertinent applications ranging from nanoelectronics to nanomedicine. Theoretical tools will be developed to analyze coherence effects, while novel experiments will be devised and conducted to probe the spectral properties of phonons participating in thermal transport at hard-soft interfaces.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: A systematic investigation of the role of anharmonicity (in soft matter) and coherence (in hard matter) during thermal transport will be conducted. A phonon wave transport theory will be extended to include particle-like behavior to enable the prediction of thermal responses in sub-10 nanometer transistors. A novel time-resolved Raman scattering approach to experimentally probe temperature-dependent anharmonic shifts in the frequencies of macromolecules will also be developed, providing a means to gain insight into the anharmonic dynamics of phonons in soft matter. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of thermal transport in soft and hard matter, and across interfaces separating these materials. This understanding may lead to new pathways for developing small-scale transistors, discovering new cancer therapies, and creating novel energy harvesting thermoelectric materials. The education plan will motivate students at multiple levels to pursue careers and research in energy conversion and the thermal sciences. New laboratory experiences will be incorporated into undergraduate laboratory courses at the PI's institution. Likewise, a new graduate course in nanotransport will be developed. Teaching kits will be developed for K-12 teachers, and outreach will include summer camps to introduce energy conversion principles to high school girls.",

This project developed fundamental understanding of thermal transport in two novel materials: silicon nanowires and ultrathin fluoropolymer films.

Specifically, new experiments and theory reveal that the interaction has partial wave character rather than only particle character. The results draw attention to the correlation between different points on the surface roughness profile as an important but often overlooked parameter. In another series of experiments, thermal transport across less than 20 nm thick fluoropolymer films was investigated to reveal percolation in the property of thermal conductivity. Taken together, the results provide detailed insight into how vibrational waves transport heat in these technologically important materials. The broader impact of the work is to assist the technological development of silicon based thermoelectrics for energy conversion and in the use of thin polymeric coatings in multiple applications. The project contributed to the training and education of undergraduate and graduate student researchers who have since joined the US technology workforce.
