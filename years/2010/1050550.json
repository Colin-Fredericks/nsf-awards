 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council will conduct a decadal survey to assist the federal government in coordinating and optimizing activities and resources across NASA (flight programs and focused missions), NSF (basic research programs), and NOAA (operational programs).  The decadal surveys in space science have been widely praised for having a positive impact on federal agency planning and decision-making, in addition to promoting unity within the space science community. This survey is designed to draw widespread community participation, engage the community in consensus-building, and set specific discipline-specific science targets and priorities for the coming decade. The study will have the following impact: provide scientific direction for the field of solar and space physics; organize the scientific community and the relevant agencies, particularly NASA, NSF, and NOAA; inform other decision-makers in the legislative and executive branches (particularly OMB and OSTP); document the needs for a scientifically- and technically-trained workforce in solar and space physics; and communicate the societal benefits of solar and space physics (e.g., interdisciplinary connections, education, workforce training, public outreach). The report will also contribute to the general public?s greater understanding of recent accomplishments and future goals in solar and space physics. \r\nIn conducting this assessment, there will be an emphasis on developing a systems approach to the theoretical, ground-based and space-based research programs that comprise the flight programs and focused campaigns of NASA, the ground-based and basic research programs of NSF, and the complementary operational programs of other agencies such as NOAA. This new decadal survey will update and extend the NRC's previous survey in solar and space physics, The Sun to the Earth--and Beyond: A Decadal Research Strategy in Solar and Space Physics (2003). The survey committee, informed by three study panels that will also be established by the Board and supplemented by informal working groups, will broadly canvas the field of solar and space physics. The committee report will reflect an awareness of the science and space mission plans and priorities of potential industry, international, and U.S. agency partners and identify opportunities for cooperation and possibilities for growth or expansion. The survey will solicit and aggregate inputs from across the solar and space physics community via town hall meetings, sessions at professional meetings, and the solicitation of white papers.",

The decadal survey report, requested by NASA and the National Science Foundation, and carried out with their financial support and with the cooperation of other federal agencies, especially NOAA, presents a prioritized program of basic and applied research for 2013-2022 that will advance scientific understanding of the Sun, Sun- Earth connections and the origins of \"space weather,\" and the Sun\u00c6s interactions with other bodies in the solar system. \n\nThe present decadal survey is the second NRC decadal survey in solar and space physics.  Like all NRC decadal survey reports, this decadal survey was conducted with the assistance of a broad swath of the solar and space physics community; the final report represented the efforts of more than 85 solar and space physicists and space system engineers working over an 18-month period.  In developing its recommendations, the survey committee also drew on over 300 \"white papers\" that were submitted by the community in response to a broadly-distributed survey request for concepts and new ideas to advance the discipline. The survey committee also sponsored numerous town-hall meetings and workshops prior to the formal start of its deliberations.  \nPer the study statement of work, the survey\u00c6s top-level tasks were to:\n1.      Provide an overview of solar and space physics science and provide a broad survey of the current state of knowledge in the field;\n2.      Identify the most compelling science challenges;\n3.      Identify the highest priority scientific targets for the interval 2013-2022; and\n4.      Develop an integrated research strategy.\nSurvey Recommendations \nThe survey report\u00c6s recommendations are shown in the full report, which is available at: http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13060.  The recommended actions include completion of projects in NASA and the NSF's current program, creation of a new \"mid-scale\" projects line at NSF, augmentation of NASA and NSF \"enabling\" programs, and acceleration and expansion of NASA's Heliophysics Explorer Program.  For later in the decade, the report recommends beginning new moderate-size NASA missions to address high-priority science targets, and a multiagency initiative to address pressing needs for improved forecasts of space weather and predictions of its impacts on society.\nSpace Weather-Related Recommendations \nThe following recommendations were made by the survey committee to help fulfill its vision of an effective program in space weather that meets national needs&mdash;one that advances the fundamental science that underpins understanding of space weather phenomena and its effects on society and the evident need for effective vehicles to translate newly gained knowledge towards societal benefit:\nRecharter the National Space Weather Program: The survey committee recommends that, to coordinate the development of this plan, the National Space Weather Program should be rechartered under the auspices of the National Science and Technology Council and should include the active participation of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget.
