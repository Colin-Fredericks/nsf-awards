 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will both provide fundamental knowledge about veterans' beliefs of engineering and the difference between those beliefs and the actuality of the field, as well as develop interventional classes focused on leadership to help veterans succeed in engineering degree programs.  To fill in the knowledge gap about veterans' beliefs, the team will interview focus groups of veterans.  The data collected will be used to develop and deploy three interventions:  a transportable curriculum for career fairs, choosing scholar-mentors as on campus leaders in veteran integration activities, and a leadership seminar.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project are to provide data on veterans' beliefs about engineering to those who administer programs to pipeline veterans to engineering, and develop research tools that can be used in planning for the influx of veterans into higher education.  Such data can reinvigorate engineering and provide life-long opportunities for veterans.  The broad focus of the proposal on creating networks and partnerships in New York may serve as a case study for other states, groups, and the Federal government wishing to address veteran to university transition issues.",
