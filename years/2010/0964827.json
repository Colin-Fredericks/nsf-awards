 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nESR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, ESR imaging (ESRI) and computational methods will be applied in order to provide details on and formulate the mechanism of degradation and stabilization of ionomer membranes used in fuel cells. The major objectives for the next four years are to: 1. Make the transition from ?ESR in an in situ fuel cell? to ?ESR Imaging of an in situ fuel cell? by combining in situ experiments with the ESR Imaging methods developed in the previous grant period. This approach will make possible measurements of the diffusion rate of nitroxide spin probes and spin adducts between the anode and cathode sides of the fuel cell and thus visualize crossover processes. 2. Focus on membrane stabilization by assessing and comparing the effect of various neutralizing cations on the stability of ionomeric membranes. 3. Increase the lifetimes of unstable intermediates by encapsulation in the hydrophobic environment of cyclodextrins and cucurbiturils as hosts. 4. Initiate density functional theory calculations in order to understand the effect of conformations of radical fragments and adducts on their magnetic parameters (hyperfine splittings and g values). The collaboration with scientists and engineers from 3M, Ford Laboratories, and the General Motors Electrochemical Energy Research Lab, as well as the contributions of international participants, will contribute to the success of the proposed project. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFuel cells are a promising source of clean energy for automotive and stationary applications. Polymer membranes are crucial for fuel cell operation, but their durability is a major problem that must be solved before the fuel cells are in use. This proposal describes the application of spectroscopic, imaging and computational methods that are expected to provide important details on the degradation and stabilization of membranes in fuel cells. The collaboration of the Detroit group with scientists and engineers from 3M, Ford Laboratories, and the General Motors Electrochemical Energy Research Lab is an example of Translational Research: Fundamental studies on the mechanism of membrane degradation will lead to the synthesis of more robust membranes. International collaborations will add talent to the local group. This investigator will co-teach a course entitled ?Fundamentals of Fuel Cells?; the course will be tailored for engineers and scientists who lost their jobs due to the current economic problems and need to be retrained so as to participate in ?green? ways to generate clean energy. \r\n",

Scientists and engineers are involved in studying ways to replace the carbon economy, which produces greenhouse gases, by the hydrogen economy, which produces only water.

Major components of a fuel cell are: the fuel (hydrogen), the catalyst (Platinum), and the polymeric membrane that separates the anode and cathode sections.\n\n\nErnest Moniz declared in 2004 that more investments in basic energy sciences are highly recommended: \"gray matter and greenbacks\". These investments led to results. Dramatic improvements in the components of a fuel cell included methods for the generation of the fuel, hydrogen; a significant reduction in the amount of Platinum catalyst needed, from 80 g in the fuel cell (FC) stack in 2007 to 30 g presently; thinner membranes to reduce cost; and increased durability of the membrane. These innovations in chemistry and materials science meant that clean, affordable hydrogen-powered cars are becoming a reality.  \n\nThe new reality was clearly shown at the 2015 Detroit and Washington Auto Shows  \n\nThe proton exchange membrane (PEM) is an essential part of a fuel cell and its role is crucial: To separate the cathode and anode compartments, allow efficient proton transport from the anode to the cathode, and block the flow of reduced oxygen species from the cathode to the anode.
