 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate new ways of extracting and using information in optical speckle. Spatial diversity will be used for imaging and communication with optical speckle. The approach is to measure speckle patterns as a function of position and incorporate the data in a spatial intensity correlation model. Imaging with optical speckle suitable in a weakly scattering environment will be developed. The approach is to use a vector Bethe-Salpeter equation as the forward model. Imaging and communication with entangled photons in random scattering media will be studied. The approach is to use measurements of energy-time entangled photons in random scattering media, exploiting features of quantum entanglement. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nMethods to image within and through scattering media are important in the development of new clinical diagnostic tools, in environmental sensing within and through aerosols and emulsions, in material characterization, and in communication. The work will develop basic understanding, models for the scattering media, an imaging method suitable for weak and strong scatter, and characterization methods suitable for applications. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe work will impact applications with other segments of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as other wave types. Two Ph.D. students will participate in the research, and an undergraduate student will be recruited each year. The work has the potential to impact elementary school science through the Purdue Engineering Projects in Community Service program, where undergraduate students are developing hands-on projects to teach important principles, and also provide demonstrations for the Women in Engineering.",
