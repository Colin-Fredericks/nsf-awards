 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nUNAVCO provides NSF-funded PIs geodetic engineering, equipment, and data management and archiving services. Significant increases in polar applications of these services arose though projects funded as part of the International Polar Year. The IPY investment has stimulated a surge of more detailed scientific investigations that were not anticipated at the time when UNAVCO?s current core funding was planned. As such, these activities must be supported thought a separate proposal. Polar geodetic networks provide first order constraints on the interactions between the cryosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, and the evolving mass balance that governs changes in global sea level and climate. In particular, these observations advance understanding of vertical deformation associated with glacial isostatic adjustment of the land surface, glacier dynamics and wasting of the ice sheets, and tectonics. The proposed terrestrial laser scanning resources will support a wide range of geoscience investigations including detailed mapping of surfaces and changes in surfaces including fault scarps, geologic outcrops, fault-surface roughness, frost polygons, lava lakes, dikes, fissures, glaciers, columnar joints and hillside drainages.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nPolar geodetic investigations have direct relevance to changing global climate and sea level rise. Facility support for polar studies lowers the barriers for broad investigator and student involvement in these science investigations, creating infrastructure and data sets that serve broad and diverse investigator communities. The broadest impact of the project is through the university partners whose research is supported. These investigations commonly involve students and early career investigators, and thus directly support workforce development. The impact on national competitiveness, both through science contributions and on workforce development, is largely realized through UNAVCO community investigators whose students and post-docs are enabled by facility support.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nUNAVCO is a non-profit, university-governed consortium that facilitates geoscience research and education using geodesy.  UNAVCO supports a community that includes scientists affiliated with 106 US academic Member universities and 92 Associate Member institutions. This community is active and productive in many areas of Earth Science, including, but not limited to solid earth science, polar science, atmospheric sciences, and hydrogeodesy.  UNAVCO has the unique and fundamental role of providing solid Earth and cryospheric scientists with free access to a pooled resource of geodetic technologies, instruments, equipment, data, technical support and collaboration, which are key enablers of fundamental Earth Science research being conducted from the equator to the poles.\nUNAVCO provided two primary services through this award: Engineering oversight and maintenance of remote polar continuous (cGPS) networks operating in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and community PI support of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) technology.  Each of these areas of support was augmented with a full time engineer, budgeted within the award.\nDuring years 2007-2009, UNAVCO led the development of a power and communications platform capable of providing up to five watts of uninterrupted power to an instrument load operating in the most extreme conditions found at high latitude locations.  This power platform was coupled with a satellite communications system for the purpose of rapid data telemetry.  This became the foundation for several continuously operating GPS networks in Greenland and Antarctic.  This rapid expansion of cGPS networks at the poles required significant engineering support, and that support was met via this award.  UNAVCO engineering support provided equipment preparation, site installation, Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M), data recovery and management, technology refinements and direct field support to the projects using this infrastructure.\nThe Polar Observing Network (POLENET) was the first project to make use of the UNAVCO infrastructure development, fielding 84 fully autonomous GPS stations at locations around Greenland and throughout Antarctica.  These remote networks are designed to measure Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) of the land surface due to changes in ice mass balance.  They also provide key insight into polar tectonics and ice stream dynamics, and they are a major advance in addressing many compelling questions in polar science.  Designed to run unattended for up to two years, the cGPS networks have returned an unprecedented polar data set while incurring a modest maintenance effort.  Data recovery from the POLENET networks is on the order of 90%.  Including POLENET, LARISSA and other projects, 157 continuous stations have been deployed in the Arctic and the Antarctic.  Of these, 114 sites were equipped with satellite or line-of-site communications for data telemetry back to UNAVCO.  UNAVCO is currently providing operation and maintenance support for 103 autonomous Polar GPS stations with onboard telemetry.  \nThis award also supported one full time Polar TLS Engineer and the infrastructure needed to meet the needs of NSF-OPP funded projects requesting LiDAR support. This engineer led the project support and drew upon both NSF-OPP and NSF-EAR acquired LiDAR instruments to support 46 projects in the Arctic and Antarctic over the duration of the award. Staff time was devoted to project support, including project planning, field data collection, initial data processing, data archiving and community outreach through training and demonstrations. Projects covered a number of geoscience fields including volcanology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, stream and glacier hydrology, thermokarst processes and ecosystem microtopography.  In addition, UNAVCO provided innovative TLS support in non-traditional areas such as archeology (3 projects) and animal biology (1 project), demonstrating the potential for new methodologies t..."
