 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an ongoing research program.  It revolves around understanding how various fundamental algebraic objects occurring in mathematics---such as rings, class groups, algebraic curves and varieties, and maps relating such structures---are parametrized.  Our goals in understanding these parametrizations are at least fourfold: 1) to describe how these fundamental algebraic objects are distributed with respect to their most basic invariants; 2) to discover new invariants of these objects, and their applications; 3) to develop efficient and practical algorithms for performing computations with these algebraic objects; and, perhaps most importantly, 4) to discover and understand how various seemingly different algebraic structures are in fact closely related to each other.\r\n\r\nSuch parametrizations have been already used by the PI over the past few years to obtain precise information on the distribution of number fields with respect to basic invariants such as discriminant and class number divisibility. Applying refined counting methods to these parametrizations has led, for example, to a proof of the first known case of the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet class number heuristics for higher degree number fields, and other theorems of this nature are forthcoming. We expect similar theorems for ranks of elliptic curves, and other data of this kind for algebraic curves and surfaces, in the near future.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn many areas of mathematics, the following equation plays an extremely important role:\n\ny&sup2; = x&sup3; + ax + b.\n\nThe graph of such an equation is called an \"elliptic curve\". Number theorists are particularly interested in the case  where a and b are whole numbers, like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., or -1, -2, -3,  etc. Moreover, they are especially interested in finding rational  solutions to this equation, i.e., those rational values of x and y that  make the equation true.

Using this technique, you can start with some small set of rational  points and use this procedure to find more and more.\n\nAccording to Mordell\u00c6s Theorem -- proven in 1922 by Louis Mordell --  it is always possible to find some finite set of rational points on the  curve, so that all of the rational points on the curve can be found from  this finite set of points using the above connect-the-dots procedure.

In other words, a positive proportion of elliptic curves have infinitely many rational points!\n\nIt is worth remarking that there is no known algorithm for determining all rational points on a given elliptic curve.  However, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture (one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium problems) provides such an algorithm, although it is an unsolved problem as to whether the algorithm actually works.
