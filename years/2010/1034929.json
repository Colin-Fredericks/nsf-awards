 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Understanding Science: Improving the Achievement of Elementary Students in Geoscience Through Proven Professional Development and Collaboration\" is a Track 2 GeoEd project with a fundamental goal of helping grade 3-5 teachers gain a more solid understanding of core Earth science topics and effective instructional approaches so they are better prepared to teach in ways that result in higher student achievement and a lasting interest in geoscience. Toward this end, three regional Geoscience Alliances in Alabama, California, and Wisconsin bring together scientists and educators to collaboratively design and nationally field test a professional development curriculum - Understanding Earth Systems - using WestEd's Understanding Science model for teacher learning that has a proven track record of positively impacting teacher knowledge, classroom practices, and student achievement in science. Key partners include: the University of Wisconsin - Madison in conjunction with the Office for Science Outreach and Madison Metropolitan School District; the University of Alabama - Huntsville along with the Institute for Science Education (ISE) and the Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI); California State Universities at Dominquez Hills and Northridge; LSAMP programs within these states; and the U.S. Geological Survey. Innovation and the creation of new knowledge often emerge from interactions across boundaries of discipline and practice. This model of network building utilizes an authentic task - developing materials for teacher learning - to knit together practicing scientists, university faculty, teacher educators, and classroom teachers toward a shared vision of strengthening STEM education in the geosciences.",
