 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to better understand quasar optical emission lines using a powerful new statistical tool - Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - which is capable of decomposing quasar spectra into linear combinations of independent spectral components that together make up the quasar gas.  ICA will be applied to the large Sloan Digital Survey quasar sample to identify simple, rare types with just a few spectral components.  These quasars will then be observed in the infrared using the SOAR telescope, and modeled using the CLOUDY computer code, to try to determine the physical nature of the emission line regions.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include development of a new program to bring the STEM field subject of astronomy to outlying elementary schools in rural areas of Michigan, using a new portable planetarium.  NSF funds will be used to send a professional planetarium lecturer around the state giving presentations, leaving behind a device for viewing the Sun, along with CDs with full sets of PowerPoint presentations and other materials. Twenty remote schools will be reached with this pilot program.",
