 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Barbara Buttenfield in the Department of Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder and Nicholas Nagle in the Department of Geography at the University of Tennessee will develop methods that situate public use census microdata in space at finer resolutions than are currently available in the public domain. The methods they will use impute a set of sample weights (probabilities) that allocate microdata records to census tracts with the addition of ancillary data, even to sub-tract levels. These sample weights respect publicly available census tract statistics, as well as correlations between census data and ancillary landuse and land cover. Importantly, the methodology is derived using statistical methods of empirical likelihood, and allows for quantification of uncertainty and simulations of small area populations, thus offering a significant advance over existing methodologies. While the method depends entirely on publicly available data, validation will utilize confidential census records held at the Census Research Data Centers. \r\n\r\nDeliverables from this research include methods, tools and usage guidelines that allow efficient construction of sample weights. Workshops will make these tools available to urban geographers, landuse planners, transportation specialists, demographers and educators. A website will disseminate the methods as Matlab, Python and R scripts, as a contribution to cyberinfrastructure, so that others may utilize tools. This website will be evaluated through a three-week short-course at the University of Colorado, by a planning workshop at Tennessee (an EPSCOR state) as well as by workshops at geography, urban planning and statistics national conventions. The project will provide specific recommendations to the US Census Bureau so that they may improve the relevance of public data for small area research, estimation and policy analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project centers on statistical imputation of geographic location for household records in the U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS), for the purpose of refining tract and blockgroup summaries.  Block group and tract-level summary tables have fine spatial resolution, but contain rough summaries for various demographic attributes.  They lack specific information on individuals or individual households.  PUMS data contain individual- and household-specific information, but preserve confidentiality by situating each household record at a coarse spatial resolution, namely, within a PUMA region comprising roughly 25 tracts.  For Decennial and American Community Survey products, PUMS are released at the geographic scale of the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA), which must have at least 100,000 persons.  It is possible to tell that a particular household is situated somewhere within a PUMA, but not in which tract.  The PUMA spatial resolution is too coarse to be of utility for many spatial analyses.\n\nOutcomes for this project include successful implementation of software tools for allocating households with given demographic characteristics to census tracts,using penalized maximum entropy statistical methods. A second outcome derives metrics for uncertainty (reliability) of such allocations, and inclusion of ancillary variables (land use, land cover, and parcel information) to refine allocations, using a GIS method called dasymetric modelling. Dasymetric models are a specialized form of areal interpolation, refining tract estiamtes by using residential areas within tracts as opposed to the entire land area of the tract.\n\nAn important finding of this research is that allocations to rural areas are not as reliable as in urban areas, and parcel data provides better reliability for dasymetric modelling than does natioanl land use and land cover information in rural areas.\n\nA third outcome of the project is to extend allocations across multiple time periods.  The challenge for temporal extension is that census boundaries change over time, complicating the allocation process because portions of tract populations must be allocated.  Where boundaries do not change, tract populations do not have to be partitioned.  Where boundaries change, a number of strategies for partitioning had to be tested and validated against finer resolution (i.e., census block) boundaries. Statistical comparisons show that a density  weighting scheme is preferable to areal weighting, volume-preserving, or expectation maximization methods, preserving populations more reliably in both urban and rural areas.\n\nThis research will provide societal benefits because of the numerous types of social services distributed according to populations or number of households.  Population projections can also be improved by outcomes of this research, in supporting the generation of more reliable estimates for example of children reaching school age used to project possible school closures, households whose below-poverty-level income warrant increased SNAP support, access to social health care services, and distribution of population for voter redistricting.  The temporal component of this research can be especially usefull in these and other applciations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara P Buttenfield"
