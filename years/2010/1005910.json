The workshop will be jointly supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Fields Institute of Canada, and will be held at Nipissing?s campus in North Bay, Ontario, Canada,  May 17-22, 2010.  The scientific focus of the workshop will be on recent developments in topological and measure-theoretic methods in dynamical systems.  Senior researchers will share fundamental research techniques, and recent results, in the areas of focus with attendees, including graduate students, post-doctoral students, and researchers that have recently received the PhD.  James Yorke (U. of Maryland), Mariusz Urbanski (North Texas State U.), Michael Yampolsky (U. of Toronto), and Vladimir Pestov (U. of Ottawa) art among the principal speakers. Topics include topological and measure-theoretic properties of attractors, basin boundaries, and  Julia sets of rational and entire maps, minimal maps on manifolds, and dynamics of infinite-dimensional groups. \r\n\r\nThe mathematics research fields of dynamical systems, topology, and measure theory have long had significant areas of overlap, and a continuing tradition of researchers working across these fields, and borrowing tools from each other.  Over the last 25 years, there have been many developments that have increased the interaction among topology, dynamical systems, and measure theory.  NSF support will be used to enable at least 10 US-based students and recent PhDs to attend the workshop.  The workshop will provide the opportunity for recently trained professional mathematicians and students to prepare for research in areas in which current developments are moving rapidly at the intersection point of topology, measure theory, and dynamical systems. Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program.",
