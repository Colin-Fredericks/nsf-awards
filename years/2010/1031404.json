 "awd_abstract_narration": "I-C STEM In My FUTURE is a two-year, year-round, informal learning program for 80 students focusing on mathematics, the use of hand-held technology, computer literacy skills, technical training and career paths. The project will examine the impact of this technology-enriched intervention program on the STEM career interest of underrepresented minorities. It is an ITEST strategies proposal designed to provide middle and high school students with challenging technological learning experiences that will foster STEM career choices, promote academic success in high school, and prepare students academically to attend a college or university. The project proposes to provide interdisciplinary exposure to concepts in computer science and mathematics. The goal of the project is to allow students to gain experience in critical thinking, to reinforce an understanding of topics discussed through hands-on activities, and to ignite an interest in STEM that will ultimately lead to pursuit of STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe project will explore the influence of applications of mathematics, engineering, and technology on student interest in college, high school STEM courses, and STEM careers. The project activities will consist of Saturday sessions during the school year, tutoring sessions with college mentors and a two-week residential summer camp. Programmatic activities are provided for both students and parents. \r\n\r\nProject outcomes will determine which strategies are most effective in encouraging 80 middle and high school students to prepare for STEM career. A database will be used to track information on students as they progress through the program. The project will seek to answer the following questions: (1) Do informal hands-on scientific algebra and geometry experiments combined with technology enriched activities encourage middle school students to take STEM courses in high school? (2) Does technology training and exploration promote the pursuit of STEM careers by underrepresented minorities in middle and high school? (3)Does academic support through one-on-one tutoring promote academic success in STEM courses and in STEM career choices among underrepresented minorities? (4) Does academic support through mentoring increase the self-efficacy in the academic pursuit of underrepresented minorities in STEM courses and career choices?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "I-C-STEM IN MY FUTURE \n\n I-C-STEM in My future was designed to provide students with challenging technological learning experiences that would foster STEM career choices, promote academic success in high school and prepare students academically to attend a college or university.   I-C-STEM was a year-round program on two levels for students in grades 7th through 11th.  The goals of I-C-STEM were: to increase students\u00c6 knowledge of STEM careers, to provide students with challenging technological learning experiences that would foster STEM career choices and to empower parents with the resources to support and encourage their children\u00c6s interest in college and STEM careers.   The informal learning program featured eight Saturday student sessions, a two-week residential summer camp,  homework tutoring sessions, on-line projects, field trips,  parent  workshops and summer internships.\n\n Broader Impact:\n\nOver the three year period from 2010 to 2013, I-C-STEM impacted 88 students and their parents.  The students came primarily from five school districts in Mississippi.  In the targeted districts, over 85 percent of the students were African American.    Through presentations and recruitment I-C-STEM brought information on STEM careers to communities and schools\n\n Intellectual Merit:\n\nI-C-STEM focused on mathematical concepts and computer literacy during the first academic-year session on each level. The program focused on such topics as computer engineering, in which students built a computer; computer programming, in which students built and programmed a robot; and animations, in which students created interactive computer games and cell phone apps.  I-C-STEM provided students with an understanding and appreciation of the STEM concepts taught in the program, as well as the mathematics and science taught in 7th through 11th grades. \n\nPresent Classification of I-C-STEM Participants by Grade\n\nEighty eight (88) students participated in the I-C-STEM Program.  Of that number, data was collected on 74 students. The telephone interviews revealed the following with respect to the grade level of the student who responded (See figure 1-Classification of I-C-STEM Participants by Grade N=74).\n\n \n\nI-C-STEM Influence on Enrollment in Colleges and Universities\n\nTwenty six (26) of the I-C-STEM students plan to enroll in Jackson State University upon graduating from high school.  At the time of this study, five students were enrolled in summer school as freshmen at Jackson State reflecting a 41.89% rate (31) for those enrolled or planning to enroll at Jackson State (See figure 2 - College Choice of I-C-STEM Participants N=74).  \n\n \n\nInfluence of I-C STEM on College Major\n\nDid I-C-STEM influence the participants\u00c6 college major?  The extent of influence is shown in Figure 3.  Approximately 69 percent (68.92%) of the students who responded felt participating in I-C- STEM had a \"great influence\" on their  college major.  Less than 5% felt there was \"little\" to \"no influence\" on their planned college major. (See figure 3 Influence of I-C- STEM on Student's Planned College Major) \n\n\n \n\nInfluence of Parents on Students\u00c6 Planned College Choice\n\nThe parents attended several activities during the course of the I-C-STEM program.  They gained knowledge about STEM disciplines and had hands-on technology experiences.   They were introduced to many careers in STEM and how to apply for grants, scholarships, and financial aid at colleges and universities.  Questions were answered about the college application process and the curriculums at institutions.  This knowledge aided parents in helping their children think seriously about colleges. The amount of influence was close for \"great influence\" (33.38%) and \"some influence\" (35.14%). This could indicate that the participants felt their parents played or would play a pivotal role in helping them make a decision about college. (See figure 4 Parents' influence on Students' Planned College Choice).\n\n \n\n Influence of Par..."
