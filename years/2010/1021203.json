 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than a millennium, ecologists, philosophers and economists have been intrigued by boom and bust cycles of predators and their prey. Surprisingly, the cause for cycles, or more generally, what enables predators and prey to coexist in nature for long periods of time is still not fully understood. In this collaborative proposal, ecologists and mathematicians combine forces to achieve two objectives. The first objective involves a pair of experiments designed to test whether making a particular prey life history stage longer or more variable in length, relative to unmanipulated (control) populations, affects the long-term coexistence or cyclical behavior of predator and prey populations. The second objective involves combining mathematics and empirical data to develop more realistic predator-prey models that can be generally applicable to diverse predator-prey interactions. Results from this research will indicate the extent to which  predator-prey coexistence is closely tied to the life cycle of the two species. It will strengthen the viewpoint of theorists that population models should incorporate information about the development times of the various life stages of each species.\r\n\r\nResults from this research apply directly to agriculture in cases where predators are released or manipulated to control plant pests. Pest suppression may be enhanced by selecting predators with certain stage-specific development times. The PIs will provide research experience, mentorship and training for 3 graduate students, 1 technician and up to 6 undergraduates at Louisiana State and Southern Illinois Universities. The PIs will participate in a variety of undergraduate research programs that promote research, most of which place a priority on recruiting minorities.",

Because boom periods for pests result in substantial losses to crops and natural products, ecologists and pest managers have long sought an understanding of the mechanisms causing population cycles. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that long-term persistence of cycles is enhanced by the presence of invulnerable prey life stages, that the interaction between the predator and prey (or parasitoid and host) can induce cycles in the host, and recently that variability in predator and prey development can strongly enhance stability.

The cowpea weevil <em>Callosobruchus maculatus</em> and its parasitoid <em>Anisopteromalus calandrae</em> were used as a model predator-prey system. In laboratory microcosms (large petri dishes containing hosts, parasitoids, and a food source for the weevils [moth beans,<em> Vigna acontifolia</em>]), under normal conditions, hosts and parasitoids exhibit population cycles.

In Experiment 1, we manipulated the duration of the invulnerable juvenile host stage so that it was increased by 60% in some cases (long-duration treatment) and decreased by 60% in other cases (short-duration treatment). We artificially changed development times by replacing beans with developing weevils with beans containing younger or older weevils. This method had the advantage of changing the development of the juvenile host stage without affecting any other life stages. Our 2-year experiment demonstrated that a short invulnerable host stage eliminated population cycles and resulted in low host densities whereas a long invulnerable host stage resulted in wild fluctuations in host and parasitoid densities and an increased risk of host and/or parasitoid extinction. Using a model created specifically for this system, we examined the long-term effects of changing host development time on host-parasitoid population dynamics.

For two years, replicate host-parasitoid microcosms were subjected to two treatments, natural levels of variation (Normal variance) and high levels of variation (High variance) in the duration of the vulnerable host stage. In unmanipulated control and Normal-variance microcosms, hosts and parasitoids exhibited distinct population cycles.
