 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective:\r\nThe aim of this research is to develop nanoantenna-based frequency up-converter arrays for efficient nonlinear optical response at wavelengths for which silicon has high quantum efficiency.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\nThis project will facilitate the development of plasmonic nanoantenna arrays that are optimized for ?photon-management? applications, e.g., optical frequency conversion solar cell technology. To-date, little work has been done on optimizing these structures for their nonlinear optical response, which, in general will depend on multiple parameters including material and geometric. In addition, this project offers an opportunity to investigate several, not well-understood, fundamental scientific studies, such as:  1)  identifying the origin of the nonlinear optical response;  2) determining  the  limiting  factors  that  influence  the  near-field  resonance of nanoantennas; and 3) understanding how nanoscale plasmonic enhancement can be precisely coupled to the local nonlinear optical response in solid state materials.\r\n\t\r\nBroader impact:\r\nThis work has the potential to be transformative by helping to revolutionize and fast-track the development of efficient solar cell technology, whereby according to recent estimates, the industry is growing at a rate of ~ 30% per year, with a predicted growth of ~$7.5B by 2015. In addition, the work is expected to broadly impact interdisciplinary science/engineering education by developing a high-school module on plasmonic-enhanced solar cells and photo detectors, incorporating research materials into an undergraduate course on nanotechnology, and providing unique graduate research experience for students from various backgrounds. The work will be broadly disseminated through various academic/industrial channels.",
