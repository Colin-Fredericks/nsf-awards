 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to create new theoretical foundations and numerical algorithms for large-scale, reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of complex engineering systems. The proposed effort will involve: (1) an extended polynomial dimensional decomposition (X-PDD) method for system reliability analysis of a general, high-dimensional, stochastic system; (2) integrated X-PDD and score functions for concurrently calculating sensitivities of system reliability with respect to design variables; and (3) system-level reliability-based and robust design optimization algorithms employing X-PDD for probabilistic response and sensitivities from a single stochastic simulation.  The innovative formulation of system reliability analysis and design sensitivities will dramatically accelerate RBDO process.  Therefore, the research constitutes a new and possibly paradigm-shifting advance towards solving large-scale, complex optimization problems in the presence of uncertainty.  Deliverables include development of new theory and algorithms, generation of modeling and simulation tools, documentation of research results, engineering student education, and hands-on design experience for K-12 students.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will be applicable to a broad multidisciplinary design optimization methodology.  Potential engineering applications comprise ground vehicle design for improved durability and crashworthiness, fatigue- and fracture-resistant design for civil and aerospace applications, and reliable design of microelectronic packaging under harsh environments.  Beyond engineering, potential application areas include energy, finance, management, scheduling, and transportation and logistics, where stochastic optimization plays a vital role.  The transfer of knowledge created by this award will take place through organization of engineering design-related symposia, peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations at major conferences and meetings, software development, and student education.  Educational goals include graduate student recruitment from an underrepresented minority group, implementation of software tools to upgrade existing graduate and undergraduate courses at The University of Iowa, and active participation in Iowa's Project Lead the Way program for middle- and high-school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A great many complex systems and engineering structures are innately plagued by extant uncertainties found in manufacturing processes and operating environments.  Conventional design procedures, which rely on heuristically derived safety factors, cannot account for the quantitative nature of the statistical variation of a system response.  Consequently, the resultant designs are either unnecessarily conservative in overcompensating for uncertainties or unknowingly risky due to the inherent uncertainties.\n\nUnder this National Science Foundation award, the principal investigator and his student conducted fundamental research on design optimization of complex systems in the presence of uncertainty; in other words, developing methods to achieve the best possible design solution in which the nature of the system behavior is uncertain.  The research involved new theoretical developments and integration of novel computational methods in engineering, mathematics, and statistics.  New computer models were created to study two principal classes of design optimization: (1) robust design optimization, which improves product quality by reducing the sensitivity of an optimal design; and (2) reliability-based design optimization, which concentrates on attaining an optimal design by ensuring sufficiently low risk of failure.  Depending on the objective set forth by a designer, uncertainty is effectively mitigated by these design optimization methods.  The innovative formulations of reliability analysis, sensitivity analysis, and optimization algorithms &ndash; the necessary ingredients of the computer models developed &ndash; have achieved not only highly accurate, but also computationally efficient design solutions.  Therefore, these new models are capable of performing industrial-scale design optimization with numerous design variables.\n\n The results of this research are envisioned to be applicable to a broad multidisciplinary design optimization methodology.  Potential engineering applications comprise ground vehicle design for improved durability and crashworthiness, fatigue- and fracture-resistant design for civil and aerospace applications, and reliable design of microelectronic packaging under harsh environments, to name just a few.

Any application discipline that can be simulated using computer software or tools should benefit from this research.
