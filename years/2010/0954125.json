 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphs and networks are ubiquitous, encoding complex relationships \r\nranging from chemical bonds to social interactions.  Hidden in these\r\nnetworks are the answers to many important questions in biology,\r\nbusiness, and sociology.  In order to analyze complex networks, users \r\nhave to master sophisticated computing and programming skills.  It \r\nindeed becomes a pain point for many scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis project is to change the state of the art by developing a \r\ngeneral graph information system, which is able to address the needs \r\nof searching and mining complex networks.  Real-life networks are \r\ncomplex, not only having topological structures, but also containing \r\nheterogeneous contents and attributes associated with nodes and \r\nedges. The mixture of structures and contents raises two challenges \r\nthat require new solutions for smarter and faster graph analysis.  \r\nFirst, new types of graph search and mining operations, such as graph \r\naggregation, graph association, and graph pattern mining, are \r\nemerging.  Second, when graphs become complex and large, most of \r\nexisting graph mining algorithms cannot scale well.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses these challenges and performs a \r\ncomprehensive study of a general graph information system.  \r\nThe system includes three major components: complex graph search, \r\ngraph pattern mining, and graph indexing.  \r\nIt covers emerging structure queries in social, \r\nbiological, and information networks, new graph mining operators \r\nsuch as graph summarization and association, and innovative indexing\r\nmethodologies, e.g., differential graph index.\r\n\r\nThis research is tightly integrated with education through student \r\nmentoring and curriculum development. Publications, software and \r\ncourse materials resulted from this project are disseminated on the \r\nproject website: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/gis.html.",
