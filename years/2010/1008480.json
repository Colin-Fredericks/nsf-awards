 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to achieve the optimized growth of InGaN quantum dots within integrated heterostructures that can be structured to form high quality optical cavities for the quantum dots. Ultimately, such integrated structures promise ultra-efficient optical sources in the visible range of the spectrum, controlled single photon sources, and new testbeds for the exploration of quantum information concepts, all operating at room temperature. The III-nitride materials have exceptional optical properties, but considerable challenges remain in the growth of low-defect materials in this system; this is particularly true for quantum dots.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental optical performance of InGaN quantum dots could be enormously enhanced through their appropriate integration into high quality optical cavities, such as microdisks or photonic crystal structures. In addition, such cavities could serve as highly sensitive probes of the performance of the dots, monitoring the effects of local defects, charge traps or electric fields. There are numerous material challenges associated with the fabrication of such structures, and care must be taken to design the entire material structure in an integrative manner. This program will bring together the critical complementary expertise in the growth of InGaN quantum dots(Cambridge University), in the fabrication of cavities and structures in the GaN material system(Harvard), and in the optical characterization of those structures (Oxford). The program incorporates opportunities for all researchers, including postdocs, graduate students and undergraduates to participate in exchange visits, laboratory experiences and workshops among the partner institutions. The team will also communicate and exchange information through a web presence and video conferencing.",
