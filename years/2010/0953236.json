 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nHigh performance materials found in nature, such as collagen and spider silk, exhibit a hierarchical structural arrangement and contain reinforcing, ordered domains, which lead to novel mechanical function.  The overall aim of this CAREER project is to utilize a bio-inspired approach, particularly the incorporation of ordered regions, to generate functional, polymeric hybrids with tunable mechanical properties.  Multi-block copolymers, which mimic the microstructure of numerous natural materials, are ideal systems with which to explore ?soft? domain ordering via variations in secondary structure of polypeptide-based block copolymers.  The PI will develop peptide-containing polymeric hybrids with controlled structural variations to elucidate the role of hierarchical ordering (secondary structure; microphase segregation; supramolecular interactions; crystallinity) and structural interplay on mechanical and morphological behavior.  The fundamental structure-function relationships obtained in this examination of hierarchically-assembled hybrids will drive the development of new polymeric material systems with tailored mechanical behavior for emerging applications, such as scratch-resistant coatings, impact-resistant films/fibers for composites, and multi-functional tissue engineering scaffolds.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe development of hybrid polymeric materials with a bio-inspired architecture and tunable mechanical response will impact the design of next generation materials for energy-absorption and high strength applications, such as impact-resistant panels, scratch-resistant coatings, and durable fabrics.  This multi-disciplinary research, educational, and outreach CAREER plan provides a unique training and mentoring platform for high school, graduate, and undergraduate researchers. The PI will also incorporate concepts of nature-inspired design, hierarchical assembly, and mechanical behavior into new and existing undergraduate and graduate courses.  Innovative and impactful outreach programs have been proposed, including 1) a mentoring network, Sister 2 Sister, for underrepresented women interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); 2) a partnership with Citizens? Academy,  an urban K-5 charter school in the University Circle area adjacent to the Case Western Reserve University campus, to provide opportunities to explore the world of polymers, support Science Club activities and curriculum development; and  3) Many Faces of STEM, an exposure day for Cleveland-area middle school students from primarily underrepresented groups, to spur an interest in STEM disciplines and to promote interaction with STEM role models from similar backgrounds. \r\n\r\n",
