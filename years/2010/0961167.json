 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foreign-born share of the U.S. population has risen to almost a record proportion, 12.6 percent in 2007.  Immigrants to the U.S. increasingly are settling outside California and other traditional gateway states. In the last 20 years, immigrant populations have grown rapidly in the South and Midwest, regions that previously had been relatively untouched by the upswing in immigration that began half a century ago.  Population growth in these areas stemmed from natural increase but more importantly from the in-migration of the native born.  The credit-fueled boom that drew many immigrants to these new locations now has fizzled.  Migration behavior also has changed.  Fewer people (both immigrants and native-born) are migrating across state lines.  Immigration also has slowed.  Some states that had experienced rapid population growth now are facing population declines.  This research project will document the settlement patterns of foreign-born immigrants within the country and compare them to the native-born population.  The investigators will look specifically at US-born and foreign-born migration systems within the U.S. and are especially interested in analyzing how these two systems change over time, with a particular emphasis on the economic crisis of 2008-2010.  They will compare the movement of immigrants within the US with movements of U.S.-born people in the context of the recent recession, with special emphasis given to determining whether foreign-born and U.S.-born workers respond to labor market signals in the same way.  The investigators will test the hypothesis that immigrants will migrate within the U.S. in response to local economic crises in ways much like U.S.-born workers, leaving areas of high unemployment for areas with better job prospects.  They also will seek to determine whether immigrants will be more reluctant to leave immigrant enclaves and that they will be drawn to these enclaves when they do move.\r\n\r\nBy examining how migrants respond to the pull of enclaves of people from the same ethnic group and the geography of employment opportunities, by considering how these responses vary by skill and education level as well as by ethnic group, and by considering how migration behavior may differ in more recent economic hard times from what occurred in the generally prosperous era of the 1990s, the investigators will address a core theoretical tension between the geography of labor markets and ethnic enclaves as drivers of migration systems.  The project's intellectual merit of this research will result from the measurement of their effects on immigrant internal migration across the economic cycle.  Positive broader impacts will include the frequent and timely release of information on the evolving settlement geography and employment of immigrants during this recession and its aftermath through both scholarly and more applied media.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe have found that:\n\na) Immigrant dispersion from traditional gateways to new destination metros slowed considerably after the onset of the recession.  Using a series of descriptive measures we found that the net migration of the foreign-born to new metro destinations defined using Singer\u00c6s typology of metro areas,  declined starting in 2007.\n\nb) The implementation of state-wide E-Verify in Arizona in 2008, a law requiring all public and private employers to check the legal status of employees for employment, increased the outmigration rate from Arizona of those who were most likely unauthorized &ndash; foreign-born no-citizen Hispanics.  We obtained this result using a set of models that compared the migration rates pre and post the law\u00c6s implementation in Arizona.\n\nc) We found that the netmigration of African Americans to the south continued during and after the Great Recession whereas the netmigration of US-born whites to the south became negative.  This implies that black migration to the south during the recessionary period was driven by non-economic factors likely associated with family and other factors associated with \"return.\"    The results are nuanced by the fact that the most educated African Americans, those with a college degree, had migration patterns most like those for whites.  The attraction of the south for this group of highly-skilled blacks diminished considerably as the region experienced high unemployment.\n\nd) State restrictionist laws aimed at unauthorized immigrants not only promote outmigration of affected groups but also affect where these groups move to when they migrate internally.   This avoidance of hostile places is net of the effects of state economic conditions and suggests a reorientation of unauthorized or likely unauthorized migrants to less hostile states.\n\ne) STEM graduates are more likely to work in STEM jobs in labor markets where STEM jobs are disproportionately concentrated.  STEM graduates who migrate are more likely to move to STEM job concentrations than elsewhere.  And this migration increases the odds they get a STEM job.  However, this outcome is gendered and raced: it is only true for native-born whites and foreign-born Asian men.  All other migrating STEM graduates do not tend to move to STEM job concentrations and migration does not improve their odds of getting a STEM job.\n\nf) Foreign-born Latino men accounted for 50% of the growth in construction employment in major metropolitan labor markets between 2000 and 2007.   All groups lost jobs in construction during the recession but foreign-born Latino men lost a smaller percentage of jobs than US-born whites and blacks.  This indicates that foreign-born Latinos have hung on to their niche in construction even as the housing market collapses.  Percentage job losses in construction employment for foreign-born Latinos were greater in established gateways than in new destinations suggesting that ethnic resources and job queues in established gateways provided some protection for these workers in the face of savage job loss.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard A Wright"
