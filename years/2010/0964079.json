 "awd_abstract_narration": "As mobile embedded systems become more prevalent, there is an increasing demand to make processor pipelines more power efficient.  Conventional pipeline inefficiencies include unnecessary accesses to the register file due to duplication or avoidable computation from constantly checking for forwarding and hazards at points where they cannot possibly occur, repeated calculation of invariant values, etc.  It is desirable to develop an alternative processor design that can avoid these wasteful energy consumption aspects of a traditionally pipelined processor while still achieving comparable performance.\r\n\r\nA statically pipelined processor is expected to achieve these goals by having the control during each cycle for each portion of the processor explicitly represented in each instruction.  The pipelining is in effect statically determined by the compiler,  which has several potential benefits, such as reducing energy consumption without degrading performance, supporting a less complex design with a lower production cost, and being able to apply more effective compiler optimizations due to instructions having more explicit control of the processor.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the broader impact of this research is manifold. The use of ultra-low power embedded devices, such as bio-implantable microelectronic devices, can significantly affect everyday activities.  A new generation of ultra-low power processors will enable these devices to be more feasible to develop and deploy.  Educational efforts to introduce the latest architecture and compiler enhancements in the classroom complement our research.  Steps will also be taken to increase female and minority enrollment at both institutions in their Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnergy efficiency of computer processors has become more important in recent years.  First, extending battery life is important due to the recent proliferation of mobile computing devices, which include smart phones.  Second, we need to reduce the generated heat for general-purpose processors due to the power wall, which means that we cannot increase the clock rate without exceeding thermal limits.  Third, the cost for energy, including electricity, is rising and this cost is an increasing fraction of the operating cost of data centers.  Thus, energy efficiency has become important at all computing levels.\n\nIn this project we have reexamined how traditional embedded computer processors can be designed to be more energy efficient without sacrificing performance.  We have found that by redesigning the instruction set so that instructions control what happens during each cycle of the processor, as shown in Figure 1, we were able to reduce energy while simultaneously improving performance and decreasing code size.  These benefits were achieved by exposing the datapath to the compiler, which allows a new level of compiler optimizations that eliminates unnecessary or redundant operations in the processor.  We have also redesigned how data accesses are performed.  We have designed new techniques for accessing the first level of the memory hierarchy is accessed for data.  Our techniques for accessing data improve energy efficiency without degrading performance.  We believe the techniques we have developed to reduce energy usage are much more likely to be adopted in embedded processors since they do not degrade performance.\n\nThe findings in this project have been integrated into an Energy Aware Computing course at Chalmers University of Technology with whom the FSU PI collaborated during the project.  The FSU PI is also including the findings in this project in his week long course that is being presented at the HiPEAC ACACES Summer School in July 2014.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/27/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhi-Hong Mao"
