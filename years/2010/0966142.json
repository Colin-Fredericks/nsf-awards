 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award to the University of Pennsylvania supports the development of a new training paradigm for perception scientists and engineers, and is designed to provide them with a unique grasp of the computational and psychophysical underpinnings of the phenomena of perception. It will create a new role model of a well-rounded perceptual scientist with a firm grasp of both computational and experimental analytic skills. The existence of such a cadre of U.S. researchers will contribute to the country's global competitiveness in the growing machine perception and robotics industry.\r\n\r\nResearch and training activities are organized around five thematic areas related to complex scene perception: (1) Spatial perception and navigation; (2) Perception of material and terrain properties; (3) Neural responses to natural signals, saliency and attention; (4) Object Recognition in context and visual memory; and (5) Agile Perception. Interdisciplinary research will enable new insights into the astounding performance of human and animal perception as well as the design of new algorithms that will make robots perceive and act in complex scenes.\r\n\r\nIGERT trainees will commit in advance of acceptance to a five-year graduate training program, comprising the following components: (1) Core disciplinary training; (2) one-year cross-disciplinary training in a chosen second discipline; (3) participation in two foundational and one integrational IGERT courses; (4) attendance of an interdisciplinary IGERT seminar; (5) co-advising throughout the 5 graduate years by an interdisciplinary faculty team ; and (6) completion of the Ph.D. dissertation.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",
