 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the vexing problem of precise gravity estimation from airborne platforms. Gravity variations viewed spatially offer an intuitive means for characterizing likely oil/gas deposits, minerals, water structures, and tunnels, among many others. The research will focus on the innovative combination of traditional navigation-grade sensors and sensors designed for low-level seismic acceleration measurement; the use of precision navigation for the measurement of translation-induced acceleration; and an innovative data processing approach that effectively isolates the vertical channel measurements to better target gravity-induced acceleration. The research objectives include refinement of the mathematical models for gravity estimation, development of a simulation to predict performance, extension of an available precision navigation system to accommodate measurements from extremely low-noise seismic accelerometers, and data collection to support algorithmic development and performance assessment. The result of the research will be an assessment of gravimetry using precision navigation and seismic sensors. Moreover, the research community will receive access to the gravimetry data collected.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project spawns from a new technical approach to estimating gravity from airborne platforms. The use of emerging generations of ultra low-noise sensors in a suitable processing framework will produce price/performance ratios that are far less than exist in the industry today. The data analyses and performance assessments that emerge will encourage further development in the sensor community and lead to innovation in measurement and data processing. Development of a low-cost, effective gravimetry system will enable exploration on a global scale as demanded by the oil and gas community and the remote sensing market. Moreover, connecting traditional remote sensing multispectral products with gravimetry will encourage the development of new markets and interests. A gravimetry system that mounts in a small airframe such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and that flies at low altitudes can produce substantially more useful gravity measurements at finer spatial resolution and at lower cost than systems currently available. Both commercial and military users will appreciate the suitability of low cost airframes with far fewer operational limitations than typical gravimetry systems.",
