 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project, graduate researcher Droulias, is an ethnography that will explore the cultural significance of the game of basketball to the community of Nenana in the Interior of Alaska. As the researcher correctly point out Basketball is a significant activity to Alaskan communities and in particular small, rural, primarily Alaska Native, communities. Droulias proposes to examine the extent to which basketball could be a metaphor for community cohesiveness and ultimately a reflection of the social and cultural construction of community itself.",

It explores the cultural role of basketball in an Alaskan community. \n\nThe anthropology of sports is a growing field and has had little contribution from researchers in the North.  The widespread popularity of basketball and its prominent role in social life is a broadly important social phenomenon in rural Alaska. Several ethnographic studies in Alaska and neighboring Canada have noted the significant social impact basketball has had on small northern communities.  Despite this importance, there has been no focused study on the topic.\nThis project examines not just athletic competition or spectators\u00c6 perspectives, but the integration of both. In addition, it explores the symbolic qualities of the social space that is created by the interaction of players, spectators, the game itself and the gymnasium. The research focuses primarily on a local instance of youth basketball but also adult organized basketball tournaments and \"pick up\" games. \nThis research also presents social aspects of sports that reflect the specific circumstances of circumpolar societies.  For instance:\n\n\nIn a vast sparsely populated state such as Alaska, basketball provides opportunities to maintain relations among communities. \nTravelling in Alaska is a unique experience for players and spectators. It renegotiates community solidarity and strengthens inter-individual inter-generational and inter-village relations. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nBroader impacts\n\nAccording to the participants in the study, basketball in Alaska has a critical role to play in community life. Residents in rural Alaska face serious sociopathologies such as drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and suicide. Children and teenagers are susceptible to all of these, especially suicide.

People of all ages and sexes meet and play regularly in the so called \"pick up\" games most local gymnasiums in rural Alaska. As such, people have a range of experiences that pertain to the specific components of the high school basketball experience in Alaska.  Their collective experiences and memories become a foundation for community solidarity, identity and self-reliance.   \nOne of the unexpected results of the study is that the data have proved a rich source for the analysis of collective memory.  For the past 30 years, the study of the relationsh..."
