 "awd_abstract_narration": "Echinoderms include familiar animals such as starfishes, sea urchins, and a wide array of extinct forms stretching back to the Cambrian Period, circa 500 million years ago. Echinoderms share a common ancestor with backboned animals and thus provide a crucial link to understanding a huge portion of the entire tree of life as well as the history of our species. This project, the Echinoderm Tree of Life Project, will resolve the phylogenetic placement of Echinoderms within the tree of life and clarify important unresolved relationships among major echinoderm lineages using data from genetic sequencing and anatomy.\r\n\r\nEchinoderms are fascinating, and their unique features, such as mutable ligaments and novel means of detecting light, have biomedical engineering applications.  Because research on such marine animals and their adaptations is naturally attractive to young people, excellent students are expected to be recruited and the importance of science will be communicated to a broad audience. Long-term impacts, embodied by scientific publications, textbooks, anatomical and genomic data, and extensive pages in the Tree of Life and Encyclopedia of Life web projects, will provide resources to researchers and educators.  Outreach will include videos and broadcasts about marine exploration and applications of fundamental biological research across the biomedical sciences.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Some years ago, I gave a conference talk on the difficulties associated with the classification, taxonomy and evolution of crinoids, the sea lilies and feather stars (Fig 1). One of my introductory slides included the phrase, &ldquo;Austin, we have a problem&rdquo;, a play on the prophetic words of Apollo 13 commander James A. Lovell, Jr.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Houston, we have a problem.&rdquo; My reference, however, was to Austin H. Clark, who described 75 genera and 307 species of living crinoids, each about 40% of the currently recognized totals. Admittedly, he often based descriptions on only one or few dredged or trawled specimens that were usually damaged or incomplete. Still, many of the distinguishing features he used have proven to be minor differences that vary with growth and habitat. One of the results of this project&mdash;Assembling the Echinoderm Tree of Life (AEToL)&mdash;has been to re-examine several crinoid groups as a step toward better understanding what constitutes a valid crinoid species or genus, to begin to address the legacy of Clark&rsquo;s vast taxonomic over-splitting. Our re-examinations, together with collection of intact specimens via scuba, ROV and submersible, have also provided better understanding of variations associated with growth and environment (e.g., most of a crinoid&rsquo;s body is suspension-feeding apparatus that varies with hydrodynamic conditions in different habitats), all of which are helping us produce a more accurate taxonomy.</p>\n<p>So, why bother? First of all, crinoids are echinoderms&mdash;relatives of sea stars, sea urchins and sea cucumbers&mdash;and the only living members of this major branch of animal life that bear a stalk. Many look like little palm trees, although most living species lose the stalk when still tiny and take up a free existence as feather stars. The crinoid body consist chiefly of small skeletal pieces composed of calcium carbonate. As a result, they have an important fossil record that began over 400 million years ago, and, in places such as the American Midwest, generated vast limestone deposits sometimes spanning thousands of square miles. However, during the mass extinction at the end of the Paleozoic Era, they were almost completely wiped out. The few survivors, the articulate crinoids, underwent an evolutionary radiation that produced a great diversity during the Mesozoic Era and led to the modern fauna. Today, crinoids occur in all the worlds&rsquo; oceans, from the shallows to trenches, and sometimes in enormous numbers (Fig 2). So, the primary goal of this component of the AEToL project, and one of its major accomplishments, was to reach a more accurate and thorough understanding of articulate evolutionary history and, as noted above, to produce a more robust taxonomy based on a combination of molecular techniques and a broader set of morphological characters. For example, the new phylogenetic tree revealed that some traditional taxonomic groups were separate branches scattered across the tree (Fig 3). Also, although we knew that one great branch gave up the stalk, the new tree confirmed that some groups within the feather star branch retained the stalk&mdash;as juvenilized versions of free-living ancestors. Such a tree also allows us to better understand the consequences of evolution, e.g., some of the earliest articulates (and some that survive) have a stalk that allowed them to release their hold on the seafloor and crawl away from predators such as pencil urchins that were evolving at the same time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project also discovered new species, which, with the more accurate taxonomy, will permit more accurate assessments of biodiversity from coral reefs to the deep sea. The discovery of new species also has potential impacts on society. As an example of such an outcome outside this project, an ethyl acetate extract from the western Pacific reef-dwelling feather star, <em>Alloeocomatella polycladia</em>, described by the PI in 1995, has recently been discovered to significantly inhibit Hepatitis C virus replication by suppressing viral helicase activity. Our more thorough descriptions have allowed more precise identifications from video and photos during both research and educational expeditions (e.g., NOAA's <em>Okeanos Explorer</em>), although most crinoid species still require microscopic examination (and often DNA sequencing) for proper identification.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To inform a larger audience, the PI and co-PI Tomasz Baumiller (Univ. Michigan) were featured in a half-hour television program on their crinoid research using a submersible (WPBT2 Miami Public Television, <a href=\"http://www.changingseas.tv/episode601.html\">http://www.changingseas.tv/episode601.html</a>). Though not funded by NSF, the program included specimen collection for AEToL and offers to the public a clear and interesting introduction to these otherwise obscure organisms, including the basic idea behind AEToL, as well as concepts in ecology, predation, regeneration, evolution, population dynamics, and mass extinctions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, three graduate students in this AEToL component received training in disciplines that will prepare them for careers in science beyond crinoid phylogenetics and taxonomy, including scientific writing and illustration, oral presentation, molecular phylogenetics, morphological taxonomy, geometric morphometrics, field research, and specimen curation and museum work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;G&nbsp;Messing</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036219/1036219_10044640_1475093135541_NSF1036219Outcomesfig1Crinoiddiversity--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036219/1036219_10044640_1475093135541_NSF1036219Outcomesfig1Crinoiddiversity--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1036219/1036219_10044640_1475093135541_NSF1036219Outcomesfig1Crinoiddiversity--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Crinoid diversity.
