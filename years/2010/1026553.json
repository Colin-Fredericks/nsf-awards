Walsh and Eric J. Schelter, University of Pennsylvania, and Miquel A. Peric\u00e0s, Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ), will link enantioselective lanthanide-based catalysts to solid supports, and enable their facile handling and recycling.  Heterobimetallic lanthanide(BINOlate) complexes will be tethered to solid supports through diamine-containing polymers that will tightly bind to their lithium ions, resulting in solid state catalysts which can be used in asymmetric reactions with equal or better performance than their parent compounds.  The supported catalysts will also be investigated in batch and flow reactors.  Graduate and postdoctoral researchers will participate in exchanges between the Walsh and Schelter labs (U.S.) and the Peric\u00e0s group (Spain).  These students will learn new techniques that are currently unavailable in their home institutions. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this work is expected to have far reaching implications in organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and industrial and medicinal synthesis. This novel approach to design may lead to new solid catalysts that are able to perform key enantioselective transformations and then be easily separated from the reaction products (recovered) and reused in multiple applications.  The development of flow systems is especially attractive as it provides evidence for the value-added nature of the assembled team in achieving practical, user-ready systems. \r\n\r\nThe MICINN will provide support funds for the Spanish investigators while the NSF will support the U.S. team's efforts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this joint research project between the US and Spain was to develop methods to link enantioselective lanthanide-based catalysts to solid supports to enable their handling and recycling.  Ultimately, these highly enantioselective linked catalysts were to be used in batch and flow reactors to pave the way for industrial applications.  En route to these goals, the synthesis of appropriate solid supports was performed and a study of the nature and length of the linker on catalyst activity and enantioselectivity was conducted.  From this work, several new supports were prepared and used in catalytic asymmetric reactions.  Studies were performed to measure leaching, which did turn out to be problematic with some resins.  The supported lanthanide catalysts were employed in reactions catalyzed by the homogeneous counterparts for the purpose of comparison.  One of the most significant advances of this NSF supported research is that a new set of precatalysts for Shibasaki\u00c6s lanthanide-based catalysts was developed.  These catalysts are a significant improvement over direct synthesis of Shibasaki\u00c6s catalysts, and will greatly facilitate the application of these catalysts.  Unlike the original catalysts introduced by Shibasaki, our new precatalysts are bench stable and readily synthesized on gram scale.  They can be easily used to generate Shibasaki\u00c6s catalysts, which are among the most enantioselective known to date.  Supported titanium catalysts were also developed for the asymmetric allylation of ketones.  Enantioselectivities are very similar to the homogeneous catalysts, and it was demonstrated that the homogeneous catalysts could be recycled.  Finally, an array of cerium complexes were prepared and their redox chemistry studied.  Most of the results outlined will be published in the coming months, as this collaboration continues past the life of this funding period.\n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is that new methods for linking lanthanide- and titanium-based catalysts to solid supports were introduced.  Fundamental studies were performed on homogeneous catalysts to study binding of model linkers (not attached to the polymer) and determine their impact on catalyst enantioselectivity and their binding strength. Over the course of the grant period, two graduate students from UPenn and two graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher from Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia  (ICIQ) participated in the international exchange program for 3&ndash;6 months.  These students learned new areas of research that are currently unavailable in their home research groups. \n\n \n\nThe broader impact of the work are multifold. Students benefited from exposure to new research topics, broadening their skill sets.  This exchange program increased their effectiveness as researchers.  They are also better prepared for future employment in research settings.  They learned about another culture, making them more aware of foreign customs and expanding their perspective on chemistry.  This experience augmented their ability to think broadly and to communicate more effectively. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick J Walsh"
