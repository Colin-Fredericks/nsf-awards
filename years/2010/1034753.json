Khovanov\r\n\r\nThis proposal asks for financial support for US based\r\n participants, for a 3-week long summer program devoted to Knot\r\n Theory: Knots in Poland III: conference on Knot Theory and its\r\n Ramifications.  It will be a conference interspersed with\r\n specialized workshops and tutorials.  It will be third\r\n conference in the series of large, very successful international\r\n conferences ``Knots in Poland\".  The conferences will take place\r\n in Warsaw July 18-25 and in Banach Center in Bedlewo July\r\n 25-August 4, 2010. Specifically, we propose to support about 15\r\n graduate students and 10 mathematicians without grant.  As part\r\n of the conference we will have a series of 3 talks by Tom Mrowka\r\n on his proof that Khovanov homology can be understood as a page\r\n in a spectral sequence converging to a version of Instanton\r\n Floer homology.  A consequence of this is that Khovanov homology\r\n detects the unknot.  Knots have fascinated people from the dawn\r\n of the human history.  Much of the early knot theory was\r\n motivated by physics and chemistry (e.g. Kelvin theory of vortex\r\n atoms). The fundamental problem in knot theory is to be able to\r\n distinguish non-equivalent knots. There have been exciting new\r\n developments in the area of Knot Theory in recent years. From\r\n the Jones, Homflypt, and Kauffman polynomials, through quantum\r\n invariants of 3-manifolds, Topological Quantum Field Theories,\r\n to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional\r\n topology (Donaldson, Witten, etc).  More recently, Khovanov\r\n introduced homology theory of links which categorifies the Jones\r\n polynomial (a chain complex is build on the Kauffman model of\r\n the Jones polynomial).  Soon after, Ozsvath and Szabo developed\r\n Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial.\r\n These two significantly different theories are closely related\r\n and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. One can\r\n mention here Khovanov-Rozansky categorification of Homflypt\r\n polynomial, categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein\r\n module of some 3-dimensional manifolds, and the result of\r\n T.Mrowka that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.\r\n\r\nThe subject has significant applications and relations with\r\nbiology, physics, chemistry and the theory of computation.  We\r\nfeel that a conference on this subject is highly appropriate at\r\nthis time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new development\r\nin knot theory and its ramifications.  The project has broader\r\nimpact in several aspects.  Knots in Poland conference brings\r\ntogether from all over the word, third-world countries, former\r\nSoviet Union, minorities, women, and provides an opportunity for\r\nresearchers and students to share their latest ideas and to\r\ncollaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this\r\noccasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the\r\nworld.  Distinguished researchers (including about 10 woman) will\r\ndeliver plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to\r\nKnot Theory and its Ramifications.  PhD students and fresh PhD's\r\nwill be encouraged to attend.  We expect to publish conference\r\nproceedings (as we did in the past) containing cutting-edge\r\nresearch papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for\r\nresearch mathematicians, students and readers with background in\r\nother exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer\r\nscience, and physics.  \r\n\r\nConference Web Page:\r\nhttp://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~traczyk/knotpol2010/<http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/%7Etraczyk/knotpol2010/>",
