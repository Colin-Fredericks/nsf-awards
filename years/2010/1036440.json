 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are ones that integrate computation, communication and storage capabilities with the monitoring and/or control of the physical and engineering systems. Such systems must be operated safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and in real-time. CPS research is expected to have significant technical, economic and societal \r\nimpacts in the near future in multiple sectors including transportation systems, smart grids, energy-aware buildings, agriculture, water/sewage treatment, environmental management and manufacturing systems.  A core aspect of CPS is its multidisciplinary nature requiring the teamwork, cooperation and collaboration of experts including computer scientists, hardware engineers, control experts, software engineers, network specialists, computer architects, sensor experts, electrical engineers, material engineers, and structural engineers.\r\n\r\nThe award is for support for student travel to CPS Week 2010 and the First International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) to be held April 12-16, 2010 in Stockholm, SWEDEN and some start-up activities for the inaugural ICCPS.\r\n \r\nMore specifically, the goals are three-fold: \r\n1. Encourage attendance at CPS Week 2010 by students based in the US to listen to and learn from the keynote speeches, presentations, posters and demos on cutting-edge topics on cyber-physical systems. \r\n2. Promote the robust growth of a research community in the nascent area of cyber-physical systems. \r\n3. Support activities of the inaugural ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, whose aim is to become a main forum for hosting original research which targets the inter-disciplinary nature of cyber-physical systems.  The specific areas of interactions across embedded systems, hybrid systems, real-time systems and sensor networks are of interest in this forum.",
