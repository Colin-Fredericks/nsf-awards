This meeting will be held in Suzhou, China, June 2 - June 5, 2010. An attendance of 300 is expected including 40 U.S. participants from diverse backgrounds. The technical scope of PC 2010 is intentionally broad to provide a forum that brings together leading and young scientists from academic institutions, governments and industries around the world to discuss the emerging and multi-disciplinary frontiers of polymer science. Five general research areas that encompass the frontiers of polymer chemistry were selected to attract participation from a broad range of disciplines: (1) polymer synthesis, (2) macromolecular architecture and supramolecules, (3) functional polymers for photonics, electronics and optoelectronics, (4) bio-related and medical polymers, (5) structure and characterization of polymers.",
