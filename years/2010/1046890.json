 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subsurface plume from the Deepwater Horizon (DH) accidental oil-well blowout is a complex, layered system of intrusions containing oil, dissolved hydrocarbons, and injected dispersants that will have far-reaching environmental consequences; however, no modeling tools are currently producing highly-resolved predictions of the plume structure and evolution. The goal of this Rapid Response Research Proposal (RAPID) is to develop a three-dimensional, multiscale hydrodynamic model for the DH blowout plume that combines the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modeling approach with the method of large-eddy simulation (LES). The resulting model platform will be validated to field and laboratory data, will respect the relevant chemistry and thermodynamics of the released oil and natural gas, and will be forced by the measured ambient conditions surrounding the spill. Such a simulation tool is urgently needed to guide field observations, predict the onshore migration and loop-current capture of the spilled oil, assess the effectiveness and potential environment impact of dispersants injected at the source, and to understand the response to this event already measured in the vertical migration of plankton and fish. The validated modeling platform will be developed through complementary laboratory experiments, numerical modeling, and analysis of field data. The laboratory experiments will evaluate the effects of currents as the flow through the plume and pull oil and dissolved constituents into the wake of the plume. The numerical methods will utilize a very large eddy simulation (VLES) to resolve the dominant plume structures in the near field of the blowout plume and will nest this model in a far-field model based on the unsteady RANS approach. Field data from acoustic Doppler current profilers will provide model forcing and validation data and will also be analyzed to understand the role of subsurface plume dynamics on the vertical migration of plankton and fish as also recorded in the ADCP data. Early analysis of this data shows a very rapid shut-down of the diurnal vertical migration pattern at nearby stations shortly after the start of the spill. This is the first documented environmental response to the blowout, and it remains unknown whether this is due to mortality, avoidance, light penetration changes or other processes. The sub-surface plume model developed here will provide detailed predictions of the subsurface plume structure necessary to analyze this environmental response. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The primary intellectual merit of the project will be an understanding of the critical physical and chemical processes in an accidental oil-well blowout that lead to the subsurface layered structure of oil and dissolved hydrocarbons in the water column. Important insight will also be gained on the appropriateness of a classical RANS model for predicting the dynamics of the oil and gas intrusions. Broader Impact: Predictions from the model will help guide the collection of observation data in the field and will be applied to understand why plankton and fish in the vicinity of the blowout shut down their vertical migration pattern shortly after the blowout. The model is also needed to predict the transport of oil and injected dispersants throughout the Gulf ecosystem, including onshore and into the loop current and potentially into the Atlantic ocean. Detailed studies of turbulence in multiphase plumes conducted in the later stages of the project will ultimately result in a reliable model framework featuring a zonal RANS-VLES simulation tool applicable to a wide range of environmental applications of multiphase plumes, including CO2 sequestration, lake aeration, and sediment plumes, among others.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: Both ambient stratification and ambient currents can cause dissolved and finely dispersed oil to separate from a rising gas droplet plume.  I have re-examined laboratory data distinguishing the two effects and have derived a simpler relationship to determine which effect (stratification or current) is more dominant.  Unlike the earlier DeepSpill field study conducted off the coast of Norway in 2000, the phase separation at the Deepwater Horizon site was found to be caused principally by stratification, hence suggesting a stratification-based plume model to predict the characteristics of oil and gas intrusion layers following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  In the process we modified a previously developed analysis for linear density stratification to apply to quadratically varying stratification.  Using such a model we found that the dominant trap height of dissolved and dispersed hydrocarbons was between 350 and 400 m above the seafloor.  This is in excellent agreement with the average elevation from over 100 CTD casts.  However, we did not predict the degree of variability in trap height shown by these observations.  Our modeling also predicts smaller secondary intrusions spaced roughly 300 meters apart and these have been observed in CTD casts.\n\nMajor findings:\n\nWe have provided a rational basis for explaining the existence and location of subsurface intrusions of oil and gas resulting from the Deepwater Horizon spill.\nOur work provides the \"inner boundary conditions\" of several Lagrangian particle tracking models that simulate far field oil transport and fate, and helps provide a constraint on the oil budget calculations (i.e., how much oil was found below the surface versus on the surface).\nChemical dispersants applied to sub-surface spills break the oil into small droplets.  In combination with separately funded ongoing research, our work on phase separation is helping to determine the efficacy of this remediation strategy by indentifying just how small droplets need to be in order to enter intrusions as opposed to being transported to the surface with the parent plume. \n\n\nBroader Impacts:  Our research has promoted a better understanding and prediction of the formation and dispersal of sub-surface oil plumes.  This information has been communicated to oil spill managers, members of the science community and students via presentations and publications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward E Adams"
