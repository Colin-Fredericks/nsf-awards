 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel for participants in the conference \"Fluid Dynamics: From Theory to Experiment,\" held at Montana State University on 7-10 June 2010.  The meeting focuses on three topical areas in fluid dynamics: (1) singularity formation in fluid dynamics, vortex dynamics, and turbulence; (2) generation and reconnection of magnetic fields; and (3) fluid dynamics of biological locomotion.  \r\n\r\nThe conference brings together applied mathematicians and other scientists working in these fields with interests in analytical, experimental, and computational methods. Its goal is to facilitate the exchange of results and ideas concerning the future roles of analysis and experiment in fluid dynamics, and their relation to computational approaches. The format of the conference, with a broad diversity of speakers and extensive informal interaction time, is designed to facilitate discussions, to promote new collaborations among the participants, and to influence the future role of theory and experiment in the fluid dynamics community.  A record of the conference will be printed as a special journal issue consisting of fully refereed, original contributions offered by meeting participants.\r\n\r\nThe meeting features invited talks from leading researchers as well as presentations by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty.  The conference encourages presentations by junior researchers in an informal setting and will provide excellent opportunities for young researchers to develop research collaborations.  High priority will be given in allocating travel support to individuals who do not have other support, and to students, postdoctoral researchers, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nConference web site: https://toto.msu.montana.edu/cs/fluid",
