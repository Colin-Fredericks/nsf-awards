The conference involves ceramics used in lithium ion batteries and other energy storage, fuel cells, solar energy, nuclear fuels, and hydrogen. NSF funding will enable a more diverse group of young researchers and graduate students to attend this conference, participate in discussions with senior scientists, and present their own work as posters.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This Gordon Conference has 21 invited lectures, with intensive discussion, by a distinguished group of experts on experimental and theoretical research on oxide materials in batteries, protonic and oxygen electrolytes for fuel cells and electrochemical storage, oxides in supercapacitors, solar photolysis, nuclear fuels, and photovoltaics.  A poster session will present further research. This Gordon Conference, with its emphasis on detailed discussion and intensive conversation between senior and junior researchers, provides a unique forum for the exchange of ideas and the development of new collaborations.  The NSF support is earmarked for junior researchers, with a strong emphasis on support for women and underrepresented minorities.",
