 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This BRIGE research project aims to demonstrate a new class of ultra wideband software defined radio transmitters using a novel mixer-less direct digital-to-RF digital-to-analog converter. The linchpin of the proposed direct RF modulator is a multi-path and multi-phase digital-to-analog converter architecture, designed to cancel ? in the digital domain ? sampling image frequencies and non-linearity spurs, and yet operate at the Nyquist-rate of the RF signal. Specifically, the transmitter comprises a wholly-digital baseband to RF modulation scheme that will enable unparalleled degree of programmability and achieve very high dynamic range spurious free operation.  Furthermore, in light of various mismatches in the parallel digital-to-analog converter paths, self-healing algorithms will be investigated to enable built-in test and tune of the circuit parameters.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed modulator will eliminate the need for heterodyne mixing following the digital-to-analog conversion, a technology deemed critical to meet the Software Defined Radio forum?s definition of the ?ideal software radio?. This technology could be transitioned to a wide range of rapidly evolving commercial and military communication systems such as cognitive radios and software defined radars. Additionally, the new architecture can serve as a catalyst for upgrading the current radio-transmitter handheld to a common radio architecture supporting all different standards and technologies.  Beyond its technological and commercial potential, this research will further strengthen a multidisciplinary teaching and research track in radio circuits and systems.  If awarded, this project will directly support a female Ph.D. student and two undergraduate students during summer.  The PI will also establish close collaboration with North Carolina A&T University, one of the leading national institutions graduating minority engineers, through funding of a minority graduate student for a summer research program in the proposed topic.",
