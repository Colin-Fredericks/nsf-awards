 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No: 1004244 \r\nTitle: Grant to Support The NorthEast Under/Graduate Research Organization for Neuroscience (NEURON) \r\nPI: Frye, Cheryl Anne \r\n\r\nThe Northeast Under/graduate Research Organization for Neuroscience (NEURON) has educated and promoted young neuroscientist professional development through annual one-day conferences. Over the past 15 years, NEURON has served over 4,000 trainees, the majority of which are those from racial and/or ethnic minority groups and/or other groups traditionally underrepresented in science. This proposal is to fund the 2009-2010 program. The Fall 2009 NEURON meeting will be held at the Boston Latin School (BLS), the 1st public school in the nation. BLS is an inner-city, high-performing school, which requires an entrance exam, with a high proportion of minority students from greater Boston. The NEURON meeting will be integrated with related activities at BLS (3-day event of the 37th Anniversary of BLS, annual science fair). Scientific information will be disseminated to participants via a keynote address, poster session, and workshops. All activities are designed to enhance outreach, networking, and opportunities for integration among high schools, colleges, and universities. Activities include a Brain Primer, which is an introduction about neuroscience given by Brian Persaud, who works for MATCH, a public charter school in Boston that operates in conjunction with Boston University. Other workshops include Getting into grad school and being successful, Society for Neuroscience, What it is and how to take advantage of it, and Partnerships in Neuroscience Research. By our integration of these events, we will increase participation by high school students and minorities, broaden the scope of outreach (local to nationwide) and continue NEURON's dedication to addressing research, training, education and pipeline issues. The Spring 2010 NEURON meeting will be held in collaboration with Hunter College's Annual Psychology Conference in New York City. Dr. Eric Nestler is the keynote speaker. There will be workshops on Getting into grad school and being successful, Grantsmanship, and Enhancing diversity in science. Funding of this program will enable NEURON to continue to have a significant impact on trainees and faculty who work closely with them.\r\n",
