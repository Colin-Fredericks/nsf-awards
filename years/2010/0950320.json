 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Royce W. Murray of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the electrocatalytic oxidation of water by solution-dispersed iridium oxide nanoparticles, and to enhance the analytical capabilities for determining the composition and properties of very small nanoparticles. Specifically, the research plan seeks a better understanding of the mechanisms by which un-supported and supported iridium oxide nanoparticles are effective as water oxidation catalysts, and seeks the development of new measurement techniques to determine the detailed composition and surface chemistry of nanoparticles.\r\nThe central aims of this project are to develop techniques to enable the control of the size and determine the composition of nanoparticles and to advance our understanding of the mechanisms in electrocatalytic water splitting.  This should ultimately contribute to the design of nanoparticle-based devices such as photochemical energy conversion systems and sensors.  Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in cutting edge electrochemical techniques with relevance to alternative energy research.",
