The workshop will be held on June 14th through June 16th, 2010 in Arlington, VA.  This workshop will engage a diverse group of scientists to discuss the challenges and opportunities for chemists facing the common challenge of understanding and exploiting chemistry at length scales beyond that relevant for conventional molecules.  The workshop will seek to articulate the grand challenges in this area, draw attention towards its promise for game changing technologies, provide valuable educational benchmarks, and identify characterization and instrumentation needs for understanding such complex systems. The workshop discussions will be widely disseminated to the scientific community through a website and workshop report.",
