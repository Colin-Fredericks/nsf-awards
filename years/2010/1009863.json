 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will calculate the properties of relativistic turbulence using high accuracy numerical simulations, motivated by recent developments in gamma-ray burst (GRB) and gravitational wave source physics.  The study involves numerical simulations of relativistic turbulence similar to recently published high resolution three-dimensional simulations of turbulent shear flows by Dr. MacFadyen and collaborators.  This will produce reliable calculations of the conditions in models of prompt and afterglow GRB emission, and elucidate the conditions of relativistically turbulent astrophysical systems including compact binary mergers.\r\n\r\nA major benefit of this work is the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the use of parallel supercomputers, thus helping the next generation of physicists and astronomers to take advantage of supercomputing, including at the petascale.  Visualizations of fluid dynamics simulations have been shown to enhance science appreciation among students at all stages, including K-12, and previous results by Dr MacFadyen have appeared widely in the national and international media, including National Geographic magazine and public television's NOVA program.",
