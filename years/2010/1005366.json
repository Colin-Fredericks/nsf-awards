So far this experiment has been quite successful. We hope to continue these activities and continue to publish its annual proceedings as well as a high level free online journal.\r\n\r\nThough many world experts frequently visit Gokova, the main emphasis of these conferences have always  been on the young researchers and the graduate students. Over the years many young now-well-known mathematicians  got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences, many instances by giving their first talks there. We hope to expand these activities by advanced mini-courses for talented graduate students and publishing its proceedings.",
