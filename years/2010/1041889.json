This conference will bring together an international community of scientists interested in molecular approaches to understanding, protecting and enhancing global marine resources. Topics included at the conference include the role of marine microbes in biogeochemical cycles; marine bioenergy; extremophiles; the \"-omic\" disciplines in marine biotechnology; biotic carbon sequestration; biomineralization and nanobiotechnology; marine metagenomics. These are important areas of research from which novel observations and ideas relevant to changes in the earth's climate and to bioenergy are emerging.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: Participation in this conference will expose US students and postdoctoral scientists (including women and members of minorities underrepresented in science) to emerging science in the area of marine biotechnology. It will permit them to present and discuss their own results with leading international scientists and provide them opportunities to develop new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by Cellular Systems, Biomolecular Systems, and Biological Oceanography.",
