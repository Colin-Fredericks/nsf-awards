This target is intended to be used with the CLAS12 detector as an essential part of the high-priority PAC approved electron scattering experiments to study the internal structure of the nucleon as part of the 12 GeV program at Jefferson Lab (JLab).   This will expand the spin structure program at JLab and be used to determine the contribution of the valance quarks to the properties of the nucleon.  The target will use standard solid materials (15NH3, 15ND3, and possibly LiD) at ~1K and will be dynamically polarized in the 5 T field of the CLAS12 central solenoid.  \r\n\r\nThe design and construction of this target will have positive impacts on the training of future scientists because undergraduate and graduate students will be deeply involved in the process.  This award will enable the knowledge transfer from experts at UVA to other researchers.  A polarized target with the proposed specifications will have a strong impact on the research program at Jefferson Lab.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
