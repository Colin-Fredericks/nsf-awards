 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attackers only need to find a single exploitable bug in order to\r\ninstall malware, bots, and viruses on a vulnerable user's computer.\r\nUnfortunately, bugs are plentiful.  For example, the Ubuntu Linux\r\ndistribution bug management database currently lists over 58,000 open\r\nbugs.  Thus, the question is not whether an attacker can find a bug,\r\nbut which bugs an attacker can exploit.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates novel techniques, approaches, and\r\nalgorithms for finding exploitable bugs.  The ability to deterimine\r\nwhether a bug is exploitable or not will allow developers to\r\nprioritize bug reports so that the most security-critical bugs are\r\nfixed first.  The techniques investigated will also help developers\r\ndistribute patches safely.",
