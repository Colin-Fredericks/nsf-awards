The investigator studies\r\nmultiscale asymptotics for the partial differential equations\r\nthat govern tropical atmosphere atmospheric waves and their\r\nconnection to midlatitude waves, extending his previous work in\r\nthe field.  The three aspects of this project are: (1) The effect\r\nof the climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) on the\r\nIntraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of the\r\nMadden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); (2) The effect of mean shear on\r\nthe non-linear interaction of equatorial Rossby or Kelvin waves\r\nwith midlatitude Rossby waves; (3) The coupling of tropical waves\r\nto a stochastic model of moist convection and the derivation of a\r\nclosed, single scale, stochastic model of the Madden-Julian\r\nOscillation.  This last project could yield a transformative\r\ndevelopment because it would be the first MJO model whose\r\nstructure is systematically derived from multiscale asymptotics\r\n(Biello and Majda) and whose convective forcing arises from a\r\ntested model of cloud dynamics (Khouider, Biello and Majda). \r\n\r\n     The effect of small and fast phenomena on large and slower\r\nphenomena is a ubiquitous question in modern science and\r\npolicy-making.  In economics, for example, the question may be\r\nphrased, \"How do individual actions organize to yield steady\r\neconomic conditions or unstable economic conditions?\"  In\r\natmospheric science, this question is manifested as \"How do small\r\nscale events such as storms and storm systems organize themselves\r\nto affect the mean climate in which they sit?\"  While large\r\nmodern computational simulations have yielded many insights into\r\nthis multi-scale organization, they are limited in that the\r\nsmallest structures they can resolve are still large; for\r\nexample, most climate computations cannot see structures smaller\r\nthan 60 miles across.  So, the equations that these computers\r\nsolve must resort to a model (whether empirically determined, or\r\nad hoc) in order to describe these unresolved structures.  A more\r\nsystematic approach is to use techniques of modern applied\r\nmathematics in order to isolate the phenomena at each scale that\r\nare the essential elements of this multi-scale coupling.  The\r\ninvestigator's work focuses on using these modern applied math\r\ntechniques to understand the multi-scale coupling of the tropical\r\natmosphere.  Specifically, he seeks to understand how storm\r\nsystems, which live for several days, organize to affect\r\nplanetary scale wind patterns, which modulate over the course of\r\nseveral months.  Furthermore, these wind patterns generate\r\nweather waves that propagate away from the tropics over the\r\ncontinental U.S.  The investigator uses similar mathematical\r\ntechniques to understand this wave generation.  Improving our\r\nunderstanding of these phenomena will increase the accuracy of US\r\nweather forecasts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSolar heating drives the atmospheric circulation in the tropics.   This large scale circulation consists of poleward flow and eastward jets in the high troposphere, and equator ward converging flow and westward trade winds in the lower troposphere.   The circulation, itself, is driven by the release of latent heat of condensation in tropical storm systems - which, although much smaller than the planet as a whole, combine to drive the planetary circulation.  \n\nIt is on this circulation that tropical atmospheric waves propagate.    These waves are generated by storm systems which act like a pebble landing on the surface of the water - sending waves away from the source of the disturbance.    These waves are important in that they carry pressure and wind signals that were generated, say, in Indonesia, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas.    \n\nThe waves have been studied for many years, bearing the name Kelvin and Rossby waves - but have mostly been understood to propagate on either a motionless  atmosphere or an atmosphere containing only east/west winds.   \n\nAmong the most significant results of this project is that these large scale Kelvin and Rossby waves are completely mangled by the equator to pole Hadley circulation.   This provides an explanation of why observed Kelvin waves do not exist at low frequencies - something not explained in previous studies.    We also found that tropical Rossby waves, themselves the nesting regions of tropical cyclones, leak their energy into the middle latitudes when they travel through a longitude of strong equator to pole circulation.   \n\nThe easterly/westerly winds in the subtropics have long been known to be unstable, shedding waves poleward with regularity.  In our studies, we discovered a new coupled instability which looks like, both, a Kelvin and a Rossby wave.   This result is significant because the resulting wave propagates along the equator - not a characteristic of previously studied instabilities.  Furthermore, the two underlying waves carry different physical quantities (the Kelvin carrying atmospheric density while the Rossby wave carries angular momentum).    Not only have we found the physical explanation for the existence of this wave, but we have determined the atmospheric conditions in which it arises.    In doing so, we collaborated closely with atmospheric observationalists.\n\nWe   developed new models of the heating effect of tropical storms by studying detailed computer simulations on 50 mile horizontal length scales in order to infer the storms' effects on larger scales.  This involved international collaborations with faculty and graduate students in the Netherlands.\n\nWe also developed a new simplification of the tropical atmospheric equations appropriate for the deep tropics (very close to the equator) on time scales of a few days - these equations capture the wave phenomena which arise when tropical cyclones form and could explain how packets of tropical cyclones can form in quick succession in the tropical Pacific Ocean.\n\nThough these projects are united by a common goal - understanding tropical waves and their interaction with smaller scale storm systems and larger scale winds - they also share the fact that the mathematical technique of asymptotic analysis was used to arrive at simplified models.    The success of these mathematical techniques spun off two new projects, one in fluid flows in elastic media and the other in diffusion in hydrocarbon cracking, a problem of interest to the oil industry.   \n\nThrough this project, the NSF directly funded the training of one graduate student while indirectly, two undergrads were involved in associated research - both of whom are now graduate students at US institutions.   A postdoctoral researcher (funded through a separate NSF VIGRE grant) was mentored by the PI, while two international collaborations and two collaborations within the US arose as part of the project.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph A Biello"
