 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is centered on the Columbia University Bridge to the PhD in the Natural Sciences Program. The program provides full-time employment to post-baccalaureate students from underrepresented groups whose objective is to gain admission into a PhD program in a STEM discipline. Participants in the program are hired as research assistants for up to two years while they are enrolled in at least one science class per semester at Columbia. While in the program the students are provided with structured professional development and are heavily mentored. Throughout their time in the program the students conduct research under the direct supervision of their mentors. They are provided a salary and some funds for professional and educational expenses. As employees of Columbia program participants are eligible for university benefits. One interesting aspect of this program is that it is shared-risk in the sense that the mentors of the students provide 30% of their salary while they are in the program. This is an incentive to both the students and the mentors to work together on the research projects. \r\n\r\nThe program is partnered with the Columbia School of Continuing Education. This partnership provides students in the program direct access to professional development workshops and other support services that are designed to ensure a successful time at Columbia and to help with their eventual application to PhD programs. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the program is two-fold. Firstly, participation gives the students an opportunity to decide whether the rigors of graduate study, including independent research, are what they want. Secondly, for those who decide that a PhD is in their future the program helps them to become competitive applicants for selective doctoral programs in their chosen field of study. The funding requested in this proposal will allow an additional seven students to matriculate into the program as part of the next two Bridge cohorts.",
