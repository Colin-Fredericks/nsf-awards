The Mg2(Si,Sn) compounds not only exhibit good thermoelectric properties but also comprise of non-toxic and abundantly available elements with high chemical and thermal stability. This award supports travel for research  discussions between senior participants and students at Clemson University (Clemson, SC) and Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) on the thermoelectric properties of Mg2(Si,Sn) nanocomposites. The results emanating from these research discussions are expected to provide guidance for developing collaborative research efforts for designing thermoelectrically favored microstructures and for thermoelectric properties optimization.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this activity is very pertinent to our overall energy needs in the future, as the US currently is responsible for one fourth of the world?s energy usage and China?s energy demands are growing rapidly as the standard of living is increasing throughout the country. The students participating in this activity will become more aware of global energy needs.",
