 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intelligent Infrastructure Systems Education Project (I2SEP) is a, multi-interdisciplinary, advanced technological education (ATE) project that is improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related undergraduate education primarily in the electronics technology (ET) area. This project is also addressing curricula needs for non-electronics based technologies that utilize complex networked electronic systems to provide automation and control functions or to further enhance system efficiency, safety, and security of the nation's infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThe I2SEP project is tackling the lack of curricula available to address the new skill sets needed by the electronics/systems technicians of the coming decade as the nation begins to rebuild its aging infrastructure and implements new technologies to enhance in-place systems in power delivery (SmartGrid), alternative energy production, building automation, transportation systems, etc. The new paradigm in electronics technology of systems-on-a-chip and a ubiquitous Internet providing connectivity is driving this project's efforts in the creation of system-centered curricula materials that include original, powerful, interactive simulations and conventional curriculum modules. Annual project workshops are providing faculty with professional development in the utilization of student-centered teaching strategies and methodologies, the emerging field of networked sensors and embedded controller technology, and various intelligent infrastructure applications enabled by these technologies. \r\n\r\nOn a broader level, the project is hosting annual Industry/educator summits to assist in the planning of strategies needed to deliver the required skill sets to students in both electronics and non-electronics based disciplines. Through these activities, a replicable model for the development of multi-interdisciplinary educational materials for both electronics and non-electronics based technology fields by traditional electronics faculty members is being created.",
