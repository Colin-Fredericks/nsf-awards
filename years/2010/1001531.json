 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to further the mathematical understanding of two simple physical models:  the nonlinear Schrodinger equation and the classical Coulomb gas associated with random matrices. The central theme in our investigations of the Coulomb gas is to develop the theory for arbitrary values of the inverse temperature, as opposed to the three special values, namely, 1, 2, and 4.  In particular, we wish to show that there is no phase transition.  A second goal is to better understand the empirically observed occurrence of random matrix statistics in manifestly deterministic scenarios, by first considering models with very little randomness. The second part of the project concerns well-posedness questions for the nonlinear Schrodinger equations at critical regularity.  Our primary goal is to complete the picture in those cases where the critical regularity corresponds to a coercive conservation law, specifically, the energy- and mass-critical equations. We will further attempt to make some initial inroads into the case of non-conserved critical regularity in a particular case where this seems most feasible. \r\n\r\nThe theory of random matrices is driven by empirical data as surely as any physical science:  Its roots lie in statistical analysis (specifically, ANOVA) and the analysis of experimental energy-level data.  More recently, random matrix statistics have been observed in the vibrations of drums and the behaviour of the prime numbers. The researches of this project are aimed at helping to elucidate and explain the results of these truly mathematical experiments. Although the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used as a simple effective model for several physical phenomena, the goal of this project is to further our understanding of the long-time behaviour of solutions to this equation principally as a model for general dispersive evolution equations.  By choosing to work with (scaling-)critical initial data, we place ourselves precisely at the border between the well-studied subcritical regime and the terra incognita of supercritical equations.  As an example of how developments of such simplified equations has fed into more physical models, we note one past off-shoot of the theory of dispersive equations at critical regularity: we now know that the well-posedness of the equations of fluid flow (as opposed to the spontaneous generation of extremely turbulent behaviour) is something that can be rigorously verified by computer for any prescribed size of initial data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe project focused on two topics: Random matrices and NLS.\n\nIt was posited by the physicist E. Wigner that the characteristic vibrations (eigenvalues) of very complicated systems might be reasonably modelled by a random system; subsequent experiment has shown this to be true to remarkabe accuracy.  When a system is coupled to an observer, these eigenvalues become resonances, with an additional `width' parameter capturing the rate at which energy is lost to the observer.  One of the significant outcomes of the random matrix portion of the project is the description of the statistics of the resonance widths for all three of Dyson's symmetry classes (odd/even spin &amp; with/without time reversal invariance).  Previously, this had only been tackled in the 'unitary' or symmetryless case.\n\nThe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (or NLS) arrises in many physical contexts. In optics, for example, it captures the two important properties of dispersion (light of differing colours travels at differing speeds in typical materials) and of the nonlinearity of refractive index (which becomes apparent at the light intensities achieved by lasers).  One of the principal outcomes in this part of the project is the analysis of the effect that inclusions (more specifically convex obstacles) have on the long-time behaviour of NLS.  While the ultimate answer is that it has little effect, verifying this was lengthy and multi-faceted.  In addition to the new techniques developed, it also required addressing basic questions of general interest: the non-refocusing of dispersive evolutions off convex obstacles and equivalence/inequivalence of the two natural ways of measuring the size/smoothness of functions outside obstacles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rowan B Killip"
