 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a new REU site in the Physics Department at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.   The site intends to engage undergraduate students for ten weeks during the summer with exciting research that is centered on optics and laser physics, and to assist the professional development of the students.   Optics and Laser Physics affects all areas of physics, many other sciences, and everyday lives. Ongoing research at UNL includes exploring the ultra-energetic, with laser energy densities currently exceeding that of the solar interior, and the ultrafast, with time resolution sufficient to \"see\" individual atoms move in a molecule. The Optics and Laser Physics program combines state of the art experimental research with powerful theoretical support. Technological applications include switching magnetic domains with ultrafast lasers to improve data storage and retrieval rates.   The professional development program for students includes a seminar, attendance and contribution to a research seminar, visits to local optics-related industry, a job orientation, GRE preparation, and graduate school selection preparation.",

The program was very popular. A total of 368 students applied, to fill only 28 positions that were funded. Our application process requires transcripts, reference letters, and an application letter to be considered complete. In 2010, 2011, and 2012 we had 82, 116, and 170 complete applications, respectively. In the 2011 and 2012 year, 30% and 23% applicants were female.

Of the total of 18 students that accepted offers, 6 or (33%) students were from underrepresented groups; 3 were female, 1 American Indian, and 2 Hispanic. The GPA of the applicants in 2011 is 3.46, while for the accepted students the GPA is 3.75. This GPA&nbsp;reflects the overall quality as perceived by the mentors; the students were considered to be highly motivated&nbsp;and hard working. The GPA of the 2011/2012 applicant pool for Asians was 3.62/3.57, for Caucasians 3.55/3.54, for Hispanics 3.31/3.37, for African Americans 2.90/2.91, and for women 3.40/3.44. The applicant&rsquo;s major was a double major for 55 out of 116 students (2011), while 6 students had majors different from physics.
