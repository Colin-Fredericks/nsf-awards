 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemistry supports Andrew Schmitt of the University of Wisconsin - Madison as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.   Dr. Schmitt will work with Prof. Mahesh Mahanthappa  to investigate the influence of polydispersity of the linking group in amphiphilic tri-block copolymers.   The work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory and with scientists at DOW chemical.   For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will organize a series of \"Science Cafes\" to discuss careers in chemistry with local high school students.  In these activities, he will also collaborate with his colleagues both at Argonne National Laboratory and DOW chemical.\r\n\r\nResearch like that of Dr. Schmitt is aimed ultimately at not only developing improved materials but learning new design principles for molecular engineering.   Results from research like that supported here will lead to new kinds of advanced materials with useful properties.   The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Schmitt  are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to pursue higher education in chemistry, by providing examples of the kinds of interesting career options available to trained chemists.",
