 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large relatively high-elevation surfaces with low relief are common on\r\nthe continents. Such uplifts have a significant impact on the geological \r\nrecord by influencing drainage networks and sediment supply, on climate by modifying\r\natmospheric circulation, and on biogeography and the biota. Work in geodynamics has\r\nshown that such uplifts amount to a telling signature of mantle dynamics. Thus, they\r\nprovide a means to discriminate among hypotheses about how the continental lithosphere\r\nand the deeper mantle interact through processes that result in uplift and mass transfer in\r\ncontinental interiors. The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and\r\naccessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which\r\nmantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have\r\nbeen important agents in its uplift. This five-year project proposes to use the Hangay\r\nDome as such a laboratory to coordinate studies of both the structure and state of the\r\nlithosphere and the sublithospheric mantle as well as the history of surface uplift and\r\nlandscape evolution. The project will involve observations and measurements made using\r\nbroadband seismology, basalt and xenolith petrology and geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar\r\ngeochronology, stable-isotope and vesicular-basalt paleoaltimetry, geomorphology and\r\n10Be geochronology, molecular genetics of divergent fish populations, and U-Th/He and\r\n4He/3He thermochronology.  The Hangay Dome?s widespread exposures of basaltic lavas,\r\nwhich were erupted over the past 30 Ma across a broad range of elevations, will be key to\r\nthe integration of all these data.  Dating of the basalts will enable linkage of petrologic data\r\nbearing on basalt genesis and the nature of the Hangay-Dome mantle with studies that\r\nuse the lavas as time markers for documenting landscape evolution and the history of\r\nsurface uplift.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe theory of plate tectonics, with its focus on the lateral motion of lithospheric plates, effectively explains many first-order observations about Earth.  For example, mountains, earthquakes, and volcanoes are typically associated with plate boundaries such as subduction zones where plates collide and rifts where plates pull apart.  The interiors of continents are generally quiet tectonically and for the most part do not reach high elevations. However, within some continents high-elevation, low-relief surfaces, intracontinental plateaus exist.  While vertical motion, uplift and subsidence have long been recognized as an important part of continental geology, the formation of continental plateaus is not predicted by plate tectonics. The goal of this research is to understand the processes responsible for developing high topography in continental interiors, by using the Hangay Mountains and Mongolian plateau as a natural research site.  These plateaus provide insight into how continents evolve and changes in surface topography through time influence river networks, climate, and biogeography. \n\nWorking as part of a multi-institutional and multi-national team, our research collaborators demonstrated that the low-relief surface of the Mongolia plateau was established over one hundred million years ago and is supported by thick continental crust built through repeated plate collisions over several hundred million years.  Importantly for the research at North Carolina State University are our colleagues? results demonstrating that beneath the thick crust of central Mongolia lies a thin mantle lithosphere and shallow convecting upper mantle.  In this setting, an active volcanic system has been erupting lavas at the surface for over 30 million years.\n\nUsing these constraints on the timing of lava flow extrusion out onto the surface across central Mongolia, we were able to calculate the amount of vertical relief (elevation difference between ridges and valley bottoms) present in the Hangay Mountains at the time of the volcanic eruptions.  Importantly, we document that the existence of deep valleys, similar to today?s topography, existed by at least 13 million years ago.  This suggests that the topographic uplift of the Hangay Mountains is not a geologically recent phenomenon, as suggested by some earlier studies.  These geomorphic studies are also consistent with results from our molecular genetic research on populations of stone loaches, small freshwater fishes, which suggest that the establishment of the continental drainage divide separating rivers flowing into the deserts of southern Mongolia from those flowing north into Lake Baikal was established as a barrier to genetic exchange by about 20 million years ago.\n\nThis intracontinental setting exhibits a number of characteristics commonly associated with plate boundaries: high topography, magmatism, active seismicity and large magnitude earthquakes, that is counter intuitively coexisting with landscape stability of significant time (hundreds of millions of years) and space (thousands of kilometers). Our research results help to constrain the timing and mechanisms associated with the development of this high-standing topography in the middle of the Eurasian tectonic plate within the larger framework of plate tectonics and outcomes can be used to help study similar features around the world including the Colorado Plateau in the US.\n\nThe geomorphic, geochronologic, and molecular data collected in support of this research is publically available by request from the PI (kwwegman@ncsu.edu), in scientific journal articles published in support of this research, and via the M.S. and Ph.D. theses of project-supported students on digital archive with the libraries of North Carolina State University and Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nIn addition, collaborative science film documentarian and science writer Doug Prose, published an article in the magazine EARTH that includes a discussion of our research into the geologic and topographic evolution of the Hangay Mountains and larger Mongolian Plateau.  The article is available at: https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/himalaya-connection-telling-story-geoscientific-exploration-film.  A major television documentary produced by the Earth Images Foundation (http://earthimage.org) that looks at the geologic processes that created the Himalayan Mountains and regions to the north, including insight from project scientists and graduate students regarding our work on the Mongolian Plateau, is now in the final stage of post-production.
