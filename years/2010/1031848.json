 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research award is to characterize the performance of an array of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators with multiple energy-domain inputs. By embedding SMA \"muscle\" wires in a biologically inspired \"vascular\" system, they can be actuated with combinations of electric and thermofluidic inputs. Electric activation is faster, while thermofluidic activation offers higher energy-storage capacity. The research approach is to first model the dynamics of a single \"wet\" SMA actuator to characterize speed and energy use as a function of the inputs and design parameters. The second task is to characterize the ability of optimal control strategies to balance speed and energy consumption of arrays of these actuators. The \"muscles\" will be actuated in a binary fashion (fully contracted/extended) and bundled together in series/parallel to achieve discrete displacements/forces. A scalable Network Array Architecture of electric and thermofluidic controls will activate the muscles. Graph Theory will be used to develop intelligent control algorithms to operate the networked actuator arrays.\r\n\r\nThis research will characterize the performance of these unique actuator systems using methods that can be adapted to other \"wet actuators\" such as Fuel-Powered SMAs and ElectroActive Polymers. Wet Actuators are anticipated to advance the capabilities of a variety of robotic systems such as prosthetics, exoskeletons, haptic devices and biomimicing robots. This work also aims to expand bioinspired robotics in a direction where the bioinspiration is anatomical and physiological in nature rather than in form and function. This research will be integrated into graduate, undergraduate and preparatory education by 1) enhancing graduate level courses to incorporate interdisciplinary engineering, 2) supervising capstone design projects focused on demonstrating wearable robotic applications, and 3) developing a novel educational Wet SMA Robot Kit that will be used in conjunction with existing K-12 outreach programs sponsored by the College of Engineering Office of Outreach and Diversity.",

These artificial muscles have the potential to enhance the wearability of prothetics and exoskeletons by safely and powerfully actuating many degrees of freedom with minimal bulk.</p>\n<p>SMAs are a Nickel Titanium alloy that exhibit a powerful muscle-like contraction when heated. While more complicated to control than traditional actuators (due to highly nonlinear dynamics), SMAs are capable of high power density and noiseless operation, and can store thermal energy, allowing them to maintain a force without continuous energy input. By controlling them in an on-off manner (fully contracted/extended) and networking large numbers of these actuators mechanically in series or parallel, a more realistic means of control can be achieved that is similar to how human muscles are controlled. In this project, we use a novel system design where we embed the SMA actuators in a network of compliant vessels (inspired by the human vascular system) and can control them with combinations of electrical inputs and thermofluidic inputs (hot and cold water). This sets up an interesting tradeoff between speed and efficiency, where electrical heating is expected to be fast but inefficient (heating occurs instantly along the entire actuator, but only a fraction of the thermal energy goes towards useful work), while thermofluidic heating is expected to be slow but efficient (the hot water takes time to propagate through the vessel, but can be recycled and used again).</p>\n<p>The first objective of this research was to characterize the dynamic performance of a single multi-input wet SMA actuator. In order to achieve this, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used in conjunction with a temperature-strain model of the SMA wire in order to simulate the thermomechanical response of the wire. Results showed that electric heating (with fluidic cooling) produces a maximum efficiency of 0.5% and a maximum cycle rate of 5 Hz. Fluidic heating and cooling produced a maximum efficiency of 0.2% and a maximum cycle rate of 2 Hz. Although the fluidic heating was surprisingly less efficient (due to thermal losses to the environment), a chemical energy source could be used to heat the fluid, which would have 100 times the energy density of electric batteries, which still gives a net advantage to fluidic heating in terms of the number of actuations that can be achieved per mass of energy storage. Futhermore, using both electric and fluid inputs concurrently maximizes the speed while also allowing for the actuation to remain contracted for an extended time without continuous energy input. Further details of this characterization are described in our journal publication in Smart Materials and Structures. A second journal publication in the IEEE/ASME Transactions of Mechatronics describes how we experimentally implemented a biologically-inspired vascular system driven by a SMA actuated robotic pump. Inspired by how the human heart provides energy to the muscles in the body (including itself), the robotic pump distributes thermofluidic energy (hot and cold water) to wet SMA muscle-actuators, some of which power the pump itself. Our experimental prototype was capable of pumping a net output of 66 mL/min, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the output of any other SMA pump, and is twice as much fluid as required to sustain the pump itself, both novel achievements. Finally, in our SPIE conference paper, we demonstrate a proof of concept for how this work can be extended to electroactive polymers (EAPs), where combinations of electric and chemofluidic inputs can be used to sequentially actuate and grow the artificial muscles.</p>\n<p>The second objective of this research was to characterize the performance of networked wet actuator arrays. In this case we use a network array architecture of wet SMA actuators arranged in a matrix of rows and columns, such that any actuator in the array can be contracted by activating combinations of electric switches and fluidic valves on each row and column. This architecture is scalable in the sense that only 2N control elements are required to control N squared actuators, but leads to an interesting control optimization problem in that only certain sub-arrays of actuators can be simultaneously contracted or extended, and thus a sequence of control commands is required to achieve the desired state for the entire array. In order find an optimal sequence of control commands, we exploited Graph theory algorithms, which have been tailored specifically to this problem based on our unique network array architecture and our multi-input dynamic actuator models, which represents a unique cross-disciplinary effort. Our conference papers in ICRA, IROS, and DSCC demonstrate a progression of algorithms with the cumulative ability to optimize speed, energy use, and tracking error for a multi-jointed robot finger actuated by a wet SMA actuator array.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/15/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mascaro</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031848/1031848_10020160_1497573824319_WetSMARobotHand--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031848/1031848_10020160_1497573824319_WetSMARobotHand--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wet SMA Robot Hand\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1031848/1031848_10020160_1497573824319_WetSMARobotHand--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wet SMA Robot Hand\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wet SMA Robot Hand.
