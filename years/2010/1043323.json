 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of South Florida to establish a Phase I Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico, the Florida Aquarium, and the Hillsborough County School System. The overall goal of the CCEP Phase I is to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts. This project will focus on the impacts of climate change in coastal areas, with sea level change as a core theme. The audience targeted by this project includes higher education and K-12 faculty, informal science educators, and college and K-12 students across the region, toward ultimately reaching the broader community. \r\n\r\nThe specific goals include to:\r\n1) Prepare a new generation of climate scientists, engineers, and technicians;  \r\n2) Prepare our region's citizens to understand global climate change and its real-time manifestations, and how to mitigate its impact;  \r\n3) Produce new knowledge about climate change, about preparing students to work on climate-related problems, and about means for effectively engaging the broader community in understanding the issue. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this project, the PIs expect to:\r\n1) Develop an inventory of existing climate change education resources with a focus on its effects on coastal regions.  \r\n2) Expand the Partnership to include other key players in the region.  \r\n3) Develop a comprehensive climate change education plan for coastal regions linked to sea level change.  \r\n4) Identify issues with \"traction\" for effective communication and education on climate change education specific to the coastal areas of the southeast and the Caribbean. \r\n5) Establish a larger partnership with representation from business and industry, community groups, and a broader menu of formal and informal educational institutions in the region. \r\n6) Pilot in Florida and Puerto Rico a \"transdisciplinary\" model for climate change education and research. \r\n7) Identify new areas of research on climate change education using the data from our evaluation, climate change education inventory, and stakeholder workshops.",

Additional partnering organizations included the Florida  Chapter of the American Planning Association, the Caribbean Tourism  Organization, CoHEMIS (consortium of Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin  academic and scientific organizations), the Florida Center for  Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University, HOK, Inc., and the  Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council. \n\nThe CACCE effort  sought to focus awareness on the climate-change challenges that directly  impact residents in the Florida and Caribbean region, the \"canary in  the coalmine\" for climate change-related societal impacts.  Our focus  was on effects on the \"built environment\" in our highly urbanized  coastal regions.   We emphasized the reality of sea level rise as a  climate change impact, one that caused not just coastal flooding but  also the destruction of freshwater resources and fisheries, and one  which threatened the tourism industry, the primary economic engine in  this region.  For CACCE, climate change wasn't a far away concern in  space and time, but one which was a problem now and could become  intractable in as little as a decade (the estimated time to the  compromising of the Biscayne Aquifer, the only freshwater source in  South Florida).  We emphasized climate change awareness, but especially  the necessity to adapt to the real changes in our region related to  rising seas in terms of regional planning and urban design. \n\nThe primary interventions conducted during our Phase 1 project were:\n\na)  Curriculum development efforts, working with teachers in both  Hillsborough County and Puerto Rico to inject climate change-focused  content into popular elective Ocean Science and Environmental Science  high-school courses.\n\nb) Annual Climate Education Showcase events  for regional K-12 teachers, which brought together a range of  climate-focused organizations and climate change researchers at local  colleges and universities to conduct workshops and interactive sessions  for educators.  \n\nc) Multiple Outcomes Interdisciplinary  Research and Learning (MOIRL) experiments in which climate researchers  partnered with high school and middle school teachers and students to  conduct investigations of climate change impacts.  A half-dozen such  projects were piloted, in both Florida and Puerto Rico, on topics  ranging from the study of water levels and chemistry in tidal cave  systems to tracking changes in the seasonal responses of plant  communities, to assaying public awareness and responses to extreme  weather events.\n\nd) Annual meetings/workshops for Florida informal  educators focused on how to best bring climate change programming into  their venues.\n\ne) Efforts to support the development of in-service  professional development content for Florida urban planners focused on  the regionally-specific impacts and concerns related to climate change.\n\nf) Efforts to establish a sustainable tourism program at UVI, in partnership with the territorial government and local resorts.\n\ng) a series of CACCE-sponsored climate education forums (see http://cohemis.uprm.edu/cacce/ , http://www.uprm.edu/news/articles/as2011145.html , http://cohemis.uprm.edu/clima2011/ )  focused on the Caribbean and hosted by the University of Puerto Rico at  Mayaguez, which involved academics and appointed officials from a range  of Caribbean nations (Virgin Islands, Barbados, Dominican Republic,  Belize, Jamaica)\n\nAnother key outcome of the CACCE project is the CACCE Information Portal (http://guides.lib...."
