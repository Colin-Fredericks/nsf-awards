However, successful quantum information processing requires mechanisms that make the basic operations reliable.  This project will extend the theory of subsystem codes, a class of quantum error-correcting codes that have rich structure and the potential to realize fault-tolerant operations more efficiently.  The goal of this project is to generalize the theory of subsystem codes from finite fields to more general arithmetic structures.  The objective is use this theory to derive better means to protect quantum information and obtain a wider class of efficient fault-tolerant quantum operations.\r\n\r\nAn outreach component directed towards K-12 students tries to wet the appetite for theoretical computer science.",
