 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, R. L. Penn of the University of Minnesota will seek to understand the fundamental chemical principles underlying nanoparticle crystal growth by the oriented aggregation mechanism.  The approach is to utilize an array of scattering and microscopy techniques to study nanocrystal growth as a function of reaction conditions and time.  In particular, four key hypotheses will be tested regarding the effects of surface charge, passivating agents, poor crystal faceting, and sequential reaction solution changes upon the structures and compositions of the resulting nanocrystals.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, disseminating research results, enhancing infrastructure for research and education through remote viewing of live microscopy in the classroom, and developing a laboratory module on nanocrystals for high school and middle school classes.\r\n\r\nThis work will expand our understanding about how to grow particles with dimensions on the order of one billionth of a meter with a high degree of control over structure and composition.  The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on nanotechnology fields in which nanoparticles are used, including medical imaging, display materials, and photovoltaics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow crystals grow is fundamental to a broad range of fields, ranging from the Earth Sciences to Materials Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Physics, and more.  This project focused on a special case of crystal growth called oriented aggregation.  When crystals grow by oriented aggregation, primary crystallites attach to one another in an arrangement that results in the formation of a new secondary and single crystal.  Crystals that grow by oriented aggregation often have unique shapes.  This aspect of crystal growth by oriented aggregation offers a new method by which nanocrystals of a particular size and shape can be produced.\n\n \n\nA major method for studying crystal growth is transmission electron microscopy, or TEM.  This method enables direct examination of nano-sized objects, and our work specifically focuses on crystals in the few to tens of nanometers size range.  We have quantified the kinetics of crystal growth by oriented aggregation by changing solution conditions (e.g., pH and other solution variables) as well as the properties of the primary particles (e.g., primary particle size).  Results demonstrate that the rate of crystal growth by oriented aggregation increases with decreasing particle size as well as increasing pH and dissolved salt concentration. This means we can control crystal growth by controlling these variables. \n\n \n\nUnfortunately, TEM requires that samples be dried and then inserted into a high vacuum.  This makes conclusions about HOW crystal growth by oriented aggregation occurs difficult.  Cryogenic TEM enables examination of crystals as they exist in liquid media. A sample of nanoparticles suspended in a solvent, such as water, can be prepared as a thin film and then plunged into cryogen, like liquid nitrogen or liquid ethane.  This results in the fast solidification of the liquid, preventing the formation of crystalline solvent (i.e., ice).  Such samples provide snapshots of how the nanocrystals are arranged in liquid media.\n\n \n\nThe image shown is of a sample of iron oxide nanocrystals in water.  This image was obtained using cryo-TEM. The uniform appearing grey background is the solid but not crystalline water and the darker dots are the crystalline iron oxide nanoparticles. From this image, we learn that the particles are not in direct contact with one another, even when they are aligned with each other (bottom two images).  Elucidation of how particles stick to one another and how the resulting aggregates evolve over time is critical to achieving control over crystal growth.  Our results suggest that the most control over crystal growth by oriented aggregation is likely to be gained at the earliest stages of crystal growth.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R.
