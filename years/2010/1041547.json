A fundamental goal of the workshop is to  bootstrap future innovation and collaborative, cross-disciplinary research between diverse fields, including, but not limited to, technology, medicine, and policy.  This award will assist approximately 10 US-based graduate students to attend the First  Workshop on Health Security and Privacy (HealthSec).  Participation in HealthSec and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience.  It provides students with the opportunity to interact with senior researchers in the field, and be exposed to leading edge work in the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 1st USENIX Workshop on Health Security and Privacy (HealthSec '10) is linked with the USENIX Security conference, which brings together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and networks.  Security and privacy are important goals for today's and tomorrow's technologies.  The challenge is to develop principled approaches for preserving our electronic security and privacy in the ever-changing landscape of new technologies and evolving threats.  HealthSec will bring together innovative practitioners and researchers in computer security and privacy, broadly defined, to tackle the challenging problems in this space.  The HealthSec '10 program included 21 technical papers.  The papers represent some of the outstanding work in the area, with topics including policy for health records, sharing data, sensors, client devices, mobile health and more.  The workshop was held in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, August 10, 2010.\n\n \n\nCriteria for selection of USENIX student stipends:\n\n \n\nThe USENIX Association offers stipends to most conferences they host.  Any student enrolled full-time at an accredited university or college is welcome to apply for a stipend.  Stipends have two components -- registration costs and expenses.  For those students selected, USENIX covers the registration costs by providing students with a complimentary registration code.  For the expense portion, USENIX provides a check to assist the student with costs related to airfare and hotel. The check is issued a few weeks prior to the event so the funds are available to the student before they travel. Variations in the amount of offers depends on how far a student will need to travel and the amount they request (i.e., some students may stay with a friend in the town of the conference, and therefore, do not need the hotel expense). We confirm that the students register and attend the event. We do not require that students provide us with a detailed accounting of how the funds were spent.\n\n \n\n- Students who are participating in the conference, e.g., presenting a poster\n\n \n\n- Students whose areas of study significantly overlap with the conference topics and who write a concise essay (supporting statement) outlining their research\n\n \n\n- First-time applicants and those who have not received a stipend in the past 12 months\n\n \n\n- Students who are willing to volunteer at the conference (this generally consists of writing a summary of technical session(s) for ;login:, the USENIX journal)\n\n \n\n- Students from institutions not traditionally represented at USENIX events\n\n \n\n- Student members of the Association (not required)\n\n \n\n- Class level and financial need\n\n \n\nUSENIX received six stipend applications from students, and six were awarded grants.  Some of the funds were covered by the $5,000 from the NSF.  USENIX appreciates the financial support of NSF, which allowed us to grant awards to many more qualified applicants than we would have been able to otherwise.\n\n \n\nAttendee Demographics:  There were 67 total Attendees at HealthSec.  Of these, 61 were from the US. Non-US attendees came from Brazil, Canada, Italy, Japan, and United Kingdom.\n\n \n\n \n\nTraining and Development:  Participating in conferences such as HealthSec is one important component in the training and development of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of systems and medicine.  The student travel support program provided stipends that enabled a larger number of students to attend HealthSec and benefit from the training and development opportunities that it offered.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe website has the program, event details, and link to the publications from HealthSec 2010:  http://www.usenix.org/event/healthsec10/.\n\n \n\n \n\nContributions within Discipline:  The main contribution of this grant is toward the training and development of the six systems and medical undergraduate and graduate students who attended the conference via the travel support program.\n\n \n\n \n\nContributions to Resources for Research and Education:  As part of the travel program, the awardees volunteered their assistance as scribes to record the technical discussions for the benefit of the greater research community. This is available in the form of a conference report online and in ;login:, the USENIX magazine.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tadayoshi Kohno"
