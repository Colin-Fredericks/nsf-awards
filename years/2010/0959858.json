 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis project will acquire a scanning vibrometer for a multi-disciplinary research program. A vibrometer uses the Doppler shift of a reflected laser beam to measure the vibration of objects without contact. In this project, the vibrometer will be used to investigate the ultrasound radiation force excitation technique; this technique uses the interference between two ultrasound sources to vibrate macroscopic and microscopic objects without contact. The other major goal of the project is to use the scanning vibrometer for research in musical acoustics. To produce their characteristic tones, musical instruments are sophisticated systems that often involve nonlinear oscillators, coupled to complex resonant structures. The project will enable a more thorough understanding of how these musical instruments work. Undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the research. \r\n\r\nMeasurements obtained using the vibrometer will lead to a better understanding of the unique capabilities available using ultrasound radiation force excitation of microcantilevers. This may impact areas that rely on the vibration of microcantilevers, including ultras-sensitive mass detection and atomic force microscopy. The musical acoustic studies will have an impact because of the close collaboration between academic researchers and actual instrument builders. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to collaborate with well-known researchers who will have remote access to the scanning vibrometer through Gustavus? cyber-enabled acoustics lab. Students and the general public will benefit from classroom demonstrations in acoustics and oscillations that use the scanning vibrometer via the cyber-enabled lab or web. Results will be disseminated widely in presentations, publications, and via a web site.",
