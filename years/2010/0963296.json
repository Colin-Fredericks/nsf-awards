 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe Biology Department at Indiana University of Pennsylvania is housed in Weyandt Hall, a 1960's era structure built to serve as a general-purpose facility for a state teachers' college. The layout and infrastructure of the building were designed for low-impact classroom demonstration activities but not for high-impact modern research. Research efforts are currently hampered by poorly-configured spaces, insufficient access to utilities and fume hoods, deteriorated facilities for shared instruments and problematic climate control and HVAC. This award provides funds to renovate and upgrade research and research training spaces in the Department of Biology. Funds for ceiling, ventilation system and HVAC upgrades, new casework, flooring, sinks, and chemical fume hoods for safety and additional utilities along with installation of equipment for specialized facilities (such as a large freezer units, wash units, and temperature control systems) are provided to increase usefulness and efficiency. Renovations funded by the NSF upgrade will improve research and research training spaces and create 12 laboratories that correspond to areas of research emphasis within the Department. These renovations will create a modern, efficient and effective research and research training environment. The award supports Department's educational philosophy that emphasizes active learning, with integral laboratories with the courses and multiple opportunities for hands-on learning outside the formal classroom structure.",
