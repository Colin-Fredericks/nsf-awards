The local organization is in the hands of researchers from the Universities of Bari and Bologna. The purpose of the ISSNLA is to acquaint doctoral students with recent developments and novel applications in a subfield of Applied Mathematics called \"Numerical Linear Algebra\". By design, the summer school is forward-looking: the courses cover topics\r\nthat are too recent to have been included in textbooks or doctoral courses; these topics include nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and tensor analysis and computations.\r\n\r\nThe target audience of the International Summer School on Numerical Linear Algebra are doctoral students in any field that requires results and methods from Numerical Linear Algebra.  The courses will be self contained, and taught at a level that is accessible to a wide audience. They will be of interest to graduate students in science and engineering. The lecturers are leading experts who are also well known for their expository skills.  They were chosen by an Advisory Committee composed by leading international scientists.\r\nNSF support for US-based participants will have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the US in this crucial discipline, with its connections to virtually every area of scientific computing.",
