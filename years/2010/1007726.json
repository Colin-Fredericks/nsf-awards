 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator has two objectives to accomplish in this research\r\nproject. The first objective is to develop theory of statistical \r\ninference for a new class of semi-parametric odds ratio models that\r\ninclude both the generalized linear model and the Cox regression model \r\nas special cases. The second objective is to apply this class of \r\nmodels to solve a number of theoretical problems that are of \r\nimportance in applications. These applications include \r\n(1) addressing issues in parameter identifiability, estimation, \r\nand inference in biased sampling designs in studying the association \r\nof a disease with gene and environment factors, (2) introducing \r\na new approach for testing goodness of fit of generalized linear \r\nmodels, and (3) developing a new flexible semi-parametric\r\nprocedure for multivariate density estimation and \r\nsurvival analysis with complex dependence structures.\r\n\r\nFlexible and easily interpretable stochastic models are \r\nvery useful in extracting information from data with complex \r\nstructures. Such data are often collected in studies exploring \r\nthe causes of diseases and other socio-economic problems. \r\nThe investigator proposes a new class of models for the \r\nstatistical analysis of such data. Results from this \r\nresearch will have broad applications in a variety of scientific fields. \r\nWhen applied to epidemiological studies, results from this research \r\nwill be able to facilitate the design of more powerful statistical \r\ntests for detecting genetic and environmental causes of disease. \r\nWhen applied to sociological studies, results from this research \r\nwill be able to facilitate the understanding of underlying causes \r\nof complex socio-economic problems so that better solutions to the \r\nproblems can be found.",
