 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Materials Research provides support to Indiana University to design and conduct research and development on four different types of neutron spin manipulation devices that are required for advanced polarized neutron instrumentation. Most of the design is based on computer simulation of magnetic fields which interact with the neutrons. The principal investigators will construct partial prototypes and test them using polarized neutrons at the Low Energy Neutron Source (LENS) at Indiana University to reduce technical risk for follow-on construction activities. The equipment will result in qualitative and quantitative increases in scientific productivity, on at least six existing or planned spectrometers at the country?s major neutron sources. The broader impact of this proposal consists of providing neutron scattering capabilities that will be available to all users of U.S. national neutron facilities allowing them to obtain scientific information that is currently inaccessible. The project provides opportunity for training of several students who will contribute to the design, construction, and utilization of next generation instruments for neutrons.",
