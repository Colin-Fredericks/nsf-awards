 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in\r\nMathematics (ICERM) is a new Institute. Its mission is to support\r\nand encourage research in the mathematical sciences with a\r\nthematic focus on the fruitful interplay between mathematics and\r\ncomputers, explored and developed through computation and\r\nexperimentation.  ICERM will accomplish these goals through a\r\nvariety of programs and activities. The Institute will run one\r\nlarge research program per semester, with each program focusing\r\non a particular subtopic that aligns with the general\r\ntheme. Program participants will range from graduate students to\r\nsenior researchers. During the summers, the Institute will host\r\nadditional programs for postdoctoral scholars and early career\r\nresearchers, as well as for undergraduates selected from a\r\nnational pool.\r\n\r\nICERM will be a novel institute in an area of growing\r\nimportance. An Institute in computational and experimental\r\nmathematics has the potential to cut across disciplines within\r\nand beyond mathematics and statistics. The Institute programs\r\nwill strongly emphasize training and retaining graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral scholars in the mathematical sciences community.\r\nICERM's leadership has substantial experience in supporting and\r\nworking with underrepresented groups in the mathematical\r\nsciences, and Institute programming will provide new\r\nopportunities for underrepresented students and scholars.  ICERM\r\nhas already initiated partnerships with leading research intense\r\ncompanies and national research laboratories, and effective plans\r\nto nurture these partnerships will help to sustain a rich and\r\ndeep interaction with the broader research community.",
