 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project proposes innovative heat transfer research involving dropwise condensation on a wettability gradient.  Dropwise condensation alone has shown the ability to increase condensation heat transfer coefficients by an order of magnitude over film condensation, typical of vertical thermosyphons.  Droplets condensing on a gradient surface experience different contact angles, causing the droplets to accelerate to high velocities in the direction of increased wettability.  The difference in contact angle on opposite sides of the condensing droplets is due to locally varying properties of the condensing surface, controlled by varying surface concentrations of molecules with low surface energy.  The higher droplet velocities caused by condensing on the gradient surface further increases the heat transfer coefficient over typical dropwise condensation.  Furthermore, the gradient surface does not require gravity to remove liquid from the condensing surface, enabling dropwise condensation heat transfer on horizontal surfaces and in microgravity applications.  In this proposal, the technology demonstrated in Phase I will be integrated into a vapor chamber heat transfer device suitable for electronics cooling.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in the thermal management industry.  Specifically, incorporating this innovation will enable significantly improved thermal performance in vapor chambers, leading to cost savings and allowing improved performance in a number of industries.  In the computing industry, solutions for notebook computers and servers are becoming increasingly limited by thermal issues.  In micro-gravity environments, these new gradient surfaces will replace or enhance the capillary forces currently used in heat pipe devices, such as axially grooved heat pipes and loop heat pipes, for communication satellite applications.  In the nuclear industry, more efficient condensation directly increases electrical conversion efficiency.  There is already a demand for higher capacity thermal solutions, and this demand will only increase as commercial entities and government agencies expand their capabilities and demand greater thermal dissipation.  This development effort will also enhance the fundamental understanding of liquid movements due to surface gradients and similar Marangoni flows, which will have an impact in various fields, including research related to fluid pumping in micro-fluidic applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThermal management is necessary to maintain the reliability of many processes and products that affect our everyday life.  In particular, the thermal management of electronics devices has become an increasing difficult issue, as faster devices ultimately dissipate heat at faster rates.  Further, the density at which the heat is dissipated also increases as devices get smaller. Advances in heat pipe technology have helped solve some of these issues over the last 1-2 decades.  However, for electronics to continue to increase in capability, further advances are needed.\n\nThis program successfully developed a technology that enables better performance in heat pipe devices.  Using a patterned nano-scale surface coating that creates patches of hydrophobic surfaces, the researchers were able to demonstrate the active removal of droplets from condensing surfaces without a capillary wick structure.  Ultimately, this improved the thermal performance of the condensing region of the heat pipe by a factor of ten.  The beauty of this technology is that it requires no moving parts or external energy input to improve heat transfer.  This will enable the surface to be of high reliability and have no environmental impact due to energy usage. \n\nIn addition to managing heat in electronics, the technology could also be used in a number of other applications, including DNA replication, LED cooling, data centers, hybrid vehicles, and satellites.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard W Bonner"
