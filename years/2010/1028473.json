 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms and limitations of rapid electrical control of the emission frequency in single-mode quantum cascade lasers using bias control of the modal effective refractive index. Rapidly tunable single-mode quantum cascade lasers with all-electrical control of the emission frequency will be used to demonstrate a prototype of a free-space optical frequency-modulation link.\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\nThe proposed research is aimed at further exploration of the unique physics and design flexibility of quantum cascade lasers. We will study a delicate interplay between the effectiveness of voltage control of the devices frequency and their performance characteristics. This work will create knowledge needed of the realization of mid-infrared semiconductor lasers that can be frequency modulated at speeds well above 1 GHz.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed research contains elements of many disciplines, including quantum mechanics, optics, high-frequency electronics, and semiconductor microfabrication and provides an excellent educational environment for graduate and undergraduate students. Knowledge developed during the research will be incorporated into graduate-level courses taught by the principle investigators, and disseminated to the research community through publications, technology transfer, and the research group websites. The devices developed over the course of this project are expected to enable the creation of high-fidelity optical communication links based on frequency-modulation in the 8-12 microns atmospheric transparency window.",
