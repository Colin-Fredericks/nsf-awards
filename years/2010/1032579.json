This proposal seeks to fabricate novel nanoparticles capable of killing bacteria in biofilms via antibiotics, quorum sensing quenchers, and quorum sensing disruptors conjugated to the nanoparticles.  The mutlifunctionalized nanoparticle strategy of penetrating, analyzing and destroying highly resistant bacteria embedded in a protective EPS, is conceptually simple, but involves complex chemistry using CLICK chemistry for efficient synthesis and RAFT methodology for massive functionalization on each nanoparticle.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nA strength of this proposal is the multidisciplinary linkage of nanochemistry with biofilm microbiology research and its applicability to a range of biofilm problems. The applicant proposes a 4-phased outreach plan, which includes outreach activities in elementary school, development of an instructional video for middle school, multiple lectures in the two graduate-level course and recruitment of minorities to the research group.",
