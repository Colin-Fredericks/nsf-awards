 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institutional infrastructure project will build on two previous CRI grants in order to significantly enhance the current shared high performance computing infrastructure in order to keep up with rapidly increasing research demands. The resulting world-class computing facilities will be shared with all Computer Science (CS) faculty researchers, Binghamton collaborators, external collaborators, and students.  Specifically, the requested infrastructure consists of high-end PowerEdge Blade servers along with a robust and high performance storage subsystem. These systems address the computational and storage needs common to research projects in microarchitectural-level power and performance assessment tool design, data center energy optimization techniques, parallel discrete event simulation, multimedia senor networks, Grid and cloud scheduling, data reduction of scientific datasets, large scale web database integration systems projects, virtualization, real-time data services, and I/O intensive simulation projects.\r\n\r\nThe resulting world-class computing facilities will benefit students, faculty, and collaborators. It will be used to enhance a wide variety of courses, and the project includes a coordinated education and research program that enhances the department's instruction and student training efforts.  Results will be disseminated to a wide audience through research publications and also on a Web page devoted to the project to advertise how the facility is being used.\r\n\r\nThe CS Department where the equipment is housed is committed to increasing the enrollment of women and students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and its involvement of undergraduates in research (as evidenced, e.g., by a current CISE REU Site).  This equipment will help the department to advance these efforts by driving research that will be attractive to the best students from these groups.",
