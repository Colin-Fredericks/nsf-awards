 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development of an adaptive immersive experience for on-going teacher in-service education and to improve science teacher?s understanding of physics concepts and principles which they will in turn teach to their own students. The innovation underlying this proposal is to integrate pedagogically sound training principles derived from intelligent tutoring system research into immersive environments to improve the understanding of physics concepts and principles in both teachers and students in high school and post-high school educational settings.  An intelligent immersive environment will adapt its instruction e.g., differentially giving advice to students based on an assessment of their overall performance, to the individual learner thus improving the efficacy and efficiency of the instruction. \r\n\r\nThere is a growing scarcity of qualified science teachers and especially physics teachers at the high school level. The proposed activity will advance the education and training communities? understanding of intelligent instruction in immersive environments by creating an instance (i.e., a physics environment) which can serve as a foundation for future research.  In addition, the innovation is a point solution aiming to improve science teacher?s understanding of physics concepts and principles to improve their own teaching endeavors.  The initial solution will be fielded in San Antonio and the South Texas region, an area with a high Hispanic population.  Upon refinement, the physics environment could reach traditionally under-represented populations who have limited access to master physics instructors.  Locally, the proposed project will extend the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) relationships of the ongoing San Antonio Math Science Education Coalition (SAMSEC) involving business, secondary education, and post-secondary education organizations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Immersive Environment for Physics Instruction\n\nProject Goal\n\nThe Immersive Environment for Physics Education (IEPE) project is to address a growing scarcity of qualified science teachers and especially physics teachers at the high school level by providing rich professional development opportunities in a computer-based environment called a virtual world.  Not only will teachers be able to use the physics virtual world for their own professional development, but also as an instructional tool with their students.  Therefore, the long-term project goal is to improve the understanding of physics concepts and principles in both teachers and students in high school and post-high school educational settings.   \n\n \n\nDiligent\u00c6s vision is to develop engaging, interactive, adaptive software for teachers and students to learn basic high school level physics concepts and principles.  The instructional software will be engaging in that the learners will be immersed in a virtual world that requires them to be active in their learning experience.  A virtual world, also known as an immersive environment, is a simulation of a three dimensional (3D) place which will contain the relevant objects required for the students to complete a series of physics learning activities.  The learners, through their online character (i.e., an avatar), will explore the physics concepts and principles in these visually rich, 3D contexts by actively participating in experiments as an individual or in small groups of students.  The instructional components of the immersive environment, called the tutoring system, will monitor the students as they perform the activities, diagnose their actions, and provide relevant feedback and advice to the learner. \n\n \n\nInnovation Underlying the Product\n\nThe technical innovation is the integration of pedagogically sound instructional principles derived from intelligent tutoring system research into a virtual world.  Virtual worlds are quickly gaining traction in education and training communities for online synchronous instruction.  The disadvantage of this, however, is the same as with all synchronous instruction: the instructors and students must be available at the same time.  With the integration of a tutoring system underlying the virtual world, Diligent will be able to deliver effective instruction asynchronously, so that instructors and students can learn in the immersive environment at any time.  Furthermore, an intelligent immersive environment will be able to adapt its instruction to the individual learner thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction.\n\nThe integration of a tutoring system with a virtual world, which delivers adaptive, pedagogically sound instruction, remains the key innovation of this project.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kurt Steuck"
