 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over recent years, significant effort has gone into ensuring high\r\navailability and integrity of NSF-funded large-scale computational\r\nresearch cyberinfrastructure. This project targets the improvement\r\nof a particular security component that is widely used to protect\r\nthese NSF investments: the open-source \"Bro\" intrusion detection\r\nframework, which is deployed by major universities, large research\r\nlabs, supercomputing centers, and open-science communities. Bro's\r\npopularity is a two-edged sword, however, as it comes with demands\r\nthat are often difficult to meet for the small research team behind\r\nthe system. Therefore, this work establishes a sustainable\r\ndevelopment model for Bro by providing explicit engineering\r\nresources outside of the scope of research efforts, and uses them to\r\nadvance the system to a state at which Bro's user community can take\r\na more active role in its future development. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, this project (1) improves the perspective of\r\nBro's end-users by providing extensive up-to-date documentation and\r\nsupport, and refining many of the rough edges that the system has\r\naccumulated over time; (2) unifies and modernizes Bro's current code\r\nbase that has evolved over 14 years of active development; (3)\r\nimproves Bro's processing performance to the degree required for\r\noperation in current and future large-scale scientific environments;\r\nand (4) adds new data analysis functionality in the form of a highly\r\ninteractive graphical user interface and a transparent database\r\ninterface. By specifically addressing much of the feedback the Bro\r\nteam has received from users, the project enables a wide range of\r\nnew sites to use Bro effectively for protecting their\r\ncyberinfrastructure.",
