 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis research develops a novel framework for interpolation and approximation of multivariate data.\r\nThe research introduces a method for construction of non-separable multivariate splines that are geometrically\r\ntailored for general sampling lattices with emphasis on sphere packing and covering lattices\r\nin multidimensions. These multivariate splines lead to the design of multidimensional signal processing\r\ntools, that have proven degree of continuity and approximation order for sampling lattices.\r\nThe splines under investigation, called Voronoi splines, are B-spline-like elements that inherit the\r\ngeometry of any sampling lattice from its Voronoi cell and form basis for reconstruction. Furthermore,\r\nthe relationship of the proposed splines with the well-known multivariate box splines are investigated\r\nand used for evaluation purposes. Compared to other polyhedral splines, Voronoi splines form shiftinvariant\r\nspaces for approximation. This property makes them uniquely suitable for multidimensional\r\nsignal processing.",
