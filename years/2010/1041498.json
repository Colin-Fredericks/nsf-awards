 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is an outcome of the NSF 09-524 program solicitation ''George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Research (NEESR)\"  competition and includes Cornell University (lead institution) and the University at Buffalo (UB), State University of New York and California State Los Angeles University (CSULA). This project will utilize the NEES equipment sites at Cornell University and University at Buffalo.\r\n\r\nLifelines include underground water, waste and storm disposal, natural gas, and liquid fuel pipelines, electric power cables, and telecommunication conduits that are critical for public health, security, and economic well-being. A large part of US lifeline systems are old and have deteriorated. To restore the health of these aging systems, special technologies have been developed to insert pipe linings, composed of polymers, into existing underground lifelines without digging them up and disrupting surrounding communities. The research will substantially improve the performance of underground lifelines during both earthquakes and daily use by investigating how polymeric linings improve their resistance to ground shaking and ground failure. The research involves a strong university-industry partnership with pipe lining companies, public utilities, and engineering firms. The testing capabilities at the  Cornell NEES Site are ideally suited for simulating ground rupture effects on pipelines to reproduce upper bound conditions of deformation in the field. The dual shake table capabilities at the University at Buffalo NEES Site are uniquely qualified for simulating seismic wave interaction with pipelines, especially for replicating the critical condition of closely spaced weak joints and defects. Guided by full-scale simulations, computer models will be developed, including 3-D models of the composite pipeline, liner, and soil system. The intellectual merit of this award involves combing state-of-the-art, full-scale experiments with advanced computational procedures to develop and validate the next generation analytical models. These models will support design and construction to apply in situ lining technologies for seismic risk reduction as well as improve design and construction practices associated with liner rehabilitation of critical underground infrastructure. The research will also explore the use of flexible electronics to embed micro-sensors, and thus create \"intelligence,\" in lining systems. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research can be appreciated by recognizing that for water and wastewater systems alone, there are more than 2.1 million km of pipelines throughout the US, with nearly half consisting of cast iron pipelines that are at least 50-100 years old.  There is a strong need to rehabilitate aging, underground lifelines, especially those located in areas with seismic risk and constructed of brittle materials such as cast iron. The proposed research has the capacity to reduce utility system costs through the extension of pipeline service life with intelligent liners that increase earthquake resistance, thus enhancing public safety and creating new markets for the restoration of underground assets. Broader impacts of the research include an integrated educational program aimed at underrepresented students (both women and minority) at CSULA and work force development in coordination with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). Two undergraduate courses at CSULA will be organized around the earthquake vulnerability and design of lifeline systems, with a major experimental component involving full-scale lined pipe tests at the CSULA instructional laboratory. At the same time, an annual short course will be given by project PIs at LADWP to address the seismic design of water supplies. Webinars will be presented through the NEES operations manager, NEEScomm, to convey both research findings and planning/design principles as developed through the annual short course, and videos of course lectures will be available at Cornell and UB NEES web sites. An integral part of the outreach activities involves industry collaboration and advice from practicing professionals to support technology transfer and disseminate research findings into engineering practice.\r\n\r\nData from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.  This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).",

Nearly half of those consist of cast-iron pipelines ranging from 50 to 100 years old. The work of NEES researchers at Cornell University, University at Buffalo (UB) and California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) have concentrated on the rehabilitation of these aging underground lifelines through the installation of fiber reinforced polymer liners, especially those in areas of high seismic hazard.\n     \n\n \n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe earthquake response and rehabilitation of critical lifelines can be enhanced substantially by in situ pipe lining technologies that involve the installation of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) linings inside existing, underground pipelines through trenchless construction procedures. In situ linings are not used currently for earthquake protection, and the absence of experimental validation and analytical procedures for evaluating the seismic response of pipelines retrofitted with FRP technology is a serious barrier to the adoption of in situ linings for improved earthquake performance.\n Analytical models developed at Cornell and UB for transient (seismic wave) and permanent ground deformation effects on underground lifelines have been successfully harnessed to full-scale tests with the dual shake table facility at UB and large-scale lifelines testing facility at Cornell to simulate the earthquake performance of pipelines retrofitted with FRP technology. The results show that the retrofitted pipelines are able to accommodate very high levels of transient ground motion and moderate levels of permanent ground deformation. Thus, the in situ lining technology is able to provide substantial benefits for seismic strengthening in addition to rehabilitation of aging and deteriorated underground infrastructure.\nThe research team developed a fundamental understanding &ndash; as well as analytical capabilities &ndash; for the in situ reinforcement of lifelines. From the results of combined full-scale experimental validation and computational simulation, the researchers are creating design and construction guidelines for such retrofits.\n The research increased substantially the options for seismic mitigation of underground lifelines by qualifying in situ lining technology as a viable method to retrofit existing underground infrastructure, and averting the serious traffic and business disruptions and associated costs of excavating and replacing underground infrastructure in urban environments. The research work also has been disseminated to the water industry through annual short courses, and has been a catalyst in the U.S. to use rehabilitated pipes.\n The research explored the use of flexible electronics for combining micro-sensor systems with in-situ linings to create intelligent pipelines as a result of in situ rehabilitation. The results of this work have the potential to transform underground utilities into real-time condition monitoring and data collection.\nEducation of the work force was pursued in this project by conducting two annual 2-day short courses, entitled \"Water Supply Seismic System Performance, Planning, and Asset Management\", at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). The short courses were held at the LADWP conference facility, with participation of scores of LADWP managers and engineers, local consulting engineering companies, and many minority (Hispanic) students from CSULA. Each short course was video-taped by LADWP and made available to NEE..."
