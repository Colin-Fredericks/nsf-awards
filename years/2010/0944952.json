 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the baseline requirements necessary for the development of an employee performance measurement platform that utilizes technology to accomplish a continuous service performance data flow used to motivate employees to higher performance levels through the use of quantitative reporting, and consistent, steady recognition/reward systems. Currently, business managers within the services industries have few reliable, quantitative methods for measuring and managing employee customer service performance. Research components for this project include: 1) Test the utilization of POS (Point of Sale) / PIN-pad technologies in a live retail environment to determine their capability in supporting this transaction level surveying process 2) Determine if consumer respondents will engage in this point of transaction survey process 3) Determine if the resultant data provides meaningful reporting that demonstrates the fluid nature of customer service and fills the knowledge gap regarding employee performance.  \r\n\r\nEmployee performance and nearly every other customer-facing element of business is rendered subjective without the timely input from the customer. With continuous and consistent data measurement available through the electronic delivery of survey questions / capture of responses real time at the transaction level, a quantitative employee performance system is established. With transaction level performance data combined with contextual data such as employee, time of day, etc. new dimensions of employee performance measurements will be derived. \r\n",
