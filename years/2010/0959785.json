 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds a set of plant growth chambers for Wilkes University.  The chambers can be set for different temperatures, humidity, photoperiods and CO2 levels, and will have a direct impact on the research of faculty and will also see extensive use in several courses. The chambers will support research in screening Arabidopsis mutants with DNA insertions in non-coding RNAs recently identified by high-throughput sequencing. The ability to screen for altered responses to temperature, photoperiod, CO2 or other factors in parallel rather than in series will greatly speed the research. Other studies will focus on both rare native and invasive plant species, as well as revegetation of abandoned minelands, so the ability to evaluate the effects of altered temperature and other environmental factors on these species will greatly enhance the studies. The ability to compare the growth of plants under a variety of conditions will also enhance several courses, including the second semester of introductory biology and upper-levels including plant physiology, plant form and function, and ecology. It will also enhance the opportunities for independent and senior research projects. The ability to conduct more sophisticated plant research in sub-disciplines ranging from molecular biology to physiology and ecology will improve the training of Wilkes students and enhance the appeal of plant biology to the Wilkes student body. Acquisition of this equipment will also enhance interest in plant biology at the local community college and strengthen the collaboration with this college to recruit minority students into the program by providing them with opportunities to participate in workshops and research at Wilkes. Finally, it will enhance interest in plant biology in local high schools, since Wilkes has outreach programs with local high schools, some of which provide opportunity for students to be directly involved in research projects at the University.  Data produced from these activities will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, and by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.",
