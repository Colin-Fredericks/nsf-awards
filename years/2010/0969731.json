 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel magnetic materials are important for many applications.  However, magnetism still has unresolved mysteries, especially in systems involving strong interactions and strong correlations between the particles.  One approach to study magnetic materials is to realize magnetic phenomena in the simplest possible systems which are well controlled and well characterized.  The simplest systems are ultracold atoms, which are very dilute gases (a million times less dilute than air).  At very low temperatures, these gases can behave like liquids, solids, metals, superconductors, or magnets.  The work at MIT studies quantum magnetism in three different systems:  Two component Bose and Fermi gases in optical lattices, and so-called itinerant ferromagnetism of delocalized fermions in free space or in optical lattices.  This work addresses important questions at the frontier of many-body physics and will have impact on future research in atomic physics, condensed matter physics and many-body theory.\r\n\r\nBroader impact. Research on quantum magnetism using ultracold atoms stimulates theoretical work on strongly interacting Bose and Fermi gases and will advance our understanding of macroscopic quantum systems and of magnetic materials.  A deeper understanding of magnetism and superfluidity may lead to new materials and novel devices in the future.  This work provides research training for several undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, and prepares them for successful careers in technology and science.  Former students and postdocs continue to find distinguished positions in the area of science and technology.  All the research will be performed on campus and will be fully integrated in teaching and education, through research opportunities for undergraduates, lab tours, and by being used in lectures as illustrations for basic concepts in physics.  Through his public lectures, Prof. Ketterle reaches out to more general audiences.  He regularly gives talks for high school students, e.g. at the annual RSI (Research Summer Institute) program at MIT, at the TOPS (Teaching opportunities in the physical sciences) program at MIT, and during visits to high schools.  An additional outreach activity initiated by Prof. Ketterle is the Virtual Journal of Atomic Quantum Fluids.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major goal in physics is the deep understanding of different forms of matter, and the prediction and design of new materials.  In our project, we use ultracold atoms for this purpose, and employ laser beam, radio frequency and microwave radiation to assemble atoms into interesting and novel forms of matter.\n\nMajor accomplishments during the grant period have been the generation of synthetic magnetic fields for neutral atoms.  Laser beams exert the same forces on neutral atoms as real magnetic fields on charged particles.  However, the synthetic magnetic fields realized in our experiment are hundred times stronger than those generated by the strongest magnets.  Therefore, we can study with such a quantum simulation what would happen to electrons and other charged particles in super strong magnetic fields.  For the first time, we realized a special form of matter, a Bose-Einstein condensate, in strong synthetic magnetic fields.\n\nAnother focal area of our research is the field of ultracold molecules.  Such molecules were assembled from ultracold atoms, and we have studied their properties.  Many ultracold atoms have similar collisions properties, called universal.  We found that the lithium dimer behaved differently, most likely due to its much lighter mass.\n\nMany predicted new forms of matter require cooling to even lower temperatures than the nanokelvin regime.  In a proof-of-principle demonstration we showed how picokelvin temperatures can be reached by slowly modifying the system during a so-called adiabatic process.  For the spin system, we obtained temperatures of 50 picokelvin, the lowest temperature ever recorded.\n\nFinally, we addressed an open question related to magnetism.  We realized what was regarded the simplest system for itinerant ferromagnetism, the kind of magnetism responsible for the ferromagnetic behavior of iron and nickel.  We could show that the so-called Stoner model does not lead to ferromagnetism by demonstrating the absence of magnetic domains.  The spin up and spin down atoms formed pairs instead of arranging themselves into magnetic domains.\n\nThe realization of new forms of ultracold matter will advance our understanding of materials and provide guiding principles for materials research.  Our research is fundamental in its immediate impact, but in the long run, it should lead to devices and advanced materials with yet unknown properties, and open new possibilities and applications.  Besides promoting the progress of science; our program educates students and postdocs and prepares them for a career in areas of advanced technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wolfgang Ketterle"
