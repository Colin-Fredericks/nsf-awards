The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1) provide a setting for feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research; and (3) support a new generation of researchers. The Doctoral Consortium organizers strive to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups and smaller schools and schools with less established programs in artificial intelligence. Students will give presentations and participate in discussion; there are one-on-one meeting with a faculty mentor. There will also be opportunities to discuss career issues in both academic and other career pathways. A report on the Consortium will be published in the AI Magazine.",
