 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Mathematics to study Crime (USSNSM) is an interdisciplinary REU program that brings together faculty from two schools (School of Social and Behavioral Sciences and School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics) and three programs (Criminal Justice, Forensic Science, and Computer Forensics) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This eight-week summer program combines the strengths of these distinctive yet interrelated programs into a synergistic relationship. Students will work with faculty in one of three research tracks: 1) Criminal Justice, 2) Forensic Science, or 3) Computer Forensics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This REU addresses emerging issues of crime and scientific criminal investigation by uniting a traditional Social Science discipline (Criminal Justice) with two STEM disciplines (Forensic Science and Computer and Information Science). The program provides a much-needed opportunity for undergraduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research on a pressing social problem. The overall objective of this proposal is to involve undergraduates in interdisciplinary research that will prepare them for a wide range of postgraduate programs in Criminal Justice, Criminology, Sociology, Law, Biology, Chemistry, Forensic Science, Computer Forensics, and Computer Security. This REU also seeks to broaden the research participation of underrepresented groups through targeted recruitment and mentoring. UAB is one of the most ethnically diverse universities in the Southeastern region of the United States and is surrounded by a large number of universities with similar levels of diversity, as well as many Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In addition to understanding and participating in research projects, students will also learn about the interdisciplinary nature of scientific inquiry, research ethics, post-graduate options, and professional and career development.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Numerous broad impacts will be realized for students involved in this interdisciplinary REU program. REU participants, faculty, and graduate student mentors will gain a greater awareness of, and appreciation for, the contributions of many disciplines to research challenges. The cohort based nature of the program will allow students to develop long-term collaborative relationships with faculty and students from multiple disciplines. The outcomes of this interdisciplinary program include: 1) State-of-the-art research experiences that motivate students to pursue graduate degrees in Social Science and STEM disciplines, 2) Broadened participation of underrepresented groups in research on crime, 3) Increased appreciation and understanding of how Social Science and STEM disciplines can converge to address pressing social problems, 4) A sense of community among REU students and faculty, 5) An understanding of ethical issues faced by researchers in Social Science and STEM disciplines, and 6) Enhanced collaboration between the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences and School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.",
