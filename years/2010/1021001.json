 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal plain wetlands occupy a critical landscape position at the intersection of terrestrial and aquatic and fresh and salt waters. Like all wetlands, coastal wetlands are disproportionately valuable in terms of services provided compared to the area they comprise including nutrient transformation, water purification, and flood control.  Humans have drained wetlands throughout much of the southeastern coastal plain for agriculture and forestry, thus diminishing their capacity to provide critical ecosystem services such as nutrient and carbon sequestration.  At the same time, fertilizer use and manure from intensive meat and poultry production have dramatically increased nutrient loading to coastal ecosystems.  Increased loading and decreased retention of nutrients has caused eutrophication of downstream freshwater and coastal ecosystems, with the associated degradation in water quality and decline in coastal fisheries.  Climate change may further exacerbate these trends: higher temperatures and increasingly sporadic precipitation may further diminish the spatial extent of perennially flooded wetlands and is already leading to seasonal salt water intrusion during drought.  Predicting the likely ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling of coastal plain freshwaters into a saltier and increasingly uncertain hydrologic future requires significant improvements to our current understanding of freshwater ecosystems.  This proposal focuses strategically on two aspects of this problem: first, incorporating sulfur (~from sea salt) dynamics into our understanding of how microbes alter carbon and nutrient cycling and second, utilizing simulation modeling to mesh dynamic hydrology together with microbial biogeochemistry.  Adaptive simulation modeling together with targeted empirical work will allow us to rapidly test and refine current models of wetland carbon and nutrient cycling and to formalize the emerging conceptual understanding of wetland biogeochemistry into a flexible, easily adjusted modeling framework.  \r\n\r\nThe focal field site is a formerly ditched and drained agricultural field in North Carolina's coastal plain that was restored to riverine wetland hydrology in 2007, becoming the largest privately owned mitigation bank in the southeast. The site has very little topographic relief (-1 to +1 m elevation); experiences significant salt water intrusion via surface water mixing during summer droughts; and has wind tide driven hydrology that generates large gradients in sulfur concentrations in both time and space.  The field site is representative of large areas of SE coastal plain agricultural landscapes that are being actively restored or abandoned.  The economic and ecological \"success\" of this project will be closely watched by regulators and practitioners throughout the region.  This research program will directly affect the potential for site owners to sell validated carbon and nutrient credits in emerging ecosystem service markets.  Resulting research findings (together with their economic implications) will influence future patterns of mitigation and conservation investment throughout the southeastern coastal plain and will provide critical information that will facilitate climate adaptation planning throughout the region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany natural processes that influence human wellbeing are tied to the cycling of elements in the environment.  Nitrogen and phosphorous cycling influence the productivity of agricultural lands.  Nitrogen and sulfur cycling are tied to pollution in the air we breathe and the water we drink.  Carbon cycling is a primary driver of climate change. \n\nElemental cycles are heavily influenced by the growth and metabolism of microbes, as mediated by both the chemical compounds that are available in soils, and the conditions under which microbial metabolism operates.  For instance, under some conditions, microbes might consume organic matter and produce carbon dioxide and ammonium while under other conditions, microbes might use carbon dioxide and ammonium to create organic matter.\n\nBecause compounds in nature (e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrate, sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, organic matter) typically contain more than one element, the elemental cycles of the planet are all interlinked.  In the past, scientists have focused on studying individual elemental cycles, but understanding the linkages among various cycles is becoming more and more important.\n\nAlthough simulation models are a powerful tool for understanding complex systems such as elemental cycles and the linkages among them, our ability to build simulating models of linked elemental cycles has lagged the need to understand such linked cycles.  A primary challenge associated with developing models of linked elemental cycles arises from the difficulty of anticipating the combinations of microbial metabolic processes, chemical compounds, and soil conditions that are possible, developing logic to describe how microbes will metabolize available compounds, and then creating a computer program that implements the logic.  Thus, ecosystem models that incorporate even a basic level of linkage between carbon and nitrogen cycling are considered to be relatively advanced models of elemental cycles.\n\nWith support from the National Science Foundation, we have developed a new approach to modeling linked elemental cycles.  Rather than trying to develop logic that prescribes how microbes will utilize different compound under different conditions, our modeling approach is based upon describing the constraints within with microbes operate.  Specifically, constraints imposed by stoichiometry (e.g., the ratios of elements contained within compounds) and thermodynamics (e.g., the amount of energy stored within different compounds) determines, in part, which compounds can be used to create microbial biomass and which compounds are useful for allowing microbes to meet their respiratory energy demands.\n\nOur model operates by assuming that competition among microbes will favor those that can use available compounds most efficiently.  Therefore, we describe the constraints imposed by thermodynamics and stoichiometry to the computer, tell the computer which compounds are available, and then ask the computer: \"How could microbial metabolism operate most efficiently with these available compounds -- without violating the imposed constraints?\"  Such questions fall in the realm of \"optimization problems,\" and many robust and efficient computer algorithms exist to answer such questions.  We use a linear programming algorithm developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to determine the most efficient use of available compounds by microbes within the constraints imposed by stoichiometry, thermodynamics, and conservation of mass.\n\nThe results from simulation models developed with this approach conform to our scientific understanding of individual elemental cycles, while having the added benefit of being able to track and quantify the concurrent cycling of any or all elements contained within the modeled compounds.  Thus our simulation approach provides a new tool for simulating and understanding the breath of potential linkages among elemental cycles.\n\nIn working with this new simulation approa..."
