 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis project, developing a software traceability instrument, enables research in diverse, much needed, software-related research areas such as formal methods, human computer factors, software visualization, and project management. The work supports a critical research agenda of the software engineering community and facilitates technology transfer of traceability solutions to business and industry. Traceability refers to the ability to capture the relationships between different artifacts of a software-intensive system development project, including code, requirements, design, specifications, external regulations, and software architectures.  Many software engineering activities involve tracing between interdependent artifacts, for example, finding software components that implement a given system requirement in order to assure that an as-built system meets its intended goals, or conversely, finding all the requirements that pertain to a code module to ensure that the system does not contain extraneous and potentially malicious features. The traceability instrument contains a library of reusable trace algorithms and utilities, a benchmarked repository of trace-related datasets, tasks, metrics, and experimental results, a plug-and-play environment for conducting trace-related experiments, and predefined experimental templates representing common types of empirical traceability experiments.  The instrument facilitates the application of traceability solutions across a broad range of software engineering activities including requirements analysis, architectural design, maintenance, reverse engineering, and IV&V (independent verification and validation) or V&V activities. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Despite the criticality of software traceability, organizations have struggled to implement successful and cost-effective traceability due to the complexity and error-proneness of the task. Despite a compelling research agenda, traceability research has been impeded by the lack of shared instruments.  The instrument will make state-of-the-art traceability results available to enable the next generation of customized traceability environments and will provide support for conducting empirical research. Results will be disseminated broadly through outreach endeavors by the Center of Excellence for Software Traceability. The project will provide multiple opportunities for participation by underrepresented minorities and undergraduate students, and will create three fulltime job positions. The long-term broader impacts of the project will be to improve software project productivity and to improve the reliability of software, as well as developing software engineering educational curriculum for training students and practitioners.",

Traceability serves an important role in demonstrating that a delivered software system satisfies its software design constraints and mitigates any identified hazards. The Center of Excellence for Software and Systems Traceability (CoEST) defines a trace link as a specified association between a pair of source and target artifacts such as between pairs of hazards, faults, design, code, and test cases.  While traceability is useful across numerous domains, it is required in safety critical domains. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through DO-178C specifies a very detailed set of traceability requirements including the need to provide \"traceability between source code and low-level requirements\" and to \"verify the absence of undocumented source code.\"\n \nDespite the importance of traceability, many organizations fail to establish and maintain adequate trace links, primarily because tracing can be costly and arduous to perform.  Furthermore, large and/or complex software systems can require hundreds of thousands of trace links. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that trace links can become quickly outdated as systems are maintained and evolved. These challenges create a compelling research agenda which has produced an active research community with researchers tackling a broad range of problems related to the automated creation, evolution, and use of trace links in rapidly changing project environments. \n \nTraceLab was designed to empower future traceability research through facilitating innovation and creativity, increasing collaboration between traceability researchers, decreasing the startup costs and effort of new traceability research projects, improving reproducibility of results so that new ideas can be built on prior findings, and fostering technology transfer.  As such, TraceLab lays the foundation for future innovations and advances in the field of traceability, accelerates and shapes future research directions, and significantly reduces the cost and effort that often discourages new researchers from entering the field.  Furthermore, TraceLab addresses the problem of lack of reproducibility of experiments, which is pervasive across almost every scientific discipline.  Researchers using TraceLab can release fully executable experiments and their associated components, which facilitate full reproducibility of results and serve as the building blocks for future research.  \nTraceLab is released  under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, version 3. Specific TraceLab features include: (1) a visual modeling and experimental environment for composing experimental workflows using drag-and-drop technologies, (2) a multi-threaded execution environment which supports concurrency,  (3) portability to Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms,  (4) an extensive component library which includes algorithms and utilities that are relevant to software traceability and maintenance research, (5) a runtime execution environment for executing experiments and reporting results, (6) features for packaging up components and entire experiments for public release, and (7) interfaces to other toolsets such as MatLab (mathematical package), R (statistics package), and Weka (data mining). \n    \n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                     \n\n /* Style Definitions */\n table.MsoNormalTable\n\t{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\";\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\n\tmso-style-noshow:y..."
