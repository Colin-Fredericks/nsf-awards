 "awd_abstract_narration": "What remains a mystery to this day is why strong interactions have not been observed to violate the CP symmetry. One solution, to what has become known as the \"Strong CP Problem,\" introduces an additional symmetry and scalar particles called Axions. This EAGER award will fund research to exploit recent theoretical developments in the search for Axions and Axion Like Particles (ALPs).  Specifically, this work will explore designs for an optical delay line that could enhance a Stern-Gerlach type beam splitting effect. The overall goal is to extend the experimentally charted region of Axion space (coupling versus mass) some four orders of magnitude beyond current limits. \r\n\r\nThis research is aimed at a future experiment that, unlike previous efforts, would be searching for a beam splitting. The laser photon could couple with solar and/or galactic ALPs. Solar ALPs are produced in the sun and, because they interact weakly, can make it through the Earth's atmosphere. In the experimental region, these ALPs would couple to the laser field. The ALP and photon field act as an effective particle/anti-particle pair which will be separated through an interaction with an external magnetic field gradient. This award will look at optical cavity geometries to ascertain the possibility of using an optical delay to enhance the detection of beam splitting. The work is limited to simulations that will be performed, using advanced optical software, to search for suitable cavity geometries. The final cavity design will be selected from several simulated possibilities. The optical software estimates effects of applied coatings, stresses due to mountings and energy loss due to imperfections in the mirror's surface. The software requires the detailed knowledge of surface manufacturing techniques, and so there will be discussions with a company that specializes in manufacturing mirrors for scientific use. \r\n\r\nAs Broader Impacts, if successful the research performed here could reshape the technology and methodology used for ALP search experiments. Furthermore, the research will be carried out, in part, at Florida A&M University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Thus the research will directly benefit the scientific infrastructure designed to develop underrepresented minorities.",
