 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The award supports the development of the solenoidal particle-tracking spectrometer needed for the first phase of the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).   There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons. Discovered in 1937, the muon (a more massive 'cousin' of the electron) is a subatomic particle whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a range of purposes. However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate muons. The key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).   This award provides for the development of RF hardware and controls which are necessary to the demonstration of ionization cooling of muon beams.  In addition, the award facilitates graduate student training, and K-12 teachers and students will be involved through QuarkNET.",
