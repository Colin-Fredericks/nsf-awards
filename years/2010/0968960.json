The proposed Center is a multi-university Center comprised of the Ohio State University (lead) and North Carolina State University (NCSU).  \r\n\r\nCAPPS was initiated in 1983 as an NSF IUCRC program, and since 2003 has been operating solely with industry member support. The major objectives of the Center include: enhancing the knowledge base in developing new and novel emerging food processing/packaging technologies; conducting research to ensure the safety of implementing non-thermal and novel processing technologies within the US; addressing industrially relevant food processing and packaging problems facing the industry; and, training students and other personnel to meet the future needs of the US food processing/packaging.\r\nAlthough the University of California at Davis is not actively seeking support as an official site, it will remain active within the Center contributing research expertise and facilities. \r\n\r\nCAPPS will create a program focus in food processing and packaging. With NSF and industry support, the Center anticipates that the collaborative efforts among faculty within the Center will result in advances well beyond what individual laboratories or a single institution could achieve. Participation by industry will require that fundamental advances in food processing and packaging be translated to in-house industry research or possess potential commercial applications. CAPPS will continue to retain company memberships, recruit new industry members and obtain participation from under-represented groups.",
