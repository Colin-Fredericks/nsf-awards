 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supercontinents arise on the Earth when the continents cluster together, typically on one side of the Earth, as a result of multiple tectonic collisions.  The past existence of supercontinents is of great interest to the tectonics scientific community, and society in general, for example for the tracing of mineral deposits.  The continents today are fragments of the Pangean supercontinent, which existed during the Mesozoic age of the dinosaurs.  Several lines of evidence suggest the existence of even earlier supercontinents, the subject of this study.  These researchers aim to reconstruct the arrangement of continental pieces between 2.7 and 2.1 billion years ago, to determine whether ancient supercontinent cycles occurred at that time.  The research will be carried out in all the major mountain ranges of Wyoming, over two summer field seasons of rock sample collection by the two principal investigators and their graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, the methods and data will be incorporated into scientific outreach programs aimed at ninth-grade inner-city students.  Finally, the results will be illustrated in a computer animation made available to the general public as an educational resource.  \r\n\r\nThe study focuses on Wyoming, one of the cratons of North America that currently is least well known in terms of its changing positions through the Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic interval.  The researchers will be examining drift histories, conjugate margins, and cratonic chronologies for purposes of supercontinental reconstruction.  In many regards, Wyoming is a central keystone in the arrangement of North American cratons during the Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic eras.  The research will entail two complementary methods:  geochronology using several well established and precise isotopic methods, and paleomagnetism of rock and mineral samples that contain magnetic domains that are particularly resistant to resetting.  The combination of these analyses provides a powerful tracking method for the analysis of supercontinent cycles.  These measurements of time and space will be applied to dike rocks from the ancient roots of now-eroded lava plains in Wyoming.  The dikes are ideal targets for the close integration of the two research methods, as indicated by preliminary data.  Such data have generated much excitement that refined apparent polar wander paths from this study may result in a re-evaluation of Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic supercontinental assembly.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe North American continent has not always been a single piece of the Earth\u00c6s crust.  Prior to 1700 million years ago, it assembled from about six large blocks, one of which is called the Wyoming Craton, encompassing most of Wyoming and the southern part of Montana.  This project sought to locate Wyoming Craton\u00c6s history of motions across the Earth\u00c6s surface, prior to its incorporation into North America.  Geological similarities of 2400-2200 million-year-old rocks in southern Wyoming and southern Ontario, Canada, have inspired previous researchers to suggest that those two areas were directly joined prior to the amalgamation of North America.  Other similarities of older rocks in Wyoming had alternatively suggested to other researchers, a connection with northwest Canada.  Our study measured the ages and magnetic directions from Wyoming rocks (in particular, basaltic dikes found mainly in the high Beartooth and Bighorn ranges), to document the timing and motion history of Wyoming prior to 1700 million years ago.  We found that Wyoming Craton probably originated next to Ontario, and migrated to its present position between 2100 and 1700 million years ago.  (Wisconsin and Michigan are composed of crust that accreted to southern Ontario after Wyoming Craton departed).  Our data suggest that Wyoming was the final major ancient crustal block to be added to North America.\n\nThe results from our study are contributing to a larger quest of reconstructing all the continental blocks in continuous animation, throughout the last two billion years, or about half of Earth history.  Aside from the general public scientific interest that this might inspire, our results also carry practical applications in terms of mineral deposit exploration:  many of the world\u00c6s metal deposits were formed about two billion years ago, so understanding global geography from that age will help find new deposits in currently under-explored regions of the world.  This project supported the work of a Yale graduate student who is currently seeking employment in academic research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Evans"
