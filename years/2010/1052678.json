 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This collaborative project focuses on the study of the durability of solid oxide cells with Dr. Jacob Bowen and others at Riso National Laboratory in Denmark; (this institution has recently merged with the Danish Technical University (DTU)).  Travel for four extended U.S. graduate student visits and two senior investigator visits to Denmark are anticipated over a three-year period.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:  This project will support activities that apply image processing and analysis to microstructure image data sets, address the durability of solid oxide fuel cells, help establish the standards for 3D reconstruction and data analysis methods, and examine the use of solid oxide cells for renewable fuel production. This project will allow graduate students to spend extended periods at Riso/DTU, which is one of the premiere labs in the world in the area of solid oxide cells that can be used as fuel cells or electrolyzers.  Students will gain broader experience in their field, make important contacts, and convey their exciting new results through presentations at Northwestern University.  The knowledge gained from these interactions will also positively impact the undergraduate students working on a closely-related NSF project.  It is anticipated that the stronger interaction between these two groups, already both at the forefront of 3D tomography and analysis, will advance this field and speed its impact on the basic science and technology of ceramic electrochemical devices.",
