Student research projects will include: spectral data processing, perceptual, ubiquitous, and mobile user interfaces, content based media retrieval, multi- approach integration of image processing, and inverse problems using scattering theories. While designed for undergraduate research, the projects are relevant to current problems in the imaging field and thus seek to contribute to its advancement in a real way.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
