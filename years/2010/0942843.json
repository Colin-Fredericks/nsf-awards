Calculus is foundational not only to mathematics, but to other STEM areas as well, so learning calculus is important for this new brand of STEM-focused elementary teachers. This Calculus for Elementary Majors serves the nation's need to educate elementary teachers who know STEM. Future elementary teachers also need a profound understanding of elementary mathematics and this project makes necessary and important connections between calculus and elementary school mathematics. To do this, educators in the mathematics department, mathematics education department, and elementary education department at NC State developed a set of materials that serve as the basis for this innovative calculus course and a textbook for elementary teachers. In the process of conducting this development, field testing of the materials and assessment of the learning of the preservice teachers determined the validity of this intriguing hypothesis.",
