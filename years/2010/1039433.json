 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding for the development of a high-precision noncontact vibration measurement system.  Fast and accurate noncontact full-field measurement of dynamical systems is important for research and development in many engineering fields. The PIs will develop a high-precision noncontact vibration measurement system using new high-speed high-resolution digital cameras and the principal investigators' novel noncontact measurement and image processing techniques. This system will have a measurement accuracy that is one order better than those of currently available camera-based motion analysis systems. The approach is to utilize commercial off-the-shelf hardware components of an existing system of an industry partner who has successfully developed camera-based motion analysis systems, and to develop and integrate auxiliary hardware and image processing software to provide advanced measurement capabilities. This camera-based measurement instrument has the potential to transform the way dynamic deformation measurements are performed. \r\n\r\nThe noncontact, high-precision, high-speed and full-field measurement capabilities of the proposed system will open up new possibilities for research on mechanical and civil structures, system dynamics, aerospace structures, animal locomotion, human motion analysis, computer graphics, and many other areas. In addition, this system will be a valuable educational tool both in the developmental phase, where two graduates and one undergraduate will actively participate, and in the operational phase, where the equipment will be used by undergraduate and graduate students to collect and analyze dynamics and mechanics of deformable physical systems for their research and design projects. Moreover, this instrumentation will be used to develop new methods to detect problems with on-earth and in-space structural systems, develop ways to mitigate effects on society from natural hazards, and detect potential threats to national security.",
