 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on fundamental fluid phenomena explored through a combination of mathematical hydrodynamic theory and experiment.  The majority of this theoretical and experimental research will take place in and around the new UNC Interdisciplinary fluids laboratory, which opened in June 2007.  This project will involve 2 mathematics faculty, 1 graduate student, and 1 undergraduate student to perform experimental and theoretical research designed to better understand mixing, entrainment, and flow properties of stratified and/or viscous systems. Research will include assessing the regularization of Stokes flow divergences through density stratifications, finite time enhanced diffusion with rigid boundary conditions, the hydrodynamics of spheres in the presence of time varying shear layers, and the analysis of singular non-self adjoint differential eigenvalue problems.  Applications of these techniques to the natural sciences will be explored.  \r\n\r\nThe environment in which we live and breathe is a complex coupled fluid system whose dynamics possess phenomena occurring on a vast range of space and time scales.  From the smallest cilia in the lung which provide a hydrodynamic defense mechanism against inhaled contaminants to the atmosphere, oceans, and our climate, we interact directly with our fluid environment.  The project seeks to provide both improved scientific understanding, and, along the way, new opportunities for research and educational experiences for undergraduate and graduate students of the natural sciences and will have an outreach to middle and high school students through tours and summer research internships.  In particular, this project is focused upon research in fundamental fluid dynamics with emphasis on improved understanding of the interaction between immersed bodies moving in stratified fluids in different environments such as in atmospheres and oceans and in biological systems.  Specific examples of such behavior include the settling of \"marine snow\" in the ocean which is responsible for sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as the formation of underwater trapped oil plumes such as those occurring in the Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill.",

These results include advances in turbulent buoyant jet theory, establishing the role of geometry in mixing, properties of dense core vortex rings sinking in stratification, the vertical transport of carbon in the ocean, internal waves in stratified fluids, and thin film, core-annular flows with application to human cough.\nThese results include the first theory and simulations showing the role which cross-sectional geometry plays in establishing broken up-stream/down stream symmetry in the evolution of passive scalars on short times. Specifically, we established that diffusing, passively transported species spreading in laminar rectangular duct flows can be delivered with either a front loaded distribution, or backloaded distribution by varying the aspect ratio of the cross-section on short timescales:  skinny ducts deliver front loaded distributions which arrive with a sharp front, and depart (as they continue to flow down the pipe) with a long tapering tail, while fat ducts do the opposite. We also established that this symmetry breaking does not occur in pipes of elliptical cross section on these early timescales.  This is potentially extremely useful information for micro-fluidic mixing and chemistry applications.  Surprisingly the critical aspect ratio which separates front-loaded from backloaded delivery is approximately 2-1.  \nFurther, we have established a complete theory predicting the depth at which underwater trapped oil plumes may form.  This was developed in the context of the prediction of turbulent mixing associated with turbulent buoyant jets which produced the first theory for a critical phenomena in which buoyant fluid rising through sharp background stratification can either be forever trapped, or escape depending critically on the distance the buoyant fluid travels before reaching the layer.  This theory additionally established under broad classes of ambient density profiles that the optimal mixing background density stratification is the two layer system.  \nThis work additionally documented experimentally and theoretically the surprising role which stratification plays in slowing the transport of carbon from the upper surface ocean to the lower bottom ocean.  This was done by working with real marine snow particulate, called marine snow, which was dropped in sharply stratified water columns.  As a control, we also used porous agarose gel particles which have similar properties to naturally occurring marine snow.  We established that the mechanisms for trapping and sinking are similar to those with turbulent buoyant jets in that the particulate gets coated in lightweight upper level fluid providing enough buoyancy to trap the particulate in the layer until it either sheds, or absorbs, enough ambient stratification agents (salt) for it to become heavy enough to to sink.  We demonstrated that these particulate trapping actually leads to an increased biological activity in the form of enhanced bacterial enzymatic rates.  So the trapping of carbon slows the ocean's ability to absorb carbon, while these biological hotspots re-convert the sinking carbon into dissolved carbon dioxide gas.  These mechanisms suggest a possible feedback loop in which may lead to a great weakening of the ocean carbon pump.  \nIn another thrust of this grant, the fundamental interplay of geometry and film flow instabilities has been investigated analytically, numerically and experimentally in a study of momentum exchange between liquid and gas phases in human trachea emulations. An analytical model developed as part of this study has proved remarkably accurate in predicting plug formation within tubes whose cylindrical walls were coated by a viscous flui..."
