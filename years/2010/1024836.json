 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how improved chemical information can increase the understanding of chemical health and safety and the effectiveness of decision making with regards to chemical management in research laboratories at universities. University research laboratories are places where many toxic chemicals not only threaten the health and safety of students and university staff, but also threaten the health and security of the surrounding neighborhoods. The risk is especially high for researchers who work in the laboratories and custodians who clean the facilities. Individuals in both groups may not be aware of the hazards presented by the chemicals in the lab; they may have incomplete knowledge of the risks. Simply providing the information (e.g. Material Safety Data Sheets) does not insure that the information is accurate, used, understood, or incorporated into decision making about chemical purchasing, handling or disposal. \r\n\r\nIn order to evaluate the quality of information sources, the project gives hypothetical questions about chemical exposures to two groups of test subjects: graduate students and workers. Then, the subjects search for the answers on several websites and rate their experiences using criteria for the effectiveness of the information. The results identify the benefits of enhanced chemical safety information for workers and students.\r\n \r\nThis research provides useful information for the occupational safety and health profession and work environment policy makers. Research labs like any workplace have several overlapping workplace cohorts--students, staff, managers, custodians, and environmental health and safety professionals. Improvements in chemical management practices can reduce procurement and use of toxic chemicals, reduce exposures to hazardous materials and reduce waste. They can also reduce environmental exposures and liability for universities.",
