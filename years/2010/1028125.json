 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on a previous UBM project (0531885) at Murray State University (MSU). To foster the development of professionals who understand the mathematics behind the biology and the biological implications of mathematical models, the Biology and Mathematics in Population Studies program (BioMaPS) II at MSU is providing a collaborative research environment for mathematics and biology undergraduates to investigate patterns in plants and animal populations. Under the mentorship of BioMaPS II faculty, 12 students over a three-year period are being equipped with skills to investigate such patterns and to develop accurate models of biomedical and ecological phenomena by engaging in transformative projects that analyze stability and controllability of population dynamics. Within this intensive year-long research experience, students attend BioMaPS meetings and national workshops with research mentors and nationally recognized experts. Collegiate and high school presentations give the BioMaPS students experience in explaining their research to non-specialists, while professional presentations at regional and national symposia help students formulate and articulate their discoveries to an expert audience.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: The BioMaPS II program advances discovery at the intersection of mathematics and biology and promotes the integration of research and teaching by engaging students and faculty as both researchers and teachers. The projects include modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes relating to biophysical traits of invasive plants, genetic diversity, climate change impacts in the tropics, and emerging infectious diseases. All projects focus on mathematical and biological questions that are of current and significant importance to the disciplines studied.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: Nine faculty investigators across two disciplines with different but complementary backgrounds collaborate on this project. These collaborators have mentored over 175 undergraduates, who have given over 140 research presentations with results in 40 publications, a record of success upon which the BioMaPS II program continues to build. The program is continuing to strengthen existing partnerships with Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Hancock Biological Station, and NIMBioS, as well as to foster the development of new partnerships.  The BioMaPS II program is making an interesting and challenging area of study available to students through curriculum reform - a Mathematical Biology minor is being designed to complement a successful Biomathematics area of concentration that was introduced in 2007. These BioMaPS II directives impact approximately 200 university calculus and biology students each academic year, and more than 100 local high school students and their teachers through outreach endeavors.  The program creates avenues for future collaborative courses across the STEM disciplines at Murray State University, with opportunities to extend the courses to state and national institutions.",
