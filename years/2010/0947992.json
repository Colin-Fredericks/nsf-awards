 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nTechnical: This project will fund and engage 9 minority graduate students (GK-12 Fellows) per year to build their science and teaching portfolios and develop leadership and teaching skills, ultimately preparing top scholars in environmental, geological, and biological sciences.  The Fellows will serve as role models and instructors in Early College High School (ECHS) classes in a predominantly Hispanic community. The ECHS is an innovative program that enables students to earn up to two years of college credit in addition to their high school diploma, and provides them with skills to increase their success in college. ECHS students will benefit from interacting with GK-12 Fellows in their classrooms, from teacher training to improve long-term capacities for interdisciplinary science , and from the development of lesson plans in ?Science for a Sustainable Future? focused on the arid southwest.  The proposed ?Scientists in Residence? program may serve as a scalable model for recruiting students into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. \r\n\r\nNon-Technical:  This proposal will actively recruit minority graduate students and will train them to be scientists, instructors, and leaders of the future.  With its growing Ph.D. programs, top faculty, and current demographic, UTEP is poised to lead the way for training minority Ph.D. future scientists and leaders, and will allow for the students to address specific challenges facing our border, desert populations, including limited water resources in a changing climate, the potential for alternative energy resources,  environmental health issues in a multi-national community, and  geological hazards facing the region.\r\n \r\n",

The GK-12 program at UTEP focused on working with Early College High Schools (ECHS) in the El Paso area, schools that target students that would not traditionally seek college degrees.  These students earn an Associates Degree plus a High School diploma upon graduation.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nOur program centered on the theme \"Science for a Sustainable Future\", with a particular focus on the arid southwest.  Specific challenges facing our border, desert populations were addressed: 1) limited water resources in a changing climate, 2) the potential for alternative energy resources; 3) a rapidly growing, diverse population and environmental health issues in a multi-national community; and 4) geological hazards facing the region.\n\nThe UTEP GK-12 Program had a series of activities based on the expected outcomes: 1) increase the capacity of GK-12 Fellows to be effective teachers, researchers and collaborators and to be competitive in the current job market; 2) enhance the ECHS students\u00c6 interest in pursuing undergraduate and, ultimately, graduate education in the environmental, geological, and other sciences; 3) demonstrably enhance the ECHS science learning environment through increased teacher efficacy and conceptual understanding by students. \n\nBroader Impacts\n We were successful in our approach. Over the lifetime of the grant, we funded 31 graduate students, 21 were female (68%), 10 male (32%), with 24 (78%) being of Hispanic origin (22) or African American (2).
