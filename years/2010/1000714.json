 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controlled delivery and release of amendments is an important concept for improving the science and engineering behind subsurface remediation.  Many current approaches to managing groundwater contamination rely on further advances in amendment delivery to initiate and sustain contaminant degradation or immobilization.  The PI?s research integrates laboratory experiments across multiple scales to better understand how engineers can control the placement and flux of remedial amendments within the contaminated subsurface environment.  Emphasis in this project is placed on the addition of alkalinity using oil-in-water emulsions.  Interest in harnessing coupled physical, chemical and biological processes for remediation and stewardship of contaminated sites often necessitates control of pH during treatment and, in some cases, long thereafter.  The central hypothesis of this research is that oil-in-water emulsions can be effective tools for modulating alkalinity release during remediation. This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms that control alkalinity release from oil-in-water emulsions designed to contain nano- or submicron-size carbonate and metal oxide particles.  Project objectives are: (i) assess mechanisms controlling particle stability within soybean oil; (ii) create and optimize emulsions containing alkalinity release particles within a dispersed soybean oil phase; (iii) elucidate the influence of soybean oil composition on the rate of alkalinity release; and (iv) analyze the ability of oil-in-water emulsions to deliver and release alkalinity for control of groundwater pH.  Model Eliciting Activities related to filtration theory and subsurface pH adjustment will be developed and deployed to motivate and engage learners in the geoenvironmental engineering thread of the civil engineering curriculum at Tufts.  The PI is committed working with Tufts Center for STEM Diversity - an umbrella organization that coordinates all STEM diversity efforts at Tufts University - to enhance diversity within research and learning environments. Project results will be disseminated to a broad spectrum of students and researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n At present, there is considerable interest within the geoenvironmental community to harness coupled physical, chemical and biological processes for remediation and stewardship of contaminated sites. Many of these processes require control of pH during treatment and, in some cases, long after. The central hypothesis of this research was that carefully designed oil-in-water emulsions can be effective tools for modulating alkalinity release during subsurface remediation. Emulsions have been employed to sequester contaminants and deliver remedial amendments, but controlling amendment release, both the extent and rate, remains highly empirical. This empiricism restricts our ability to realize the full potential of oil-in-water emulsions for controlling release of amendments within complex systems of porous media. The research project integrated experiments and modeling to elucidate the mechanisms controlling alkalinity release from oil-in water emulsions during subsurface remediation.\n\n Two types of alkalinity releasing particles were evaluated - magnesium oxide and calcium carbonate nanoparticles.  These types of particles were tested in two systems: (i) suspensions of particles within the aqueous phase; and (ii) oil-in-water emulsions.  In the latter, nanoparticles were encapsulated within the oil droplets of the emulsion using food-grade components (soybean oil and gum arabic).  Both magnesium oxide and calcium carbonate particles produce equilibrium pHs which are greater than 8.  Thus, kinetic control on the rate of dissolution is important when attempting to maintain circa neutral groundwater pH with these particles during remediation activities.  Encapsulation was shown to substantially decrease rates of alkalinity release, while not appreciably influencing the availability of particle mass for release.  \n\n Emulsion encapsulated particle systems were tested in flow through systems with Ottawa sand as a porous medium.  Emulsions were introduced to the porous medium for two to three pore volumes.  During the introduction of the emulsion, approximately 10-250% of the droplet mass was retained in the porous medium.  This retained fraction enabled subsequent, long-term treatment of acidic water.  In comparison with conventional approaches (e.g., use of a sodium hydroxide solution), the emulsions provided greater than ten times longer treatment at the mass loadings considered in this research.  Moreover, the alkalinity content of the emulsion can be readily increased to provide additional longevity of treatment.    \n\n An additional element of the project focused on evaluating the influence of a problem based learning (PBL) activity on learner motivation and self-efficacy.   PBL activities are similar to model eliciting activities (MEAs).  Both types of activities are most often centered on realistic scenarios where student learners working in teams engage in open-ended, self-directed learning with the instructor(s) functioning as facilitators or guides rather than leading the learning process.  The evaluation occurred over two years (i.e., two offerings) in a junior-level course.  The course selected for the PBL study emphasizes the principles of chemical, physical, and biological processes relevant to environmental engineering to enable rational design of unit operations within the engineered environment, as well as effective process assessment within the natural environment. The course traditionally follows a lecture-lab format, where labs on specific topics are conducted following the lectures on the content. Results suggest that learners in this course were highly motivated, making it difficult to discern the influence of the PBL activity on motivation.  Data suggest that the PBL improved learner self-efficacy related to the course content.  Self-efficacy relates to how individuals perceive their capability to perform specific tasks.  Overall the observational, anecdotal, and instrumental data in our study support more widesp..."
