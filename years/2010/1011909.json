 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program, co-funded with the Biomolecular Systems Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, supports work by Professor Gary A. Lorigan at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio) to probe the structure of membrane peptides using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop state-of-the-art EPR spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural properties of integral membrane peptides.  These techniques will be widely applicable to all peptide and protein systems.  The pulsed EPR technique of Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy will be used to measure short-range distances (< 8 Angstroms) between a spin label and deuterium nuclei on integral membrane peptides.  The ESEEM experiments may become very valuable biophysical tools for measuring distances on chemical and biological systems and will move the field forward by providing an efficient and easy way to distinguish between alpha-helical and beta-sheet structural segments.\r\n\r\nThe potential future benefits of these fundamental studies are to develop new techniques to obtain structural information on membrane proteins.  This methodology is useful for all proteins, including those associated with energy transfer, electron transport, photosynthesis, and the consumption and generation of greenhouse gases.",
