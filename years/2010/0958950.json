The magnetron sputtering system has three DC sources one of the sources was upgraded to a dual DC/RF source with an additional funding from the Army Research Laboratory through a Cooperative Research Agreement (CRA). The magnetron sputtering system has two ports available for future upgrades to install atomic-layer deposition and an e-beam sputtering systems useful for more advanced material synthesis. The three source guns and the two turbo pumps for the processing chamber and the load lock are water cooled by a stand-alone chiller. The processing chamber vacuum can reach up to a pressure of 10-8 Torr, 1 Torr is 1/760 of a standard atmosphere, and the load lock serves to exchange samples without breaking vacuum which is energy efficient and time saver. Fe thin films of thickness 50 nm were prepared on MgO (100) substrate at several temperatures capped with 5 nm Cu to avoid oxidation. These samples were studied using MOKE and other magnetic characterization tools. This study on nano-metric films revealed the dependence of magneto-crystalline anisotropy on deposition temperatures. This study is useful since nano-metric thin films, few atomic mono-layers thick, can exhibit an out-of-plane uniaxial surface anisotropy which is sufficient to overcome the demagnetizing field. This feature is very useful for magnetic recording since data can be recorded at higher densities in such magnetic media. Using the RF source a tri-layered thin film sandwiching a thin insulator layer about 5 nm thick between two conductors was synthesized, Fe/MgO/Fe on MgO (100), this system is known as magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with conductivity that is highly dependent on an externally applied magnetic field. MTJ has several technological applications including magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and magnetic sensor. These magnetic materials were also used to fill carbon nanotubes that are vertically grown and substrate supported using magnetron sputtering system. In conclusion the NSF-MRI-R2 funding has established state of the art infrastructure at Morgan State University to further study lower-dimensional solid state structures such as thin films and magnetic materials filled carbon nano-tubes materials with novel optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics governed by quantum mechanics. Understanding these structures is extremely important in order to probe size effects, surface and interface physics, to gain critical understanding of the physics of lower dimensional materials as well as to develop new technologies since the quest to develop new technologies is at the heart of material research. \nThis effort was accomplished to a considerable part by undergraduate research students supported by Morgan State University LSAMP grant over the summer. Students who worked on this project presented their work at the Science symposium at Morgan State University. The first students to work on this project were two Electrical Engineering majors who joined the work force after graduation. They presented their work on \"Fe thin films characterized by MOKE\" at the 2011 Science symposium at Morgan State University and one of the two students used this work for his senior project. The following year the student who joined my research group was a Physics major who is now a graduate student at West Virginia University. He presented his work on \"The Effec..."
