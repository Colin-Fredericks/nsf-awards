 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria and archaea account for half the biomass on Earth and drive major biogeochemical cycles, due to their ability to catalyze a broad spectrum of chemical reactions. They form the basis of various ecosystems, yet our understanding of the functioning of the microbial communities in many of these environments is still limited.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true for deep ocean sediments, which harbor a significant portion of the microbial biosphere existing under elevated hydrostatic pressure (up to 110 MPa; 1086 atm) and low temperatures. This prevents many, if not most microorganisms from these environments from being cultured in the laboratory, suggesting that we have only scratched the surface of the metabolic potential and the extent of physiological diversity of the microbial communities inhabiting these environments. From a biogeochemical standpoint, hydrostatic pressure can also dramatically influence chemical gradients within microbial ecosystems, in particular in gas- and gas-hydrate bearing deep-sea sediments. Preservation of sediment samples from these environments is a particular challenge in that the time between sampling and retrieval can be hours and changes in pressure, temperature can result in substantial out-gassing that destroys the structural integrity of the retrieved sediment sample as well as changes the composition and activity of the contained microbial communities. The Deep Ocean Benthic Sampler (DOBS) possesses a capability that is unique to the fields of deep-sea microbial ecology and biogeochemistry, the ability to obtain a contamination-free core and preserve in situ conditions of pressure and temperature upon retrieval to the ship. \r\n\r\nThe PI?s propose to develop Deep Ocean Benthic Sampler (DOBS) into a routine instrument that can be used by the oceanographic community to obtain undisturbed sediment cores maintained under in situ conditions for biogeochemical and microbiological analyses.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:     \r\n\r\nThis is a novel technology that is of interest for a broad range of researchers from several fields of science. The knowledge gain will not remain in a distinct community of scientists but will be of interest for a wide variety of scientists as well as or the public. Given that the deep sea is the largest ecosystem on earth, our knowledge about deep sea habitats is very limited at present. The authors take good care of educational programs for undergraduate and graduate students including females and minorities. Ample public outreach of the exciting science will be achieved.",
