 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis project involves the renovation of sections of Boelter Hall, part of UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science.  The building houses the departments of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Computer Science. The unifying theme of the space to be renovated is its use for \"sustainability research.\"  Four research \"collaboratories\" will be created and core mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure will be renovated to support these.  The collaboratories are: a Structural Sustainability Collaboratory, a Bio-Sustainability Collaboratory, an Energy and Water Sustainability Collaboratory, and a Sustainable Enviro-Bio-Nano-Technology Collaboratory.  \r\n\r\nThe renovated facility will be used for research in technologies for renewable and alternative energy production and storage, and environmental engineering.   Some of the research goals include: the development of the biosynthesis of pharmaceuticals to replace current processes involving organic solvents and to convert renewable resources into pharmaceuticals; a study of the effect of biofuel combustion products on mammalian cells; the discovery, development and optimization of new methods for designing metabolic pathways, new enzymes for biosensors, and new biodegradable polymers; understanding microbial processes at the sub-cellular level; the biotransformation of pollutants, nanoparticles, and pathogens to solve hazardous waste problems and improve public health;  and understanding how site-specific physiological and hydrogeochemical conditions and engineered manipulations affect biodegradation activities, microbial community structures, and the fate and transport of pollutants.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing infrastructure for research, the renovated facility will be used by undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers for research training.  The outcomes of some of the research activities may translate into technologies that industry can commercialize and that society can use to provide new energy streams, enhance environmental stewardship, and mitigate the adverse consequences of environmental change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project is to renovate existing research space within Boelter Hall (BH) to support the existing and planned research in sustainability that demand modern experimental facilities.  The renovated research facility will be transformed into four major collaboratories and the entire renovated space will also become a collaboratory where the energy consumption can be monitored with fine granularity and the information can be gathered and shared by the Facilities Management, the school, the faculty, and all the end users.  The proposed renovation of BH go hand-in-hand with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as the project will stimulate economic recovery, impact the research/training in HSSEAS and spur employment growth, and contribute to the nation\u00c6s long-term gross domestic product via technological advancement with new manufacturing and technology transfer opportunities.  \n\n \n \n\n \nThe project began on August 2, 2010 with the kick-off meeting and concluded on May 5, 2014 with the receipt of the certificate of occupancy.  This project transformed aged research space into five state-of-the-art research collaboratories that include: \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\nSustainable Infrastructural Collaboratory (1st and 2nd Fl Boelter Hall) \n\n\nEmbedded Networked Sensing and Energy Monitoring Collaboratory (3rd Fl Boelter Hall) \n\n\nSustainable Water and Energy Research Collaboratory (5th Fl Boelter Hall) \n\n\nSustainable Enviro-Bio-Nano-Technology Collaboratory (6th Fl Boelter Hall)  \n\n\nBio-Sustainability Collaboratory (7th Fl Boelter Hall)\n \nThe renovated research collaboratories have been used by 21 PIs, 10 research staff, 26 postdoctoral researchers, 96 graduate students, 70+ undergraduate students and many high school students to conduct their research.  The renovated server room has provided enhanced research support to over 30 faculty and 200 graduate students.   The research output during the construction time period to the completion of the construction includes 37 published conference proceeding and papers and 3 software.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \nAll ARRA reports have been submitted on time, continuing the ~100% on-time submission for the ARRA institutional reporting requirements, since the program's inception.  All section 1606 semi-annual report has also been submitted on time.  \n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane P Chang"
