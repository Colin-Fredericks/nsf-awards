  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder this award, the PI (and coauthors) contributed to a great increase in our understaning of certain discrete diffusion processes, known under the name of the Abelian Sandpile.\n\nThese are processes based on simple local rules which produce striking complexity.  Previously, the emergence of complexity from these simple local rules was completely mysterious.\n\nWe now know how the local rules govening the Abelian Sandpile give rise to configurations whose large-scale structures are determined by certain Partial Differential Equations.  In particular, we are able to characterize fractal patterns produced by the process.\n\nThis work involved connections to several disparate areas of mathematics, including circle packings, discrete tilings of the plane, and superharmonic functions.  As a result, we have learned new things about these other areas as well.  In particular, the new analysis of the Abelian Sandpile leads to a construction of infinitely many different discrete regular tilings of the plane with the peculiar properties that 1) the tiles in the tiling are 90-degree symmetric and 2) each tile in the tiling touches six other tiles.  (The only \"easy\" examples of such tilings involve squares; the Sandpile analysis produces examples with striking complexity.)\n\nIn the attached figure, one sees the kind of patterns produced by the Abelian Sandpile process.  This figure is the result of one million mathematical \"grains of sand\" being dropped at the origin of the integer lattice.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wesley Pegden"
