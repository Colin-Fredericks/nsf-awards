 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the mechanisms and pathways of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) export from the South Atlantic to Indian Ocean. Two eddy-resolving ocean general circulation models will be analyzed to determine the quantity and characteristics of deep flow eddies in the NADW and the possible roles they may play in the inter-basin exchange. The project will also address interannual changes in NADW transport and its relationship to the subtropical front, if any. The results will be examined in relation to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).\r\n\r\nThe research bears on the AMOC and global thermohaline circulation which are crucial links in the global climate system. Improved understanding of the deep circulation links between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans should translate to improved certainty in climate modeling and prediction.",
