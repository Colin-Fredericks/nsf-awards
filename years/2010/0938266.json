 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF/CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences--Nonlinear Water Waves with Applications to Wave?Current Interactions and Tsunamis--May 17-21, 2010\r\n\r\nProfessor Adrian Constantin, Chair of Partial Differential Equations, University of Vienna, Austria, has agreed to serve as the Principal Lecturer of the conference and to deliver ten lectures on the proposed topic. The objective of the lectures is to give a self-contained and comprehensive exposition on the new and modern developments in the subject of nonlinear water waves with a broad spectrum of nonlinear problems. The general area of the conference's endeavor is of great scientific interest and has seen an explosive expansion of research activity in the last few years, both in modern mathematical theory and in diverse applications. The research focus includes three general aspects encountered in the theory of nonlinear water waves: (i) the effects of vorticity on the surface water waves, (ii) the particle motion within water waves and (iii) wave breaking. These aspects will then be applied to an in-depth study of destructive tsunamis.\r\n\r\nThe conference will stimulate interest in research, teaching and learning of graduate students and faculty of mathematics, science and engineering at The University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) and other institutions. This conference will ultimately prove useful for research and development of more effective techniques and strategies that lead to better tsunami forecasting, warning and protective systems that minimize catastrophic damage,loss of human lives and economic resources.  The conference will attract junior researchers, graduate and postdoctoral students including women, and individuals from underrepresented groups, most notably Hispanic researchers from South Texas.",
