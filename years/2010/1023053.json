 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes could be especially large in the Arctic, which is projected to have some of the greatest anthropogenic warming.  Consistency of physical causes of extreme temperature and precipitation in observations and in simulations of past and future scenarios can indicate the robustness of projected changes. Consistent simulations of extremes by several models can provide much greater sampling of extreme events, leading to more confident assessment of the changing risk of extreme events.  The PI's will investigate possible changes in extreme temperature and precipitation events in the Arctic using observational records and output from the CORDEX (regional) and CMIP5 (global) climate modeling programs.  The project aims to detect, attribute, and understand changes in extreme temperature or precipitation through an analytical framework that focuses on both the extreme temperature or precipitation events and the physical processes which support them.  The PI's will assess observed and simulated changes in extreme precipitation processes using a pattern-recognition tool, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), that allows construction of a coherent, multivariate view of collections of extreme events.  The methods developed will also have application to studies of extremes in other regions of the planet, extending capacity for assessing changes in extremes and their underlying physical causes.  The project will train a new generation of scientists equipped to perform ensemble analysis of the changes in extremes and the uncertainties in their projection.",

Research activities at the University of Washington have continued to improve the land surface representation within the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), which in turn will benefit the simulation of extreme events in the Arctic. This work has mostly been funded by DOE, but has also benefited from our participation in this NSF funded project.\n\n2.

This comparison has focused on differences in land surface forcings and model outputs such as snow cover extent and snow water equivalent. This work has recently been extended to include streamflow and satellite derived snow covered area.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFindings:\n\n\nComparison of the offline datasets and coupled simulations focused on differences in land surface forcings (precipitation in particular) and model outputs such as snow cover extent, snow water equivalent, and streamflow. Comparisons of summer precipitation and temperature between the observation-based dataset from Sheffield et al. [2006] and RASM simulations are shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe coupled simulations capture the overall seasonality and spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation. However, biases in RASM simulated precipitation and temperature are non-uniformly distributed in space and between seasons.\n\nRASM continues to produce larger absolute biases in precipitation during the summer. Notably, RASM produces higher precipitation over western North America during fall and lower preciptation over notheastern Russia in the summer.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSpring and summer warm biases are present throughout the highest latitudes in RASM whereas cold biases are found in the fall and winter months. This amplified seasonal pattern is a topic for further research.\n\nEven at the current resolution (~50km), the coupled simulations already resolve geographic features that remain unresolved in the Sheffield et al. [2006] data set. The latter is based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis combined with gauge observations. For example, because of the sparsity of gauge observations and the relatively coarse resolution of the original reanalysis data, the Sheffield data set does not resolve the Greenland ice cap well. In addition, some of the mountains in central Eurasia (and the associated precipitation) are much beter resolved in the RASM results. Furthermore, recent model runs suggest that RASM has seen large improvements in high-elevation temperature and precipitation.\n\nComparisons of simulated and observed streamflow serve as an aggregate measure model performance. In fact, streamflow observations are one of the few sources of observed insitu data that can be used to evaluate distributed model performance. RASM simulated streamflow generally peaks about a month earlier than observed records. This bias in streamflow timing indi..."
