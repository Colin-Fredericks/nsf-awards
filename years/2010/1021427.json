 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schistosomes are blood fluke parasites that are significant pathogens of humans as well as domestic and wild vertebrate hosts. The schistosomes that occur in birds represent over 65% of known schistosome species diversity, yet they remain understudied. Bird schistosomes are also responsible for swimmer's itch in humans. In this project, schistosome diversity will be studied by targeted collecting of under sampled and high diversity areas. Identifications will be done using modern approaches to morphological and genetic characterization. The goal is to develop an evolutionary tree of schistosome species, describe the many new species discovered, and produce a monographic treatment for schistosomes. In addition, the resulting evolutionary tree will be used to study the evolution of traits within this clade, with broad implications for evolution within the family Schistosomatidae. This research will greatly increase our understanding of a globally distributed group of parasites and provide the tools necessary for species identification.\r\n\r\nThe project involves faculty from two EPSCoR states and fosters broad international collaboration in Argentina, France, Kenya, and China. The study will improve and build on a natural history museum collection of parasites that is globally accessible. Finally undergraduates and graduate students will be involved with and trained in all aspects of the project. Information generated by this project will be made available to scientists and the medical community, with outreach through K-12 education, and to the general public.",
