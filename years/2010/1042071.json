Nanotechnology modules will be added to a minimum of eight courses, exposing every student in the Temple University College of Engineering to nanotechnolgy.  A course entitled \"Nanotechnology: The Path to a Sustainable Urban Environment\" will also become the College's first course dedicated to nanotechnology.  Students will gain hands-on experience through research internships, Senior Design Projects and five laboratory teaching modules in the areas of water purification, transportation and renewable energy.",
