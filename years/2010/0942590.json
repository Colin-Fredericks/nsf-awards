 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a new unit operations laboratory with an emphasis on bioenergy for use in the undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum at the University of Washington.  This is being accomplished by developing laboratory facilities and experimental modules based on the complete cycle of bio-butanol production.  The laboratory modules being developed address topics in fermentation, separation for water recycling, solvent purification, control of emissions, and heat exchange.  The laboratory is also the central focus of a new course in bio-fuel production.  The laboratory and the course are utilizing modern pedagogies including team based learning and project based learning.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an experienced independent evaluator.  The evaluation plan includes a comparison between a traditional chemical engineering course taught at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) and the new course at the University of Washington on student learning.  The results of this study are informing how the laboratory can be best integrated into the curriculum at UPRM and be used with students from underrepresented groups.  The projects results are being disseminated through conferences and journal publications and the NSF sponsored National STEM Distributed Learning education resource database.",
