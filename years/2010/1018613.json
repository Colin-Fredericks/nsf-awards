 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to building a large multilingual semantic network\r\nthrough the application of novel techniques for semantic analysis\r\nspecifically targeted at the Wikipedia corpus. The driving hypothesis of\r\nthe project is that the structure of Wikipedia can be effectively used to\r\ncreate a highly structured graph of world knowledge in which nodes\r\ncorrespond to entities and concepts described in Wikipedia, while edges\r\ncapture ontological relations such as hypernymy and meronymy. Special\r\nemphasis is given to exploiting the multilingual information available in\r\nWikipedia in order to improve the performance of each semantic analysis\r\ntool. Significant research effort is therefore aimed at developing tools\r\nfor word sense disambiguation, reference resolution and the extraction of\r\nontological relations that use multilingual reinforcement and the\r\nconsistent structure and focused content of Wikipedia to solve these tasks\r\naccurately. An additional research challenge is the effective integration\r\nof inherently noisy evidence from multiple Wikipedia articles in order to\r\nincrease the reliability of the overall knowledge encoded in the global\r\nWikipedia graph. Computing probabilistic confidence values for every piece\r\nof structural information added to the network is an important step in\r\nthis integration, and it is also meant to provide increased utility for\r\ndownstream applications. The proposed highly structured semantic network\r\ncomplements existing semantic resources and is expected to have a broad\r\nimpact on a wide range of natural language processing applications in need\r\nof large scale world knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please see the project website:\r\nhttp://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Mu.Se.Net",
