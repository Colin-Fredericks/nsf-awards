Each laptop and smartphone is capable not only of recording and transmitting video and audio in real time, but also of advanced analytics on the data (e.g. speech recognition, speaker identification, face detection, etc.). Yet this rich resource goes largely unexploited mostly due to lack of good training data for machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe first step in exploiting this resource is to collect a corpus of audio, video, and annotations of \"natural\" meetings using the participants' own laptops and cellphones, allowing both analysis of the meetings and training of machine learning algorithms. This one year planning project involves design of the corpus, including collection protocols, signals, formats, and annotations, collection of a small pilot corpus, and ongoing interaction with the community through mailing lists, forums, wikis, and a workshop hosted at ICSI in Berkeley, California. The annotations include the words spoken, events such as laughter, a telephone ringing, or a new participant entering the room, who is speaking, who appears on which camera, head and hand gestures, the participants' focus of attention, and summaries and topics.\r\n\r\nSuccessful planning for the collection of a significant number natural meetings from a variety of settings using the participants' own laptops and cellphones allows for a new generation of analytic tools for meetings including browsing, search, collaboration tools, and teleremote aids.",
