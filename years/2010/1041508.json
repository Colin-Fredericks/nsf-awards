The objective of this application is to test a nonlinear derating method that can predict the thermal effects of HIFU beams at high powers. The central hypothesis of this research is that temperature rise within the focal volume in tissues can be estimated by performing measurements in water and using a nonlinear derating method to quantify bioeffects in tissues. They plan to test the hypothesis and accomplish the objective by pursuing the two specific aims: 1) To derive algorithms for assessing the amplitudes of pressure modes in tissue, given the amplitudes in water. The working hypothesis is that a derating algorithm for converting pressure mode amplitudes from water to amplitudes in tissue will be accurate and that, when inserted into the expression for temperature modes, will enable assessment of temperature rise in a tissue phantom; and 2) To evaluate the derating approach with inverse heat-transfer method in tissue phantoms using thermocouples. The working hypothesis is that measurements in tissue phantoms, combined with inverse method, can validate the derating algorithm. The expected outcome of this study is a unique method for establishing the thermal efficacy and safety of the devices that is accurate, low-cost, and applicable at clinically relevant powers. The method is expected to have an important positive impact by providing a tool that will expedite the preclinical testing of new HIFU systems, benefitting both the ultrasound device industry and FDA reviewers.",
