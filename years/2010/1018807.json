 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network-data-plane-disrupting bugs can cause the disruption of\r\ncritical network applications. Unfortunately, today, there exists no\r\ncomprehensive solution for detecting data-plane-disrupting\r\nbugs. Consequently, the network operator has few useful leads for\r\ninvestigating bug-triggered problems. To bridge this gap, this project\r\ndevelops novel measurement-based solutions for automatic bug detection\r\nthat are accurate and scalable. The results from this project will\r\nsignificantly improve the reliability of current and future generation\r\nnetworks. The expected results include network measurement techniques,\r\ndata analysis methods, network-wide monitoring strategies, data\r\nstructures and algorithms for high performance bug detection, and bug\r\nlocalization techniques. These solutions will (1) save IT personnel\r\nresources because network operators no longer need to troubleshoot an\r\nentire complex network but instead can focus on finding the best\r\nsolution for a detected bug; (2) reduce negative impact of bugs\r\nbecause the operator can immediately take proper defensive actions;\r\n(3) improve assurance after software or hardware updates since\r\nincorrect data plane behaviors resulting from updates could be\r\nautomatically caught; (4) improve feedback to vendors since vendors\r\ncan receive valuable information correlating detected bugs to\r\nconfigurations, updates, configuration changes, etc., which helps\r\nvendors diagnose the problem's root cause and develop solutions. The\r\nresults from this project will be broadly disseminated through\r\nscientific workshops, conferences and journals, as well as through a\r\nproject web site hosted at Rice University. Software and tools that\r\nare produced by this project will be released to the public under open\r\nsource licenses.",
