 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sketching plays an important role in creative design. Early attempts at computer-aided sketching overlay a sketching interface on a CAD approach for 3D modeling. This approach has been successful in quickly communicating designs that have already been fully envisioned, but is problematic in early conceptual design. Fundamental in CAD is the requirement that there is always an underlying consistent 3D solid representation. Requiring a consistent 3D model is an impediment to early conceptual design. Geometric forms must be either constrained or generated automatically without the designer's input. In the early conceptual phase the designer needs the freedom to experiment with incomplete and possibly inconsistent views and details. Early work has shown that 3D design and analysis can be performed using only strokes attached to 2D planes placed in 3D space. This research extends the free-form paradigm by experimenting with additional sketch primitives and interactions. The base 3D stroke system will be used as a starting point. Techniques for selecting and displaying additional elements, such as images, 3D fragments and 2.5D surface representations will be added. The intellectual merit of the project is the change in the nature of CAD systems that better support conceptual design by incorporating sketches and concepts that can be placed on a 3D model without requiring that the model be made consistent, until the designer is ready to enforce consistency. The broader impact of the project is the development of sketching and CAD tools that are relevant to early concept and creative designers.",
