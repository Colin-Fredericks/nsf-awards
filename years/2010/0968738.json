The STEM content of this project includes oceanography, marine biology, and ecology.  The project team will develop a multimedia, interactive kiosk exhibit that builds on the existing Portal to the Public project at PSC. Kelley's graduate students are actively involved in the exhibit and outreach components. \r\n\r\nThe target audience for \"Life in Extreme Environments\" is the approximately 800,000 U.S. and international visitors to PSC, including a significant number of urban, underserved minorities. This CRPA project will become a component of the existing Portal to the Public exhibit. This exhibit kiosk will subsequently be made available to other scientists to promote research and related topics in their respective disciplines. The exhibit will be fabricated and evaluated by PSC staff.",

This exhibit, a collaborative effort between the University of Washington and the Pacific Science Center, included an 11-foot across video wall, which can be triggered for key topics, showing stunning imagery of hydrothermal black smokers, vent animal communities, and personnel impressions of sea-going work.&nbsp; The other four walls are focused on key questions about how hydrothermal vents work, life in extreme environments, UW scientists who work in these environments, and the technologies used to explore submarine volcanoes and the deep-sea. In total, the portal included stunning still images that showcased &nbsp;black smoker chimneys and vibrant animal communities at hydrothermal vents, an ~4 foot tall black smoker chimney, preserved tube worm casings, and glassy lava from the Juan de Fuca Ridge as well as an in situ microbial incubator that had been deployed within the walls of an active chimney to examine the upper temperature limits of life on Earth.&nbsp; The exhibit also included is a SeaPerch mini robotic vehicle with text that guided visitors to the outside pools where they could operate the mini ROV&rsquo;s. Squished sytrofoam heads and cups emphasized the impact of pressure at seafloor conditions and the adaptive capabilities of animals that thrive in the oasis&rsquo;s of vent systems.
