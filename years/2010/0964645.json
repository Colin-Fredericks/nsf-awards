 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wide use of wireless data services leads to sensitive and confidential information delivered over wireless links. With e-crimes resulting from such information being compromised to unauthorized parties at an all time high, the ?all wireless? vision can truly materialize only if the security of wireless information transfer can be guaranteed. Conventional approaches to information security are designed for wired networks with assumptions that lead to a disassociation from the physical medium in which communication takes place, and provide guarantees against adversaries that are computationally limited. This project provides a new approach for wireless networks to deliver provable and unconditional security. \r\n\r\nThis research designs wireless networks with a secure foundation guaranteeing reliable and secure delivery of information.  In doing so, the investigators account for untapped and rich resources provided by wireless systems naturally, including sources with correlated observations or application content, channels that provide spatial and temporal diversity, network nodes that are helpers or relays providing interaction, and broadcast and bi-directional nature of the medium enabling communication with feedback. The project calls for a network design paradigm that has security in its foundation and provides enlightened system design principles and protocols that are optimized to jointly exploit these resources. Some examples of this, which form the intellectual backbone of this project, include the optimal use of correlated sources and broadcast channels, the role of multinode interaction, the opportunistic use of potentially untrusted relay nodes, the creative use of feedback channels, in order to render intelligent and computationally unlimited (passive and active) adversaries ineffective. An extended goal is to integrate the resulting design principles for unconditional security with cryptographic approaches towards exploiting synergies between the two.",
