 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbiotic bacteria have played a large role in insect diversification.  Studies on endosymbionts, specialized bacteria living inside insect tissues and organs, have provided insight into novel ecological adaptations, the origins of plant feeding, and genome evolution.  This project will investigate the role of two endosymbionts in the diversification of the native Hawaiian leafhoppers (Cicadellidae: Nesophrosyne).  This group is an excellent model system because of the known geologic history of Hawaii, the strict use of particular host plants by these insects, and the restriction of certain species of Nesophrosyne to individual islands.  This unique temporal and ecological framework can be used to test hypotheses of insect-endosymbiont coevolution and adaptation to local environments. \r\n\r\nThis work involves students at multiple educational levels, from elementary and secondary schools to undergraduate and graduate programs.  Ongoing work with the NSF GK-12 program (5th and 7th grade) uses project resources to enrich science education of public school students.  This project also trains undergraduate students in applied research techniques.  Work on the Nesophrosyne-endosymbiont system will provide the groundwork for examining the role of these associations in the evolution and diversification of plant-feeding insects.  Taxonomic work on native leafhoppers will provide conservation resource managers and land use planners with more accurate information of the Hawaiian biota.",
