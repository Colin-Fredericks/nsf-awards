 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do autocratic governments hold rigged elections that carry little or no credibility? How do such elections affect political stability and the survival of autocratic leaders? Although scholarly attention to autocratic elections has been steadily increasing, the existing literature does not provide sufficient theoretical leverage to explain why such elections are held nor to account for variations among them. The central theoretical contention of the proposed research project is that autocratic elections are held to shape beliefs about regime support and thereby reduce the likelihood of opposition revolt. In our theory, we identify the conditions under which autocrats are willing to call fraudulent elections and derive a number of hypotheses regarding variations in the competitiveness of elections and likelihood of post-election protest. This research is designed to test these predictions with data generated in a controlled laboratory experiment with human subjects, statistical analysis of a cross-national dataset, and in-depth analysis of regional executive elections in Russia during the 1995-2001 period.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to our understanding of the widespread phenomenon of unfree and unfair elections. First, the research contributes to the still nascent theoretical literature on autocratic elections by showing how such elections may affect public beliefs about the legitimacy of autocratic regimes and prolong (or shorten) their survival. Second, the research constitutes, to our knowledge, the first attempt to conduct experimental research on the informational effects of rigged elections. This research makes it possible to place further theorizing about autocratic regimes on firmer micro-foundations. Third, the research advances our understanding of democratization by showing how autocrats may insulate themselves from revolutionary pressures by instituting rigged elections instead of resorting to fully democratic rule. Fourth, the dataset on fairness of executive elections in Russia's regions will be instrumental for future scholarship on this topic.\r\n\r\nElections are frequently seen as a panacea for problems of political instability, bad governance, and lack of accountability in the developing world. The fact that U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) alone spends more than $700 million a year to promote democracy and elections speaks to the positive impact policy-makers expect of elections. The research helps to identify to what extent this view is warranted. At the theoretical level, the proposed research suggests a mechanism whereby rigged elections may in fact prolong the survival of badly governed and unaccountable autocratic governments. In addition, the research better identifies the conditions under which post-election conflicts and protests are likely to occur. Learning how rigged elections affect public beliefs and post-election conflicts is important not only for political scientists but also for policy-makers concerned with the political development of non- democratic regimes.",
