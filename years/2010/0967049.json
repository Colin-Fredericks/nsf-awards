 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research program of Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his group at the Moscow State University (MSU) in Moscow, Russia. Braginsky and his group are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and they propose to continue research on topics of great interest to the LIGO project to which the group has made outstanding contributions over the years. They will perform both experimental and theoretical  research in two main areas of great interest to the LIGO project. The experimental portion of their research will focus on: 1) identifying and measuring the excess noise (noise of non-thermal origin) due to mirror coatings, electric charging of the mirrors, and interaction of mirrors and the surrounding structures; 2) in-depth searches for new unknown sources of noise of nonlinear origin; and 3) methods for modeling and controlling dynamic instabilities that can appear in the interferometers due to coupling of their high-Q mechanical and optical degrees of freedom caused by the high optical power in the interferometer arms.  They will also continue theoretical and experimental investigations of novel optical topologies as well as new methods of quantum measurements that might be applied in the future to Advanced LIGO to allow operation at sensitivities below the Standard Quantum Limit.  While most of the research will be carried out at MSU, Braginsky and his colleagues will be in frequent close contact with LIGO Laboratory and LSC members through visits and regular reports.&#8232;&#8232;Progress in the supported research program will contribute to the success of Advanced LIGO in opening the new gravitational wave window on the universe. The members of the MSU group are committed to combining first-rate education with their research. The faculty members in the group will continue to incorporate LIGO concepts and research results into their technical lectures for students and for colleagues working in other fields of science; they will continue to involve undergraduate and graduate students in their theoretical and experimental research; and they will continue to give public lectures about LIGO and the LSC's research, including lectures aimed at high school students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this grant was to engage Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his research group at Moscow State University (MSU) to develop techniques for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) project and its next generation of detectors (known as Advanced LIGO).  Professor Braginsky and his group have been leading researchers in this field for nearly four decades, with particular expertise in two fundamental areas of great importance to gravitational wave detectors: 1) how the quantum nature of matter limits the sensitivity of physical measurements (the so-called Standard Quantum Limit), and 2) how thermal noise (noise due to the fact that matter at a finite temperature is in continual motion) enter gravitational wave detectors. \n\nTheir earlier experiments to understand thermal noise gave the MSU group both the understanding and the equipment needed study other potentially important sources of noise.  A particular achievement during this grant was that they recognized that the electrostatic actuators used to control the mirrors in the Advanced LIGO detectors could be a source of excess noise due to stray electrostatic charges.  They performed a number of experiments to characterize the accumulation of static charges on fused silica (the material used for the Advanced LIGO mirrors) and to study the mobility of charges on the surface.  The outcome of these experiments was to identify the conditions under which stray electrical charges would be a significant source of noise for the Advanced LIGO detectors and to develop techniques that could be used to control and mitigate charging.   \n\nThe Moscow State University group also developed several new theoretical techniques for circumventing the Standard Quantum Limit.  The two most promising of these techniques are:\n\nSpeedmeters, in which one measure the relative speed of the mirrors in the interferometer instead of measuring their position, and \nOptical springs, in which the radiation pressure of the light in an interferometer has a force component proportional to the position of the mirror, turning the nominally free mass mirror into a quantum oscillator. \n\n\nA major effort of the MSU group has been to collaborate with other groups around the world to assess the challenges to convert these theoretical ideas to practical implementations.   \n\nTaken together, these outcomes will impact both the Advanced LIGO detectors which are currently being commissioned by the LIGO Laboratory and the longer-term future evolution of the field as gravitational waves become a unique way to study energetic astrophysical phenomena.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/15/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stanley E Whitcomb"
