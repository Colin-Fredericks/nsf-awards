 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to establish a network forensics lab at University of Massachusetts Lowell. This proposed research and education infrastructure consists of network devices, such as network analyzers, Cisco routers, spectrum analyzer, and software for collecting and analyzing wired and wireless data. \r\n\r\nThe requested infrastructure will support three projects focusing on network forensics: \r\n(1) Tracing Anonymous Criminals on the Internet \r\n(2) Localizing and Locking Anonymous Malicious Wireless Mobiles \r\n(3) Fingerprinting Wireless Mobiles for Forensics Purpose \r\n\r\nThese projects will address issues that are critical to the nation?s security and will train students who will be sought out by industrial companies and research laboratories. The proposed research will also position UMass Lowell among the leaders in network forensics research and education. \r\n\r\nThe three projects in this proposal have the following broader impact: \r\n(i) The proposed infrastructure will enhance the research and education of network forensics, and will create an opportunity for developing new courses on network forensics and data recovery and analysis in UMass Lowell. \r\n(ii) The proposed infrastructure will also enhance the collaborations that already exist between UMass Lowell, regional security industry, and the other UMass campuses.",
