 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to use novel carbon fiber-integrated microelectromechanical (MEMS) structures to develop an innovative high definition raster-scanned projection display system for mobile devices and other applications. Current technology relies on silicon-based MEMS structures that suffer from poor fracture toughness and fatigue behavior, and cannot provide the simultaneous large angular deflections and scanning speeds necessary for projection display. Research objectives for this project include fabricating the MEMS components, testing the prototype electronics and optics systems, packaging the optics and electronics into a portable prototype unit, and conducting preliminary investigations into screen materials. The anticipated technical results will be a functional, full-color prototype demonstrating proof of concept for a miniaturized MEMS and optics-based projection display system.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project applies to mobile device users, offering the potential of a small, affordable, projection system that could be embedded in almost any mobile device to produce a large, high resolution image onto any near-by surface.  Use of mobile devices has been rapidly expanding, however the limitations of a <5\" diagonal display prevent mobile devices from achieving their full potential.  The proposed technology's carbon fiber MEMS micromirrors are the only demonstrated technology capable of meeting the fast speed and large deflection requirements that enable mobile projection displays capable of providing a laptop-like user experience from a mobile device. This innovation can enhance technological and scientific understanding via an improved method for multi-media information display and access. Societal benefits include improved communication and transfer of multi-media.  Commercial impact is significant, as the technology could be integrated into most hand-held mobile devices, enabling portable video-viewing.",
