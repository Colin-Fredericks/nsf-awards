 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Steven H. Strauss and Dr. Olga V. Boltalina at Colorado State University to study the synthesis, properties, and applications of nanoparticles consisting of hollow cages of sixty or more carbon atoms (known as fullerenes) to which highly fluorinated pendant groups have been added.  These molecular fluorocarbon nanoparticles, collectively known as perfluoroalkylfullerenes, have a unique set of properties that make them ideal as electron transfer components in next-generation organic photovoltaic systems and in other photochemical and electrochemical devices (including field effect transistors).  The synthesis and characterization of new perfluoroalkylfullerenes and their organic derivatives will be investigated.  Their oxidation/reduction properties, gas-phase electron affinities, solubilities in a variety of organic solvents and in polymers, electron mobilities in thin films, and thermal stabilities under a variety of conditions will be investigated, and these properties will be correlated with the structures of the new molecules, which will be determined by X-ray diffraction techniques.  Through collaborations with other universities and national laboratories, the graduate student and postdoctoral research associate working on this project will be exposed to a broad cross-section of the chemical sciences including photovoltaics, molecular electronics, polymer chemistry, and the chemical physics of thin-film devices.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental study will lead to improved organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics, and will help advance synthetic schemes in general, alleviate the energy shortage, and reduce greenhouse gases, the last two of these because this research will significantly impact the production of more efficient and longer-lasting solar energy collectors, and this will lead to their more widespread use in our society.",
