The main thrust of the research work in this laboratory has been to develop engineered structures in the nanometer size range for medical diagnosis and intervention. Not only is this size range compatible with molecular targeting and cellular delivery, but it also allows for the manipulation of materials with unprecedented control of their optical and electronic properties, specifically tailored for biomedical applications.   Examples generated in this laboratory include biodegradable plasmon resonant nanoshells and spectrally controlled content release.   Data generated by this particle sizer will help the process of manipulation of optical and biological properties of multifunctional nanostructures developed by this investigator.  In addition, this proposal addresses the need of several researchers at this location who require characterization of materials on the nanometer scale.  Such characterizations have become especially important in research programs concerned with molecular imaging and targeted therapy, colloidal chemistry, and conformation of proteins, pursued by the faculty associated with the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arizona.  Therefore, one of the aims of this proposal is to provide access to this instrumental capability to researchers pursuing related research directions at this location. Finally, an integral part of this proposal is to provide research and educational opportunities to students with interest in engineering materials on the nanometer scale, and to enhance educational curriculum in the areas of photonics, material science, and nanomedicine.",
