EAAI-10 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical issues and share resources related to teaching artificial intelligence (AI) and using AI in education across a variety of curricular levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning. The symposium will seek and disseminate contributions showing how to more effectively teach AI, as well as how themes from AI may be used to enhance education more broadly. Examples of this kind of broad AI impact include its use to motivate and inspire students in introductory computing courses or as a means for fostering computational thinking. We encourage the sharing of innovative educational approaches that convey or leverage AI and its many subfields, such as robotics, machine learning, natural language, and computer vision.",
