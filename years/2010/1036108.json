This proposal requests partial funding to organize a Workshop on the Future of Carbon Nanoscience and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This short\r\ncourse aims to introduce the graduate and undergraduate students in the New England region to the new properties and possibilities of graphene, a single monolayer of carbon atoms with unsurpassed transport properties. It will bring together world experts in graphene science and technology and it will foster student participation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The proposed short course on graphene electronics will provide student participants with an opportunity to gain exposure to the new material graphene, its basic physics and potential engineering applications. The timing of this workshop is ideal for this generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of graphene is developing. These lessons will be useful beyond graphene, as these students will be able to apply them to any future new\r\nmaterials and technologies that they will encounter during their career. Special effort will be made to involve female and minority students in the short course by advertisement and active recruitment.",
