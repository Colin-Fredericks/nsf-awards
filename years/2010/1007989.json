The principal investigator emphasizes the following\r\nspecific topics:\r\n - Material Voids in Elastic Solids with Anisotropic Surface\r\nEnergies.  Here he studies how the qualitative features of the\r\nequilibrium shape of the void depend on the smoothness and\r\nconvexity (or lack thereof) of the interfacial energy. \r\n - Evolution by Surface Diffusion.  The principal investigator\r\nstudies the short-time existence and regularity of solutions of a\r\nmodel of second-phase particles and material voids in a linearly\r\nelastic solid. \r\n - Non-Local Operators for Image Recovery.  Here he studies\r\nregularity and qualitative features of solutions of a non-local\r\nmodel for image and signal processing proposed by Gilboa and\r\nOsher.  He also takes up problems in water waves and\r\nmicromagnetics. \r\n\r\n     The central theme of this project is the application of\r\nmodern calculus of variations to materials science, mechanics,\r\nand imaging.  When an elastic material is subject to stresses, it\r\ncan stretch and develop voids within the material; the shape of\r\nthe voids affects other properties of the material.  The\r\nprincipal investigator studies how the shape depends on the\r\nenergy at the interface between the material and the void.  The\r\nmovement of interfaces by means of surface diffusion is not well\r\nunderstood when the interfacial energy is highly anisotropic. \r\nThe investigator studies this problem, focusing on the short-time\r\nbehavior; rigorous results here improve our understanding of\r\nvarious behaviors of materials.  He also considers problems in\r\nimage processing, water waves, and micromagnetics.  The results\r\nand methods developed in the project are incorporated in new\r\ngraduate courses, and some are included in a series of books that\r\nthe investigator is writing in collaboration with I. Fonseca. \r\nGraduate students are involved in the project.",
