 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) award is to collaboratively advance nanomanufacturing and biomedical science by exploring the development of human stem cells cultured on molded polymeric substrates with nanostructured surfaces.  The successful differentiation and maturation of stem cells is critical to cell implantation therapeutics and tissue engineering.  Since mammalian cells are significantly influenced by their physical environment, the incorporation of tailored nanostructured surfaces into tissue culture devices has great potential to enhance stem cell engineering by more effectively mimicking in vivo situations.   The approach taken will be to utilize nanoscale injection molding to reliably and economically produce cell culture devices designed specifically for each cell phenotype of choice. Fully approved biocompatible polymers will be used, and molded surface features throughout the study will range from the sub-micron scale down to as small as 50 nanometers.  Human mesenchymal stem cells will be studied initially, with other stem cell types included as the work evolves.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include the development of a practical and more effective route to optimally develop human stem cells for a wide range of medical applications.  This would dramatically enhance the international position of U.S. based bioengineering firms active in this field.  In addition, the fully coupled advancement of biomedical science with nanomanufacturing science will establish a new paradigm for approaching bioengineering challenges.  This will benefit both the manufacturing community that needs to direct nanoscale manufacturing science advancements toward appropriate applications and the biomedical community that has so many important problems to solve.  The research will also bolster the development of the future scientific workforce through the inclusion of a significant number of middle and high school students in the work each year. This will establish interdisciplinary scientific advancement as an enjoyable and productive norm in the minds of all involved.",
