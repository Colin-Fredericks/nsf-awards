 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a palmtop device to accurately detect and report in real-time the analytes, pathogens and contaminants in the field.  The approach is to integrate (1) antibody functionalized conducting nanosensors; (2) an automated robotic sample manipulation/preparation device; and (3) a low energy, high throughput, miniaturized electromechanical system with user interface for data integration and reporting.   This project will address the nanosensory detection of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne illness in the United States. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a device for vector and disease management, biodetection in homeland security, health care, agroenvironmental applications and food safety markets.  It is believed that an early detection is the best solution to prevent epidemics.  In the case of Lyme disease, current detection of Borrelia burgdorferi is slow, expensive and requiring constant human interference and laboratory conditions, resulting in only a small portion of the introduced pathogens actually being detected before diseases or epidemics become widespread.   This project will enable the efficient in-field monitoring for the presence of Lyme disease and other pathogens.  The data will be wireless transferred to a centralized hub, providing decision-makers with real-time intelligence of field conditions and allowing time for preventive rather than crisis control actions.",
