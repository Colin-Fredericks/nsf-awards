 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this research is to address a fundamental issue that pervades modern optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices: power conversion efficiency. The efficiency of highperformance photonic devices is typically limited by a combination of electrical resistance and optical absorption. The approach of this research is to combine photonics with nanotechnology to dramatically enhance the performance of lasers that emit in the mid-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such laser sources will find manifold applications in medicine, emissions monitoring, communications, etc.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Recent advances in mid-infrared diode lasers are hampered by the optical absorption of free holes, which increases power consumption and degrades performance. This interdisciplinary approach couples nanostructured materials science with semiconductor physics to surmount this intrinsic limitation. Semimetallic nanostructures offer the capability to dramatically reduce the number of free holes that are required in edge emitting diode lasers, substantially reducing the optical loss, and enhancing power conversion efficiency.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This research will produce a transformative photonic device paradigm that is applicable to a broad range of other problems in solid state lighting, solar power generation, and green computing/communications. The effort will integrate the proposed research with courses and outreach activities, exposing hundreds of talented students at the elementary, high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels to cutting edge photonics and nanoscience research to inspire them to pursue science and engineering careers. This work will also develop an undergraduate research program in photonicsfor women and underrepresented minorities.",
