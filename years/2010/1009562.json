It\r\ncomprises three parts.  The first part concerns the discrepancy\r\nbetween the stability predictions of the standard\r\nBurton-Cabrera-Frank model and recent experiments that have\r\nestablished the coexistence of step meandering and bunching. \r\nThis discrepancy is traced back to the incomplete information\r\nthat the classical Gibbs-Thomson relation delivers about the step\r\nchemical potential.  An alternative theory, informed by\r\nthermodynamics, yields a framework for resolving the\r\naforementioned discrepancy.  The second part focuses on the roles\r\nof electromigration and elasticity in the onset and evolution of\r\nstep instabilities.  In both cases, appropriate generalizations\r\nof the Gibbs-Thomson relation are embedded in thermodynamically\r\ncompatible formulations of the resulting free boundary problems. \r\nAs regards electromigration, the goal is to determine if the\r\ninterplay between the drift velocity and the jump in the adatom\r\ngrand canonical potential along steps can explain the observed\r\nreversals in the current direction needed to trigger bunching\r\nupon transition from low- to medium- to high-temperature regimes. \r\nWith respect to elasticity, the effect of stress on the stability\r\nof an isolated step against meandering and that of a periodic\r\ntrain of steps against bunching is studied.  In the third part,\r\nthe growth of nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy and\r\nelectrodeposition is considered.  Because of its small radius,\r\nwhich implies few steps, the growth of a nanowire is an ideal\r\nsetting to examine boundary effects on step instabilities and\r\ncompare the standard Burton-Cabrera-Frank formulation to its\r\nproposed thermodynamically consistent alternative.  The role of\r\nthe jump in the adatom grand canonical potential during\r\nelectrodeposition is probed, especially whether bunching provides\r\na dissipative mechanism for the minimization of the nanowire\r\ntotal free energy. \r\n\r\n     This project develops a unified approach to a central\r\nproblem at the junction of materials science, solid-state\r\nphysics, and applied mathematics, namely, the investigation of\r\nthe onset and evolution of instabilities during step-flow\r\nepitaxy.  Through a blend of modeling, analysis, and computation,\r\nthe investigator and his collaborators develop novel mathematical\r\ntheories that resolve discrepancies between experimental\r\nobservations and existing models.  Instabilities play a critical\r\nrole in the self-assembly of various nanostructures, which in\r\nturn strongly affect the macroscopic performance of devices that\r\nspan a wide range of technologies, from optoelectronics and\r\ndata-storage devices to biosensors and energy-conversion systems. \r\nA fundamental understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying\r\nthese instabilities and their interplay can therefore contribute\r\nsignificantly to the design and manufacture of increasingly\r\nsmaller and more reliable devices with tailored properties for\r\nspecific applications.",
