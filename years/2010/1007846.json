She also\r\nintends to explore the rich implications of the equivalence of\r\nvarious theories on both sides.\r\n\r\nSymplectic Geometry has its origin from classical\r\nmechanics. However, in spite of much progress made, many basic\r\nquestions remain unanswered. An example is the long standing\r\nWeinstein conjecture, which states that there is a periodic orbit\r\non any compact contact manifold. In physics, \"contact manifolds\"\r\nprovide the framework to describe the motion of particles. On the\r\nother hand, gauge theory arises from the theory of elementary\r\nparticles in modern physics. Surprisingly, many seemingly\r\nunrelated invariants defined on both sides turn out to be\r\nequivalent, and therefore facts that are easier to see on one\r\nsides imply similar results on the other side, which might\r\notherwise be very difficult to establish.  Taubes's celebrated\r\nrecent proof of the 3-dimensional Weinstein conjecture is an\r\nexample of many possible applications of such equivalence.",
