 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution and organization of genes on chromosomes varies widely among animals. Chromosomes can change in number and size, as well as gene composition, over short evolutionary time scales. Furthermore, chromosome location can influence how genes are expressed. The aims of this project are to test alternative hypotheses for the origin and evolution of chromosome organization using diopsid flies as a model system. The research will focus on the genetic composition of the X and Y chromosomes. These chromosomes are responsible for much of the behavioral and physiological differences between males and females and are dynamic with respect to gene content. Also, preliminary research indicates that the X chromosome of diopsid flies is an autosome in other flies and, therefore, provides an opportunity to study how gene content and expression evolves on a newly derived X chromosome. The project will utilize advanced next-generation technology to identify a complete catalog of genes located on these chromosomes and their movements between species.\r\n\r\nThis project represents a collaboration between the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). The project will substantially enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of new chromosomes and will influence scientific infrastructure by generating substantial genomic resources that will be made available through online databases. Training opportunities will be provided for students at all levels at both institutions. Finally, outreach will involve high school student interns at the AMNH and a high school teacher seminar series offered at UMD.",

Chromosome composition can also influence how genes are expressed in various tissues and how their DNA sequence evolves. The sex chromosomes, in particular, have a dynamic impact on gene movement, expression, and molecular evolution. In this project, we investigated how genes on the sex chromosomes influence reproduction and change location and expression over evolutionary time in a family of unusual insects called stalk-eyed flies. Stalk-eyed flies are remarkable because the male head is elongated into long stalks in numerous species. They have become an iconic system for studies of sexual differences and provide a natural experiment for studying sex chromosome evolution for several reasons: 1) a newly evolved X chromosome is present and not shared with other flies, 2) gene movement between sex chromosomes and autosomes is common and 3) distorted offspring sex ratios result when sex chromosomes are exposed to alternative genetic backgrounds in males.

More significantly, the X chromosome in these flies exhibits gene composition that is substantially different from the autosomes and from the X chromosomes that have been examined in other insects. We found that novel genes (i.e. genes that do not exist in other groups of flies) are created at an extremely high rate in stalk-eyed flies and are disproportionately located on the X chromosome. Most of these genes are also expressed exclusively within the testes. In contrast, previous studies on other insects have found that genes with male reproductive functions are underrepresented on the X chromosome. Also contrary to other studies, male reproductive genes are more likely to move off of an autosome and onto the X chromosome during the evolution of the family.
