 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because closely related species often differ in habitat, ecological differences could be important in speciation.  The two possible mechanisms of ecological speciation are called extrinsic and intrinsic isolation.  Extrinsic isolation occurs when hybrids that are intermediate in form cannot find appropriate habitat.  Intrinsic isolation occurs when hybrids have reduced fitness regardless of habitat, that is, the problem has to do with internal factors such as hybrid physiology.  The challenge is to determine which kind of isolation arose first and their relative contributions to allowing populations to continue towards being distinct species.  For most animals, speciation takes too long to observe directly, but some can be caught in the process of speciation.  Such species are ideal for making inferences about the order and magnitude of extrinsic and intrinsic isolation because populations can be studied at various stages of divergence, from recently diverged to completely unable to hybridize. This project focuses on ecological speciation among populations of killifish, which are ideal for studying ecological speciation because populations have diverged across a gradient from freshwater to saltwater multiple times.  The PI will measure extrinsic and intrinsic isolation between freshwater and saltwater populations and compare the results with those from populations that are found in similar salinities.  \r\n\r\nTeachers and biology education majors are incorporated into nearly all the proposed activities; they will conduct research and develop curriculum materials.  The goal of the PI is to provide a thorough understanding of speciation through participation in research.  A yearly seminar event will be held on teaching evolution to create an ongoing discussion between educators and scientists.  Finally, a summer workshop will be held to educate local teachers about evolution and disseminate the curriculum materials developed through this project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt their core, studies of speciation ask how reproductive isolating barriers (RIBs) evolve.  Speciation occurs when a single lineage diverges into two.  Reproductive isolating barriers are traits that prevent two lineages from exchanging genes.  RIBs include things such as (a) mating preferences where individuals prefer to mate with members of their own species/population; (b) genetic incompatibilities where hybrid offspring have reduced fitness compared to the ?parental? species; (c) extrinsic isolating barriers where hybrids aren?t necessarily inferior, but have problems finding a niche where they can outcompete their parents, and (d) gametic isolation where the sperm of one species cannot properly fertilize the eggs of another. \n\n \n\nThis project sought to determine how RIBs evolve in a group of killifish.  One of the difficulties with studying the evolution of RIBs is that most ?good? species possess multiple RIBs making it difficult to determine what evolved first. One way to examine the evolution of RIBs is to compare them between populations/species that have been isolated for different amounts of time. In this project, we took a comparative approach and examined the strength of RIBs between different populations of the rainwater killifish and also between the rainwater killifish and its sister species, the Bluefin killifish.  Key to this project was the fact that (a) the two species differ in salinity tolerance, (b) populations within the rainwater killifish also differ in salinity tolerance, and (c) the two species differ in the presence of a chromosomal fusion.  The Bluefin killifish is a freshwater species, and the rainwater killifish is euryhaline, meaning that it can be found in fresh, brackish, or marine waters.  The Bluefin killifish also possesses 24 chromosomes whereas the rainwater killifish only has 23 due to a chromosomal fusion where two chromosomes that are separate in Bluefin killifish became fused in rainwater killifish. \n\n \n\nThe hypothesis that natural selection as a function of salinity favors the evolution of RIBs makes two predictions.  First, it predicts heightened levels of RIBs between freshwater and saltwater populations of rainwater killifish.  Second, the genes conferring salinity tolerance should be located in the genome in the same areas as the genes responsible for RIBs.  The hypothesis that the chromosomal rearrangement drives the evolution of RIBs predicts that the chromosomal rearrangement is responsible for reductions in hybrid fitness and the subsequent evolution of preferences for members of the same species.\n\n \n\nWe found good evidence for local adaptation as a function of salinity.  However, there was little evidence that salinity had large effects on the evolution of RIBs. Rainwater killifish populations that occurred in different salinities had very minor reductions in hybrid fitness. They also mated freely with individuals from foreign populations. Instead, there was overwhelming evidence that the chromosomal rearrangement has resulted in a pronounced genetic incompatibility between the two species.  Hence, hybrid offspring have very low fitness.  In areas of where the two species co-occur, there are exceedingly high levels of behavioral isolation where both sexes of both species prefer to mate with conspecifics.  These preferences are absent in areas where each species occurs in isolation.  Hence, the chromosomal rearrangement has generated low hybrid fitness, which favors high levels of preference to mate with the same species.  These high levels of conspecific preference have also caused high levels of preference for members from an individual?s native population over individuals from a foreign population.  Hence, selection to mate with members of one?s own species have altered preferences such that females also prefer their own native population over foreign males.  Further evidence for the importance of chromosomal rearrangement (and the lack of a role of selection as a function of salinity) comes from a genetic mapping study where the genes for salinity tolerance and the genes involved in the genetic incompatibility map to different areas of the genome. \n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of this study is that it allowed us to compare the relative importance of ecological speciation versus chromosomal speciation.  We found very strong evidence for chromosomal speciation in this system.  One of the most surprising findings from this study is the presence of ?cascade reinforcement? where the evolution of preferences for members of one?s own species indirectly creates preferences for members of one?s own population.  The chromosomal rearrangement reduces hybrid fitness, causing the subsequent evolution of preferences for members of one?s own species and the correlated response where choosy animals also favor mates from native over foreign populations.  Hence, the chromosomal rearrangement acts as a driver of speciation.\n\n \n\nThe broader impact of this study is that it provided research opportunities for many teachers and pre-service teachers.  Teachers who have experience doing ?real science? are more likely to use project-based teaching in their courses. We also held a summer workshop for teachers to present curriculum materials for teaching evolution across 3 summers.  We trained ~60 teachers in our workshops. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca C Fuller"
