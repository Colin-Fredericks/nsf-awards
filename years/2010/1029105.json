PI research focuses on study of calcareous nannofossils assemblages as recorders of past climate and oceanographic conditions.  A state-of-the-art Zeiss microscope with digital image analysis capability will allow for detailed taxonomic study of even the smallest nannofossils.   The microscope will support expansion of student training in methods of marine micropaleontology, a currently shrinking field that remains critical for advances in our understanding of Earth?s climate dynamics and for hydrocarbon exploration.   \r\n\r\n***",
