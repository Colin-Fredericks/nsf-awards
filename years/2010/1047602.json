Dr. Hofer's project is concerned with the study of\r\nfundamental aspects of symplectic geometry, its applications to\r\ndynamical systems, as well as the development of mathematical\r\ntechnology to address analytical problems arising in the\r\nfield. One part of the project is devoted to the study of\r\nSymplectic Field Theory (SFT) which currently is the most general\r\nand most comprehensive theory of symplectic invariants.  Another\r\npart develops a general approach for studying certain classes of\r\nnonlinear elliptic partial differential equations as they occur\r\nin SFT. These methods potentially should have other applications\r\nin nonlinear analysis as well. A third part is devoted to the\r\napplications of the theory to dynamical systems.  The aim is the\r\ndevelopment of mathematical infrastructure, based on a\r\ncombination of Floer theory and the theory of finite energy\r\nfoliations due to Dr. Hofer and his collaborators. This research\r\naims at the understanding of long-term behavior of iterated\r\narea-preserving disk maps with its numerous applications.\r\n\r\nMany physical systems like the flow of an incompressible ideal\r\nfluid, the movement of a satellite under the gravitational forces\r\nof celestial bodies, or the movement of charged particles in a\r\nmagnetic field, to name a few, are examples of so called\r\ndynamical systems.  The mathematical theory of dynamical systems\r\nprovides tools to understand their complex behavior and allows to\r\nmake predictions.  The particular examples mentioned above are of\r\nso-called Hamiltonian nature and have an intricate structure\r\nleading to extreme complicated dynamical behavior. Stabilizing a\r\nbeam of particles in a partic= le accelerators, or sending a\r\nprobe on an interstellar journey, or understanding the dynamics\r\nof a stationary flow of an incompressible ideal fluid are\r\nproblems whose mathematical underpinnings are touched by the\r\nresearch proposed in this project. Some of the methods developed\r\npotentially have application to larger classes of partial\r\ndifferential equations of relevance in physics.\r\n",

Due to some particular preserved quantity these systems have more structure and are related to an interesting geometry called \"Symplectic Geometry\".  Unlike the usual geometries, which have as basic notions length and distance, the main concept of Symplectic Geometry is area. Symplectic Geometry provides a tool to study an important class of dynamical systems by geometric means.  Since the beginning of the eighties, the understanding of symplectic geometry accelerated in an unprecedented way.  Also it became clear that there are relations between symplectic geometry and string theory, and to other fields in mathematics like algebraic geometry.  \n\nOne of the basic ideas in studying questions in symplectic geometry is that certain  classes of  surfaces in an otherwise high-dimensional space should play an important role.  These surfaces are in particular minimal surfaces, which are two-dimensional surfaces, which locally have the smallest area possible. The occurrence of minimal surfaces, given the fact that the geometry  has area as its basic notion is very natural.  Many of the questions in symplectic geometry can be reduced to a counting of the number of such minimal surfaces in \"good position\". It is quite involved to give an accurate definition of what \"good position\" means. However,  it can be shown that in most situations a good position does not exist. To overcome this problem the idea is to study a larger class of problems where counting still leads to the desired results and where in all situations a \"good position\" can be achieved.  Here the PI and his collaborators introduce a new theory, called \"Polyfold Theory\" which overcomes these problems.  Polyfold Theory leads to a generalization of differential geometry, in particular it is possible to develop calculus on spaces with varying dimensions.
