 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-eddy simulation (LES) is widely used to replicate atmospheric and other flow behavior for many purposes, such as\r\n\r\n1) Prediction of flows in complex topography,\r\n2) Transport and diffusion of pollutants,\r\n3) Convective energy flux estimation.\r\n\r\nThis research will concentrate on developing a state-of-the-art tool for the LES of atmospheric boundary-layer flow over complex terrain based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Simulating flow within a sufficiently large region in Owens Valley, CA with adequate grid resolution will exploit the benefits of the complete subgrid-scale  and subfilter-scale turbulence scheme.  A new land surface characterization tool to provide better treatment of land surface processes at fine resolution over complex terrain will also be incorporated.  Comparison of simulation results with relevant parts of the extensive Terrain-induced Rotor EXperiment (T-REX) dataset will test the realism of the turbulence models and the tiled-land-surface treatment.  Specifically, the effects of small-scale variations in surface properties on fluxes and flow dynamics will be assessed.  These newly combined modules should provide an improved state-of-the-art tool for atmospheric boundary-layer LES.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This research will demonstrate that the LES code is suitable for studying the development of atmospheric flow structures, and for sensitivity studies of the effects of grid resolution and land surface treatment on the fluxes and flows of the atmospheric boundary-layer.  The results will also be useful for developing parameterizations for numerical simulation at regional to global scales.  Improved LES techniques can have wide impacts wherever LES techniques are applied.  A Ph.D. student will be trained in the subject area.",
