The approach, based on a pilot study, is to design appropriate interactive options in the form of computer games and other activities requiring imaginative thinking.  The premise taken is that multiplexing an interesting task in a background monitoring task can lead to improved engagement and, indirectly, improved performance.  The concept has been successfully tested in a pilot study and it is proposed to build new application designs suitable for effective dual tasking.",
