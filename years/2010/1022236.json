 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the ecological and genetic mechanisms that allow the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to adapt (grow, survive and reproduce) to different natural environments. Using wild populations from the extremes of a natural gradient in temperature and length of daylight, the investigators will identify the traits and genes that govern plant performance in nature. Traits of particular interest include flowering time, freezing and drought tolerance, and the capacity of plants to photosynthesize (make energy from sunlight) under conditions of physiological stress. The investigators will identify the genes that contribute to adaptation in nature and the magnitude of the effect of individual genes. A major goal of this work is to investigate the importance of genes that have positive effects in one environment but negative effects in other environments.  Such genes are poorly understood but are thought to play a key role in adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe study will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that allow plants to cope with different environments and has the potential to provide genetic tools for producing new varieties of plants/crops. In addition, the study system is well suited to investigate the possible consequences of global climate change and the potential of plants to adapt to rapidly changing conditions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur findings contribute to a better understanding of plant response to the environment and have several potential applications to agriculture and the selection, breeding, and/or engineering of crops for food, fiber, and biofuels.  Our results reveal what plant features allow plants to have a superior productivity under stressful environmental conditions, including excessive heat or cold temperatures, and to have a superior nutritional quality (antioxidant content).  Our results also provide a better understanding of the costs of a superior performance under cold temperature in terms of an associated inferior performance under hot temperatures, and vice versa, and of unintended consequences of the manipulation of plant antioxidant content.  We discovered that plants adjust the numbers or sizes of conduits that export sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant and of conduits that transport water from the roots to the leaves in response to specific demands of the environment they grown in.  Specifically, we determined that a greater capacity of the physical route for sugar export from leaves plays a role in the ability of plants to be productive under cold temperatures and that a greater emphasis on the physical route for water transport from roots to leaves is involved in the ability of plants to withstand hot temperatures.  We, furthermore, identified genetic differences in the degree to which plant populations adapted to different climates respond to changes in their environment by adjusting their sugar and water conduits.  We also showed that the internal balance between oxidants and antioxidants helps regulate the adjustments in sugar and water conduits, and that this balance differs in plants from populations adapted to different climates.\n\n \n\nThis work also allowed us to develop human resources in science and technology by training two postdoctoral students, one graduate student, and four undergraduate students (three of them female students), which resulted in these individuals acquiring new skills and qualifications, and accumulating evidence of success (e.g., in funding through small grants, and manuscripts published, in press, and in progress).\n\n \n\nWe disseminated our findings to the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and to the student community at the university of Colorado at Boulder by incorporating our results in the teaching of large introductory biology classes, where we cover the impact of climate change on agriculture and efforts to develop food and biofuel crops with superior productivity, stress tolerance, and nutritional quality.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara Demmig-Adams"
