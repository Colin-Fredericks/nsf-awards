 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nWe are surrounded by embedded systems that use software to control devices in cars, appliances and cell phones.  There is a worldwide shortage of engineers with core skills for designing embedded systems.  Computer science students rarely have an opportunity to design meaningful software for embedded systems.  Investigators are developing a Versatile Unix Emulator (VUE) to address this need.  It is used to emulate four software architectures: round robin, round robin with interrupts, function queue scheduler and real-time operating system software.\r\n\r\nVUE creates an application with three groups of processes: 1) virtual input devices, 2) virtual output devices, and 3) control processes.  An instructor creates a laboratory exercise by specifying input, output devices and a scenario of events.  Students develop software to control the process of the embedded systems and must consider design trade-offs such as energy consumption and responsiveness.  VUE generates a rich and repeatable set of events that stress test student designs.  The automated random events create repeatable experiments to evaluate software quality.  \r\n\r\nExpected outcomes include the emulator and a collection of laboratory exercises. VUE is being piloted at Auburn University and Tuskegee University.  Workshops are provided to train faculty how to adopt the materials. \r\n",
