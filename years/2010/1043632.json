 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, a collaboration between MIT and the NSDL Resource Center at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), is working to further extend the impact of the MIT Math CI Space, an online site where educators from throughout the mathematics community can develop and share strategies and materials for teaching mathematical communication to undergraduate math majors.  In this online space, educators are discussing pedagogical needs and exploring potential solutions.  Once a good solution is identified, it is classroom tested and the resulting materials are uploaded for other educators to use and further refine.  To encourage and facilitate this discussion and improvement of pedagogy, materials and discussions are tightly integrated within the web space.  This integration is being achieved via a WordPress-based platform.  Pedagogical materials for mathematical communication developed through these collaborations are available to the larger community via the NSDL-supported MathDL Pathway.  The MIT Math CI Space was initially created in 2009.",
