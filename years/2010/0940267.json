The investigators focus on three key themes: (1)\r\nDynamics of Climate, (2) Climate Process Modeling, and (3) Data\r\nAnalysis and Data Assimilation.  Dynamics of Climate addresses\r\ncritical climate processes and their interactions.  Climate\r\nProcess Modeling undertakes the modeling of climate components\r\nthat have been underrepresented in extant climate models, such as\r\nthe multi-scale material structure of sea ice.  Data Analysis and\r\nData Assimilation develops mathematical tools for analyzing\r\nclimate data and assimilating them in current climate models. \r\nThe Research Network aims to be a national resource, with\r\nparticipants at thirteen U.S. universities.  The investigators\r\nwork together as a virtual community that holds regular weekly\r\n\"webinars\" and working meetings over the Internet.  This\r\nmulti-year effort is expected to help in defining a research area\r\nof \"climate mathematics\" and in educating a new generation of\r\nmathematical researchers to meet the scientific challenges\r\nassociated with a changing climate. \r\n\r\n     This project is driven by the need to better understand the\r\nEarth's climate system.  Climate is the result of many\r\ngeophysical and chemical processes in the Earth's atmosphere,\r\noceans and biosphere.  These processes evolve in time over many\r\nscales, ranging from minutes to centuries, and interact in\r\nmultiple ways, most often nonlinearly.  Feedback mechanisms, many\r\nof which are poorly understood, further complicate the picture. \r\nBecause there is only one Earth, climate cannot be studied by\r\nsystematic experimentation; the only approach available to\r\nclimate researchers is through computational experiments.  These\r\nexperiments are based on mathematical models, which must be\r\nsimple enough not to exceed the capabilities of today's advanced\r\ncomputer architectures, while still incorporating the physical\r\nand chemical processes that are essential for realistic climate\r\noutcomes.  The expertise of mathematical scientists in designing,\r\nassessing and interpreting these models is critical.  This\r\n\"Mathematics and Climate Research Network\" helps engage the\r\nmathematical sciences community to address the mathematical and\r\nstatistical issues of our changing climate.  The Research Network\r\ntakes full advantage of current information technology;\r\ncommunication and collaboration among the participants takes\r\nplace mostly remotely over the Internet.",
