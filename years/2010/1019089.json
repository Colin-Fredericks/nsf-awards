The ACM GROUP conference is held bi-annually, bringing together researchers and practitioners from the fields of organizational behavior, information systems, social informatics, information sciences, and computer supported cooperative work. The focus of the DC is the intellectual content of the students' doctoral research projects. Students are selected for attendance based on competitive review of the materials supplied. These projects represent state-of-the-art research in the study and development of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work. The DC creates a social network among the next generation of researchers and several senior mentors selected from top academic institutions and research laboratories. Students and mentors will be a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, gender, institutional affiliation, under-represented minority status), therefore participation in the consortium will broaden the students' intellectual and social perspectives at a critical stage in their professional development.",
