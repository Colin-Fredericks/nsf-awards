 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Amazon basin has high biodiversity and is an ideal region in which to examine geographic influences on species diversification.  Large Amazonian rivers are known to act as barriers that separate genetically distinct populations of related birds (species pairs or different subspecies).  Rivers, however, cease to act as barriers in their headwaters, where many pairs of otherwise divided populations of birds come into contact.  The aim of this study is to explore both the role of rivers as barriers to gene flow (phylogeographic breaks) and the rivers' headwaters as meeting points (contact zones) using 90 pairs of species or subspecies of birds.  This research will pioneer a comparative multi-species approach to study bird distributions and species interactions in remote regions of the Amazon, focusing on plumage characters and molecular data.  This study will address long-standing questions in evolutionary biology, including the role of physical and ecological barriers in the geographic location of contact zones, the role of rivers as historical and contemporary barriers to bird species (the \"Riverine Barrier\" hypothesis), and the relationship between genetic distinctness and the likelihood that two populations will interbreed when in contact.\r\n\r\nThis project relies on close cooperation between American, Brazilian, and Venezuelan institutions. Fieldwork in Amazonia included Brazilian students and assistants, who were introduced to museum-based studies of biodiversity. This project is likely to lead to long-term collaborations with South American scientists. Understanding how physical barriers prevent gene flow will help understand the consequences of large-scale human-created fragmentation on natural populations.",

Such studies are best done in places where many unrelated species share common boundaries. These regions, known as suture zones, offer unique opportunities to study diversification processes, allowing comparative studies, using multiple independent pairs of taxa.</p>\n<p>Our study, initiated in 2006, was conducted in the Rio Negro basin, one of Amazonia&rsquo;s most prominent suture zones. We compiled a large distributional database with ~30,000 documented records obtained from museum collections and our own field expeditions. With the database, we mapped species distributions and found that at least 88 species of birds (1/3 of the species) had a geographic replacement across the Lower Rio Negro (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Our first goal was to describe general replacement patterns. These results, published in the Journal of Biogeography (Naka 2011), showed that whereas the Lower Rio Negro represented a barrier for 88 species, only 21 of these are bounded by the narrower upper Rio Negro. Most of these species divided by the lower, but not the upper Rio Negro, relied on a different riverine river: the poorly known Rio Branco. This river bounded 43 of these species. Surprisingly, 15 pairs were neither replaced along the upper Negro or the Branco and had their breaks within the Branco/Negro interfluve, away from any large riverine barrier. We identified seven additional barriers, including medium-sized rivers, savannas and mountains. With these data we defined the boundaries of the Guianan Area of Endemism, revealing a more complex scenario than formerly recognized. This study highlighted the importance of other landscape features besides rivers, and the existence of three distributional patterns in the region (Figure 2). We concluded that the longstanding view of the Amazon Basin as a mosaic of parapatric areas of endemism delimited by major rivers represents an oversimplification and needs to be reevaluated.</p>\n<p>Our second goal was to investigate not only the location of avian exchanges along the suture zones, but also to identify where pairs may come into contact. We also aimed to understand whether these pairs represented different evolutionary lineages. To answer these questions, we used distributional and genetic data from 78 pairs of avian taxa. Using spatially explicit statistical models, we showed that phylogeographic breaks and contact zones are not randomly distributed. Geographic breaks cluster along physical barriers (rivers, non-forested habitats, and mountain), whereas contact zones aggregate where these barriers break down or are easier to overcome, such as around rivers&rsquo; headwaters. These results, published in the American Naturalist (Naka et al., 2012), indicate that although major Amazonian rivers are often key determinants of taxon boundaries, the &ldquo;riverine barrier effect&rdquo; is a synergistic consequence of the wide lower reaches of some rivers, coupled with non-riverine landscape features at the headwaters.</p>\n<p>Finally, we aimed to investigate the role of two Amazonian rivers in the avian diversification process. We know that rivers are meaningful barriers for birds, but were these rivers responsible for the original separation of these populations? Or did rivers appear after those populations were already separated, and represent secondary barriers? We explored these questions using molecular data to estimate time of divergence of pairs across rivers and ask whether populations subdivisions clusetered in a particular time period, such as the Pleistocene. We found large variation in divergence times, indicating that most differentiation did not stem from a single, shared speciation event (Figure 3) (Naka &amp; Brumfield, in review). We also evaluated whether the pairs of replacing taxa were each other&rsquo;s closest relatives, as expected from a primary barrier. We found that phylogenetically, the taxon pairs represent a blend of sister taxa (~40% of the pairs) and non-sister taxa (~60%), suggesting that simple vicariant scenarios are not sufficient to explain current distribution patterns. Finally, we tested scenarios of simultaneous divergence across the Branco and Negro. Our analyses do not indicate a single diversification event for pairs divided by the Branco. On the other hand, we found evidence supporting the effect of the Rio Negro in the diversification of 12 pairs of avian taxa. Together, these results indicate that species turnover across rivers may encompass a mixture of histories, supporting the dual role for Amazonian rivers in the generation and maintenance of biological diversity.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Naka LN (2011) Avian distribution patterns in the Guiana Shield: implications for the delimitation of Amazonian areas of endemism. <em>Journal of Biogeography </em>38:681-696.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Naka LN, Bechtoldt CL, Herniques LMP &amp; RT Brumfield (2012) The role of physical barriers in the location of avian suture zones in the Guiana Shield, northern Amazonia. <em>American Naturalist</em> 179: E115-E132.</p>\n<p>Naka LN &amp; RT Brumfield (<em>in review</em>) The role of Amazonian rivers in generating and maintaining terrestrial bird diversity.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/14/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;V&nbsp;Remsen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1011512/1011512_10016758_1489498145124_FigureS1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1011512/1011512_10016758_1489498145124_FigureS1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
