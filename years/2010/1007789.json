 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the physics underlying plasma density irregularities in the lower (E-region) ionosphere at unprecedented spatial resolution based on numerical improvements to existing, massively-parallel, kinetic plasma simulation code as well as theory.   Improvements include the development of ion and electron fluid modules to enable larger scale simulations and the incorporation of electron thermal effects, non-periodic boundary conditions, and particle injection and removal for simulation of auroral and photoelectron processes having more realistic temperatures and density gradients.  The proposed scientific studies are focused on low- and high-latitude plasma instabilities and also, for the first time, E-region thermal instabilities.  The simulation results will be compared to observations and used to develop analytical models to improve understanding of turbulent and inhomogeneous currents and energy flows within the ionosphere. Results from this research will improve interpretation of rocket and radar monitoring of the geospace environment as well as advance upper atmospheric modeling capability.",
