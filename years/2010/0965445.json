 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Michael Stokes (Western Kentucky University) \r\n\r\nCo-PI: Bruce Schulte (Western Kentucky University) \r\n\r\nSenior Personnel: Mark Chambron (Western Kentucky University)\r\n\r\nHuman-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a broad term encompassing all negative interactions between humans and wildlife; it stems from expanding human populations and competition for resources.  In sub-Saharan Africa, crop-raiding is a widespread and economically damaging form of HWC.  A single elephant or herd of bush pigs or buffalo can completely destroy a small farm in a day; in many areas, greater than 90% of farmers experience crop losses from wild life.  This innovative project aims to test various aspects of behavioral ecology and the influence of modifying animal behavior on instances of HWC in Africa where wildlife raiding on rural farmsteads occurs.  \r\n\r\nThis research project will target wildlife species that are of particular importance to crop damage (elephants, wild pigs, monkeys, and various hoofstock) and will attempt to use the evolved, adaptive behavioral responses of those species to a broad suite of sensory stimuli (especially sound and odor) to reduce crop loss.  Adaptive behavioral responses are those that are inherent in a species and help individuals to survive and/or reproduce.  Behavioral responses to various stimuli will be assessed for each target species to develop a set of effective stimuli that elicit responses that are disruptive to foraging or crop raiding.  In addition, stimuli will be delivered in ways to reduce habituation by the target species.  If/when such stimuli are identified, deterrent devices, including standalone, high-tech scarecrows and training collars will be field tested to determine whether the devices are capable of reducing visits to feeding sites by individuals or if they can modify group feeding behaviors in such a way as to reduce feeding intensity and therefore crop damage.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  HWC can lead to the decimation of wildlife populations as farmers react to crop damage by killing wildlife or converting wildlife habitat to agriculture.  This project will contribute to our fundamental understanding of wildlife biology that is essential for mitigating HWC and for conserving wildlife and functional ecosystems.  However, the results from this research project may have the broadest impact on the small shareholder farmer.  The intention of this research project is not to prevent all HWC, but to determine if changes in animal behavior can be characterized that may reduce specific, common types of crop damage during growing seasons, that in the long term will increase the yield of small shareholder farmers.  Reducing HWC by even a few percentage points by disrupting foraging behaviors of animals at the agricultural-wildlife interface could improve food security in areas of Africa where the spectacular wealth of the wildlife resource contrasts with the often desperate poverty of the subsistence farmers.  In addition, this project will train young scientists and community volunteers in the USA and Africa.  The project will include both Kenyan and American university students working in partnerships in both cultural and scientific networks and will provide opportunities for American student researchers to work with local African communities.  School groups, NGOs, and other interested parties will be able to access products from this project, including a digital library of sounds, behavioral data and engineering schematics of deterrent devices from a public website developed and maintained at the Department of Biology at Western Kentucky University (http://bioweb.wku.edu).",

It is often economically or socially inviable to relocate farmers and ecologically indefensible to eliminate wildlife, so low-cost and nonlethal solutions to reduce this conflict are essential to long-term sharing of the landscape by agriculturalists and wildlife. This project was initiated to determine the nature of such conflict and determine whether selected wildlife species could be deterred from damaging harvestable crops by invoking their evolved fear responses to perceived but not actual threats. In southeastern Kenya, where human-wildlife conflict is intense, we interviewed farmers from randomly selected farms to determine which wildlife species were most responsible for crop damage.&nbsp; All farmers ranked elephants as the worst problem, but domesticated animals were also implicated in much damage. To test whether perception mirrored reality, we established reporting stations throughout the area and attempted to measure and document every reported case of elephant damage to farms. Although elephants were most feared by farmers, only about 10% of farms actually were impacted during a year. The farms that were damaged by elephants were in areas that made them particularly susceptible, such as adjacent to wild land and water sources. As a result, efforts to deter elephants could be targeted, and we recommended zoning of agricultural crops to local authorities.&nbsp; To reduce wildlife damage to crops, we developed circuitry for hi-tech, motion-activated &lsquo;scarecrows&rsquo; and matching collars for elephants that could activate scarecrows by radio signal and would themselves emit a beeping sound and flash of light when elephants entered interdiction zones determined in our initial study. We tested the scarecrows on several species of crop raiders in South Africa, including bush pigs, porcupine, bushbuck, buffalo, Chacma baboons, vervet monkeys, and banded mongoose. In Kenya, we installed collars on two elephants. Reactions of the animals to our scarecrows were observed using remote wildlife cameras, which captured short video sequences when triggered by animal motion. Our scarecrows were unique in that they were designed to minimize the biggest drawback of any kind of nonlethal deterrent, habituation. The scarecrows are multimodal, emitting a scent, flashing a strobe, and randomly selecting a sound from a large library of natural distress calls and human noises.&nbsp; Following analysis of more than 900 individual videos of free-ranging animals, we have reached these conclusions. Nocturnal animals such as porcupines, bushbuck and bushpigs are easily frightened and do not habituate quickly to the scarecrows. Primates habituate very rapidly and are not easily deterred from raiding crops. Buffalo are not easily deterred, as they are aggressive animals with few natural predators. Scarecrows do frighten them, but not reliably. Elephants with young are cautious and will display either protective behaviors or leave the immediate area, but young bull elephants, most commonly implicated in crop raiding, are not reliably deterred by scarecrows. Loud, abrupt, unnatural sounds are generally more effective than natural sounds such as distress calls. Based on this proof-of-concept project, we recommend that a production model of a low-cost scarecrow be developed, to include motion-detection, a strobe, and random play of a library of various short, high-volume, abrupt sounds.&nbsp; These can be deployed strategically along common entrance paths to crop fields.
