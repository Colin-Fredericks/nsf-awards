The mechanistic information thus obtained will be used to develop bioremediation strategies to alleviate the environmental insults that have resulted from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. \r\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill has resulted in drastically impaired aquatic life and environmental health of the gulf. Nevertheless, the specific chemical composition of the contaminant stream presents a novel opportunity for simultaneous bioremediation of both the primary organics (the petroleum hydrocarbons) and the methane (the purported cause of the explosion that led to the spill). Methane is typically the primary energy substrate for methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB). However, owing to the broad substrate specificity of the first enzyme involved in methane oxidation to formaldehyde (methane monooxygenase), MOB can oxidize not only methane but also alternate organic substrates such as longer chain aliphatic and aromatic compounds. However, MOB cannot derive energy from such transformations, which are termed ?co-metabolic?. Co-metabolism based bioremediation strategies are therefore characterized by a finite transformation capacity, limited by availability of the primary substrate (in casu, methane). \r\n\r\nIn this project, they will elucidate the proteomics scale mechanisms of MOB to oxidize methane (via primary energy metabolism) and the mix of petroleum hydrocarbons (via co-metabolism) in lab-scale bioreactors. This NSF MRI Rapid project will support the acquisition of a quantitative proteomics analyzer (Waters Corp.), which will be housed initially for six-months in Earth and Environmental Engineering (the home department of the PI, Dr. Kartik Chandran) and then deployed onsite in the Gulf.  When used for ex-situ bioremediation of the sequestered or skimmed pollutants along with the methane (which is currently just being flared or released), the bio-process technology developed in this project could be specifically applied to address both contaminants simultaneously. Mathematical models that describe methane oxidation and co-metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbons will be constructed and parameterized using the proteomics data combined with chemical profiles and microbial measurements. Finally, operating strategies, ex-situ transformation and mineralization of methane and petroleum hydrocarbons mixes obtained on site will be developed and tested. \r\n\r\nSuccessful application of this project will enable the accelerated biological treatment of the widespread petroleum hydrocarbon and methane pollution in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, the developed strategies will help to accelerate treatment and minimize such widespread dissemination of this particular contaminant mix, which is typical of offshore drilling operations in the future.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will be used for Gulf oil spill related research in a timely fashion consistent with RAPID funding requirements.",
