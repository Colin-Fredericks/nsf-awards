Comparisons will be made with non-ADHD-affected persons to determine the difference, if one exists, between normative test anxiety and medicalization-based stereotype threat. The effect of a frequently-provided test-taking accommodation for persons with ADHD - extra time to complete the questions - will also be experimentally evaluated to determine the extent to which it might offset stereotype threat.\r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIf stereotype threat negatively impacts test-taking performance among persons with ADHD, this will provide evidence for one way in which the labeling component of medicalization may harm patients despite the possible benefits involved with having a diagnosis to which counter-normative behavior may be attributed.",
