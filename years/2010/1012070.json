 "awd_abstract_narration": "By 2011, data centers in the U.S. are poised to consume around 100 billion KW of energy, half of which in servers. The majority of power consumption will shift from the processor to main memory.  This project, rather than relying solely on DRAM, uses multiple technologies to construct a high-capacity, energy-efficient memory system for virtualized computer servers with a new Storage Class Memory Architecture that incorporates multiple memory technologies such as DRAM, Phase-change memory (PRAM) and Flash.\r\n\r\nThis project is ambitious with fundamental and applied contributions in the design and development of energy-efficient computer servers. The fundamental contributions include: a new integrated memory architecture  that seamlessly manages hybrid memory resources; novel algorithms and policies for energy, performance and endurance management; better understanding of the hypervisor?s role in resource management and its interaction with upper and lower system layers; and a new hybrid DRAM and PRAM main memory controller. The applied contribution is in the form of tools that will be developed and disseminate, including simulations, analytic models and actual software/emulated hardware system. \r\n\r\nThis research represents a new \"green computing technology\" that satisfies the demands of future computing systems (e.g., cloud computing, server farms, commodity computers) in an exceptionally low energy manner. The project impacts undergraduate and graduate students through research opportunities and industry internships and aims to recruit people from under-represented groups in computer science and computer engineering.",
