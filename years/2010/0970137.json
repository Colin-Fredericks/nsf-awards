 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of the Pacific Lattice Group (PLG) involves investigations into the fundamental behavior of matter at subatomic scales via supercomputer simulations and calculations of theoretical physics. There are three complimentary strands to the program, all involving study of strongly-interacting particles. One theme is to understand from basic principles how only a few fundamental building blocks --- the quarks and gluons of Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) --- combine in complex ways to generate experimentally observed states such as the proton, neutron, and other more exotic particles found at accelerators. The second strand of the work explores the mechanism of quark confinement, namely the puzzle of why quarks cannot be observed individually in Nature, but are instead always restricted to multiple quark combinations by some not-fully understood aspects of QCD. Finally, the third strand studies the possibility that the new experimental program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN might discover a whole new family of fundamental particles, whose strong interactions have prevented them from being observed to date, and which combine to form the ``Higgs'' particle, the only remaining particle predicted by the Standard Model which has not been found. All three strands involve intensive large-scale computer simulations, requiring high-end computational resources combined with cutting-edge simulation techniques, developed within the framework of lattice field theory.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this program is to advance the current understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. Specifically, the particle physics community is preparing for major new discoveries in the near future as new experiments such as the LHC start, coupled with very large-scale computing power making possible the exploration of theoretical ideas in new and more detailed ways. This research program sits precisely at this juncture.  These studies are coupled with the development of a modern data-sharing mechanism and a lively outreach program affecting K-12 schools and the community.  This research is also taking place at a predominantly undergraduate institution, and thus provides an active research site involving the training of undergraduates.",
