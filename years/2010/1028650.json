 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop highly sensitive silicon-based sensor elements, monolithically integrated with silicon microelectronics, for passive millimeter-wave camera systems. The research is based on the development of a silicon backward diode by this group, providing new opportunities for a fully silicon-based front-end solution. The research approach includes miniaturization of the backward diodes, characterization of their radio frequency performance, and modification of the tunneling junction design and epitaxial growth to achieve high sensitivity concurrently with low resistance. Guidance towards system-level integration will be provided through close collaboration with Traycer Diagnostic Systems.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Silicon-based sensor technology at the materials and device levels will be studied for their viability in millimeter-wave imaging systems. Specific advances targeted in this research include: (i) cost-effective sensing through lower-cost devices, increased packaging yield and reduced assembly cost; (ii) improved imager performance and reduced imager weight through reduced number of packages and simplified packaging needs; (iii) larger imager pixel counts for improved resolution; (iv) improved uniformity of imaging array for enhanced image quality; (v) operation at room temperature; and (vi) operation at zero bias, virtually eliminating 1/f noise.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research is expected to significantly advance millimeter-wave imaging technology for a range of security and safety applications including detecting concealed weapons hidden on a person below clothing and pilot vision through obscuring media (e.g., rain, fog, smoke), such as for an aircraft landing in a fog-bound airport. This project includes domestic and international collaborations with Traycer Diagnostic Systems, Inc., the Naval Research Laboratory and the Intra-University Microelectronics Center (IMEC) in Leuven, Belgium. The project will train both graduate and undergraduate students including students from underrepresented groups.",
