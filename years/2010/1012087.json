This resource is essential to enabling many electronic structure calculations as well as computations in fluid dynamics.  In all these cases, a large shared memory system is critical.  In addition, the new system will allow larger scale computational experiments in OpenMP and provides an excellent entree for students desiring to learn parallel programming.",
