The ability of molecular simulations to isolate specific molecular interactions at the atomic scale permits researchers to explore phenomena that cannot be isolated through traditional experimental techniques. Ion diffusion at the basal surface of smectite clay minerals is just such a phenomena. Compacted smectite minerals are used as a barrier to the migration of radioactive ions because of their low permeability. Understanding diffusion at the basal surface in compacted clay barriers is an important aspect of the risk assessment for hazardous waste containment as it provides an estimate of the design lifetime of such facilities.\n\nExperiments by my host researcher, Prof. Tamotsu Kozaki of Hokkaido University, have demonstrated that the energy barrier to diffusion in compacted clays with a dry density ~1.0 kg/m3 can be less than the energy barrier to diffusion in free water.  However, with three or more diffusion pathways existing simultaneously at this dry density, it is difficult to identify the dominant pathway associated with the decrease in activation energy of diffusion, Ea.  The current research used molecular simulations (for model, see Figure 1) to determine the energy barrier to diffusion at the basal surface by modeling diffusion in this model system at five different temperatures.  The slope of a plot of the diffusion coefficient (D) versus the inverse of temperature (1/T) gives the energy barrier to diffusion (Figure 2).\n\nThe energy barrier to diffusion at the clay basal surface was found to be less than the energy barrier to diffusion in free water (14.2 kJ mol-1 vs. 18.4 kJ mol-1, respectively).  This is in agreement with the experimental values determined by Dufey &amp; Laudelot (13 kJ mol-1; 1975) and Kozaki, et al. (~14 kJ mol-1; 2005). These previous finding were attributed to diffusion at the basal surface. However, this interpretation could not be confirmed as this diffusion pathway cannot be experimentally isolated.  The results of these atomistic simulations have demonstrated the validity of this methodology to determine the energy barrier to diffusion in a compacted clay layers.  Future simulations using this methodology are being planned to determine the energy barriers to diffusion for additional cations and anions as well as along the different diffusive pathways (i.e. the interlayer and bentonite edges).\n\nThese research findings are relevant to countries and government agencies that are designing facilities for the safe, geologic disposal of high-level radioactive wastes and the techniques employed provide a means to isolate the other diffusive pathways in compacted clay barriers for further research.  \n\nReferences: 1) Dufey, J.
