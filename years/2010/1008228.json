 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education (NSSME), being conducted by Horizon Research, Inc. with assistance from Westat, is the fifth in a series of national surveys of science and mathematics education since 1977.  These surveys have proven highly valuable to science and mathematics educators, researchers, and policy makers, exploring both trends in science and mathematics education over the years, and current issues. \r\n\r\nNSSME's research questions include:  \r\n1. To what extent do science and mathematics instruction and on-going assessment mirror current understanding of learning?\r\n2. What are the most commonly-used textbooks/programs, and how are they used?\r\n3. What factors, including policies such as those in the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation, influence teachers? decisions about content and pedagogy?\r\n4. What formal and informal opportunities do mathematics/science teachers have for on-going development of their knowledge and skills?\r\n5. How are resources for mathematics and science education, including well-prepared teachers and course offerings, distributed among schools in different types of communities and different socioeconomic levels?\r\n\r\nThe study involves a random sample of elementary, middle, and high schools across the U.S., relying on web-based data collection.  One questionnaire is directed at school-level leaders, who are being asked to respond to questions about the nature of STEM programs in their schools.  Another questionnaire is being administered to classroom teachers within sampled schools, inquiring about classroom practices, curriculum materials used, and assessment practices. It also asks teachers about their licensure and their entry routes to the profession. This study provides a view of the demographic characteristics of the STEM teacher workforce, and information about such issues as out-of-field teaching assignments, and the use of technology in schools. The study also sends observers into STEM classrooms to provide first-hand accounts of current STEM education in U.S. schools. Analyses will use weighted data, with school, teacher, and class weights calculated to reflect the sample design selection probabilities. An Advisory Board with expertise in research design/analysis; science and mathematics education; policy; and dissemination is providing oversight and evaluation.  \r\n\r\nThis study is important because of its longitudinal nature, allowing comparisons of STEM education over time. It is also extremely timely because no survey research as comprehensive and focused on STEM education has been done since the passage of NCLB. The data analysis plan provides both national estimates of trends as well as results disaggregated by type of community and by school socio-economic status.  In addition, NSSME's database is designed to be used by other researchers who can mine the data in unique ways, further contributing to the impact of this work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education (NSSME), the fifth in a series of studies dating back to 1977, provided current data on essential elements of the K-12 science and mathematics education system in the United States.  The NSSME provides the only detailed, nationally representative snapshot of the K-12 science and mathematics education system, which comes at a critical time when the country is adopting new standards in these disciplines.  The 2012 NSSME gathered information about a diverse set of topics, including science and mathematics courses offered to students, teacher background and preparation, professional development opportunities, classroom instruction, and resources available for instruction.  Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of over 7,700 teachers from more than 1,500 schools, and disaggregated in several ways, including by: subject, grade band (K-5, 6-8, 9-12), poverty level, school size, and region of the country. \n\n \n\nAlthough the study identified a number of strengths of the science and mathematics education system, it also found a number of areas in which improvement is needed.  For example, the typical elementary school class spends about 20 minutes a day on science instruction, compared to 60 minutes on mathematics and 90 minutes on language arts.  Further, mathematics is taught every day in elementary classes, but only about one-fifth of elementary classes teach science each day.  Three-fourths of elementary teachers describe themselves as very well prepared to teach mathematics, but less than 40 percent feel similarly confident about teaching science.  Mathematics classes in high-poverty schools are more likely to be taught by inexperienced teachers than classes in affluent schools.  In addition, although female students are just as likely as males to take advanced science and mathematics classes in high schools, students from race/ethnic groups historically underrepresented in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are less likely to be enrolled in these courses. \n\n \n\nProducts from the study, including the main technical report, a large number of more targeted reports and presentations, and de-identified data sets available for secondary analysis have been widely disseminated and are available on the project\u00c6s website:  http://www.horizon-research.com/2012nssme/.  The website has been visited nearly 15,000 times since the report release, representing over 100 countries.  According to Google Scholar, the main technical report has been cited 90 times already in scholarly work since its release in February 2013.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric R Banilower"
