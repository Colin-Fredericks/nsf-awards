 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing an understanding of, and a predictive capability for, strongly correlated electron systems (SCES), is a rapidly evolving field that relies critically on faster computation for continued progress. SCES form the basis of crucial materials capabilities, including high temperature superconductivity, nuclear fuels, new classes of thermoelectrics, and the exotic and promising behavior seen in cold atomic gases. SCES are difficult materials to model theoretically because of the highly time-dependent fluctuations of their electronic constituents.  An important emerging technology is the multicore processor, where an increasingly large number of CPUs (\"cores\") are juxtaposed on a single chip and thus are extremely closely coupled.  The resulting (expected) speedup in computational throughput comprises a promising path to sidestep the well publicized breakdown of Moore's law in semiconductor technology.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the development of advanced computational physics methods, \"Quantum Monte Carlo\" and \"Density Functional Theory,\" for studying SCES properties.  The capabilities of these new approaches will be greatly enhanced by the formulation of efficient strategies for their implementation on emerging multicore processors.  This work crosses the intellectual boundary between condensed matter and atomic physics, and also between physics, applied mathematics, and computer science.   The applications will explore effects of interactions on novel quantum states of matter which arise from magnetic, metal-insulator, and superconducting transitions.  A particular project focus will be on the effect of spatial inhomogeneities (\"defects\") on ordered phases of quantum systems.  In addition to advancing research in computational physics and materials science, this work has broader impacts to training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in interdisciplinary\r\nresearch tools.  The Principal Investigators have also a substantial effort in involving undergraduate students and even high school students in research, which they will continue with this project.",

Zhaojun Bai, Warren Pickett, Richard Scalettar \nUniversity of California, Davis\n\nThe properties of solids, for example whether they are magnetic, whether\nthey conduct electricity, and the nature of their crystal structure,\nare determined by the laws of quantum mechanics.  These laws,\nalthough well known, are very difficult to solve for more than\na few particles.  To get exact results, physicists often resort\nto large-scale computation.\n\nOur project involved the development and application of numerical\nmethods to compute the properties of materials which exhibit\nnovel magnetic and transport properties, including, for example,\nsolids where the electron energy has an unusual relation on momentum,\nand others where there are regular or irregular sites with missing\natoms.\n\nThese studies are particularly challenging, and so we explored\nthe use of multicore processors to speed up the simulations.  Our codes\nnow can run more than ten times faster than previously, and allow\nus to address important new problems in the quantum properties of\nmaterials.  We achieved this speed-up through a collaborative\neffort of physicists and computer scientists.\n\nSeventeen research papers were published documenting the\nadvances in computational algorithms and their applications to\nsolid state physics.  Codes which were developed are available\nfor open use by the general scientific community.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate education were also a vital part of our\nproject.  Three advanced degrees (two in physics and one in computer\nscience) resulted from the work undertaken in this grant.\nUndergraduate students were co-authors on\nseveral of the research papers, and learned important\ncomputer and materials science skills .\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/08/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard T Scalettar"
