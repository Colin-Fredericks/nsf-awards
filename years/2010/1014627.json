A time-calibrated phylogeny is being used to test hypotheses of geographic and ecological change.\n\nThis dissertation research will advance our understanding of the evolution of biodiversity and global patterns of species richness.

Results from this research will provide a framework to address conservation concerns.\n\nThrough NSF\u00c6s program, East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute, a portion of this dissertation research was conducted in China, with my host, Dr. Xiao-Quan Wang at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Botany in Beijing.

It is particularly relevant to direct future research efforts in this area, where climate change may threaten the biodiversity of our high elevation plants. Moreover, ongoing collaborative efforts with researchers worldwide are imperative for addressing such issues on a global level.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/1..."
