The PIs plan a comprehensive survey of electrical and chemical engineering faculty; the project partners with the IEEE (electrical engineering) and AIChE (chemical engineering) professional societies to improve participation.  If successful, this research project will help provide the faculty perspective on barriers to broad adoption of research-proven pedagogies.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to understand, then ultimately lower, barrier to adoption of teaching techniques that have been proven to engage diverse audiences of engineering students.  While successful at improving retention and engagement of students, including those from under-represented groups, these techniques have not spread widely, and researchers do not yet have a clear understanding of why.",
