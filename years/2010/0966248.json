 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this IRES project supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the direction of Professor Alex Volinsky at the University of South Florida will participate in a collaborative engineering research effort with two German institutions, the Technical University in Dresden and Deutsches Elektronen-Synchotron (DESY) research center in Hamburg.  Over the course of three years a total of 15 U.S. students will work in teams on optimization and control of the thermomechanical stability of X-ray optics using both Finite Elements (FE) modeling and X-ray diffraction experiments.  The students will receive special training in thermomechanical modeling and X-ray diffraction prior to their international visit.  The international collaborators include Professor Dirk Meyer in Dresden and Professor Dmitri Novikov at DESY.\r\n\r\nHeating of X-ray optics is a major problem with synchrotrons and in-house X-ray sources, since it causes beam distortions and makes beam conditioning a challenging task.  Only one degree Celsius change in surface temperature significantly affects the diffracted X-ray beam wavelength, rendering it unusable.  Currently liquid nitrogen is used to cool diffraction-based synchrotron optics, but through design improvements and optimization the results of this project could help significantly to improve the thermomechanical stability of the X-ray optics without requiring such cumbersome operating conditions.  The students involved in this project will gain an invaluable research experience in an international setting, helping contribute to the development of a new generation of a skilled technical workforce with a multidisciplinary and global perspective.",
