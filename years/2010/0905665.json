In this project, we focus on design-time evaluation of architectures with respect to one key attribute: reliability.  The approach we pursue will enable an engineer to build a multi-faceted, hierarchical model of a system and assess its reliability in an incremental, scalable fashion.  Moreover, we particularly focus on the area of embedded systems.  Embedded systems present a rich target of opportunity for this work as (1) they demand close interplay of software and execution substrate; (2) they are often unencumbered with legacy concerns, allowing easier introduction and exploration of new techniques such as the one we propose; (3) they often have stringent and complex requirements, yet are seldom approached from a software architectural perspective.  An extensive evaluation of our research focuses on two measures of interest: tractability (intended to address scalability issues existing in real, complex systems) and sensitivity (intended to address issues of confidence in our predictions under numerous design-time uncertainties).",
