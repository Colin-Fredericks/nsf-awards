 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to enhance fabrication of devices based on compound semiconductors in areas related to energy, nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.  The approach is to acquire one inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactive ion etcher (RIE) for etching compound semiconductors and materials on compound semiconductors to augment the tool set available within the shared-access University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) shared-access Cleanroom Research Laboratory (CRL).  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project will close the gap in compound semiconductor applications, unify research and development in materials and devices, and allow teaming among university and industry researchers for a wide variety of application segments including communications, military, medical and energy.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The UTD CRL enables the research of over 160 users throughout UTD as well as academic researchers from other universities.  Hands-on experience with state-of-the-art equipment prepares students and post-docs to enter the workforce ready to engage in research, development, and manufacturing.  The breadth of functionally diverse materials, structures and devices enabled by this RIE will attract a broader pool of researchers beyond the current user base.  The PIs will develop a two lecture sequence for an undergraduate Nanotech Instrumentation course which will focus on facilitization of advanced research equipment using this new RIE as the example.  This represents a unique opportunity to directly show undergraduates how numerous disciplines are required to manufacture, install and operate advanced research equipment.",

The plumbing of numerous gases provides for a very flexible system which can etch numerous materials with different etch profile characteristics.  The system was ordered by UTD in November, 2010 and the system was delivered in July, 2011.\n\nThe new RIE was placed in the Metallization/Plasma Etch Bay of the UTD CRL.  In order to prepare the laboratory for the new RIE, a variety of fit-out activities occurred.  UTD purchased a new SDC gas cabinet for CH4 and HBr that was placed in the CRL gas storage bunker.  UTD also contracted SDC to modify existing gas cabinets (Cl2/BCl3/H2) with additional gas sticks for the new etcher.  Midas gas sensors, heater jackets for gas lines and gas regulators for non-toxic gases were procured by UTD.  Finally, TDIndustries was contracted to fit-out utilities for the system including electrical, exhaust, gas lines, vacuum, water, gas cabinets, and fire, life and safety systems as described in the attached quote.  System installation and connection was completed in August, 2011.  Following initial testing, the system was made available to the general CRL user base beginning in mid-September, 2011.\n\nSince that time, researchers have been actively using the RIE to perform cutting edge research in advanced nanoelectronic technology and energy harvesting.
