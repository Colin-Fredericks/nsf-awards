Ten students will be recruited annually for a 10-week summer research experience at the School of Polymers and High Performance Materials. The proposed research activities can be broadly classified into three general areas: (1) Synthesis of high performance polymer composite matrices, (2) Mechanical testing and performance of composites, and (3) Addition of fillers or nano-additives for material property enhancement.\r\n\r\nThere is a commercial and national need to develop high performance, lightweight materials for increased fuel efficiency and corrosion resistance. This REU Site provides REU participants access to state-of-the-art facilities to pursue fundamental research in critical areas. Undergraduate students participate in a comprehensive research and professional development program that encourages them to pursue scientific and engineering careers.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Divisions of Materials Research and of Chemistry.",

The students had a diverse background of undergraduate majors varying from biology (30%), chemistry (45%), chemical engineering (5%) and materials engineering (10%). Of the 63 participants, 25 were women and 10 were from underrepresented minority populations.  Finally, 56% of the students were from primary undergraduate institutions.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe research objectives centered on developing lightweight, energy efficient polymer composite materials to be used in next-generation aerospace, marine and defense components. The research initiatives can be broadly classified into three general areas: (1) Synthesis of high performance polymer composite matrices, (2) Mechanical testing and performance of composites, and (3) Addition of fillers or nano-additives for material property enhancement.  Students were required to spend 40 hours per week in the laboratory working with graduate students and faculty advisors on individual research projects.  These studies have resulted in six peer-reviewed publications and over 21 presentations at American Chemical Society (ACS) national meetings.  There are additional publications in progress, and there have been a number of additional presentations at regional meetings such as the Southeast/Southwest Regional ACS meeting, the Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation annual research conference and the Mississippi Academy of Sciences.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nIn addition to the research projects, students were provided introductory short courses administered by the participating faculty members. The curriculum was designed to provide necessary fundamental instruction in polymer science, laboratory safety, ethics and professionalism, and experimental techniques to prepare the students for their research activities.  Students participated in professional development activities designed to build leadership, communication, confidence, and teamwork skills.  These included an extensive teambuilding/problem solving workshop, presentation skills workshop, interview skills workshop.  Finally, the participants toured local composites facilities including the Huntington Ingalls Naval Composites Center of Excellence in Gulfport, MS and the Nissan facility in Canton, MS.\n\nThe REU program was a successful tool to build students\u00c6 confidence in performing and presenting their research.  At the beginning of their summer experience the REU students were asked to complete a pre- evaluation to personally rank their comfort level in the following areas:  (1) I am confident in my ability to work in a research lab, (2) Currently I am planning on pursuing graduate studies in science research (3) I am going to pursue a career in science (4) I have a comfortable level of knowledge about polymers and biopolymers (5) I feel comfortable giving presentations in front of a group (6) I feel comfortable developing PowerPoint.  At the end of the summer the students were asked to rank the same areas in their post-evaluation and the results showed a significant increase in all six areas.  Students commented that their fundamental knowledge of polymers and the skills they gained working with specific research techniques were most beneficial to their summer experience. \n\nPre- and post-REU experience surveys about attitudes toward scientific research showed that REU participants maintained a positive attitude about planning to pursue graduate studies and a career in science (average = 4.8 on a sca..."
