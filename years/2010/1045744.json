 "awd_abstract_narration": "National Geographic Television is creating multi-platform media to communicate the scientific and engineering stories unfolding in the Gulf region due to the major oil spill. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is one of the worst environmental disasters to occur in the U.S., and though traditional news outlets continue to report on the spill, there is little discussion about the scientific factors at play. They include the technology and engineering skills needed to stop the leak and contain the oil; the scientific and engineering efforts to mitigate its effects; and the potential impacts on the Earth system. Communicating these scientific and engineering concepts to the public is both critical and urgent. \r\n\r\nNational Geographic is uniquely positioned to take the lead in reporting on the science and engineering behind the spill and its implications.  Deliverables will include: a 60-minute \"Explorer\" documentary television program to air on the National Geographic Channels in September 2010; 16 weekly online \"Science Journal\" segments featuring interviews with scientists, engineers, and other experts, promoted through National Geographic's social media channels; ongoing online news coverage and blog reports from the Gulf region; and online content for children. Funding from the National Science Foundation will specifically support coverage of the yet-to-be-filmed science and engineering segments for the television program and digital content. \r\n\r\nThe television program and digital content will reach a broad public audience with critical science and engineering concepts. The entire project is designed to communicate scientific messages from the Gulf in real time and over the longer term, and in so doing, to enhance public understanding of science and engineering as it relates to the oil spill crisis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSUMMARY &ndash; PROJECT OUTCOMES / FINDINGS\n\nNational Geographic\u2019s mission is to inspire people to care about the planet.   With the award of the National Science Foundation\u2019s  (\"NSF\") Rapid Response funding, National Geographic (\"NG\") was able to create a body of work that not only directly contributed to National Geographic\u2019s mission, but also that of the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission by enhancing the public\u2019s understanding of the Deepwater Horizon crisis and providing documentation in multiple media formats of the scientific community\u2019s response to the disaster.  It may be many years before we know the full effects of the oil spill, however, it is evident from National Geographic\u2019s reporting that the effects of the oil spill have been far reaching, from across coastal marshlands and the insects that inhabit the region, to the larger creatures like crabs and fish that are ultimately consumed by humans.\n\nNational Geographic has covered the Deepwater Horizon spill since the initial event occurred on April 20th, 2010.   National Geographic Television created over 25 original news stories, photo galleries, quizzes, blog posts, over 15 Science Journal web videos, as well as a television program.  This body of work focused on a number of story elements, including the environmental, social and economic impact of the spill.  Specifically, scientists, some of whom were NSF Grantees, were featured in the news stories, Science Journal web videos and the television program to provide in-depth, on- the-ground, as it\u2019s happening coverage of their response to the spill. \n\nAmong NG\u2019s stories, we focused on 3 engineering research projects, giving Internet video exposure to a scientific discipline largely overlooked by the mainstream media, and rarely covered on commercial television newscasts. These videos helped promote specific universities involved in some of the research projects, and whose primary researchers may not have gotten public media exposure otherwise.  This Rapid Response funding allowed us to focus on the science behind the research, and get beyond the legal and political ramifications of the oil spill itself which were most often headlined by the mainstream media outlets.\n\nThese news stories have been released on National Geographic\u2019s distribution feeds worldwide in three different languages (Japanese, Italian and Spanish) in addition to English, and have been featured on National Geographic\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts, which collectively are read by 7 million \u2018fans\u2019.  The 15 NSF-funded Science Journal web videos are publicly available online and visible worldwide.  Combined, our Science Journal web videos (as of August 2, 2011) have collected 3,063,195 video views and continue to increase (Re: Omniture / Site Catalyst) since our first video was published September 1, 2010.  The television program was broadcast on National Geographic Channels, which is available in more than 70 million US. Homes.  National Geographic Channels International reaches approximately 300 million households in 167 countries in 34 languages.  The program was also distributed via DVD (retail &amp; direct buy), streaming via ITunes, Amazon.com, and Xbox.  This body of work has educated an international audience about the importance of research into one of the largest man-made disasters in world history.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nNational Geographic Television (NGT) is the documentary TV production arm of the National Geographic Society (NGS), known around the world for its remarkable visuals and compelling stories.   With 138 Emmy Awards and nearly 1,000 other industry accolades, including recognition from the Peabody Awards, DuPont Columbia Awards and highest honors from natural history film festivals, NGT programming can be seen globally on the National Geographic Channels, as well as terrestrial and other cable and satellite broadcasters worldwide through international sales by National Geographic Television International, and on U.S. public television stations.
