 "awd_abstract_narration": "THE OBJECTIVE of this research is to explore new avenues for nanoscale photonics and to improve fundamental understanding of physical (including quantum) operational principles of novel class of ultracompact photonic components. THE APPROACH is to develop theory, to numerically model and simulate functional properties of the proposed components and to investigate their potential capabilities. \r\n           INTELLECTUAL MERITS. The proposal implements an exotic property, backwardness, of electromagnetic waves in negative-index metamaterials, unique features of coherent nonlinear-optical coupling of ordinary and backward waves, counterintuitive effects of quantum interference and methods of quantum engineering. It presents unparallel, nonlinear-optical approach to compensating strong losses inherent to plasmonic metamaterials and to control light energy distribution and conversion across metafilms. Recent advances in design of bulk multilayered nanostructured metamaterials make such opportunities crucially important for creation of unique devices. \r\n           BROADER IMPACTS. This research contributes to synergetic interdisciplinary approach to nanotechnology-based, high priority, revolutionary breakthroughs in optical processing technologies. It will also greatly benefit educational efforts for introducing nano and device technologies to undergraduate students. The effort provides excellent opportunities for enhancing the curriculum of related courses in physics and chemistry and for addressing photonics and nanoengineering as the interdisciplinary science and technology areas. Special focus will be placed on incorporating students into a comprehensive computer-enhanced research program in the exciting field of modern electrical engineering and on disseminating its results to society. Interdisciplinary seminar series will be developed for undergraduate students to foster their motivation in learning and to broader their vision of contemporary science and technology.",
