 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in algebraic geometry is concerned with the solution sets \r\nto systems of algebraic equations, and it offers tools and models \r\nfor non-linear problems across the mathematical spectrum. It now \r\nhas numerous applications in the sciences and in engineering. This \r\nproject is aimed at four specific directions: Spectrahedra and \r\nOrbitopes, Algebraic Statistics, Tropical Geometry, and \r\nImplicitization of Higher-Dimensional Varieties.\r\n\r\nSpectrahedra and Orbitopes are fundamental objects in convex \r\nalgebraic geometry, an emerging interdisciplinary direction that \r\nfocuses on convex bodies with a distinguished algebraic representation.\r\nIt is driven by applications in convex optimization, especially in the \r\ntheory of semidefinite programming. The project will cement the \r\ndevelopment of convex algebraic geometry, and it will lead to new \r\nsemi-numerical algorithms for non-linear optimization problems with \r\na special algebraic structure. Such problems arise frequently in  \r\nAlgebraic Statistics. That area is concerned with statistical \r\nmodels that can be represented by polynomials in the model parameters. \r\nThese include graphical models for both Gaussian and discrete random variables.\r\nThe project will resolve fundamental questions concerning these models, and it\r\npromises novel computational tools for statistical inference. Tropical Geometry\r\nis a piecewise-linear version of algebraic geometry that is custom-taylored \r\nfor modeling applied problems. The project is aimed at key open problems on \r\nthe combinatorial side of the field. Implicitization in Higher Dimensions is\r\na new paradigm for computer algebra, and it will lead to new tools for finding\r\nthe defining equations of parametrically specified algebraic varieties.",
