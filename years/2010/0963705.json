The meeting focuses on three interrelated areas in theory and applications of fluid dynamics: (1) analysis of partial differential equations relating to fluid dynamics; (2) fluid motion driven by interfaces; and (3) computational methods for fluid dynamics.   \r\n\r\nThe conference features keynote addresses from leaders in the field and includes an extended poster session, where graduate students, postdocs, and faculty will present contributed poster presentations on their research; this is intended to be a central conference component to foster the interaction of participants across research areas and levels of experience. The conference brings together leading researchers to provide an authoritative overview of the current state of the field and new directions for further work for junior researchers.  Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.math.duke.edu/conferences/FAN2010/",
