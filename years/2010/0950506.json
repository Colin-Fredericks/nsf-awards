The focus of the conference is recent exciting developments and emerging future directions, particularly in such areas as representations of algebras, noncommutative algebraic geometry, homological and categorical techniques for Hopf algebras, and von Neumann regular algebras. One purpose of the conference is to generate new research in noncommutative algebra and related areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together a large number of participants, including the leading experts from different specialties within noncommutative algebra, encouraging interactions between participants from a broad range of perspectives and approaches. The organizers intend for this conference to create opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, young researchers, and mathematicians from underrepresented groups to communicate and receive feedback on their ideas. This conference will emphasize new ideas and  new developments and help to identify new directions in noncommutative algebra.\r\n\r\n",
