 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for a two-year study, initially involving a 42-day cruise to collect two high-resolution seismic profiles and near-bottom magnetic field data from the Hawaiian Lineation Jurassic Magnetic Quiet Zone (JMQZ) using an AUV. The PIs plan to obtain 800 km long magnetic profiles as well as local seismic reflection and refraction data using a portable multichannel seismic system and sonobuoys. Seismic data will allow them to evaluate whether the Jurassic crust has been affected by later intra-plate Cretaceous volcanism. This magnetic data will be compared to the previously studied JMQZ data from the Japanese Lineation. The latter reveals rapid reversal and decreasing field intensity as well as a period of apparently incoherent anomalies with short wave lengths and low amplitudes. If real and global (as opposed to a local bad signal) this low amplitude zone represents an very unusual field behavior in Earth?s magnetic field history. The new data from Hawaii and its comparison with Japanese results will allow testing the hypothesis that this unusual field behavior was indeed global, which has important implications for dynamics of the deep Earth and for the construction of a robust geomagnetic polarity time scale for the Mid-Jurassic period.\r\nBroader impacts include discovery while promoting teaching and training at sea for graduate and undergraduate students. Public outreach is also planned through internet and WHOI exhibits. The scientific results could have far reaching implications for Earth dynamics, magnetic field behavior and geomagnetic polarity time scale and useful to other workers in the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported a study of Jurassic age lithosphere with the primary goal of understanding the magnetic anomalies within the Jurassic Quiet Zone (JQZ), the oldest magnetic anomalies within Earth?s ocean basins.  The source of the unique characteristics of the JQZ anomalies has been a long-standing problem, with implications for the behavior of Earth?s geomagnetic field.  A secondary goal of this award is to seismically image Cretaceous-age magmatic additions to this Jurassic lithosphere, with the aim of distinguishing the magnetic influence of these secondary magmatic additions from the lineations recorded in the Jurassic-age crust.\n\nThe project involved a cruise in 2012 to acquire deep-towed magnetic data and surface-towed multi-channel seismic (MCS) and sonobuoy data.  There were difficulties with the submersible vehicle during the 2012, and so the magnetic-field objectives of this award have been pursued via a subsidiary grant that supported a second cruise in 2014.  The present award thus primarily supported the acquisition and analyses of the seismic data.\n\n The seismic data acquired on R/V Thomas G. Thomson cruise TN272 included an 800 km transect of high-resolution MCS data and wide-angle recordings from 50 sonobuoys deployed at a ~15-km spacing along that transect.  The MCS data reveal a spectrum of igneous features related to the Cretaceous  magmatic event that modified this Jurassic lithosphere, including seamounts, volcanic flows that emanated from these volcanic centers, and igneous sills emplaced within sediments (see figure).  These new data reveal interesting aspects related to these features, including lateral compression of sediments related to the growth of seamounts and conduits emanating from the ancient sills that appear to persist as active fluid-flow pathways that perturb the near surface thermal regime, as indicated by perturbations to the shallow opal A/C phase transition.\n\nResults derived from the sonobuoy data, complemented by gravity and flexural modeling, provide additional insight into crustal-scale magmatic additions.  A key finding from the sonobuoy data is a systematic thickening of oceanic Layer 2 over 100s of km that is difficult to relate to ridge processes.  If this thickening is a secondary, Cretaceous age magmatic addition, then this growth may have occurred via sill-like intrusions near the sediment/basement interface.  The areal extent of this thickening would then seem to imply a broad melt source and, thus, a diffuse mechanism of melt transport from the asthenosphere through the lithosphere.  At the same time, punctuated crustal growth in the form of seamounts probably reflects pipe-like transport through the lithosphere.   The sonobuoy results thus suggest that the igneous features imaged by the MCS data relate in functional ways to melt transport through the lithosphere.  An important implication of a diffuse transport mechanism is the scale of modification to the lithospheric mantle that is likely to result from a pervasive mantle melt network.  These modifications have implications for global-scale elemental cycles and processes that occur at convergent margins, including large magnitude, deep-focus earthquakes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Lizarralde"
