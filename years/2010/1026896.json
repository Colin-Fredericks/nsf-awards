 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a  scalable, compact and rapid ammonothermal method to grow high-quality, low-cost bulk gallium nitride (GaN) substrates.  A novel apparatus that is scalable to large volumes at modest cost will be utilized to achieve high-pressure, high-temperature conditions and grow single-crystal GaN.  This project is expected to demonstrate the synthesis of ultrapure raw material and the growth of high-quality bulk GaN crystals with excellent crystallinity, improved transparency, a diameter of at least 1 inch and a process capable of rapid scale-up to larger sizes.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to offer high-quality and significantly lower cost GaN substrates, which may enable their applications in next generation displays including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), green and blue laser diodes etc.  Bulk GaN substrates, currently in use for 405 nm laser diodes only and grown by a vapor-phase technique, are projected to be a $405 million market in 2010.  The availability of low-cost and high-quality bulk GaN substrates is anticipated to improve efficiency and reduce cost of GaN-based LEDs, which will enable a large reduction in electrical power consumption.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project a new method has been developed to grow single crystals of gallium nitride (GaN), a semiconductor material that has enabled blue and white light emitting diodes, as recently recognized by the award of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Gallium nitride also enabled Blu-RayTM optical storage and is an ideal material for power electronics.  Today, most GaN-based LEDs and power electronics utilize non-native substrates, such as sapphire or silicon, due to the relatively high cost of native GaN substrates.  Blu-RayTM technology, by contrast utilizes native substrates.  Soraa, Inc. (www.soraa.com) has demonstrated that native GaN substrates enable LEDs with 5x the light output per unit substrate area, which in turn enables LED lamps with state-of-the-art light quality at a competitive price.  GaN-on-GaN power electronics are in the early stages of development but also look extremely promising.\n\nThe cost of the native substrates, which are manufactured commercially by an expensive vapor-phase process, remains a significant obstacle, however.  In addition, improvements in crystal quality are needed for power electronics applications.  The new gallium nitride crystal growth method is adapted from that used to grow quartz crystals, which represent the second-largest (after silicon) single crystal market for electronic applications, by volume, and are very inexpensive.  More extreme conditions are required to grow gallium nitride crystals and a new type of reactor was invented that is suitable for large-scale manufacturing and allows access to extreme conditions, enabling high-rate growth of GaN crystals.  The new apparatus and method are shown schematically in Figure 1.\n\nDevelopment of a method for cost-effective manufacturing of gallium nitride single crystals has been a major world-wide focus since the mid 1990\u00c6s, when GaN-based LEDs and laser diodes first became available.  The crystal growth is difficult due to the intrinsic properties of this material.  Bulk gallium nitride crystals have been available commercially since 2003 but remain quite expensive and have significant quality issues.  The new method will enable cost-effective manufacturing of high-quality gallium nitride crystals for the first time and is expected to have a transformative impact on several classes of optoelectronic and electronic devices, including white LEDs and power electronics.\n\nThe main focus of this project was to develop large-area crystals and wafering capability.  As shown in Figure 2, the crystal diameter capability was successfully increased to 2 inches.\n\nAs a part of this project, Soraa developed a method to synthesis a raw material with greatly-improved purity, enabling growth of GaN crystals with best-in-the-world transparency, which is critically important for LED applications.  The optical absorption coefficient provides a quantitative measure for absorption of light by a material, and is zero for a perfectly transparent material.  As shown in Figure 3, the transparency of SCoRA GaN crystals improved greatly during the life of the project and is now similar or superior to that of the expensive vapor-phase-grown substrates over the wavelength ranging from 400 nanometers (violet) through 700 nanometers (red).\n\nAs another part of this project. Soraa has improved its capability for orienting, slicing, and polishing SCoRA GaN crystals into wafers suitable for manufacturing of LEDs or power electronic devices.  A partially-finished SCoRA wafer is shown in Fig. 2(b).  The final stage of wafering is so-called chemical-mechanical polishing, which provides an extremely smooth, clean surface, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nThe new gallium nitride substrates, with lower costs and improved quality after full-scale commercialization, will enable a new generation of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers for full-color displays, and high-performance power electronics.  These applications represent markets of more than $50 billion per year and have..."
