 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract:  This CAREER award by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Hairong Guan of the University of Cincinnati to study the kinetic and thermodynamic driving forces that control the reactivities of metal-hydrogen and metal-heteroatom bonds of nickel and iron complexes.  This mechanistic information is used to design efficient and selective catalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol as well as various other organic transformations.  The proposed research may lead to the development of homogeneous catalysis with non-precious metals and should provide significant benefits for the energy and medicinal chemistry fields.  \r\n \r\nIn addition to training undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis, Professor Guan creates a high-achieving, learning environment for his students.  His participation in the University of Cincinnati Woman in Science and Engineering Program and the American Chemical Society Project SEED Program helps in the recruitment and retention of women and other underrepresented minorities in science.  The establishment of teaching and research collaborations with primarily undergraduate institutions enhances the learning experiences for students from the University of Cincinnati and collaborating colleges.  The engagement of local chemical companies in education and research activities facilitates student career development and strengthens the workforce pipeline for the chemical industry. \r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract:  This CAREER award by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Hairong Guan of the University of Cincinnati in the study of new environmentally-friendly and sustainable catalytic reactions.  To meet the global energy and resource demand in a sustainable fashion, chemists need to develop catalytic reactions that use less energy and more renewable or readily-available materials.  In the past few decades, research has focused on the use of expensive and scarce metal-based catalysts (e.g., gold, platinum, and palladium), while inexpensive metals, such as nickel and iron, received much less attention.  This project examines the factors that influence the reactivity of these more abundant metals with carbon dioxide.  A variety of products that are useful in energy, medicine and building materials are formed.  The investigation of new ways of using of carbon dioxide may help use to reduce global warming.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training undergraduate and graduate students, Professor Guan is active in the recruitment and retention of women and other underrepresented minorities in science.  He establishes collaborations with primarily undergraduate institutions that enhance the learning experiences of students from the University of Cincinnati and collaborating colleges.  He also invites local chemical companies to interact with his students and this enables the students to gain industrial experience firsthand.",
