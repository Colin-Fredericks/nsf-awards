In studies of animal locomotion, this relationship has typically been examined in the context of a single, isolated function that is easy to elicit and measure, such as forward locomotion at a steady speed, without any clear indication of how important this function is for animals in the wild.  A more complete understanding of the role of particular body structures can be gained by examining their effect on performance during complex, demanding locomotory behaviors that are known to affect an animal's survival or reproductive success.  The current study will demonstrate this approach through integrated analyses of the biomechanics, behavior and performance of dragonflies hunting aerial prey.  Studies will be conducted in a novel, outdoor artificial dragonfly habitat, in which natural predatory behaviors can be elicited reliably from known individuals, and filmed with a high-speed multi-camera system to reconstruct three-dimensional body motions.  This will be the first project to explore the mechanical determinants of aerial predation, one of the most challenging and complex behaviors performed by flying animals.  Through a series of manipulations, the work will provide a better understanding of the effects of body mass distribution, wing flexibility, and wing damage on flight performance.  In addition, the project will train several undergraduate and high school students in basic experimental and field techniques, while providing data on prey capture rates and the effectiveness of wild dragonflies in controlling mosquito populations.",
