McClung (University of Arkansas/USDA-ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center)\r\n\r\nKey Collaborator(s): Stefan Einarson (Cornell University) and Lewis H. Ziska (USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center)\r\n\r\nThis project will establish a joint forward-reverse genetics platform to facilitate the utilization of wild and exotic genetic materials in plant improvement and to accelerate the pace of discovery of genes and gene networks underlying transgressive variation in rice. Transgressive variation occurs in crosses between genetically divergent parents where offspring outperform the better parent. The nature of transgressive variation is that an individual locus' effect is dependent on other loci in the genetic background. Thus, the genetic dissection of transgressive variation necessitates modeling explicit gene interactions.  Over the course of this project, models of genotype by genotype interaction(s) will be developed and validated, information that is key to manipulating non-additive genetic variation that can rapidly propel significant improvements in plant yield, adaptation and quality.  In addition, this project will create a comprehensive genomics platform using wild and exotic rice germplasm to accelerate the pace of discovery of genes and gene networks underlying transgressive variation in rice for plant improvement.  Specific objectives are to (1) re-sequence 30 diverse Oryza rufipogon accessions for the development of a 600K SNP chip for rice; (2) phenotype an expanded panel of wild and exotic rice germplasm for resistance to selected biotic and abiotic stresses; (3) create genetic materials for use in association mapping analyses and to rapidly translate discoveries into plant breeding applications; and, (4) develop integrated analysis techniques aimed at detecting non-additive genetic architecture associated with transgressive variation.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the breadth and depth of genotypic and phenotypic variation within the rice gene pool and to empower the rice community to efficiently translate this knowledge into practical applications in plant improvement. Educational outreach activities will provide diverse opportunities for interdisciplinary, hands-on learning for high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral fellows with emphasis on groups that are currently under-represented in science.  The project will also continue and expand the 3-week Rice:Research to Production field-course in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (the Philippines).  All of the data, germplasm and genomic resources developed on this project will be publicly available through project websites (www.ricediversity.org and www.ricesnp.org), the Gramene database (www.gramene.org), the International Rice Germplasm Center (IRGC), and the Genetic Stocks Center Oryza (GSOR) (www.gsor.gov).",
