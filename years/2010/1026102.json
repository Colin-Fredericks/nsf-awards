California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA), one of the 22 California State University campuses in CSU-LSAMP served as the \"graduate institutional site\" for this BD Activity.

This model, which provides financial, academic and professional development support at the Masters level, has proven successful in recruiting, retaining, and advancing talented minority students who, otherwise, would be unlikely to pursue doctoral level study.

For these students, the MA/MS program serves as a necessary \"bridge\" to doctoral-level study.\n\nClearly, there is a great interest on the part of graduates of LSAMP programs for a Master\u00c6s level Bridge to the Doctorate of the type offered by CSU-LSAMP.  Recruitment efforts yielded a total of 82 applications for the 12 slots. The final cohort included students from five different campuses with LSAMP programs.

The project was also successful in recruiting students from a diversity of STEM disciplines.  Among the 12, there were three chemistry majors; four biology; one civil engineering; one chemical engineering; two physics; and one biochemistry major. All 12 BD-Scholars self-identified as Hispanic.\n\nAt the end of the two-year project period, 92% (11/12) of the LSAMP BD Scholars were continuing in STEM graduate study. Of these students, 45% (5/11) have begun PhD programs at research intensive universities; and 55% (6/11) are continuing in their Cal State LA MS program and will apply for fall 2013 admission to PhD programs.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juanita C Barrena"
