 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines whether the polarization of American politics by race and racial attitudes continues or has become irrelevant to citizen's political evaluations.  In particular, four specific areas are examined to advance our understanding of racial dyanics in American politics.  These include the impact of racial attitudes on evaluations of the president, the potential spillover of racial attitudes on issues seen as related to the president, the possible reorganization of partisan politics around attitudes toward outgroups, and the the president's effect on racial attitudes.  Race is probably the most visceral issue in American public life.  As such, increased polarization of the electorate along the lines of race and racial attitudes would likely make it more difficult to achieve common ground on public policy.  Understaning if and how racial attitudes have changed over time will help with our understanding of how to achieve common ground on public policy.\r\n\r\nThe research design of re-interviewing at least 3000 respondents from the 2007-2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP) in the fall of 2010 and the spring of 2011 is singulary situated to capture these dynamics in American politics.  Because the original CCAP contained excellent meausures of racial and ethnocentric attitudes before the 2008 election, this research can determine how these attitudes continute to affect assessments of the president as well as how his presidency may be influencing underlying belifies about outgroups.  Similarly, this research can determine how the impact of racial dispositions on issue positions and party identification changed since 2008 without having to worry about the respondents' underlying attitudes changing in order to rationalize their partisanship and policy preferences.  Finally the large sample size allows us to separately assess political changes amongst subgroups like African-Americans, Latinos and first-time voters who figure to become increasingly important in the years ahead.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe major goals of this project were to identify the effects of Barack Obama's presidency on racial politics in America.  More specifically, we sought to examine the following: 1) How would racial and ethnocentric attitudes influence mass assessments of Barack Obama through out his presidency? 2) How would Obama influence Americans' underlying racial attitudes? 3) Would Obama's presidency spark a renewed organization of mass politics around racial attitudes and race? 4) How would Obama's presidency influence the political opinions of such key subgroups as Blacks, young adults, and Latinos? \n\nIn addition to these specific goals of testing racial dynamics in American politics during Obama's presidency, we also sought to study other changes in American politics that would inevitably occur during this time period.  Simply put, what were the sources of continuity and change during Obama's presidency?\n\nTo answer these questions we conducted three national surveys, two of which reinterviewed 3,000 respondents in 2011 and 2012 who were currently surveyed during the 2008 campaign.\n\nOur  project produced the following significant results: 1) The effect of racial attitudes on mass assessments of Barack Obama remained remarkably stable from 2007-2012.  2) Consistent with those robust results, our experimental efforts to either enhance or deactivate the influence of racial attitudes in mass assessments of Obama turned up null.  3)  While Obama's presidency lead to a sharp increase in the number of both black and white Americans who were optimistic about racial progress, white attitudes about African-Americans--stereotypes, affect, and racial resentmet--were virtually unchanged at both the individual and aggregate levels from before to after Obama's rise to prominence.  4) Policies easily connectable to Obama's presidency such as health care, top-bracket tax increases, and gay marriage, became more strongly influenced by racial attitudes after Obama's position was publicized than they were beforehand.  5) Moreover, several policies became more influenced by racial attitudes when they were experimentally attributed to Obama than they were when the exact same policies were framed as being proposed by white Democrats. 6) Our original data collected for this project further revealed that 2010 and 2012 congressional vote choices were more polarized by racial resentment than they were in 2008.  7)  Similarly, cross sectional data from on of our surveys showed that midterm vote choices were also more polarized by old fashioned racism and anti-Muslim attitudes than they were in prior elections, with evaluations of Obama transmitting that enhanced influence.  8)  Aggregate election returns from 2010 were also more polarized by the district's level of racial conservatism, as measured in the 2006-2008-2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (pooled n ~ 250 per district), than it was in 2002 and 2006.  9) The correlation between several measures of racial attitudes and party identification is now stronger than it was at any time on record, with that enhanced relationship once again mediated by evaluations of Barack Obama.  10) Moreover, racial attitudes were a strong and significant predictor of individual level changes in party identification between 2007 and 2012, despite the fact that racial resentment did not predict changes in white Americans' party identifications in four different panel studies conducted between 2000 and 2008.  11) The black and white divide in Democratic Party identification, which was thought to be on the decline before Obama's rise to prominence, increased by about 5 percentage points since late 2007.  12) Obama's endorsement of a number of policies, ranging from health care, to gay marriage, to drone strikes, significantly increases black support for those policies.  13) The growing racialization of American politics discussed above is especially strong among white Americans under the age of 30, who as a group did ..."
