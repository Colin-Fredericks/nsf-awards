 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project investigates scaffolding strategies that can promote (a) growth in reasoning abilities, (b) understanding of the nature of science, and (c) conceptual change on topics in middle school life science.  Specifically, it focuses on a type of scaffold--epistemic criteria of quality--that has the potential to produce large gains in student learning. Teachers and students in two highly diverse New Jersey urban middle schools will participate in the study.\r\n\r\nThis project undertakes three experiments that will: (1) provide evidence for the efficacy of these scaffolds, and (2) illuminate classroom mechanisms by which the scaffolds improve student learning. Oral data, written artifacts from class discussions, group work, and individual student work will be gathered.  Pretest and delayed posttest data will be collected from individuals and pairs, assessing their epistemic understanding, mastery of epistemic criteria, reasoning, and conceptual understanding. Assessments will address both near and far-transfer. Analyses will identify mechanisms by which different scaffolds have their effects. A project website will make available the instructional interventions, annotated narratives illustrating students and teachers working on key components of the modules, a variety of annotated student models and arguments, and video recordings of excerpts from workshops that the Principal Investigators conduct.",

Such reasoning involves the careful evaluation of competing explanations in light of evidence, critical thinking about evidence, and respectful argumentation about the merits and shortcomings of models, explanations, and evidence. The reasoning strategies promoted by PRACCIS are also a central focus of the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013), and thus our materials are well aligned with the new vision for science education advocated by these standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>To promote growth in students&rsquo; reasoning as well as conceptual understanding of science, we have developed a series of model-based inquiry units (ranging from one to seven weeks) that engage students in model-evidence coordination as they learn core scientific concepts and practices. The instructional units focus on content topics that students learn as a regular part of their seventh-grade curriculum, such as cell organelles, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, mitosis, food webs, and natural selection (see Figure 1 for an example of a student-generated model of natural selection of small headed Red-Bellied Black Snakes). The learning units are structured around interesting phenomena, driven by meaningful questions, and are data-rich (often requiring students to integrate data they collect though hands-on experiments with the data of others). In order to support students in the ambitious task of working with evidence to generate and evaluate explanatory models, we have developed a suite of scaffolds that include:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; class-generated criteria for good models and good evidence that students use as shared norms to guide their development and evaluation of models (see Figure 2);</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp; the Model-Evidence-Link (MEL) matrix, which is a representation that supports students as they consider how each piece if evidence relates (e.g. supports, contradicts, is irrelevant) to one or more models providing competing explanations of the phenomenon in question (see Figure 3);</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; a scale to rate the quality of evidence that is used to help students critically evaluate each piece of evidence and that encourages discussion of strengths and weaknesses of methods used;</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp; an argumentation rubric that students use to guide them as they write evidence-based arguments.</p>\n<p>These scaffolds work together to make the reasoning strategies that expert scientists use more explicit and structured so that they are accessible to novice science learners. They also support rich argumentation among students about models and evidence.</p>\n<p>Our outcomes to date provide evidence for the efficacy of the scaffolds that we have developed in promoting growth in students&rsquo; reasoning.&nbsp; In addition, we have found that students are creative in generating scientific ideas to explain evidence and that they reason effectively to achieve consistency among the evidence and between evidence and models.&nbsp; Students engage readily in argumentation about the quality of evidence and improve in their ability to recognize and discount low-quality evidence. Figure 4 provides an example of a student written argument about whether it is possible for humans to be genetically resistant to HIV (it is!). The student properly recognized that the account of a lab assistant in an HIV-clinic, claiming that he has never met anyone who was HIV resistant individual, was problematic because HIV resistant individuals would not frequent an HIV clinic and because this evidence was not a scientific study.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts </strong></p>\n<p>PRACCIS also supports teachers, through extensive professional development in creating a classroom environment in which critical thinking, collaboration, and respectful argumentation are the norm. Students learn that science is a creative process that values evidence and reasoning. The classroom operates as a learning community in which everyone (including the teacher) can contribute to knowledge that the community develops and shares. The student-centered focus of PRACCIS learning environments supports all students in ambitious scientific reasoning and helps them learn that everyone can be successful in scientific inquiry. As part of our research, we have worked closely with over 20 teachers from six districts, and have also engaged in various outreach and professional development activities with over 250 teachers both locally and nationally, including webinars and workshops provided under the auspices of the National Science Teacher Association. We have also used PRACCIS materials in our teacher education programs to help secondary science pre-service teachers learn how to teach using the model-based inquiry approach. Having models of instructional materials, examples of student work, and video of classroom instruction can greatly help pre-service teachers develop a working understanding, along with a toolset of instructional strategies, for ambitious instruction aligned with the NGSS vision of three dimensional teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/09/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ravit&nbsp;G&nbsp;Duncan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1008634/1008634_10020502_1483995809945_1008634OutcomesreportFigure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1008634/1008634_10020502_1483995809945_1008634OutcomesreportFigure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1008634/1008634_10020502_1483995809945_1008634OutcomesreportFigure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
