Four topic clusters are the focus: (1) Green products and materials, (2) Information and communication technology and associated problems of e-waste management, (3) Urban metabolism and environmental management, and (4) infrastructure and large scale systems.  Because of feedback gathered from past conference surveys requesting increased student participation, this year's conference will include the first associated Gordon-Kenan Research Seminar (GKRS) prior to the start of the conference itself.  The GKRS is organized by graduate students and post-docs wit the support of leading scientists and engineers and is designed to provide a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment for researchers early in their careersto present their work in talks and poster sessions.  The conference promotes broad participation from a diverse background, both through speaker selection and special GRC funding mechanisms that target underrepresented groups.",
