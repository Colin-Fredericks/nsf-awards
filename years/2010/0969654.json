 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is centered on experiments addressing fundamental issues of nuclear physics. An experiment is being designed to search for the neutron electric dipole moment, an observable that violates the reversal of time and plays an important role in descriptions of elementary particle physics and on the observed asymmetry of matter and anti-matter in the universe. Another experiment will measure second order effects in electron-proton scattering to address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there are on-going experiments with cold neutrons measuring neutron decay parameters and the strength of the weak interaction among quarks.\r\n\r\nThe activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the ASU's technical workforce and that of the society at large.",
