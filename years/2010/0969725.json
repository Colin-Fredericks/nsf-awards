 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is a continuation of fundamental experiments in quantum optics using superconducting integrated circuits. Based on the paradigm of \"circuit QED\" developed by the PI's group, in which superconducting qubits are combined with microwave transmission line resonant cavities to realize the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model with ultra-strong coupling, the team is pursuing the generation, manipulation, and measurement of non-classical states of the electromagnetic field. Using the tools developed for quantum information processing with superconducting devices, we have developed a new \"two-cavity\" circuit architecture during the current funding period. Here a single qubit, which provides nonlinearity, is combined with two microwave cavities, allowing new possibilities for nonlinear optics at the single quantum level. The main goal with this architecture was to develop a quantum non-demolition measurement capable of detecting single microwave photons. The team has experiments showing that they can indeed perform several repeated measurements on single photons. The main thrust of the continuation program will therefore be to characterize and understand this quantum measurement, and to observe single quantum jumps of the field in their solid-state system. This measurement capability can then be used to study the backaction of the measurement, observe the collapse of the cavity wavefunction, prepare nonclassical states by measurement post-selection, and investigate quantum control and feedback on few photon states.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work is that it will open a new area for fundamental studies of the quantum measurement of the electromagnetic field, as well as develop new technology for integrated circuits which operate at the single quantum level. The experiments that will be performed employ the novel features of the circuit QED system to observe and study phenomena that are mostly inaccessible with traditional AMO systems in quantum optics. The techniques and capabilities for single photon generation and detection could have major impact on the prospects for scalable quantum computation and communication in these superconducting circuits and also atomic/condensed matter hybrid systems such as ion and molecule chips. This project will also continue the trend established by earlier work to forge new connections between the atomic and condensed matter physics communities. This research will take advantage of the infrastructure and technical knowledge for fabrication and measurement of superconducting devices developed as part of the large, applied effort for development of quantum computing at Yale, but allows new and distinct directions of fundamental physical interest.",
