 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Delaware State University (DSU) to provide undergraduate research training in molecular genetics and genomics for nine weeks to 10 students each year, for the summers of 2010-2013. The scientific focus of this research program is the use of genetics, molecular biology, and genomics tools to bring together and understand diverse areas of biological sciences.  The program offers a unique opportunity to use this common thread to train undergraduate students with interests in various fields of biology and to expose them to potential applications in their respective fields of interest.  The program includes training in state-of-the-art research techniques and instrumentation in molecular biology and genomics by means of an initial methods workshop, a microarray/next generation sequencing and bioinformatics workshop, ethics training, and interaction with various levels of researchers in academia, government, and industry. Students will have the opportunity to work on specific research problems under the supervision of faculty mentors, while developing capabilities to work both individually and as part of a team with fellow students.  Students are expected to participate in all individual research projects and team activities that will conclude with a research symposium, and in surveys required for tracking of progress after completion of the program.  Students are expected to maintain laboratory notebooks that document their research experiments, and conduct their research responsibly.  The REU program will conclude with a DSU-wide Student Research Symposium where REU students present posters, and showcase their summer research to faculty, students, family, friends, high school students and teachers. Students for this program will be recruited from the biotechnology program at Delaware Technical and Community College, biology program at Wesley College, biology, agriculture and natural resources at Delaware State University and biology and related fields from other institutions nationwide.  Student progress in scientific careers and research after completion of the REU program will be tracked by the use of a common assessment tool.  Interested students are invited to visit http://cars.desu.edu/reu, contact the Project Director, Dr. Venu (Kal) Kalavacharla (phone: 302-857-6492 ; email vkalavacharla@desu.edu), or alternatively contact the Center for Integrated Biological and Environmental Research (CIBER) at Delaware State University, Dover, DE 19901 at (302) 857-6453.",
