 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a small workshop proposal to bring together Yup'ik scientists and educators with their Saami colleagues in Norway for a 3 day workshop to explore mathematics in a cultural context. The workshop will examine Yup'ik and Saami mathematical systems through their connections to practice, epistemology, and cosmology. The PI, Dr. Jerry Lipka, has been working with Yup'ik elders and teachers for several years exploring the cognitive processes behind everyday tasks or problems such as: making a pattern for clothing, a process that not only involves geometry and mathematics but encompasses Yup'ik cosmology and cultural epistemology. The purpose of the workshop is to work together with Saami people to explore the possibility of an Arctic \"indigenous\" cognitive process that can be understood through mathematical principles.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will take place at the Sami University College in Kautokeino, Norway. There is an expected 10-15 participants, including scholars from Taiwan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand at their own expense. In addition to the workshop the participants will be attending the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium meetings August 24th-26th.",
