 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  Attic pottery - the iconic red- and black-figure pottery produced in ancient Greece from the 6th to 4th centuries B.C.  - represents the pinnacle of ancient ceramic craftsmanship and is considered one of the first precision ceramic technologies.  However, the means by which ancient craftsmen produced these remarkable vessels is still not completely understood.  A new collaborative project between the Getty Conservation Institute, Stanford University/SLAC National Accelerator Facility and The Aerospace Corporation will study the chemical and physical makeup of these ancient ceramics at an unprecedented level of detail using state-of-the art high-resolution analytical technologies.  The results are expected to significantly advance the knowledge of the materials and methods used to create Attic pottery and to provide new insights into ancient workshop practices, thereby impacting a diverse range of fields including materials science, chemistry, archaeology, art history and art conservation.  A post-doctoral researcher supported as part of this grant will receive a uniquely integrated experience in cultural heritage, academic, and industrial laboratories, thus helping train the next generation of scientists to conduct research at the interface between science and art.  In addition, integrated outreach programs will be developed to educate and inform students at all levels - and the general public - regarding how science can contribute to our understanding of one of the most important ancient civilizations in Western human history.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The materials and methods used by ancient craftsmen to create the red- and black-figure vessels known as Attic pottery are being studied by a multidisciplinary team consisting of cultural heritage, industrial, and academic research scientists, art conservators and art historians.  They are measuring the composition, morphology and chemical state distribution of iron minerals comprising the ceramic slips using the high-resolution techniques of laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, inclusive of x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)), x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS).  Correlating the data with stylistic analyses, the team are evaluating whether ancient artisans employed deliberately engineered clay compositions and/or complex kiln firing regimens.  As part of this effort, they are refining a sub-100 nm XANES microscopy technique for the study of ceramic materials, providing a means of coupling chemically-specific information with micro-imaging.   Once mature, this technology will be available to all users of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, thus enhancing the studies of a wide variety of heterogeneous materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow did the ancient Athenians produce their iconic black- and red-figure pottery (Figure 1), with decorations created by glossy black surfaces over a contrasting red body?  That was the question addressed in this study, carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, conservators and art historians from the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), The Aerospace Corporation, the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), Northwestern University and the J. Paul Getty Museum. The team looked at examples of ancient pottery produced in Athens from the 6th through the 4th centuries B.C. using high resolution analytical techniques that measured the composition, morphology and mineralogy of the clay slips.  The project has advanced our understanding of ancient ceramic technology, but it has also served as an example of how collaboration between cultural heritage, academic and industrial scientists can foster new ways of thinking and provide unique and rich learning experiences for the next generation of scientists.\n\nAt first glance, the chemistry appears deceptively simple.  Depending on the temperature and atmosphere (oxidizing versus reducing) of the kiln during firing, the iron-containing clay slips used to paint the decorations on these vessels either were oxidized to forms that are red in color (hematite, &alpha;-Fe2O3, or maghemite, &gamma;-Fe2O3), or reduced to forms that are black (hercynite, FeAl2O4, or magnetite, Fe3O4).  However, our findings revealed that the specific minerals that are formed, and in what order, is anything but simple.  Synchrotron&ndash;based x-ray absorption spectroscopic studies determined the oxidation states of the iron-containing minerals on a micro-scale, providing information about the atmosphere in the kiln during firing.  High-resolution imaging by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and micro-x-ray tomography allowed the morphology of individual mineral grains to be studied, providing insight into the firing temperatures.  Comparison of results from ancient vessels with those obtained from modern replicates produced under controlled conditions helped the team determine the temperature and atmosphere in the kiln, and the number of firing cycles, that were used in the production of the ancient vessels.  The most significant finding from this research, which looked at dozens of examples of ancient pottery, was the emergence of evidence that multiple firings were employed, challenging the long-held belief that a single, three stage (oxidation &ndash;reduction &ndash; oxidation) firing was used.\n\nFor example, one study looked at a fragment of a red-figure vessel attributed to the painter Kleophrades (Figure 2).  The black gloss decoration was created using three different applications of black gloss: a relief line (to create fine details), a contour line (to define the general outline of the figure) and the background. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the clay particles in the relief line were significantly more melted than those in the adjacent contour or background areas, suggesting two separate painting/firing cycles: first the relief line was painted and fired, then the contour and background areas were painted, and fired again. \n\nAnother study looked at a fragment from a vessel by the Berlin painter that contained a complex stratigraphy of gloss: over the ceramic body was a layer of red gloss, over which was a layer of black gloss.  How could a reduced (black) layer be produced over an oxidized (red) glossy layer?  The answer was found by looking at the specific form of the iron-containing minerals in the glossy slips.  Utilizing facilities at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, subtle, but important differences in the iron minerals in the different layers were revealed.  Combined with data collected on replicate samples fired under known conditions, the team reconstructed the firing..."
