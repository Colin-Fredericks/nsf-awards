 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although hydrothermal vent systems have been intensively studied at mid-ocean ridges where ocean crust is being created, few such studies have been carried out in back arc basin spreading systems where crust is being subducted back into the mantle.  This research assesses the chemical evolution of hydrothermal activity and its linkages to associated vent biology in one such back arc basin spreading center in the East Lau Basin.  A unique series of time series fluid samples that were collected in 2009 will be analyzed for a variety of geochemical and isotopic species, including magmatic volatile species.  These data will be combined with temperature measurements to examine the effect of acid volatiles on the evolution of hydrothermal systems overlying silicic magmas and how this influences the mobilization of metals.  It will also be used to examine the role of seawater circulation in the ocean crust and its impact on the removal of CO2 via mineral precipitation.  Broader impacts of the work include the support of an early career scientist, involvement of faculty and undergraduates from a college that serves economically struggling urban centers in southeastern Massachusetts, and engaging undergraduates involved in local summer sea-going programs.  Hands-on learning modules for K-8 students will be created.",
