 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lithosphere is the Earth's rocky outer shell. Lithospheric 'plates' drift over the Earth, carrying the continents, and large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur where the plates interact. Hence, understanding the lithosphere is central to our understanding of how the Earth works. The oceanic lithosphere, which covers some 70% of the Earth, is central to our understanding of global geodynamics and plate tectonics, but our understanding of its character (including composition and thickness) and the factors that control them is poor. Variations of seismic and electrical properties of the Earth are indicators of compositional variations. The aim of this project is to use the most up-to-date seismic and electromagnetic methods to address two fundamental questions about the lithosphere that lies beneath the Pacific basin: What factors control the seismic structure of the lithosphere, and what defines the base of the lithosphere? The broader impacts of this work include improved understanding of factors such as the composition of the lithosphere that affect volcanic eruptions, great earthquakes and tsunamis that threaten  heavily populated areas in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and elsewhere around the Pacific Rim.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhat is a plate?  How does it interact with the underlying asthenosphere, and what controls that interaction? These questions are central to our understanding of plate tectonics and global geodynamics, but we have poor knowledge of basic lithospheric properties in even very simple geological settings, far from the complexity of plate boundaries.  In this project we are conducting a comprehensive data-collection and analysis effort designed to significantly advance our understanding of the structure and evolution of oceanic plates.  Using the research vessels R/V Marcus G. Langseth and R/V Melville, we combined an active-source seismic refraction experiment, a passive-source broadband ocean-bottom seismometer (BB OBS) deployment, and a seafloor electromagnetic (MT) experiment to characterize a 600x400-km swath of mature Pacific lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere in unprecedented detail.\n\nThe field experiment was remarkably successful.  Wide-angle refraction data recorded on 34 short-period OBS indicated a complex lithospheric structure with remarkably strong, depth-dependent seismic anisotropy arising due to rock fabric emplaced at the ridge.  This rock fabric provides a fingerprint of the deformation that occurred both as the plate formed, and as it moves over the underlying mantle.  Seismic surface waves from earthquakes recorded across 16 broadband OBS indicate that the strength of the rock fabric peaks within the lithosphere, and then falls off dramatically in the low-velocity asthenosphere.  There is then a secondary peak in apparent fabric at about 250 km depth, near the base of the seismic low velocity zone.  The direction of anisotropy, along with the pattern of anisotropic strength, indicates that flow beneath the lithosphere is driven either by pressure-gradients or small-scale buoyancy forces within an asthosopheric channel.  This flow is stronger than simple drag produced by the motion of the plate over the asthenosphere, which has been widely inferred as a dominant process based on global models, but is not clearly observed in this region.  Average seismic velocities and electrical conductivity estimates both suggest that the asthenospheric channel is weakened by modestly high temperatures and perhaps a small amount of volatiles (H2O or C02), but is not consistent with a high degree of partial melt.  These results present a unique, new estimate of the current state of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system, and it\u00c6s relationship to mantle flow.  They represent only the first-order conclusions &ndash; detailed modeling is still underway by collaborators at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of the lithospheric structure and the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition.\n\nThe intellectual merit of these activities is two-fold.   First, the integrated seismic and electromagnetic models provide an unprecedented perspective on plate evolution and it\u00c6s association with the major dynamic circulation driving plate tectonics.  Second, the seafloor data represent a rare and valuable resource that are now openly available to researchers for exploring other major questions of earth structure and dynamics.  In terms of broader impacts, the seafloor instrumentation utilized offers new opportunities for understanding the nature of human hazard associated with earthquakes and tsunami, and this experiment provides an excellent demonstration of the quality of such observations and their scientific utility.  Finally, the project provided important training on seafloor instrumentation and associated scientific analyses for students and post-docs at Lamont and the collaborating institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James B Gaherty"
