 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nThe I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program (I3BSC) will build bridges from the undergraduate\r\nto graduate levels for traditionally underrepresented (UR) students.\r\nI3BSC focuses on the mathematical and physical sciences (MPS) in an effort to open the door for\r\nstudents from diverse backgrounds to key fields of modern science, in which underrepresentation\r\nof both ethnic minorities and women of all ethnicities is long-standing and remains severe. New\r\nbridges to and into the beginning years of graduate training will be built on research experiences\r\nof increasing intensity for undergraduates and incoming graduate students. The research activities\r\nwill be fortified with systematic access to structured academic enrichment and professional\r\ndevelopment opportunities and resources, as well as a network of peers, near peers and scientists\r\nwho are further advanced on the academic pathway and will serve as mentors.\r\nI3BSC targets the transition into graduate school for undergraduates in their junior and senior\r\nyears and through the first two years of doctoral study. It focuses on the advancement of students\r\ninto MPS careers, particularly academic careers, incorporating and also going beyond the goals of\r\nretention in science majors and completion of degrees.\r\nI3BSC?s approaches lend themselves to study and evaluation. We will examine if and how the\r\nvariety and frequency of interventions effects UR advancement in science and the influence of\r\nparticular interventions. For example, the mentoring aspect of the project will provide a unique\r\nwindow into learning how mentoring affects not only the mentee, but also the mentor. While\r\nthere is a growing set of literature around instructional beliefs and practices within the classroom\r\nthere is little published about this more informal aspect of academic life.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nI3BSC is designed to take the highly effective work of four separate NSF programs that now work\r\nindependently from each other at Berkeley, each operating with different MPS disciplinary foci\r\nand targeting different points on the educational pathway. I3BSC extends each of the four\r\napproaches to make them more uniformly and consistently available for all UR students at UC\r\nBerkeley who are majoring in any of the MPS departments at Berkeley or are entering any of our\r\nMPS doctoral programs.\r\nI3BSC will create new synergies that extend the work of these four key NSF-supported programs:\r\nBerkeley?s NSF-California Alliance for Minority Participation Program (CAMP), which supports\r\nstudents across STEM fields in undergraduate research experiences, community building and\r\nprofessional development; Berkeley?s NSF-AGEP program, The Berkeley Edge, which increases\r\nURM doctoral degree production, and advances PhD students and post-doctoral fellows to\r\nprofessorial careers; a NSF-supported program for mentoring lower-division students in Physics,\r\nthe Compass and Society for Women in the Physical Sciences joint mentoring program; The\r\nNSF-Explorations in Statistics Research Program, which is an intensive week-long program for\r\nundergraduates to explore cutting edge research in Statistics. We will include students from all\r\ngroups that add diversity under the post-Proposition 209 definition (URMs, women, students with\r\ndisabilities, first-generation to college), because these groups are severely underrepresented in the\r\nmathematical and physical sciences, with a primary focus and priority given to those Berkeley\r\nstudents who are eligible for participation in CAMP, Compass-SWPS-PURNA, and AGEP.",
