The OSS 2010 conference will bring together a wide range of researchers from the fields of software engineering, information systems, social science, and information science. This conference is a critical link between researchers who study the more formal practices of software engineering and those who study the often less formal practices of the Open Source Software movement. The focus of the OSS 2010 DC is the intellectual content of the participants' doctoral dissertations. These dissertations represent state-of-the-art research in the study and development of complex software systems. Established faculty will participate in the DC as mentors to provide critical feedback on the participants' research. Participation in the DC will develop an intellectual community in a critically important research area. Organizers will work to cultivate diverse participation on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, gender, institutional affiliation, and under-represented status).",

Due to the success and the rapid release of open source software such as the Linux operating system, interest in this approach to software development process has increased, both in the academic and commercial world. A varied research community has developed examining open source systems from different perspectives.\n\nThe grant provided travel support for nine US-based PhD students and faculty to attend the OSS 2010 Doctoral Consortium, co-located with the 6th International Conference on Open Source Systems (OSS 2010), on May 30, 2010, in Notre Dame, IN. Attendance at the consortium also allowed students to participate in the conference itself, which was held May 31 - June 2. Because the grant was a travel grant, there are no immediate research outcomes. However, the grant had numerous broader impacts. \n\nFirst, the funding contributed to the education of the students who participated in the consortium. The students were particularly positive about the consortium's contribution to their research skills. The consortium provided feedback to students in order to develop higher quality and more relevant research on the Open Source phenomenon, which is relevant to NSF's renewed interest in software research. \n\nSecond, the consortium also helped achieve the goal of the development of a future generation of researchers grounded in their own disciplines but interested in and knowledgeable about the phenomenon of Open Source. A longer-term expected benefit is the development of ties among researchers to enable interdisciplinary research projects, thus addressing the NSF's interest in cultivating partnerships between traditional software researchers and those from other areas within and outside of computing. Four students attended the consortium from the EU and South America (not funded by NSF), thus enabling the development of international ties. \n\nThird, the outreach efforts of the consortium organizers helped increase diversity in the community of researchers. The students funded by NSF were a diverse group. In particular, three of the seven students were female, typically an underrepresented group in software research. \n\nFinally, the submitted abstracts have been made available to the broader research community.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/12/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Crowston"
