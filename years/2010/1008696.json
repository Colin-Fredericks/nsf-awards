 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville (SIUE) is a comprehensive university located in the greater St. Louis metropolitan region.   The institution proposes to implement an ADVANCE IT Catalyst project that would focus on an effort to develop a systematic and integrative effort to address the persistent under-representation of women and under-represented minority women in STEM disciplines. Specifically, this project will: (a) compile and analyze baseline data regarding women?s representation and advancement in STEM discipline; (b) carry out institutional buy-in activities and strategies, especially among departmental chairs; (c) conduct targeted surveys, qualitative interviews, and concept mapping; (d) analyze current policies; (e) conduct site visits to other ADVANCE institutions; and (f) offer events on campus to promote awareness of issues relevant to creating gender equity on campus. \r\nIntellectual Merit: This project proposes to utilize a unique methodological approach called concept mapping that will provide a useful tool for the investigation of questions and issues surrounding barriers to the career advancement of women faculty. Additionally, this project will focus on networks as a mechanism to empower women, improve access to information, and foster institutional change. \r\nBroader Impacts: SIUE will provide an ideal site for a case study as an institution in transition and, with an ADVANCE IT Catalyst project, will be poised to develop analytical paradigms and exemplary intervention strategies for institutions in similar states of transition.  Project findings will be disseminated broadly to diverse institutions of higher education in the immediate geographical area and to other peer institutions around the country as well.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nThe ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project \"Laying the Groundwork: The Status of Women Faculty at an Institution in Transition\" was designed to systematically evaluate the climate for women faculty and under-represented minority women faculty in STEM and SBS disciplines at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.  Project initiatives included (a) compiling and analyzing baseline data regarding women\u00c6s representation and advancement in STEM disciplines; (b) carrying out institutional buy-in activities and strategies, especially among departmental chairs; (c) conducting targeted surveys, qualitative interviews, and concept mapping to better understand our current climate and the impact of recent changes on women faculty; (d) analyzing current policies; (e) conducting site visits to campuses with successful NSF ADVANCE awards; and (f) offering events on campus to promote awareness of issues relevant to creating gender equity on campus.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nAn innovative concept map approach was used in the climate survey. Findings from the climate survey (distributed to tenure-track and tenured faculty) and qualitative interviews were shared with a range of campus constituencies as well as presented at regional and national conferences.  Three experts on gender equity in STEM disciplines and one dramatic presentation were brought to campus to spark discussion of the issues and raise awareness of possible approaches among faculty and adminstration, particularly department chairs.  The project helped jump-start new recruitment initiatives and supported the development of improved policies to support tenure-line faculty.  All project initiatives were carried out over the grant lifetime.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis project was originally envisioned as a program to help provide a case study for an institutions in transition.  Focusing on a master's comprehensive university with recent changes in faculty expectations and other university characteristics can illuminate challenges that other similar universities face in the pursuit of institutional transformation.  More waves of transitions have arrived at this university throughout the duration of the project, from economic challenges to additional leadership changes at the university.  These challenges at a university in transition makes the project's emphasis on sustainable change from a broad base of university support even more pointed.  Work at the university continues to adapt the practices learned about through this project to our specific setting in a way that may provide a model for other, similar institutions.  Additionally, the project has encouraged senior leaders to identify and pursue innovative solutions, unique to our institutional setting.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: P.
