 "awd_abstract_narration": "CarbonEARTH (Carbon Educators and Researchers Together for Humanity) will team STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduate students with upper elementary and middle school science teachers from rural and urban school districts to present innovative open-inquiry science projects related to the themes of Energy, Matter and Materials, Earth Processes and Ecosystems.  The interdisciplinary theme of carbon, broadly construed, will provide a unifying platform for investigation, discovery, training and education. In addition to their ongoing training in research, the CarbonEARTH graduate fellows will be trained in relevant elements of K-12 science teaching, and engage in activities promoting skills in collaboration, organization, communication, teaching, leadership, team building and other transferable skills. CarbonEARTH will additionally facilitate collaboration among faculty and graduate fellows across carbon-related research areas. CarbonEARTH will beneficially provide teachers and students from a wide range of disciplines with science learning experiences that not only teach concepts, but also develop skills for approaching scientific problems, for example global warming, waste disposal, renewable energy and nanoelectronics. The inquiry-based approach will enhance the understanding of STEM concepts and scientific skills for the upper elementary and middle school students, providing experiences that reflect the excitement and importance of STEM careers through their interactions with graduate fellow role models. To address the need to increase the STEM pipeline, throughout the program, priority will be given to supporting STEM education and career retention of underrepresented groups. CarbonEARTH also will strengthen and expand relationships between Penn State and K-12 schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
