  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Recently, there have been significant advances in the use of magnetic nanoparticles for various therapeutic applications, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, drug delivery vessels, and cancer therapy using magnetic hyperthermia. In the case of MRI contrast agents, magnetic nanoparticles are used to create contrast in varying parts of the body, allowing doctors to distinguish healthy from abnormal tissue.  The key components of this contrast enhancement system are the magnetic nature of the particles, the ability to stabilize the particles inside the body, and the ability to deliver the agents to a desired location inside the body.  The most common type of magnetic nanoparticle contrast agent is magnetite coated with dextran, which is popular due to its low cost, ease of creation, and biocompatibility.  However the main problems with these systems is that they remain poorly classified, specifically how the magnetic field introduced during testing and patient observation affects these particles.  The magnetic field should play a significant role in how these magnetic particles form chains and clusters, which both have an affect on the contrast received from the agents.  To date the interparticle interactions in these systems resultant from an induced magnetic field and therefore the resultant affect on the contrast enhancement have not been properly defined.   \n\n The major contributors to interparticle interactions in the case of magnetic particles are the size of the magnetic particles and the length of the stabilizing layer on the nanoparticle, which determine how attracted they are to each other and how well they repel each other.  Both of these factors can influence the arrangement inside a magnetic field, specifically interparticle spacing and moreover the formation of clusters and chains. Since field induced colloidal arrangements may greatly affect the transverse relativity of magnetic nanoparticle contrast enhancement systems, the effects of the particle size and the stabilizing polymer brush need to be well characterized in order to fully understand their effect on local protons.  It has been previously reported that contrast enhancement increases with increasing particle size. This is due to the fact that larger particles have a larger magnetic saturation value, therefore they have a greater sphere of influence.  This affect also holds true for clusters of nanoparticles, with the transverse contrast enhancement increasing with increased cluster size.  However, the effect of the stabilizing layer has not been well classified and remains inconclusive. Several current theories on how ligand length alters the observed transverse relaxivity define its effect by either varying the hydration layer thickness surrounding each particle or retarding the self-diffusion coefficient and chemical proton exchange rate of water.  Another possible conclusion is that the stabilization layer on magnetic nanoparticles determines the structure of field induced colloidal arrangement of particles, therefore altering the transverse relaxation rate.  This work is aimed to examine the effect of both the nanoparticle core and ligand size and on T2 contrast enhancement to further investigate the merit of these theories.\n\n Through the effort of this work, clear evidence has been provided that field induced colloidal arrangements for these magnetic particle systems inside a magnetic field play a significant role in the observed transverse relaxation rate.  Field induced colloidal arrangement must be addressed to more fully understand the role that magnetic nanoparticles play in MRI contrast enhancement. Understanding these principles will in turn aid in the development of better magnetic nanoparticle contrast agent systems.  Only once this issue has been addressed can we correlate instrumental data to clinical trials and identify the best contrast agent systems for specific clinical needs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven L Saville"
