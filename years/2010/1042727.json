The approach proposed here involves applying new, untested and exploratory computational approaches to extremely large corpora of digital music in combination with sets of proven algorithms and tools for effectively extracting features from recorded music. These developments together with successful efforts to create and deploy online massive online music corpora have created circumstances in which music analysis can be greatly expedited because of automation in critical areas.  This project also intends to expand the corpus of scores available (Open Source) and create new tools for analyzing them.",
