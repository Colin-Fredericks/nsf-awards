 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms and software for geometric problems are usually designed and implemented in several layers of abstraction:  For example, a map in a GPS navigation unit may be represented as a road network topology (just the interconnections) on top of the road geometry (a collection of line segments), which is represented with coordinates (as a sequence of points in a standard geodesic coordinate system), which are stored as numbers in a computer memory (which have a relatively small number of bits).  At times, assumptions at higher levels of abstraction (e.g., lines are continuous, straight, and infinitely thin) are broken by the realities of the underlying levels (e.g., most points fall off a line when rounded to \"machine precision\").  Examples can be found in geometric algorithms for motion capture, robot simulation, x-ray crystallography, video tracking, and many other applications.\r\n\r\nSophisticated implementers of geometric algorithms will identify exactly what properties one level needs from its underlying levels, and carefully implement the underlying levels to provide these.  The increasing amounts of geometric data mean that most implementers do not have sophistication in geometric algorithms, either because they are more focused on the sophisticated knowledge of their own domain, or because they are students who have not yet reached that level of sophistication.\r\n\r\nComputer Scientists are accustomed to designing algorithms to optimize running time and memory space -- two resources that are limited, but whose limits may not be known in advance.  This project adds arithmetic precision to this list of resources.  This resource can be measured, up to constants, by the degree of polynomials in predicates and constructions.  Restricting designers to low degree predicates forces creative new solutions to standard problems that can be guaranteed correct in machine precision.  The result will be a codebook of algorithms that have been developed and tested by graduate and undergraduate students in this project, and can be the basis for robust primitives or further exploration in education and practical settings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThere are more ways than one to solve any problem. Computer scientists\noften explore possible solutions by limiting resources: time, memory,\nor, in the case of this project, the number of digits you can\ncalculate with.  A classic example is the \"Post Office\"\nproblem. Suppose that you know mailbox locations as coordinates in the\nplane. If you know your own coordinates, then you can compute all\ndistances by the Pythagorean theorem, then compare to find nearest.\nIt is enough to compare squared distances, which can be done exactly\nin double precision (and is faster, since it eliminates the\nunnecessary square root computation). It you will do this often, you\nmay prefer to store a map colored by closest mailbox locations, so\nyour color tells you which mailbox without further measuring -- this\ntrades storage space for time, and also requires more precision, since\nprevious algorithms to compute the coloring use four to six times\ninput precision.\n\nThis project successfully created new algorithms and data structures\nfor the Post Office problem and other problems with limited\nprecision -- including ways to create the colored map with only double\nthe input precision, an important advance, since most computers\nsupport double precision arithmetic in fast hardware.\n\nEqually importantly, this project has shown that by thinking of\nprecision at algorithm design time, one can create more robust\nsolutions for geometric problems in Geographic Information Systems\n(GIS), Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and physics simulation.  The last\nhas been demonstrated through collaboration with Bettis Labs on robust\nneutron tracking in reactors; PhD graduate David Millman became a\nSenior Research Scientist at Bettis.\n\nFrom the start, this project has had an educational focus, aiming to\nbring considerations of precision down to general programming classes,\nnot just the advanced classes in numerical analysis.  In addition to\nDr. Millman's PhD, three Masters students have written theses, and six\nundergraduates have had research experiences within this project.  A\ntextbook on \"Degree-driven design of geometric algorithms\" is nearing\ncompletion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Jeffay"
