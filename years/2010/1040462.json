This quantitative phase imaging instrument will benefit diverse research efforts in the materials and life sciences. In particular, it will enable: (1) non-destructive inspection of nanostructures, semiconductor devices, and new materials such as graphene and carbon/semiconductor nanotubes, (2) observation of the dynamics of live cells and transport in neurons, and (3) exploration of new cancer detection techniques. Current topographic imaging technology severely constrains the size and sheer number of samples that can be measured at high resolution. Thus, the information gathered and new understanding obtained is thereby limited. Numerous new lines of research and opportunities for discovery in fields ranging from medicine and life sciences to semiconductors and material sciences will be enabled once this new form of fast microscopy is made accessible. Further, development of this transformative scientific instrument will provide rich opportunities to broadly integrate research and education.",

The Illinois Summer Academy (a partnership with UI extension and the 4-H club) for high school students was offered for a third time in June 2014. Prof. Goddard led the development of GLEE. It has been offered as an annual summer camp since 2010. A total of 93 girls ranging from entering 9th through entering 12th grade participated in the camp over five years: 19 (including 5 African-American and 4 Hispanic) in 2010, 20 (2 African-American) in 2011, 20 (2 African-American, 1 Hispanic) in 2012, 14 (2 African-American, 1 Hispanic) in 2013, and 22 (2 Hispanic) in 2014. Details of the GLEE curriculum have been included in past NSF MRI annual reports. In 2014, we added two new activities: a card game that teaches different sorting algorithms and a hands on project to build an optical imaging system, specifically, a color projector using an LED light source, a lens, a printed transparency, and cardstock paper to form an optical V-groove (to allow the students to vary the object distance from the lens). Both activites were well received. The projector activity was surprisingly inexpensive, only $4 per projector ($2 for the LED flashlight, under $2 for the lens, and negligible costs for the paper and transparency material). Given the activity\u00c6s popularity, simplicity, and opportunity to teach key concepts in imaging, we intend to have this 1hr project as a display at Engineering Open House and at other campus outreach events.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1.
