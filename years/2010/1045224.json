 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will survey the insects that belong to the families Tabanidae (horse flies, etc.) and Ceratopogonidae (biting midges) that use Louisiana tidal marshes. The larvae of both families of flies prey upon invertebrates in tidal marshes, and adult reproduction is dependent upon the vertebrate hosts that reside above the larval habitats. Therefore, these flies will serve as excellent bioindicators for wetland health. The impact and recovery related to oil contamination will be evaluated via comparative analyses of data on population size, species diversity, and genetic diversity of flies collected in tidal marsh areas that are contaminated as well as sites that are not contaminated. The studies will show which areas have been affected by the spill, and identify areas needing mitigation and rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nThe oil spill is likely to impact communities that border the Gulf and potentially even the Atlantic Ocean.  Therefore, surveillance of these insects could be an important element used in future rapid assessment efforts.  Collaboration with scientists from other coastal states will be established to foster development of future assessment efforts. Both graduate and undergraduate students would be involved and benefit from participation in these studies, which should provide a new role for entomology in coastal studies.",

Immediately after the spill, we conducted studies on the abundance of tabanid (horse fly) populations at four locations (Grand Bayou and Grand Isle which were oiled and Cypremort Point and Cameron which remained pristine). Our trap data indicated that the adult tabanids had truly been affected on Grand Isle and Grand Bayou (an average of 1.27- 4.8 flies captured per hour in 41 trap days); both of these areas are notorious for greenhead attack each summer. However, fly activity was high at the unaffected locations at Cypremort Point and Cameron (an average of 36.6 &ndash; 92.2 flies per hour in 60 trap days). The dramatic decline in tabanid activity had also been reported by the first observers of the intrusion on the barrier islands near Barataria Bay. We also developed primers and PCR protocols for microsatellite genotyping of <em>T. nigrovittatus</em> populations. Genotypes at the remaining 10 polymorphic loci were confirmed to assort independently and four populations were evaluated. The genetic diversity within the pristine populations was moderate with an allelic richness of up to 6.5 per locus and population. We did not detect recent genetic bottlenecks in any of the three populations that were not impacted by the oil spill. We also gathered preliminary data based on the genotypes at two loci of a population collected at a site that had been hit by the oil (Grand Bayou). Rarefaction analysis showed that the allelic richness at those two loci of the Grand Bayou population was at the lower end of the range observed in the three control populations. Moreover, only the Grand Bayou population showed heterozygote excess, likely the result of a bottleneck effect that indicates reduced population size. The findings of this project were used to successfully obtain a subsequent award from GoMRI to collect data to compare to those obtained in 2010. The results of that study indicated that there were long term effects of the oil spill on tabanid populations. We have not been able to obtain funding to conduct long term studies.
