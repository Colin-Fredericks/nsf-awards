 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Timothy M. Swager and Dr. Peter M. Mueller from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) redox transformations in a number of metal-containing systems (Jonas Peters); 2) study of molecular photocatalysis sytems (Daniel Nocera); 3) characterization of metal-containing systems with multiply-bonded ligands (Christopher Cummins); 4) the development of new catalysis systems for olefin metathesis and dinitrogen reduction (Richard Schrock).  The instrument will also feature in the educational outreach activities of Dr. Mueller.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, catalysis and solar energy research.  Students using the apparatus will receive valuable training with cutting-edge instrumentation. \r\n",
