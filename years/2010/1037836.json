This event will host world experts in catalysis to address four key strategic areas: 1) heavy feed stocks: coal and tar sands, 2) light alkanes and natural gas, 3) biomass and renewables, and 4) assessment of new technology. The purpose of the event is to identify the key challenges in the development of new\r\ntechnologies focused on alternative feedstocks and to highlight the opportunities that can lead to breakthroughs necessary for the transformation to new materials and fuels. Paul Dauenhauer of the University of Massachusetts requests $25,000 to support the travel and lodging for 10 United States researchers to attend the conference. The team of researchers selected for participation will highlight existing NSF-funded American research centers that are currently focused on utilization of biomass and alternative carbon-based materials.\r\n\r\nThe design of new technologies focused on utilization of alternative feedstocks provides the opportunity to improve energy independence, reduce the impact on the environment and improve the economic prosperity of the United States. Participation of a team of U.S. researchers from a wide selection of NSF-funded research centers in this international conference highlighting technology for utilization of alternative feedstocks should enhance domestic research by providing an excellent opportunity to share and learn about the newest research developments in alternative feedstock utilization technology. Additionally, participation will increase interactions and offer new collaborations with other academic, industrial,and governmental researchers from around the world.  The interaction gained by U.S. participation in this international conference will potentially impact the overall research strength of NSF funded alternative feedstock programs.",
