The group will meet several times in Washington D.C. and will draft a report that will be widely disseminated to federal agencies, industrial groups, as well as the nuclear chemistry community.\r\n\r\nPrevious studies have suggested that the US may be facing a critical shortage of workers trained in nuclear and radiochemistry, but there have been no recent reports that have evaluated the national needs, potential training opportunities, and possible solutions to this problem.  Nuclear energy provides approximately 20% of the US electrical energy requirements and radionuclides are widely used in industry and medicine.  This study will provide valuable guidance for new training modalities to assure that the US has a workforce with adequate expertise in nuclear, radiation, and radiochemistry for the continued growth of the US economy and for improvements in health care.",
