An award will allow Drs. Robert T. Walker and Cynthia S. Simmons, Michigan State University (MSU), to meet with Dr. Scott Hoefle, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).  The workshop will assemble experts on the Transamazon Highway and its surroundings to consider the current state of knowledge of the social and environmental impacts of the highway.  The planning visit considers among other things workshop logistics and themes, which include construction costs, maintenance costs, impacts on indigenous peoples, environmental impacts, the emergent agricultural economy, and mineral production.\r\nThe planning visit builds on recent and preliminary collaborations among participants.  The workshop is meant to be the first formal phase of a three-year collaboration between US and Brazilian researchers.  The Brazilian team consists of Geography faculty at UFRJ, who have also extended invitations to select researchers in France.  Workshop organizers plan to invite people across the spectrum of academic experience, from established professors to assistant professors to graduate students recruited from both MSU and UFRJ with expertise in both social and environmental sciences.  Young researchers will be expected to present and develop a manuscript for circulation within the group and for ultimate publication.  The workshop will expand communication about current understanding of the Transamazon Highway and will provide an opportunity to develop new collaborations between environmental and social scientists, between US and Brazilian citizens, and between young and experienced researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project involved travel to Brazil in order to plan for a workshop aimed at evaluating the environmental, economic, and cultural impacts of the Transamazon Highway, at the age of 40.  Given the Highway was started in 1970 and finished in 1974, the workshop is timed to coincide with the maturing of the first generation of Brazilians who heeded the government\u00c6s call to come and fill what was perceived to be a demographic vacuum.  The US lead institution is Michigan State University (MSU), and the Brazilian, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).  In preparation for the planning visit in the summer of 2011, MSU organized two special sessions at the 106th Annual Meetings of the Association of American Geographers in Seattle.  The sessions addressed large scale infrastructure development in the Amazon, with a specific focus on the Transamazon Highway.  Well-known specialists on these topics from both the US and Brazil participated in the Seattle conference, which set the stage for the subsequent planning meeting.\n\n The actual planning meeting supported by this project involved travel to Brazil by MSU faculty, who gave two seminars to UFRJ faculty and students, entitled \"Fragmenta&ccedil;&atilde;o Florestal como processo de Desenvolvimento: Impactos da Rodovia Transamaz&ocirc;nica na Amaz&ocirc;nia Oriental\" [Forest Fragmentation as a Development Process: Impacts of the Transamazon Highway on Eastern Amazonia] and \"A&ccedil;&atilde;o Direta na Reforma Agr&aacute;ria na Amaz&ocirc;nia Brasileira.\" [Direct Action Land Reform in the Brazilian Amazon].  As a result of the planning discussions, MSU and UFRJ participants agreed on the broad themes of collaborative research that would flow from the workshop activity.  They also agreed that a good workshop product would be the publication of a book addressing Amazonian Development, with a focus on the Transamazon Highway.\n\n Workshop specifics that emerged in discussion, and which excited MSU and UFRJ participants, were ideas to (1) engage scholars from the region in the workshop and book preparation, as well as in follow-up research; and to (2) conduct the workshop itself either on or near the Transamazon Highway, possibly in Santer&eacute;m, for example.  MSU has subsequently gauged strong interest for such involvement from colleagues at the Federal University of Par&aacute; (UFPA), specifically with the N&uacute;cleo de Meio Ambiente (NUMA) [Center for the Environment].\n\n In sum, the workshop idea has crystallized, and the Brazilian collaboration is highly engaged.  The next step would be to submit the workshop proposal.\n\n \n\nProposed Book: Amazonian Development, Destruction, and Resurrection\n\n Table of Contents:\n\n Part I: Setting the Stage\n\n1) Introduction.\n\n2) The Geopolitics of Regional Development: Then and Now.\n\n3) The ones who were here before: Amerindians and Caboclos on BR-230.\n\n4) The Occupation Process: Colonization, Planned and Spontaneous on BR-230.\n\n \n\nPart II: Amazonia Today\n\n5) Mega-Development across the Basin.\n\n6) Predatory Resource Extraction.\n\n7) Agricultural Development and Agrarian Change on BR-230 and Throughout the Basin.\n\n8) At the brink of the Tipping Point.\n\n \n\nPart III: Possibilities of Hope\n\n9) Emergent Environmental Protections: From State to Community.\n\n10) Citizenry comes to the Amazon.\n\n11) Mobilization Success: The Amerindians.\n\n12) Resurrecting Amazonia.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert T Walker"
