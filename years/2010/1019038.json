 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a U.S.-Japan workshop on Scientific Collaboration and Productivity in Tokyo in March 2010, jointly organized with collaborators at Hitotsubashi University, Seijyo University, and Japan?s National Institute of Science & Technology Policy (NISTEP). There is a strong need to understand research teams in a global context and for major research centers such as the U.S. and Japan to learn from the experiences in the other country in order to develop best practices for guiding scientific collaboration. The need is fueled by three facts: (1) scientific research is becoming increasingly collaborative; (2) there is an increased interest in translational research; and (3) there is increased emphasis on the part of policy makers to expand the scientific and technical labor force, and, in particular, to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research. The workshop will to examine three themes: the composition of scientific teams, especially by gender and seniority; collaboration structures, including size, disciplines and institutions; and impact of the structure and composition of collaboration on scientific and commercial outcomes of research. It also aims to help set an agenda for future research on the nature of collaboration, including a joint survey of US and Japanese scientists. The award supports travel support for U.S. participants, including economists and sociologists of science at the junior and senior level. The award is cofunded by the Science of Science & Innovation Program in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences directorate.",

Walsh (PI): Georgia Institute of Technology\n\n \n\nProject Summary\n\nWe proposed a joint US-Japan workshop (March, 26, 2010, Tokyo, Japan) to examine three themes: the composition of scientific teams (especially by gender and seniority), collaboration structures (size, disciplines, institutions), and impact of the structure and composition of collaboration on both scientific and commercial outcomes of the research. In addition, the workshop had the goal of providing an agenda-setting forum for future research on the nature of collaboration (including a joint US-Japan survey of scientists). The workshop included Japanese, US and European experts in the economics and sociology of science, junior researchers (graduate students and assistant professors) and senior domain scientists from several fields (for example, physics, life sciences, and pharmaceuticals). This proposal was to support the travel of the US participants and the follow-up work for developing the survey based on the results of the workshop.\n\nIntellectual Merit: There is a strong need to understand research teams in a global context and for major research centers such as the US and Japan to learn from the experiences in the other country in order to develop best practices for guiding scientific collaboration.  The need is fueled by three facts: (1) scientific research is becoming increasingly collaborative; (2) there is an increased interest in translational research; and (3) there is increased emphasis on the part of policy makers to expand the scientific and technical labor force, and, in particular, to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research.  The workshop provided an important forum for addressing these issues, reviewing the state of the art, and also providing guidance for a major international collaboration to further develop the research frontier in these areas.  In addition, by integrating domain scientists with senior and junior social scientists, the workshop promoted a greater understanding of the economics and sociology of science.\n\nBroader Impacts: This research coming from this workshop will inform policymakers in the US and Japan who are interested in developing programs to encourage collaboration (especially interdisciplinary collaboration) and translational research.  It will also provide greater insight into the participation of women in science and help understand opportunities for greater inclusion of women in scientific collaboration and the commercialization of science.  The survey based on this workshop has recently been completed and the initial findings were presented at a workshop in Tokyo that included scholars and policymakers from Japan, as well as American scholars and representatives of science funding agencies.\n\nFinally, this workshop provided a unique opportunity for junior researchers in the economics and sociology of science to meet with senior scientists in the US and Japan, and to participate in the agenda setting for this large scale cross-national effort.
