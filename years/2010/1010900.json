 "awd_abstract_narration": "PEEP and the Big Wide World, produced by WGBH, is an award-winning daily half-hour math and science television series for 3-5 year old children, complemented by an outreach campaign designed to encourage greater family involvement in children's math and science exploration.  PEEP's three intended impacts are to: (1) empower families to feel more equipped, more confident, and more inclined to facilitate science and math exploration with their preschoolers; (2) engage preschoolers in science explorations that promote positive attitudes and inquiry skills; and (3) provide project partners with appropriate educational resources for both the English- and Spanish-speaking families they serve.  \r\n\r\nThe project's deliverables include:\r\n- Ten new animated PEEP stories in Spanish and English, which will introduce a new bilingual character to bring to life PEEP's science and math-based curriculum for Spanish speakers;\r\n- Ten new live-action segments in Spanish and English, which will show children, their siblings, parents, and grandparents actively engaging in \"Anywhere Math and Science\";\r\n- Collaborations with the project's long-standing partners (National Head Start Association, National Education Association, and National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies) and with new groups that specialize in delivering science content and messaging directly to Latino families (Self-Reliance Foundation, National Latino Children's Institute, and Hispanic Communications Network);\r\n- Five model projects developed jointly by public television stations and their community partners, to pilot new approaches to reaching Latino families;\r\n- Summative evaluation that will assess the impact of PEEP's materials on Latino families and their young children and the success of our collaborations with our outreach partners. It will be conducted by the Concord Evaluation Group.\r\n\r\nThe PEEP and the Big Wide World will be broadcast on PBS stations around the country and carried on V-me Ninos, the most widely distributed block of children's programming on U.S. Spanish television. The PEEP website gets approximately 10,200 visits per day. Nearly three million children and adults over the course of a year visit the site to watch animated stories, play games, and access educational resources.  The project's curriculum and resources presented via multimedia platforms make a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of preschool science and math education. This series and the outreach efforts are particularly valuable given the paucity of preschool educators and caregivers who identify themselves as being science and math educators. The new emphasis on the Spanish-speaking audience is a unique contribution within the ISE children's media portfolio.",

WGBH also used non-NSF funds to convert six existing web games to iPhone apps in order to increase their use.
