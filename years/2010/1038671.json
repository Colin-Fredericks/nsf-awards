The new sequencer is a massively parallel pyrosequencing instrument that will be used for the sequencing of microbial communities, transcriptomes, and microbial genomes.  The new sequencer is utilized for both courses (Biochemistry to Microbial Ecology) and research projects for undergrads, grads, and faculty at ASU and beyond.  The diverse and innovative research projects that utilize the sequencer span a range of topics that include physical chemistry, fish genetics, nanotechnology, microbial/mitochondrial genomes, microbial ecology and physiology.  The research projects help to advance the Alabama State University goals of student training and research resource development.  The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe use of Next Generation Sequencing technology has resulted in an explosion of studies focused on whole genomes, transcriptomes, and microbiomes, which indicate a paradigm shift in the exploration of biology.  Students and faculty at Alabama State University (ASU) have participated in this shift because the award provided the resources to purchase a 454 sequencer.  Over three years, the DNA sequencer has been used for training and conducting state-of-the-art research in the fields of environmental microbiology, microbial genomics, cellular biology and forensic science.  In total, one high school student, 6 undergraduate and 15 graduate students, one post-doctoral fellow and two faculty members have been trained in the principles of 454 pyrosequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing data.  Faculty and students who used this technology have presented their research at regional, national and international science meetings.  One undergraduate student won an award from the American Society for Microbiology for her research.  Research generated from this award has resulted in breakthroughs in the understanding of the microbial response to Deepwater Horizon oil and dispersant in Gulf of Mexico surface waters.  In collaboration with scientists at University of Washington and University of D&uuml;sseldorf, this award lead to the development of a new way to characterize the microbial communities in the human mouth, which might cure chronic periodontitis and peri-implantitis.   Collaboration with faculty and students in Forensic Science Dept. at ASU has resulted in a new way to determine how long a person has been dead, which is important for crime scene investigations.   This award has resulted in the publication of seven science articles, a front-page newspaper story, and an interview on a regional TV news program.  The acquisition of the 454 sequencer has gone a long way towards linking course material to the development of inquiring minds and inquiring attitudes.  It has also enhanced scientific collaborations at national (University of Washington) and international levels (Max-Planck-Institute and University of D&uuml;sseldorf).  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter A Noble"
