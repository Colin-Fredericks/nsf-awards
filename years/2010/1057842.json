Since the Mw 7.2 El Major-Cucapah earthquake there has been a migration of seismicity to the north that has included the recent 7 July 2010, Mw 5.4 Collins Valley earthquake. This RAPID award will accelerate the instrument deployment for the existing NSF funded project (EAR-0908903) entitled: Collaborative Research: Structural Architecture and Evolutionary Plate-Boundary Processes along the San Jacinto Fault Zone. This is a joint project between USC, UCSD, San Diego State University, and UNAVCO.  This RAPID project will use resources of UNAVCO to provide the most cost effective method for installation of  new shallow borehole sensors. The funds are solely for the shallow borehole drilling, since USC is providing the borehole sensors and UCSD is providing the data acquisition system. The RAPID funding will allow for 7 installations.",

Their primary concern in April was that earthquake activity along the San Jacinto Fault would increase and there would be an opportunity to record unique a new scientific dataset, particularly for making on-scale measurements near seismic sources on the San Jacinto Fault.   In response to the immediate evolving seismological situation, USC used $66k of internal funds to purchase 11 Kinemetrics SBEPI (Shallow Borehole EpiSensor) Downhole Force Balance Accelerometers.
