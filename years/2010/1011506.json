Despite broad biological significance, no study to date has directly tested whether the evolution of bioluminescent systems is concordant with increased rates of evolution. This research project will focus on an ideal model system for comparing rates of evolution in luminescent versus non-luminescent species. The evolutionary relationships of bioluminescent fishes in the Order Alepocephaliformes will be reconstructed using a combination of DNA sequence data and morphological features, including anatomy of the light-organ system. The resulting set of relationships will be used to test for changes in evolutionary rate between the bioluminescent and non-luminescent species. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide new insights into the evolution and diversification of the complex light-organ system in fishes, and more broadly, the forces shaping deep-sea fish biodiversity. The \"alien nature\" of the deep sea and its inhabitants provides an excellent system for engaging public interest in biology. Results will be disseminated via public outreach and education programs.",
