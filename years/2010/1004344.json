  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCommutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are among the oldest and yet most active disciplines in mathematics. The fields have strong ties to such diverse areas as complex analysis, topology, and number theory, and are used in a wide variety of applied settings. Applications range from error-correcting codes in computer science and genomics to control theory and modeling in engineering.  These fields seek to understand geometric objects (algebraic varieties) given locally as the solutions to polynomial equations. For instance, a plane curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two variables (such as the cusp y^2 = x^3). The richness and simplicity of polynomial equations make algebraic varieties fascinating objects of study.  The program of research completed by the PI during his fellowship has led to a deeper understanding of the varieties and singularities in positive characteristic, i.e. over number systems having the property that a prime number vanishes.  In particular, these systems include the finite fields at the heart of essentially all electronic computation.\nSingularities and numerical invariants defined via the Frobenius endomorphism are an important part of the study of Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in positive characteristic.  To that end, the program of research completed by the PI has led to a number of important developments in these areas.  These include: adescription of test ideals via alterations, as well as transformation rules for them via birational maps; a uniform description of test ideals (characteristic p &gt; 0) and multiplier ideals (characteristic 0), as well as an important analog of the Nadel vanishing theorem for test ideals up to finite covers; and finally showing the existence of a local numerical invariant called the F-signature which characterizes the maximal asymptotic growth of F- splitting numbers, answering a question that had remained open for over a decade.\n\nDuring his tenure, the PI has also worked extensively to have broader impacts outside his research program.  He has remained active in the research community at large, attending numerous conferences and coordinating various seminars.
