 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overlay anonymity systems like Tor are effective against many kinds of attacks\r\non privacy, but they have significantly slower network performance than regular\r\nInternet traffic. The purpose of this project is to explore the design of\r\nanon.next, an anonymity system for the next-generation Internet. In anon.next,\r\nwe embed anonymizing proxies into new Internet architectures, so that the\r\nnetwork itself can provide efficient and effective privacy protection in a way\r\nthat overlay designs cannot. This project seeks to make major advances in two\r\nareas key to the design of anon.next. First, methods to construct\r\nhigh-throughput paths of anonymizing proxies to route the user's packets to\r\ntheir destinations with minimal leakage of privacy. Second, secure methods to\r\nlocate those proxies without relying on centralized directory servers or\r\nexposing the users' packet routes. Both components require us to develop new\r\nmetrics for the privacy provided by a given anonymizing path and by the system\r\nas a whole. We are conducting analysis and simulation studies and validating\r\nthese with extensive experimentation on GENI testbeds.  These efforts will\r\nprovide major insights into the design of anonymity systems, which provide\r\npersonal privacy as well as censorship resistance and protection for\r\nwhistle-blowers, journalists, and intelligence services. Our project is also\r\npart of the large effort required to understand and design distributed systems\r\nin the next-generation Internet. This project involves students at many levels,\r\nincluding middle and high school students in summer camp settings,\r\nundergraduate students in research into finding new attacks against our\r\nsystems, and graduate students.",
