Ten Microfluidics Laboratory Modules and Kits are being developed and tested in nine existing courses at multiple universities and colleges across the nations.  This project addresses the rapidly growing need for microfluidics technology and a trained workforce. The new learning materials developed from this project allow engineering and science students to explore microscale fluid behaviors and microfluidic devices, and provide opportunities for students to apply science and engineering principles to microscale phenomena and compare them with microscale observations.",
