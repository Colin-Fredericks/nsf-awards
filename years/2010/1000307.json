 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microcellular foamed polymers are produced by the use of a decomposing gas in the polymer which leaves behind microcellular voids within stiff, lightweight materials. An objective of the work is to reinforce these materials with plant fibers since such composites have been found to possess highly dissipative, foam-like dynamic response in a rigid, lightweight form. The voids as well as the cellular and vascular anatomy of the natural fibers have been found to play a role in this behavior. The goal of the project is to describe the micro-structural behavior of the biocomposites under dynamic loading, and to connect it to macro-structural response. This knowledge is unavailable for microcellular biocomposites, and will enable the exploitation of the natural properties of the underlying materials and lead to tailored, multi-functional material systems. Building on ideas from polymer crystallization and traditional composites, fundamental research will be conducted concerning micro-structural response, modeling, microscopy, microcellular processing and testing. \r\n\r\nPotential applications range from impact safety materials in automobiles and municipal transportation systems to infrastructural materials like specialized flooring, guard rails, seismic panels, and composite slabs, and to less obvious ones like electronics protection and biomedical scaffolds. The participation of a potential large scale user of the materials can help lower the cost of the materials and work to overcome the financial inertia that hinders the use of new materials by smaller manufacturers. Many candidate applications are presently met with petroleum-based materials. The replacement of just a moderate amount of these materials with environmentally-friendly alternatives can produce significant environmental benefit. The project includes education of a graduate student, REU students and educational outreach to kindergarten - 12 students.",
