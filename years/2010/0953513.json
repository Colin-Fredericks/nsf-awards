 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cognitive radio (CR) is a frequency-agile wireless communication device with intelligent control and a monitoring interface that enables dynamic spectrum access.  The CR concept represents a paradigm change in spectrum regulation and utilization.  As basic understandings gained, there is a compelling need to fully capitalize CR's high potential for supporting new applications. \r\n\r\nThis CAREER project investigates the problem of enabling rich multimedia services in emerging CR networks.  Although highly rewarding, the new dimension of dynamics on channel availability, sensing, and access brings about a whole level of technical challenges.  To address these challenges, a novel cross-layer optimization and control approach is employed, complemented with distributed algorithm design and development of an open source CR video testbed.  The manifold design trade-offs, multifarious dynamics, scarce resources and, on the other hand, video's tight QoS constraints make the optimization and control approach highly suited for \"squeezing\" the most out of CR video networks.  The three research thrusts include: cross-layer optimization of CR video networks, classical and modern control theory based analysis and design of CR video networks, and experimental research with a CR video testbed and field experiments.\r\n\r\nThis project will serve a critical need by enabling video communications in emerging CR networks for commercial and mission-critical applications.  Open source software, a CR video testbed, and experimental data will be distributed in the wireless community.  The research outcomes will be integrated with course development, textbook writing, involving graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research, promoting diversity, and outreach to K-12 students.",
