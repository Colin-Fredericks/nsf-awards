The integrated package will be mated to an existing JEOL 6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) that was acquired by Colgate with previous NSF/MRI support (EAR-0320639).   The enhanced capabilities of the SEM will support PI and student research including rock fabric investigations of footwall mylonites from Cordilleran core complexes using EBSD to infer the kinematics and temperature of their formation,  CL-SEM analysis of lower Paleozoic quartz sandstones of the Appalachian basin to infer the diagenetic history of micron-scale cement fabrics, and studies of the biomineralization of barnacle exoskeletons.  Colgate University is a non-Ph.D. granting institution.  The instrumentation will support undergraduate student training in state-of-the-art electron microscopy  research methods with applications to structural geology and sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic petrology.\r\n\r\n***",
