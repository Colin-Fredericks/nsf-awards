 "awd_abstract_narration": "Video-on-demand (VoD) is an attractive service that has\r\nalready gained popularity in the Internet by\r\nallowing users to view a video from a large catalog at\r\nany time. A limitation of existing VoD services, both\r\nusing traditional design as well as P2P is their inability to support\r\nefficient streamed access to ALL content at high quality,\r\nregardless of demand: not just blockbusters that millions want to\r\nsee, but also niche content that has relatively small demand in\r\ncomparison to their highly popular counterparts: re-runs of TV shows,\r\nnon-blockbuster releases, replays of sporting events, and speeches.\r\n\r\nThe peer-to-peer (P2P) approach is an effective\r\nsolution for scalable content distribution without imposing a\r\nsignificant burden on a centralized infrastructure.  In a P2P-based\r\nVoD system, users receive streamed videos from VoD servers as well as\r\nfrom the peers. The ability of peers that are viewing the videos to\r\ncollaborate with each other reduces the load on serving\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis project extends the design of successful P2P VoD systems to\r\nenable support for efficient delivery of a large, potentially\r\nlimitless library of high (movie) quality stored VoD.  Regardless of\r\na video's popularity, a high-quality version will be playable by any\r\nclient attached to the network without interruption within seconds of\r\nits request.  The research utilizes three design principles: leverage\r\nP2P technologies, implement altruistic cross-content caching and\r\nserving, and utilize playback-point weighted caching strategies.\r\nResults include models that describe desirable caching behavior,\r\ndistributed algorithms to implement the desired caching behavior, and\r\na functional prototype.",
