 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms interact with members of their own species, and such interactions can directly and indirectly influence genetics, behavior and evolution. Biologists have only recently begun to consider how social partners change the rules of evolution and alter the way that selection shapes biodiversity. This project will follow an insect model system in the wild, to examine how differences in social contexts translate into differences in classically understood selection. The work includes direct behavioral observation, as well as the development of infrared video monitoring systems to record data remotely. Fieldwork will be conducted at the Mountain Lake Biological Station so the project interfaces with the highly successful MLBS-Research Experience for Undergraduate program to provide training opportunities for new scientists, as well as developing mentoring skills for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The results of this work will determine how import social context and social networks are to the process of behavioral evolution.",
