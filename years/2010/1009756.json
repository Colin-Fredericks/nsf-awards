The main goals will be to (1) accurately measure the scaling of accretion disk size with black hole mass; (2) determine the scaling of disk size with wavelength from the near-IR through the space UV; (3) determine the size of the non-thermal X-ray emitting regions and their scaling with black hole mass; (4) routinely measure disk inclinations and orientations; and (5) measure the changes in disk structure with changes in luminosity.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and a postdoc, public lectures, and middle school teacher training by the PI.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe structure of quasars, supermassive black holes a million to a\nbillion times the mass of our Sun, growing by accreting\ngas through a surrounding disk, remains enigmatic.  While they\nare so luminous that the can be seen anywhere in the Universe,\nthey are too small to be resolved into a ``picture'' with a\ntelescope -- this makes it very challenging to understand their\ninner workings.  The structure and evolution of quasars also strongly\naffect the development and growth of their host galaxies,\nso their properties are also important to understanding the entire\ndevelopment of structure in our Universe.  Figure 1 (from Urry &amp; Padovani 1995 via Z. Ivezic)  shows a cartoon of a quasar, its surrounding accretion disk, a jet of ejected material seen in some systems, and nearby\nclouds that are responsible for producing the broad and\nnarrow emission lines from atoms excited by the ultraviolet\nradiation from the accretion disk.\n\nThe intellectual merits of the investigation were (1) to further\ndevelop and apply the method of gravitational microlensing to\nmeasure the size and structure of quasar emission regions, and\n(2) to advance methods for analyzing and interpreting the variability\nof quasars.  In particular, we clearly see that the hotter\nparts of accretion disks are more compact, with a temperature\nstructure that is broadly compatible with simple models.  The\nabsolute sizes of the disks are larger than predicted, and this\nremains a mystery even though we later confirmed the microlensing\nresults using the methods we developed to better understand\nquasar variability.  The X-ray emission of quasars appears to\nclosely track the inner edge of the accretion disk, very close\nto the black hole, which rules out some theories for its origin.\nWe developed quantitative statistical models for quasar variability\nand applied them to understanding quasar structure, both that of\nthe accretion disk and the so-called broad line clouds. We have\nstarted using these methods to classify variable stars and to better\nunderstand the stars the Kepler satellite is searching for new planets.\n\nThe broader impacts covered a range of areas. First, it contributed\nsignificantly to more closely unifying two sub-fields of astronomy\nwhile working with and training a large number of graduate students\n(12) and post-doctoral researchers (10) at twelve institutions both\nin the United States and in Europe.  Second, this project and\nother projects of the PI contributed to educating and developing the\npublic's interest in science through public talks and press releases.\nThird, the statistical methods developed for analyzing time series\ndata may have significant application outside the field of astronomy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher S Kochanek"
