This approach contrasts with the current  state-of-the-art that focuses on creating highly porous cancellous bone.\r\n\r\nThe work proposes a creative approach that combines ideas from modular assembly of small tissue building blocks to form large constructs, nano-structured scaffolds, and tissue culture to cellular engraftment upon these structures. The educational broader impacts of the proposed work are graduate student education and research, the development of underrepresented groups, the engagement of a local community college, the inclusion of high school student research activities, and course development.",
