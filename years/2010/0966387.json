 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a) increasing the number of students pursuing degrees in STEM areas, b) increasing the retention and academic success of S-STEM scholars, c) enriching their learning environment and d) facilitating the transfer of S-STEM scholars to appropriate baccalaureate institutions. The project is partnering with existing outreach programs at Centralia College to induce more middle and high school students to choose STEM careers. S-STEM scholars are working with peer and faculty mentors, visiting labs and field sites of STEM professionals, pursuing independent research opportunities and attending regional scientific conferences, visiting potential transfer institutions, and meeting with financial aid / admissions experts to ensure academic success. This project is increasing the visibility of STEM careers in a rural area that lacks role models in these areas. Many project activities are open to all Centralia College students, lifting the academic achievement of not only the S-STEM scholars, but also their classmates. The investment in S-STEM scholars is having a spillover effect on their classmates, on the visibility of STEM careers and education programs at the college, and on the viability of STEM careers to students in the community who might otherwise not attempt this path.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreasing the number and diversity of STEM professionals is a national priority.  Talented Students with STEM potential are everywhere and often just need a spark, a role model, direction, or financial support to reach their potential.  But Southwestern Washington has several impediments to translating STEM potential into STEM professionals.  Median household incomes are 2/3rds of the state average, only 15% of adults over 25 hold a bachelor?s degree, and the region lacks a strong cadre of STEM professionals to serve as role models for STEM students.  The goals of the Rising Tide Project at Centralia College (CC) were A) increase the number of students pursuing STEM degrees, B) increase retention and academic success of S-STEM scholars, C) enrich their learning environment, and D) facilitate the transfer of S-STEM scholars to baccalaureate institutions. \n\nA)  Recruitment.  Our efforts to expand the pipeline of students pursuing STEM degrees extended from middle school and high school students to students already enrolled at CC.  Partnering with our vigorous TRiO program, STEM faculty were actively involved in Expanding Your Horizons day for middle school girls and Career Day for high school juniors.  CC STEM faculty developed math/science programs for the Upward Bound Program, visited area high schools to promote STEM careers, and led tours of the STEM facilities on the CC campus.  CC STEM faculty partnered with the Chehalis School District to organize a week-long Summer STEM academy; as part of the activities, high school students participated in hands-on STEM workshops at Centralia College.  The Rising Tide project organized the Rising Tide Science Seminar Series.  Several times per quarter, STEM professionals were invited to the CC campus to provide insights into their careers or to describe exciting STEM projects.  These seminars were open to the campus and general community.\n\nB) Retention and Academic Success.  Efforts to increase retention and academic success focused on providing needed resources to S-STEM scholars.  Over six years, the Rising Tide project provided scholarship support to 51 students, up to $10,000 per student per year; this financial support allowed S-STEM scholars to focus more on their education and less on off-campus employment.  Each STEM scholar met with his/her faculty advisor at least once each quarter; the scholar and advisor a) developed an academic plan for the current and following quarters, b) mapped out the most efficient path to reach scholar?s academic goals, c) discussed transfer options and d) explored potential summer research or internship opportunities. During the period of this project, Centralia College established a STEM tutoring center.  While some S-STEM scholars availed themselves of the peer-tutoring assistance, even more served as tutors, an opportunity to build communication skills and reinforce core concepts from previous courses. \n\nThe success of the recruiting efforts was reflected in increased enrollments in core STEM courses, including the Biology majors series, the General Chemistry series, and the Engineering series.  The number of associates? degrees awarded in STEM disciplines were higher than before the start of the Rising Tide project.  Over 70% of S-STEM scholars earned one or more associate degrees from CC. \n\nC) Academic Enrichment.  CC STEM faculty organized field trips to visit areas of special scientific interest (e.g., Mt. St. Helens) or scientific research facilities (e.g., Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center).  S-STEM scholars were encouraged to participate in group or individuals research projects.  Engineering students sent a controlled glider into the upper atmosphere.  Biology students mapped population genetic patterns in freshwater fishes.  Geology students determined the timing of ancient lahars by dendrochronological analysis of buried trees.  S-STEM scholars joined other CC students in presenting their results at our spring Capstone Day.  Some S-STEM scholars presented the results of their research at regional or national scientific conferences.\n\nD)  Facilitating transfer.  In addition to mentorship by individual faculty advisors, STEM faculty organized workshops that focused on graduate school opportunities in STEM disciplines.  The Rising Tide project also supported visits by S-STEM scholars to potential transfer institutions.  Over 80% of S-STEM scholars transferred to a baccalaureate institution, almost all to pursue a bachelors? degree in a STEM discipline.  After earning bachelors? degrees, S-STEM scholars are pursuing graduate degrees or employed in a wide range of STEM occupations, including electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, systems analyst, health physics, fisheries biologist, and environmental scientist.\n\nMany of the initiatives nourished by the Rising Tide Project continue using institutional funding and support from the Centralia College Foundation.  There are still more boats to lift.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen F Norton"
