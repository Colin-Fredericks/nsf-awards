 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nPulmonary delivery of therapeutics represents a significant area of growth in the pharmaceutical industry. Dry powder aerosols represent the formulation of choice due to improved aerosol delivery and drug stability compared to nebulized or metered solutions.  Obtaining dry powders typically requires processing techniques such as milling or spray drying that yield polydisperse powders with large aerodynamic diameter (>5 \u00ecm), poor dispersibility and inadequate flow characteristics. Furthermore, processed particles (~1-5 \u00ecm) must dissolve or disperse rapidly once deposited in the lung to avoid being cleared by cilia or by alveolar macrophages. Nanoparticles possess desirable properties for avoiding these clearance mechanisms; however, nanoparticle aerosols are typically exhaled due to their small size.  Nanoparticle agglomeration has been identified as an effective means to incorporate the desired micro- and nanostructure into dry powder formulations. Nanoparticle agglomerates possess a low density microstructure to enhance lung deposition. Furthermore, the nanostructure of these particle assemblies dramatically improves the dissolution rate of drugs compared to microparticles of a similar size. In objectilve 1, processing conditions will be systematically studied and agglomerates characterized for two types of drug nanoparticles. Objective 2 will analyze the powder properties of nanoparticle agglomerates compared to micronized drug and correlate these properties to physicochemical traits of the agglomerates.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed research will broadly impact students, researchers, industry, and ultimately patients. Defining nanoparticle agglomeration as a pharmaceutical processing modality will provide new insights to researchers working in nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, particle processing, and aerosol science. Flocculation of colloids is currently applied in diverse industries such as waste recovery, food and health care product processing, and microbial separations. These industries will also benefit from dissemination of the results of studies proposed here. The educational cornerstone of this proposal is a program entitled ?Education through Outreach? (EtO) aimed to introduce high school students to the role of scientists and engineers in product development by enlisting them to present projects to junior high students.  The program aims to capture students at critical educational crossroads as they transition to high school or to college. This educational program will enhance student awareness of science and engineering in everyday products, spurring them on to STEM-based careers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNanoparticle formulation technology represents a portion of the  nanotechnology paradigm shift of recent history.  Nanoparticles are desired for improving  drug dissolution since &gt;50% of new drugs are poorly water soluble.   The pharmaceutical community has focused primarily on using surfactants  to stabilize drug nanoparticles as colloids.  Drying these colloids  tends to yield a broad range of random agglomerate sizes.  We have  discovered that eliminating surfactants from colloids of hydrophobic  drugs consistently yields nanoparticle agglomerates ~1-5 &micro;m in size.   Particles in this size range are highly sought after for incorporation  into dry powder inhalers.  In addition, nanoparticle agglomerate powders  were found to be easily dispersible, which may be due to irregularities  in the surface of particles, a nanoparticle \u00e6haloing\u00c6 effect, surface  chemistry, or other phenomena.  Although the observation of nanoparticle  agglomerates is not new, processing techniques for particles emulating these structural features to create  pharmaceutical aerosols represents a critical need.  We  proposed to validate process variables for drug nanoparticle  agglomeration that yield dry powder aerosols of formoterol and  fluticasone with a particle size of ~1-5 &micro;m.  The physicochemical  properties of agglomerates were then used to qualify the intriguing  aerosol performance of these pharmaceutical materials.  Our objectives were: \n\nObjective 1: Define processing variables and characterize drug nanoparticle agglomerates.  Variables  affecting the agglomeration process were thoroughly assessed by  building on our previous work to make low-density dry powder aerosols  via nanoparticle agglomeration.  Processing conditions were correlated to the resulting agglomerate microstructure and mapped on  phase diagrams.\n\nObjective 2: Identify nanoparticle agglomerate aerosol performance and correlate phenomena to powder physicochemical properties.  Nanoparticle  agglomerate aerosolization, flowability, surface adhesion, etc. was  quantified and compared to micronized drug particles of a similar  size.  The superior  aerosol properties found in dry nanoparticle agglomerates are a direct  result of structural phenomena of the agglomerates (e.g. low density and surface irregularity).\n\nProcess variables controlling the  assembly of drug nanoparticles were mapped to  corroborate basic agglomeration phenomena  of drug nanoparticles with  known mechanisms reported in the  literature.  Nanoparticle agglomerate  properties were then  thoroughly characterized and compared to micronized drug of a similar geometric size (the status quo for current dry powder   aerosols).  A variety of techniques were used to measure the size,   surface area, zeta potential, shape, density, aerodynamic diameter, and other properties of agglomerates.  Finally, these physicochemical  data were used to illuminate basic phenomena driving the enhanced  nanoparticle  agglomerate dry powder aerosol performance observed to  date. \nAs a result of this grant, our team  has defined process variables that control the assembly of drug  nanoparticles with the goal of identifying basic agglomeration phenomena  of drug nanoparticles.  We have presented results in multiple invited  talks and published manuscripts.  We expanded the types of  analytical methods used to define nanoparticle agglomerates.  For  example, our collaborators have discovered that relaxation times from  NMR data correlate to the size of crystalline domains within  nanoparticle agglomerates.  This novel approach by Dr. Eric Munson to 'look inside'  agglomerates has been presented at a Gordon Research Conference and  publications are forthcoming.\nWe used both fluticasone and budesonide steroids as model hydrophobic  drug compounds.  We also worked with salbutamol as a model hydrophilic drug compound.  Each of these  compounds is used in approved dry powder aerosol products.  Our research has focused on proce..."
