 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), entitled \"NUE: Interdisciplinary Course-Nanoscale Transport Phenomena for Manufacturing Nanodevices\", under the direction of Dr. Zhiyong Gu, will involve five faculty from three engineering departments (Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Plastics Engineering) working together to create an interdisciplinary course in which nanoscle transport phenomena needed for manufacturing of nanodevics will be presented through lectures, hands-on laboratory exercises, demonstration experiments, and a final design project.\r\n\r\nThe proposed course will translate nanoscience discoveries in nanoscale transport phenomena into workable knowledge that will better prepare undergraduates for employment focused on nano/microfluidic systems, lab-on-a-chip devices, electronics devices, medical devices, and other emerging technologies.  The impact of this senior-level course will significantly enhance the \"Nanomaterials Engineering Option\" in the Chemical Engineering undergraduate curriculum as well as the medical device industry focus in Plastics Engineering and may be used in the five-year BS-MS program which is popular in the UML College of Engineering.",
