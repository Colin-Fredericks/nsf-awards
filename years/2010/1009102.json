The\r\nheterogeneity can come from intrinsic atomic structures,\r\nexternally imposed forcing, or even numerical approximations. \r\nThe emphasis is on understanding the structure and propagation of\r\ninterfaces.  Due to the highly nonlinear interaction between the\r\nmaterials interface and background inhomogeneity, many new\r\nfeatures arise, most notably boundaries between patterns instead\r\nof pure phases, and pinning and de-pinning transitions.  In terms\r\nof mathematical disciplines, the project is related to the\r\nconcept of homogenization of singularly perturbed problems in\r\nwhich multiple scales coexist.  To tackle nonlinear problems as\r\nin the current setting, new techniques and interpretations beyond\r\ntraditional approaches are required.  The project investigates\r\nthe structure and propagation of boundaries between patterns, and\r\nthe connection between pulsating waves and singular\r\nperturbations.  Both the discrete and continuum regimes are\r\nanalyzed. \r\n\r\n     The project is highly interdisciplinary and is\r\nwell-motivated by problems coming from applied science, in\r\nparticular materials science.  It brings together rigorous\r\napplied analysis, numerical simulations and modeling in a variety\r\nof physical phenomena.  It emphasizes the connections between\r\nmultiple scales, as practical materials often are composed of\r\nstructures that have greatly different length scales.  Results\r\ncan lead to better understanding of how applied forcing and\r\nchanges of external environments can affect the behavior of\r\nmaterials responses.  This in turn can lead to the manufacturing\r\nof stronger and better materials.",
