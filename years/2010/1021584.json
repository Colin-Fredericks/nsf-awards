 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Type II project extends research and curriculum development performed in an NSF Phase I CCLI project conducted from 2007 to 2010. In Phase I, co-PIs produced Instructor and Student Guides for implementing discovery learning projects in introductory statistics courses at college and Advanced Placement (AP) secondary levels. They also developed and validated three instruments: a content knowledge test, a self-efficacy scale for statistical tasks, and a scale for perceived usefulness of statistics. Five college and AP secondary pilot instructors used the materials; student outcomes were measured using the 3 instruments and were compared to prior student outcomes for each instructor in a quasi-experimental control-vs.-treatment design. Results showed significant gains, particularly in student self beliefs and also in content knowledge. Results also showed variable effect among instructors, as well as interaction among three variables: instructor, student achievement level, and use of the materials. \r\n\r\nIn the Type II project, curriculum materials are revised to add flexibility. The control-treatment design is repeated using a geographically diverse nationwide group. In addition, the existing instruments are updated to more accurately measure student knowledge and attitude gains achieved by participating in the discovery projects. To measure teacher orientation toward facilitating these projects, a new instrument is created. Finally, the team introduces a qualitative component to the research design. The project goals are as follows:\r\n1. Promote vertical integration and wider university utility of Discovery Project Curriculum Materials: Adapt project guides to early secondary curricula; make college guides more flexible.\r\n2. Revise quantitative instruments from Phase I and use these to analyze student outcomes.\r\n3. Use qualitative research to explore interactions among teachers, students and discovery projects.\r\n4. Widely disseminate improved curricular materials and quantitative/qualitative research results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project was to study the impact of discovery based projects in introductory statistics classes on the student\u00c6s knowledge of statistics and their attitudes and opinions of statistics.  As part of this project, we developed curriculum materials to support the introduction of projects into statistics classes, which are available at http://faculty.ung.edu/DJSpence/NSF/materials.html.  These curriculum materials focus on using these projects as a means to teach content related to linear regression and 2-sample t-test procedures.  We also developed an instrument to measure the students\u00c6 statistical content-knowledge and a survey about the students\u00c6 perception of the usefulness of statistics and about their confidence in their ability to perform statistical tasks (referred to as their self-efficacy).  Our study had both quantitative and qualitative research components.\n\nWe involved eight statistics instructors from institutions across the United States.  These instructors taught their statistics courses as they would normally teach them; then we trained them to use our curriculum materials during a workshop hosted at our institution.  During the semester following the workshop, the instructors taught their classes again using projects as a means of teaching linear regression and t-tests.  Both semesters, we asked their students to complete the content knowledge instrument and the attitude survey (measuring self-efficacy and perceptions of utility).  Some pilot instructors agreed to collect the same data again in subsequent semesters, during which they continued to use our curriculum materials to implement projects.  We compared the results to see if the students who learned statistics using projects experienced any improvements over the students who did not use projects; this comprised the quantitative component of our study.  Our project also had a qualitative research component, in which researchers examined instructors' beliefs, practices, and details of project implementation in their classes, comparing instructor approaches and attempting to identify how instructor differences might play a role in varying student outcomes. \n\nBy completing our research project we have advanced knowledge in the field of Statistics Education in that there is an increased understanding of the potential implications of teaching statistical content via student-directed projects.  Prior to the start of our research, we were not aware of any other research that studied empirically the impact of student-directed discovery projects on student content knowledge and self-efficacy in introductory statistics courses.  Our findings suggest including student-directed projects in introductory statistics courses may lead to improved statistical knowledge in some domains and higher self-efficacy for conducting certain statistical tasks.  Our research also suggests that the benefits to the students increase over time as the instructors become more skilled at facilitating student-directed projects.  We have submitted two different articles to peer-reviewed journals that publish in the area of STEM Education; one of these articles covers the quantitative research component and the other focuses on the qualitative research component.\n\nRegarding the broader impact of our work, we have influenced not only our pilot instructors, but also numerous statistics instructors who have been exposed to our instructional methods and materials. We conducted two-day pre-conference workshops preceding both the 2011 and 2013 United  States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS); a  one-day workshop preceding the 2012 Joint Mathematical Meetings  (JMM); and numerous brief workshops for school systems and state practitioner conferences. We also conducted two webinars through CAUSEweb, a division of the  Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education  (CAUSE).  We also published an article on the implementation of  such projects in the Journal of Statistic..."
