 "awd_abstract_narration": "Factors at multiple spatial scales can influence photosynthesis in marsh habitats, from the species and conditions of individual plants, to the microsite variation in non-living and living resources, to the broader landscape-scale effects of tidal ranges, river inputs and oil spills. This project will study spatial patterns in photosynthesis of salt marsh plants which have been and will potentially be impacted by the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the northern Gulf Coast. The investigators will test the hypothesis that salt marshes under higher stresses will be less resilient to oil spill disturbance. A stochastic modeling approach (Hierarchical Bayesian models) will be applied to address the research question. Its ability to quantify uncertainties and reduce uncertainties by assimilating new data makes it powerful approach. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will develop a scalable and transferrable methodology that can be used in river-dominated salt marsh ecosystems around the nation. It will advance the understanding of disturbance effects on ecosystem dynamics, and can be used to guide future research and management efforts in assessing long-term impacts and recovery of marshes impacted by oil spills. In addition, the project is expected to facilitate more informed wetland restoration plans at the impacted areas on the Gulf coast. This project will provide enriching and supportive educational experiences for two graduate students who will learn the basic techniques necessary to obtain and manage field based environmental data, and updated modeling techniques.",
