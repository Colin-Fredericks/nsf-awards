 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work by Professor Peter Pintauro at Vanderbilt University to develop new fabrication strategies and new nano-morphologies for anion-exchange, cation-exchange, and bipolar membranes. Membranes will be prepared by electrospinning simultaneously nanofibers of a functional ionomer (ion-exchange polymer) and an uncharged (inert) reinforcement polymer.  The resulting dual fiber mat will be processed into a membrane with one of two phase-separated morphologies: (i) ionomer nanofibers surrounded by an uncharged polymer matrix or (ii) uncharged polymer nanofibers surrounded by charged ionomer.  In these two nanofiber composite membrane designs, the function of the charged polymer (providing pathways for ion and solvent transport) is decoupled from that of the inert/uncharged polymeric material (providing mechanical strength to the membrane and restricting ionomer swelling). Thus, the use of embedded nanofiber networks represents a paradigm shift in the way membranes are made and the way membrane nano-morphology is controlled/manipulated. Experimental work will focus primarily on anion-exchange and bipolar membranes. The resulting films will have improved mechanical properties, higher ion fluxes and conductivity, and better separation selectivity.  Applications for such membranes include electrodialytic salt separations, industrial electrochemical processes, bipolar membrane water splitting, and chemical sensors.",

Refereed journal papers and conference/invited presentations on the project results have helped to establish the embedded nanofiber mat design as an important new membrane morphology platform, where the final membranes can be used in a variety of different energy-related or separation applications. The graduate and undergraduate students funded on this grant acquired a unique and important set of experimental skills and general intellectual knowledge with regards to multi-fiber electrospinning and polymeric membrane fabrication.
