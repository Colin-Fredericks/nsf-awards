 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis RUI award to the University of Puget Sound from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research will allow for an in depth analysis of how structural changes in a series of oxadiazole and oxazole containing liquid crystals (LCs) impact the formation and stability of the biaxial nematic (Nb) phase.  This unique LC  phase, that was discovered in oxadiazole derivatives in 2004, may allow for faster electro-optic switching in LC displays.  However, the original compounds show the Nb phase at impractically high temperatures.  The awardee, Eric Scharrer, and his undergraduate students have demonstrated in preliminary work that the incorporation of lateral methyl groups into oxadiazole containing derivatives is a successful way to lower the nematic onset temperatures.  The proposed research will involve systematically changing the position of various lateral groups (alkyl and halogen) to probe the effects of both steric and electronic factors on the biaxial nematic phase.  Synthesis of the target compounds (by undergraduates and a community college instructor), and initial phase analysis, using polarizing microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, will be carried out at the University of Puget Sound.  In order to determine the degree of biaxiality present in each of the derivatives, the PI and his students will travel to the University of North Carolina to carry out more sophisticated analysis (conoscopic microscopy and 2H NMR spectroscopy).  An overarching goal of the research is to generate derivatives that show the Nb phase at relatively low temperatures, which will facilitate the exploration of device applications of these compounds by physicists and engineers.    \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nLiquid crystal displays (LCD) are widely found in a variety of applications including laptop computers, cell phones, and flat screen televisions.  Compounds that exhibit the liquid crystal phase are an integral component of these displays; molecules in this phase are reoriented by an electric field producing changes in contrast, thus allowing the production of images. The aim of the research funded by this grant is the investigation of a particular type of liquid crystal phase, the biaxial nematic phase. Specifically, the goal is to prepare new compounds that show improved stability of this phase. The biaxial nematic phase is of tremendous interest because assembly of an LCD using a compound possessing this phase may lead to significantly faster response times.  Undergraduate students at the University of Puget Sound will be directly involved in all aspects of preparation and characterization of this technologically important class of materials.    The experience they gain will be excellent preparation for graduate studies in Chemistry or a related field, or direct employment in the industrial sector. The grant also provides a summer stipend that will allow an instructor from Tacoma Community College (which has a diverse student population) to be involved in the research process.  This experience will allow her to more effectively convey to her students how Chemistry plays an important role in technology.  In addition, the PI will visit the community college to deliver presentations on liquid crystals and other materials science topics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhile most compounds melt directly from a solid to a liquid, some compounds melt first to an intermediate phase, the liquid crystalline phase, before melting to a liquid upon application of more heat.  The unique liquid crystal phase is more ordered than the liquid state, but less ordered than the solid state and molecules in the liquid crystal phase can be reoriented using an electric field.  This reorientation alters the optical properties which is what makes such compounds useful in display applications.  Liquid crystal displays (LCD) are found in variety of everyday products from cell phones to computer screens and televisions.  Such displays are made possible due to the fact that the materials used in these displays exhibit a liquid crystal phase.\n\nThe research carried out with support from this NSF grant focused on compounds thought to exhibit a unique type of liquid crystal phase, the biaxial nematic phase.  While many liquid crystal displays are constructed using compounds with a nematic phase, it has been postulated that using a biaxial nematic phase might allow for faster electro-optic switching in the device, which would lead to a better picture (especially for fast action).  In 2004, the biaxial nematic phase was found in a class of compounds possessing a certain type of ring structure (oxadiazole).  Unfortunately, the temperature at which these derivatives showed the biaxial nematic phase was very high; in order to be useful in a display application, the liquid crystal phase must be present at room temperature.  Our efforts focused on the preparation of new derivatives that might show the nematic phase at much lower temperatures.  Not only is this important for possible device applications, but lower transition temperatures would allow for a more thorough analysis of the specific liquid crystalline properties (by physicists).  We prepared a number of derivatives that possessed lateral substituents on the core molecular structure and these changes did lead to lower transition temperatures.  Notably, in some cases, the nematic phase of the compounds remained present all the way to room temperature upon cooling. Based on our analysis on how different structural features affect the phase behavior, we have been able to generate multiple compounds that show this low temperature liquid crystal phase.  In conjunction with physicist collaborators, we were the first researchers to find (by x-ray diffraction) that these compounds exhibit a specific type of biaxial order.

A total of six students (3 men and 3 women) worked with me over the course of the grant, either over the course of a summer or during the academic year.  Many of the students presented their work at national conferences and are co-authors on the aforementioned publications.  The students gained direct experience in the preparation of organic materials and the characterization of the liquid crystalline properties of these compounds and this prepared them well for graduate studies in a scientific field or employment in the industrial sector.  Three of the six students are currently in PhD programs in Chemistry or Materials Science, one of the students is in pharmacy school, and the other 2 are currently applying to graduate programs in the sciences.  In addition, an instructor from Tacoma Community College also did research with me over the course of three summers.  Since community college instructors do not often have the opportunity to participate in research, this experience allowed her to broaden her chemical knowledge.  I also know that she would frequently used examples from her research when teaching her students organic chemistry. She was also able to present her work at a National American Chemical Society conference.  In terms of the ef..."
