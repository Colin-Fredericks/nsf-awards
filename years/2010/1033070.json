 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports work to understand and engineer how important antibiotics are synthesized by microbial organisms.  In particular, the PI and his research group are focusing on the group of compounds in the tetracycline family.  Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are effective towards the treatment of different pathogenic bacterial infections.  However, overuse of tetracyclines in the last two decades has contributed to the emergence of bacterial resistance mechanisms that decreased the effectiveness of these drugs.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to overcome the resistance by developing new analogs of these natural product antibiotics.\r\nTetracyclines are synthesized by microorganisms via complex biosynthetic pathways.  The goals of this project are to 1) understand how different tetracyclines are assembled by elucidating these underlying pathways; 2) dissect the basis of the enzymes that perform these chemical transformations.; and 3) use the accumulated knowledge to engineer these pathways towards tailored bio-synthesis of new tetracycline analogs.  The long term goal is to combine metabolic engineering, protein engineering and biosynthetic engineering towards the production of new tetracyclines that may have improved antibiotic activities against resisting pathogens.  In this proposal, the PI will examine the biosynthesis of two complex, recently discovered tetracyclines in detail.  The research group will focus on the enzymes that decorate the tetracycline scaffolds in ways that were not observed before.  They will then use these enzymes towards modifications of clinically useful tetracyclines such as oxytetracycline and minocycline.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we developed a highly efficient host for the reconstitution of tetracycline biosynthesis in heterologous Streptomyces hosts.  The tetracycline family of natural products is immensely important to human health.  They have served as front line antibiotics for many pathogenic bacteria.  Newer generations of tetracyclines are continuously in demand due to their effectiveness.  The compounds also display interesting structural features that reflect novel enzymology encoded in the biosynthetic gene clusters.  However, tetracycline compounds have not subjected to the successful engineered biosynthesis approaches proven to be powerful for other families of natural products.  This is largely due to 1) the lack of efficient reconstitution in a heterologous host; and 2) the lack of enzyme tools that can modify the tetracycline scaffold.   To address these limitations, we demonstrate the heterologous biosynthesis of oxytetracycline, SF2575 and dactylocycline in Streptomyces lividans.  Using the genetically superior host, we identified numerous tailoring enzymes that can functionalize the tetracycline molecules, and generated several new analogs of tetracycline and anhydrotetracycline.  Our studies will therefore pave the way for using engineered biosynthesis to generate new pharmaceutically relevant tetracycline therapeutics.  Also in project, we studies a few key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of tetracyclines and used a combination of genetics and structural biology to understand the mechanism of enzyme catalysis. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yi Tang"
