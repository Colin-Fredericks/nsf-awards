 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will test the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) can degrade wood.  This would resolve a contemporary debate among scientists and indicate that these fungi play a greater role in carbon cycling than previously thought.  This will be done by using a monoclonal antibody method to demonstrate that wood-degrading enzymes specifically produced by EMF do, in fact, bind woody components in soils.  The PIs will use a model system in which they will attempt to develop monoclonal antibodies to laccase, lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase from a model EMF, and then use them against the soils from lodgepole pines in Yellowstone National Park.  They predict that, in a controlled field experiment, enzyme binding of substrate will increase when photosynthetic capacity of the host tree is decreased. This experiemental approach entails considerable risk due to the difficulty associated inherent in the methodology and it's application to natural soil samples.  If this project is successful, it would lead to a reconsideration of the biology of this abundant and broadly distributed group of microorganisms, and the role that they play in forest ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support a PI who is a member of an underrepresented group in science.  The research research will involve a partnership between California State University Dominguez Hills (a Hispanic-Serving institution), and NASA Ames Research Center and will include research training for one or more undergraduate students.",
