The first project, gauged\r\nmirror symmetry, combines group actions on projective manifolds,\r\nequivariant K-theory and ideas from category theory (open-closed\r\nTQFTs and a conjectural Brauer group of equivariant K-theory).\r\nOne application would be the determination of Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory of GIT quotients from the gauged Fukaya category of a\r\nsymplectic manifold. A concrete description of gauged topological\r\nquantum field theories in two dimensions is proposed, based on\r\nrecent progress by Kontsevich, Costello, Hopkins and Lurie on\r\n'extended' topological field theories. The PI has a concrete\r\nproposal for coupling a 2-dimensional TQFT to a compact symmetry\r\ngroup and quantizing the gauged theory.  This combines ideas from\r\nphysics (Landau-Ginzburg super-potentials) with earlier work by\r\nthe PI and collaborators on equivariant (twisted) K-theory and\r\nthe general index formula on moduli of principal bundles over\r\nRiemann surfaces. The second project explores the 'higher\r\nalgebras' introduced by the PI and collaborators as simplified\r\nmodels of higher categories, and the a toy example of a\r\nhomotopical TQFT for finite homotopy types. This is hoped to be a\r\ngood working ground for the interaction of exotic homology\r\ntheories with ideas from QFT. A third, closely related project is\r\nthe construction of Chern-Simons gauge theory as a 0-1-2-3 theory\r\nby topological methods, along the lines already accomplished by\r\nthe PI and collaborators for torus groups.\r\n\r\nTo explain the context of this research, one must recall that the\r\nfundamental interactions governing energy and matter in the\r\nuniverse are believed to be governed by quantum field theory, a\r\nsophisticated mathematical framework that has evolved from the\r\nbeginnings of quantum mechanics over the last century.  Quantum\r\nfield theory has never been reconciled with general relativity --\r\nanother well-supported physical theory -- and much mathematical\r\nresearch over the last six decades has centered around\r\nreconciling the two. Topological quantum field theory is a toy\r\nattempt to come to grips with the problem while avoiding the\r\nanalytical difficulties: the notions of distance and magnitude\r\n(for instance, mass) are abandoned, and the geometry of\r\nspace-time is directly related to the algebraic structure of the\r\nquantum field theory. Substantial progress in understanding the\r\nalgebraic structure has been made over the last decade thanks to\r\nwork by Kontsevich, Hopkins and Lurie. The PI's projects revolve\r\naround integrating these recent developments with the idea of\r\nsymmetry -- in the form of gauge theory -- which is known to be\r\nindispensable in realistic physical theories. (One should recall\r\nthat the so-called 'standard model' of particle physics,\r\ncomprising the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions, is\r\na gauge theory.)",
