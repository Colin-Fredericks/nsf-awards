 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program targets extended molecular capsules to address fundamental questions in physical organic chemistry and to develop novel supramolecular materials. Specific goals of the proposal are: a) preparing and characterizing new multicomponent hydrogen bonded assemblies; b) understanding the dynamics of self- and hybrid assembly processes; and c) exploring the use of these assemblies as molecular devices, delivery systems, organocatalysts and smart materials. \r\n\r\nWith the support of this EAGER award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Julius Rebek, of the Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute is exploring the synthesis and properties of molecules that completely surround other molecules. Such arrangements represent unique phases of matter in chemistry and lead to materials with potentially broad technological applications. This project serves as an excellent training ground for students in fundamental research because it exposes them to broad experiences in organic synthesis, compound characterization, spectroscopy, as well as issues in chirality, data storage and nanotechnology. This project will have an important impact on society because it will permit the Principal investigator to host, mentor and cultivate talented high school teachers and devise research plans for future high school student and teacher internships. These internships provide the early steps in the education of the nations future professors of chemistry.",
