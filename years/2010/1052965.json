The school will last 3 weeks and be located in the region of sub-Saharan Africa. There will be three main topics at the school: 1) theoretical physics, 2) experimental sub-atomic physics and 3) accelerators and technologies. The contents will be aimed primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form collaborations and partnerships.",
