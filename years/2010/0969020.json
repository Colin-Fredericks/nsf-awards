 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.  This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic).  Results from string theory have also spilled over into many other branches of physics, leading to improved understanding of gauge theories, condensed-matter physics, and heavy-ion physics.  String theory has also led to powerful new insights in mathematics.  In this project, the Texas high-energy theory group proposes to continue their quest for a deeper understanding of string theory, focusing, in particular, on its connection with cosmology.  Making progress in this field requires a many-pronged approach, and the Texas high-energy theory group plans to probe issues ranging from the proper mathematical formulation of the theory to extracting its implications for low-energy physics. At the same they also propose to proceed by following a pragmatic phenomenological approach to questions in cosmology and physics beyond the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nThe envisioned broader impact activities of this group include the professional training of graduate students and postdocs.  They also intend to continue their highly regarding outreach and education activities.  For example, Professor Weinberg has recently authored a number of extremely well-received textbooks which are widely viewed as major contributions to the dissemination of knowledge in the scientific community.  He also gives numerous public lectures.  Likewise, Professor Distler authors a blog which discusses and elucidates many of the important research papers which appear on the daily arXiv listings, and he plans to continue his activity.",
