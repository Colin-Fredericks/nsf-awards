Our ability to model combustion processes with high fidelity relies on the existence of accurate measurements of fundamental reaction rates of a smaller set of key reactions that control the reaction progress. This project proposes to measure the high-temperature rate coefficients for reactions of HO2 with CH3, C2H5, HO2, and OH. These reactions have been difficult to measure because of both the highly reactive nature of the reactants and the challenges in developing quantitative and sensitive diagnostics for the reactant and product concentrations. These reactions have been identified as major contributors to the uncertainty in the modeling of hydroperoxyl radical concentration in combustion systems. Measurements of these reaction rates will be performed in high-purity shock tubes using UV laser absorption of OH, HO2, H2O2, and CH3 radicals and mid-IR laser absorption of H2O. The overall range of temperature and pressure to be studied is from 800 to 2200 K and from 0.5 atm to 10 atm. This work will take advantage of a recently acquired tunable ultra-fast (76 MHz) quasi-CW laser system for ready access to broad deep-UV absorption transitions and recent advances in distributed feedback diode lasers in the mid-IR.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nReactions involving the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) play an important role in oxidation pathways of hydrogen and hydrocarbons. Much of what we already know about the role of these hydroperoxyl radical reactions has been derived from lower temperature (below 800 K) experiments, or from estimates. Direct experimental results for these reactions at high temperatures are rare (or non-existent) or contradictory, and are critically needed to enable development and validation of combustion kinetic models. The development of new and sensitive species diagnostics methods are also needed to advance these studies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThis research will provide an opportunity to train a new generation of engineering scientists in modern combustion kinetics and state-of-the-art laser diagnostic and shock tube techniques. These techniques have provided, in the past, the highest quality high temperature kinetic data available and continue to be a source of reliable information.\r\nPublic dissemination of this data through the web using current databases (the Kinetic Database Utilizing Shock Tube Measurements at Stanford and the PrIMe data warehouse currently located at Berkeley) will provide the public, government workers, and other researchers with the information needed to critically understand combustion processes. With one of the important problems facing Americans today being the generation of greenhouse gases from combustion processes and the subsequent effect of global warming, the proposed research is both appropriate and needed.",

Expanding computer resources have enabled more complex descriptions of combustion, for example by the use of larger reaction mechanisms, in actual devices such as engines.  However, our ability to model these combustion processes with high fidelity continues to rely, for the most part, on the existence of accurate measurements of fundamental reaction rates of a smaller set of key reactions that control reaction progress.  Many of these reactions have been measured directly with varying accuracy, but some have eluded researchers\u00c6 attempts at measurements for many years.  In particular, with the development of smaller, high-powered and more efficient automotive engines, there is a critical need for accurate measurements of transient radical species and their reactions, which play an important role in determining the rate of ignition processes.  HO2, the hydroperoxyl radical, is one of these transient radical species, and it and reactions of this species are very difficult to measure.  Under this grant we have measured several of the HO2 reaction using shock tube and laser absorption methods:  HO2 + CH3 = Products, HO2 + HO2 = H2O2 + O2, HO2 + OH = H2O + O2, OH + H2 = H + H2O.\n\nTo study these radical-radical interactions, we have taken advantage of sensitive and quantitative laser absorption diagnostics for reactant (e.g. OH, HO2, H2O2, and CH3) and product (e.g H2O) species found in these hydroperoxyl reactions.  We were aided in this task by a tunable ultra-fast (76 MHz) quasi-CW laser system that we have recently acquired though support by the US AFOSR, that enables ready access to deep-UV absorption transitions of radicals such as HO2 and CH3, and by recent advances in DFB (distributed feedback) diode lasers in the mid-IR that enable sensitive, quantitative detection of H2O.  These new and sensitive laser absorption diagnostics have enabled the study of these radical species at much lower concentrations than were previously possible, thus significantly reducing interference from secondary reactions in the reaction rate measurements.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this work stems from the fact that reactions involving the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) play an important role in the oxidation pathways of hydrogen and hydrocarbons.
