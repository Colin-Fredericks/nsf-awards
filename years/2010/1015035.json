  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCharacterization of amylose tris-(3,4-methylphenyl carbamate)\n\n     Analytical chemistry is in the forefront in many of today's critical industries.  Criminal investigators, pharmaceutical companies, and medical diagnostics are all relevant fields that use analytical chemistry techniques. These techniques include: liquid/gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and protein/DNA sequencing.  Within the field of liquid and gas chromatography polymers surfaces are used to interact with mixtures of unknown materials to determine the individual components and their relative percentage in those mixtures.  These mixtures may be samples from crime investigation sites (blood, hair, soil, or paints) or dangerous impurities in pharmaceutical products (contaminants, residual starting materials, or additional unwanted reaction products).  \n     At the present time we can analyze pharmaceutical products to determine the existence of impurities in individual batches of the material.  Unfortunately, we cannot predict which polymer will detect specific impurities.  When a new drug is developed for the market extensive research is devoted to methods of detecting the presence of impurities in each drug product.  The characterization of the amylose carbamate polymer is important due to the need to understand the nature/structure of the polymer used in the liquid chromatographic analysis of pharmaceutical products.  The amylose tris-(3,4-methylphenyl carbamate) polymer is one of the most widely used materials in the analysis of pharmaceutical products, yet very little is known about how it interacts with mixtures that contain pharmaceuticals.  The purpose of characterizing this polymer was to increase the amount of information know about how this amylose polymer interacts with individual molecules.  \n     Dr. Taihyun Chang at Pohang University of Science and Technology specializes in the analysis of polymer structures.  As a result, his research group was a perfect starting point for the characterization of this amylose polymer.  Before the analysis of this amylose polymer in Dr. Chang's lab, only one structural analysis of the polymer had been reported by Dr. Yoshio Okamoto research group (Yamamoto, C.; Yashima, E.; Okamoto, Y. J Am Chem Soc 2002, 124, 12583&ndash;12589).  The work done in Dr. Chang's lab did increase the amount of information know about the amylose polymer's structure.  The new information included: molecular mass distribution, structural linearity, solvent compatibilities, and solubility limitations.\n      The new information collected using the NSF's EAPSI award does suggest a number of contributions to the field of chromatography and additional future work to complete the goal of making a predictive model for the separation of pharmaceutical products.  The amylose polymer is not the only structure used in the analysis of pharmaceutical products, four additional polymers are used to optimize the analysis of impurities in pharmaceutical materials.  The structural analysis that Dr. Okamoto completed for the amylose was applied to only one additional polymer structure.  The four remaining polymer structures can be analyzed in a similar manner as the amylose carbamate polymer with similar data collected about each structure.  Molecular modeling software can then be used to determine the important chemical interactions that create the proper analytical conditions to detect impurities in pharmaceutical products.  Further characterization of all five polymer structures will also allow models to be created that take each polymer into account when predicting if impurities will be detected on the individual polymer. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel G Putnam"
