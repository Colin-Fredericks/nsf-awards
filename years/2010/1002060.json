 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposal is to investigate novel compact geometries that overcome the traditional temperature sensitivity of Si nanophotonics enabling future computing systems that with high bandwidth  and low power.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nWe propose to control the thermal drift of photonic structures by tailoring the degree of confinement in silicon waveguides. We aim to achieve structures that self compensate for temperature effects based on such waveguides with dissimilar thermal drifts. Our preliminary work shows the possibility to tailor the thermo-optic drift of an interferometric structure. This technique of thermal stabilization is completely passive and fully compatible with current microelectronics fabrication processing. We propose to use this approach for demonstrating a 40 GHz WDM modulator system stable with temperature.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe fundamental knowledge gained in this research on temperature insensitive devices and in particular temperature insensitive modulators is also applicable to other novel photonic structures such as optical routers, switches and filters as well as other optical materials system such as glass-based compounds. We propose to develop an educational program for exposing students to photonics as an interdisciplinary area and enhancing the undergraduate and graduate Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum in the area of photonics. An interdisciplinary seminar series will be developed for undergraduate and graduate students and will cover research areas related to photonics such as: photonic materials, biomedical applications, and optical computing. We also propose to introduce novel subjects of photonics in courses of the electrical and computer engineering in Cornell university to include active research areas.",
