 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Syracuse University ADVANCE project proposes to link the intellectual, cultural and economic development of women faculty in the STEM disciplines through a ?connective corridor? that is intended to create a sustained culture of equity for the campus.  To this end, the project has four initiatives that include: a networking initiative that links women faculty to each other and to potential mentors and other resources on campus; a corridor initiative that provides professional development and opportunities for partnerships with industry; a recruiting initiative that focuses on women of color and women with disabilities; and a practices initiative that supports leadership development for all faculty members.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  This project has impressive intellectual merit in that it combines well established social science research methods with social network analysis.  Additionally, the project uses novel approaches for the inclusion of male advocates and women from industry are highlighted in the proposal.  Other novel components related to this project include a 360o evaluation of the networking initiative, faculty of practice positions and fundraising to implement endowed professorships for women faculty.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  The Syracuse University ADVANCE IT project will include women scientists from the academy and from industry.  As such, the breadth of the impact of this project extends far beyond the institution and includes atypical ADVANCE institutions as well.  Additionally, this project has a focus on an underserved population of women faculty in STEM disciplines, those of color and those with disabilities.",
