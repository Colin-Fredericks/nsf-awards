 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Shelia David and Jared Shaw at the University of California - Davis for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support nine students per summer in a ten week program.  The research projects focus on chemical research applied to problems in energy and catalysis.  Sample projects include:  (1)  protein engineering and synthetic biology for biofuel production; (2)  the study of the electrocatalytic, multielectron reduction of carbon dioxide into liquid fuels; (3)  the study of the enzymes involved in Photosystem II; (4)  the study of the catalytic mechanisms of biosynthetic enzymes; (5)  the study of the repair of damaged DNA by enzymes ; (6)  the structural and kinetic study of photosynthetic enzymes; (7) the development of new silicon-based catalysts; (9) the synthesis of novel thermoelectric materials; (10) the optimization of C5 and C6 sugar co-utilization in biofuel synthesis, and (11) the assembly of nanosheet diodes for sunlight to fuel conversion .   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including industrial site-visits as well as workshops to develop strong communication skills.  Students will be recruited from a number of institutions, including a number of schools that are minority-serving.  In addition, this REU site will recruit blind and visually-impaired students through a partnership with the National of the Blind.\r\n\r\nYoung scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The research projects are in areas of chemistry that will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur UC Davis ChemEnergy REU provided a diverse group of undergraduate students during the summers of 2011, 2012 and 2103 a unique ten-week research experience taking advantage of the distinct strengths of our faculty and University.  A key feature of our program was a focused theme on \"Energy and Catalysis.\"  With this theme in mind, students were exposed to the use of chemical principles and techniques toward developing new catalysts and energy sources, and the broader role of chemistry in solving important economic and societal problems.  This focused theme provided opportunities for cooperative learning between the students and laboratories involved and reinforcement of important basic concepts to provide a lasting impact on the student\u00c6s education.  The focused theme also provided an important identity and cohort experience for the students in the program.  REU faculty and students also worked together to improve the student\u00c6s skills in critical thinking and science communication.  The students made impacts on the research programs of the laboratories that they worked in by allowing for new projects to be started and explored or by participating in providing key pieces of data for on-going project.  The research results of the students were reported in publications in peer-reviewed chemical journals (7 in print, 3 in preparation) and at oral and poster presentations at scientific meetings.  Thus, the REU students made impact on the research programs of UCD faculty and made important contributions to the long-term goals in solving key problems in chemistry related to energy and catalysis.\n\n \n\nOver the course of our program, we recruited 26 highly qualified students (avg. GPA = 3.7) from a range of institutions across the U.S.  Our group of students was diverse with a high percentage of under-representated minorities (11/26, 42%; 3 African Americans, 6 Hispanic, 2 Native American) and women (12 males, 14 females). Both of these groups are under-represented in Chemistry, and STEM fields.  Of the 26 students that participated, 25 have since graduated from college: 14 are in chemistry graduate programs, 7 in post-graduate research or industry positions (and most of these are planning to apply to graduate programs), four are in health-related jobs or medical school.  Of those going to graduate school, it is clear that the research experience at UCD had a direct impact on their choice of fields&mdash;they have all chosen research areas similar to that of their REU experience. This illustrates the impact of a research experience as an undergraduate in the long-term impact of the student\u00c6s careers.  This also indicates that creating a diverse workforce in chemistry and STEM fields to solve problems in the future is greatly aided by exposure to cutting-edge scientific research during the undergraduate years.  Most of the students gave presentations on their REU research at their home institution and at research conferences thus providing an opportunity to teach other students about the important chemical research enterprises that they were involved in during their summer REU.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheila S David"
