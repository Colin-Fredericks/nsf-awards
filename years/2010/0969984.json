 "awd_abstract_narration": "Desktop computers are employed to model the double ionization of atoms by high-intensity visible or infrared laser light.  Of particular interest is the process of \"non-sequential double ionization\", in which two electrons share the energy from a large number of laser photons and escape an atom.  The dominant mechanism for this process is now accepted to be recollision, a process in which one electron moves outward from the atom, absorbs energy from the laser, then returns and shares energy with the other electron.   Many parts of this process are turning out to be describable using classical physics rather than quantum mechanics, and a significant component of the project involves investigating the limitations of classical analysis.  In addition, the final momenta of the doubly ionized electron pairs and possible correlations between these momenta are investigated.  Chaotic behavior in the classical system is investigated, as well as the importance of laser intensity, frequency, and pulse shape in the ionization process.  Recollision lies at the heart of the growing field of \"attosecond science\", and the present work helps to provide a solid foundation for that growing area.\r\n\r\nImpacts of this project emerge from scientific knowledge that is gained, from computer techniques that are developed and from educational components.  Many systems, particularly molecular ones, are too complicated for full quantum analysis, but may be amenable to classical analysis.  The knowledge gained in the present study regarding the limitations of classical analysis should prove useful in these other areas.  The computer techniques being developed in this project are adaptable into other areas and will be useful to other researchers in coming years.  In addition, and very importantly, the project features extensive involvement by undergraduate physics students.  They benefit not only through increased knowledge of the field and improved computer skills, but also through the development of thinking skills and intellectual habits.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe topic for the study was theoretical modeling of double ionization of atoms by intense laser fields of visible or infrared wavelengths.  The double ionization process is dominated by recollision, a process in which the laser first removes one electron from the atom but then impels it back to the atom for \"recollision\" with the other electron, so that energy is shared between the electrons. The process is of considerable interest in atomic physics because of the rich dynamics and the number of things that can occur at recollision.  The double ionization process appears to be well explained by classical physics.\n\nFor the first three summers of the grant, from two to four undergraduates were involved in fulltime research under the supervision of the PI.  Two of these students were able to attend a major conference, with one of them giving a poster presentation.  In a subsequent summer, this student continued limited research on the project.  All four of the students went on to graduate school, three in physics and one in philosophy.\n\nThrough this project we learned some new physics regarding classical modeling.  We had noted that during the time period between when the first electron is removed from the atom and its return for recollision, the remaining electron could sometimes escape from the nucleus without receiving energy from the second electron. We learned that in an oscillating laser field a classical electron in a low angular momentum orbit can gain energy if it establishes the right phase between its atomic oscillations and the laser oscillations.  This nonlinear physics is important for understanding the characteristics of classical models that are employed to investigate the double-ionization process.\n\nWe also showed that in quantum mechanical studies of ionization and recollision, it is an oversimplification to claim that after one electron is stripped from the atom, the other resides in the ground state.  Instead, the inner electron is left in a changing superposition of states.  At recollision, the state distribution for the inner electron is modified, and the returning electron may also be described in terms of being in a mixture of bound and continuum states.  This makes for a very rich recollision process.  The mixing of the states explains in part why classical modeling of the process works so well and why there is no sharp threshold for the double ionization process.\n\nThe PI gave four presentations from the work at international or national conferences plus one presentation at another university. One or more students joined the PI at two of the conferences, with one student doing a poster.   The PI also was a featured speaker at the 2012 Western Michigan Undergraduate Science Research Conference, where he presented an overview of this work.   Students also did oral and poster presentations at Calvin College.  So far one paper has been published in a refereed journal, with other papers still in preparation.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stanley L Haan"
