 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-local dynamics is an emerging interest in physics across many disciplines, from condensed matter physics to particle physics to quantum gravity. This project explores the effects of non-local dynamics as realized in the context of a certain class of string theory models of particular interest to cosmology. The string theory embedding of these models assures that the exotic frameworks encountered are physically and logically self-consistent. Yet, such non-local systems remain poorly understood, with many counter-intuitive features and apparent paradoxes. This project aims to unravel general features of non-local dynamics as they arise in this class of string theory models, and apply these results to modeling the primordial plasma of the universe. \r\n\r\nThe project also involves undergraduate education as an integral part. This is achieved through a two-pronged approach: (1) through the direct participation of undergraduate students in the research within a program that has already proven to be highly successful in involving undergraduate seniors in string theory research; and (2) through the development of a senior-level undergraduate course and textbook to help prepare students for competitive graduate programs in theoretical physics. The project also includes a multi-pronged community outreach component involving a web-based instructional resource, and a public lecture series on current topics at the frontier of theoretical physics.",
