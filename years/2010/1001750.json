 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a 3-year sequence of regional conferences in Algebra, Combinatorics & Number Theory. The goals of the conferences are to encourage and stimulate research efforts of regional PhD students in mathematics and computer science, to foster collaborations among senior researchers and students, and to further strengthen the developing group of researchers in the Rocky Mountain region in the focus areas.  A tentative list of topics is: 2010 Topic: Expander graphs, Speaker: H.A. Helfgott (University of Bristol); 2011 Topic: Finite Geometry and its applications, Speakers: Gary Ebert (University of Delaware) and William Kantor (University of Oregon); 2012 Topic: Algebraic Graph theory applied to complex networks, Speakers: Sebi Ciaoba (University of Delaware). Each conference will have two plenary speakers. Those listed have already confirmed their participation. The remaining slots will be filled in consultation with the speakers to support the chosen topic.\r\n\r\nGraduate student involvement will be a high priority. Graduate students will be encouraged to present their research, and the schedule will be designed with break-outs and problem sessions so that faculty can offer suggestions and direction to the students. Creating an environment to foster new collaborations will be another priority, and the topics and speakers have been chosen because of their timeliness and the high potential for collaborations with regional faculty. The project provides funds to defray some of the travel expenses for speakers and participants. Priority for travel funds will go to minority applicants and graduate students. The project will (a) provide an encouraging environment for young researchers and graduate students, (b) inform researchers of some of the latest developments in Algebra, Combinatorics and Number Theory, and (c) strengthen collaborative, and interdisciplinary research ties among mathematicians in the Rocky Mountain region.",
