 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project in gravitational physics is largely in support of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  It will be theoretical, although in many aspects closely related to experiments.  In LIGO instrumentation, this project seeks to finalize the optical-configuration design of LIGO detectors after the successful initial operation of Advanced LIGO; it will also critically evaluate optical configurations for third-generation detectors, the next major upgrade to LIGO, while continue to generate new ideas.  This project will continue to study how gravitational-wave experiments will probe quantum mechanical behavior of macroscopic objects.  In gravitational-wave data analysis, this project seeks strategies that enable fast detection of compact binary systems (consisting black holes and/or neutron stars) by incorporating advanced signal-processing techniques.  In general relativity theory, this project seeks to shed light on the dynamics of the highly curved space-time of binary black-hole mergers. \r\n\r\nThis project will increase the scientific output of gravitational-wave astronomy by contributing to the short- and long-term improvement of instruments, by optimizing data analysis strategies, and by improving understandings of gravitational-wave sources. It will eventually lead to the experimental proof (or disproof) that quantum mechanical laws also apply to macroscopic (human-sized) objects.  This project will also have the following broader impacts: (i) It will serve as a training ground for young theoretical physicists, through solving a broad range of problems. (ii) The PI will assume teaching responsibility at Caltech. He plans to update the web-based course in gravitational-wave science that he assisted Professor Kip Thorne in creating. This course has helped train graduate students at Caltech and other universities and institutes, and has made gravitational-wave science accessible to scientists and engineers throughout the world. (iii) Through cooperation with Glendale Community College, results of cutting-edge research in gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a diverse student body; participation of research projects by students with stronger math and physics background will encourage them to pursue a career in science and engineering. Through web pages and demonstration programs, gravitational-wave science will be communicated to a broader audience in the general public.  (iv) The PI will carry out research in collaboration with scientists in Germany, Australia, Japan, and Russia.  These collaborations will strongly influence the design of the European third-generation gravitational-wave detector, the Einstein Telescope, and maximize scientific output of prototype detectors in Australia and Japan.",

This project covered theoretical research in gravitational-wave sources and gravitational-wave instrumentation science. Commenced in 2010, this project continued till 2015, right before Advanced LIGO interferometers started their observations.\n\n In gravitational-wave source physics, the group made significant progress in the black-hole perturbation theory --- the theory of how black holes deform and oscillate, and how waves propagate around black holes.  They first elaborated the connection between photons\u00c6 orbits around a rotating black hole and the frequencies at which the black hole oscillates --- and the rate at which these oscillations die off. They then discovered new features of the oscillation of a highly rapidly rotating black hole --- one that is approaching the maximally allowable rate.  Based on these research, members of the group later deduced possible turbulent behaviors around Kerr black holes, which could have profound implications in understanding \"gravity-fluid duality\", a relation that may hold the key toward understanding the reconciliation between quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nIn collaboration with Professor Kip Thorne, the group invented a new approach toward the visualization of highly curved space-time geometry --- using the stream lines of the so-called Weyl Curvature tensor. These stream lines are roughly analogous to electric and magnetic field lines in classical electromagnetism. This approach has lead the group to construct a series of analytical models that intuitively explained the \"superkick phenomenon\" in binary black hole mergers: some mergers of binary black holes were found numerically to acquire a final kick velocity up to several thousand kilometers per second.  Besides inducing analytical insights, this visualization can also provide the general public with pictures that have direct connections to the highly curved geometry.  \n\nThe group made important contribution to data analysis algorithms that were fast in detecting the mergers of two neutron stars in LIGO --- even before the final collision takes place.  The group also applied the method of Reduced-Order-Modeling (ROM) to waveforms from binary black-hole mergers, and constructed an algorithm for establishing a template bank for these waves using the minimum amount of numerical simulation.  These contributions dramatically increased our ability to extract science from LIGO observations.\n\nBeyond Advanced LIGO, sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors must be further improved to guarantee a fruitful research program in gravitational-wave astronomy.  The group not only analyzed the best possible ways to upgrade Advanced LIGO, but also pointed way toward future improvements.  In particular, by analyzing white-light cavities, they found that in order to improve sensitivity further it is necessary to study components of the interferometer that are individually unstable, but would otherwise be stabilized as part of the entire system.  The group also studied thermal fluctuations in the mirrors, and provided new theoretical frameworks for designing and interpreting experimental data involving mechanical damping of mirrors.\n\nIn gravitational-wave observations, macroscopic objects are being monitored at the Heisenberg Uncertainty.  The group formulated theoretical strategies to prepare quantum states of macroscopic objects that have no classical counterparts --- this will eventually lead to the confirmation that macrosocpic objects behave like waves. The group also proposed to the study of quantum systems whose self gravity is important. They pointed out a possible experimental path toward finding ruling out the possibility that gravity could be classical, instead of quantum.\n\nThis project also had broader impacts beyond the above scientific achievements.
