 "awd_abstract_narration": "Echinoderms include familiar animals such as starfishes, sea urchins, and a wide array of extinct forms stretching back to the Cambrian Period, circa 500 million years ago. Echinoderms share a common ancestor with backboned animals and thus provide a crucial link to understanding a huge portion of the entire tree of life as well as the history of our species. This project, the Echinoderm Tree of Life Project, will resolve the phylogenetic placement of Echinoderms within the tree of life and clarify important unresolved relationships among major echinoderm lineages using data from genetic sequencing and anatomy.\r\n\r\nEchinoderms are fascinating, and their unique features, such as mutable ligaments and novel means of detecting light, have biomedical engineering applications.  Because research on such marine animals and their adaptations is naturally attractive to young people, excellent students are expected to be recruited and the importance of science will be communicated to a broad audience. Long-term impacts, embodied by scientific publications, textbooks, anatomical and genomic data, and extensive pages in the Tree of Life and Encyclopedia of Life web projects, will provide resources to researchers and educators.  Outreach will include videos and broadcasts about marine exploration and applications of fundamental biological research across the biomedical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe portion of the larger Assembling the Echinoderm Tree of Life project conducted at the University if Tennessee centered around understanding the evolutionary history of the many classes of echinoderms that went extinct during the Paleozoic Era (542-251 million yeas ago) and have no modern descendants that can be sampled genetically.  Our work began with a detailed analysis of homology &ndash; similarity of structures in organisms that resulted from shared descent &ndash; because many of the terms used to describe morphologies in echinoderms referred to different structure in closely related taxa.  This line of inquiry resulted in series of papers, scientific presentations, and public lectures on the topic.  The resulting homology scheme is now commonly used among the Paleozoic Echinoderm research community and has been used by several researchers to investigate the evolutionary relationships among fossil organisms.  This work was critical because the data used to infer the evolutionary history of a group comes from the transformation of homologous structures through time.\n\n            Our lab group produced evolutionary trees for several echinoderm groups during the run of this project.  The tree developed for small discoidal echinoderms called edrioasteroids showed that several early forms with unusual morphologies form one lineage whereas the more typical medallion like forms formed a second.  This investigation flowed directly from the work on homology.  Our work on edrioasteroids forms the basis for the revision of the edrioasteroid chapter of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology which is the standard reference work on fossil invertebrates.\n\n            One of the graduate students who worked on the project developed a new set of homologies for a group called diploporitans and demonstrated that it consists of three distantly related groups of echinoderms that evolved similar respiratory structures.  This work highlighted the importance of using the total morphologies of specimens rather than basing classification on a single feature that may have evolve more than once.\n\nA second graduate student project on an important echinoderm group called blastoids explored this group using the emerging field of virtual paleontology where images of sectioned specimens, along with advanced imaging such as CT scanning, were digitally visualized in 3D.  Respiratory structures from several blastoids species, and in one individual a digestive tract, were processed and rendered by three undergraduate students who were trained in several visualization software packages.  The resulting models were used to show that the older classification based on the external expression of the respiratory structures poorly represented blastoids evolution.  The models were uploaded to publicly available file share sights associated with the resulting publications. \n\n            Three graduate students were trained during the course of this project in research, public outreach, and mentorship.  So far, two of these students have completed their degrees and have become women scientists in permanent academic positions.  All of these graduate students were active in disseminating their results in the peer reviewed literature as well as talks and posters at professional meetings.  Mentorship of graduate students included learning how to manage undergraduate researchers in STEAM research.  The PI supervised graduate students as they trained undergraduates in research related to specific research question with which they were involved. Undergraduate students presented their research at professional meetings and were included in several peer review publications.  Two of these undergraduate students went on to graduate school in STEAM fields.  Public outreach for this project took the form of presentations at avocational societies such as the Cincinnati Dry Dredgers, the Kentucky Paleontological Society and the Knoxville Gem and Mineral Society.  These included talks by each of the doctoral students involved in the project. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Colin D Sumrall"
