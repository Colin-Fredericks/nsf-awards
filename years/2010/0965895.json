 "awd_abstract_narration": "S-STEM scholarships are being awarded to two consecutive annual cohorts of 12 students who are interested in biology and chemistry. Because supportive social networks are key factors in STEM retention, we are designing programs to support STEM students from diverse backgrounds guided by two themes: 1) research preparation and opportunity and 2) interdisciplinary connections. These programs build on existing programs and incorporate new initiatives including a three-week pre-college bridge program focused on data analysis; science advising clusters; a new first-year interdisciplinary course emphasizing research preparation and interdisciplinary communication; peer-led supplemental instruction and group study; a new workshop series in Research Preparation and Career Opportunities; expansion of our Summer Science Program; and attendance at professional meetings by cohort members. This project is retaining students from groups with traditionally low STEM retention rates, and thus is broadening participation in STEM fields. By opening programs to the broader STEM community, the S-STEM cohort's influence is strengthening the overall culture of the institution's STEM students.",
