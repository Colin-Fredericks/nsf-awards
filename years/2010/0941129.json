 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators (PIs) plan to carry out an exploratory research campaign in a mega-city environment in Tianjin, China (near Beijing).  The PIs will focus on three topics: 1) accuracy and completeness of the gas phase emission inventory with an emphasis upon understanding emission sector contributions; 2) analysis of ozone indicator species, photochemical processing of volative organic compounds (VOCs) and related features of VOC/NOx (nitrogen oxide) limitations in the region; and 3) investigation of particulate emissions and aging with an emphasis upon partitioning of semi-volatile compounds (SVOC) between gas and vapor phases. The end products will be a better understanding of ozone and aerosol formation and fate within this megacity region and a better basis for placing the impact of this megacity in perspective with respect to future change in China.  In the three week field program, the PIs will operate from a tall flux tower. This will involve chemical speciation of ambient VOCs and size distributions of aerosols coupled with NOy, CO, SO2, and O3 measurements and boundary layer lidar sensing.  This work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from the local Tianjin University as well as with NCAR scientists, who will be at the field site during the same time period (September 2010).\r\n\r\nGaining an initial understanding of atmospheric chemical cycles within this region will benefit overall understanding of megacity impacts on regional and global chemistry and thus benefit societal decisions regarding global change. The work will also target undergraduate and graduate student education through the PIs' NSF REU atmospheric chemistry program and a new and novel Atmospheric Policy Trajectory (APT) program.",
