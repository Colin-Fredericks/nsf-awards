 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Eastern Michigan University to establish a Phase I Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) in collaboration with the College of Exploration, Michigan State University, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, Ashland University (Ohio), RISA and the Graham Sustainability Institute, the Knight Center for Environmental Journalism, the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network, and the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum. The overall goal of the CCEP Phase I project is to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts. This project is focusing on climate change education in the Great Lakes region. The formal and informal education activities associated with the project are targeting an audience including STEM educators, pre-service teachers, public and business stakeholders, as well as the general public. The project is implementing an inventory of regional climate change research/education resources and creating an associated network map of existing interrelationships and partnerships. It is designing and implementing a virtual Great Lakes community platform that is linking project partners and collaborators. The project is convening a series of community focus groups that are producing white papers outlining the breadth and scope of climate research in the region and identifying the pathways of movement of emerging science and learning science knowledge from the scientists and laboratories in the region to the formal and informal education providers. The PIs are developing a comprehensive planning document that is providing the partnership with realistic goals and objectives for future climate change education efforts in the region. The systemic network being developed by the project is 1) enabling explicit partnering of educators, climate scientists and learning scientists; 2) broadening the participation of underrepresented groups by enhancing opportunities for populations within the Great Lakes region, many of whom have been significantly affected by both recent and long-standing economic downturns, both economically and in terms of educational opportunities; 3) enhancing the regional infrastructure for research and education; 4) disseminating Great Lakes climate science through partnerships with formal and informal education institutions; and 5) benefiting society by building partnerships among academic, non-profit, and governmental entities that together are working to improve climate change education in the Great Lakes region.
