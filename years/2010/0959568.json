 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor John J. Bozzola and colleagues Samir M. Aouadi, Peter Filip, Punit Kohli and Shing-Chung Max Yen from the Integrated Microscopy and Graphics Expertise (IMAGE) facility at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale will acquire a high resolution, field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). This facility is used by a large number of researchers in fields as diverse as biomolecular sensing to atmospheric to geological sciences and engineering. The facility is administratively housed at the Graduate School. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) studies of nanoscience applications to bioanalytical and materials chemistry; 2) adaptive nanocomposite and textured tribological coatings; 3) dendron-functionalized superconducting iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as pH-sensing MRI contrast agents; 4) application development using carbon nanotubes, nanowires and carbon nanotube-based hybrid materials; 5) surface phenomena and imaging of nanostructures to study the interplay between surfaces and bulk electronic properties of individual nanostructures; 6) study of modified matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) targets as advanced platforms for biomarker screening/comparative proteomics; 7) studies of the generation, processing and fate of atmospheric particulate matter; 8) applications of  sol-gel derived materials; 9) study of bacterial degradation of cellulose; and 10) study of oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals.\r\n\r\nA scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a widely used technique for providing an image of a sample surface. The image is obtained from scanning the surface with a beam of electrons. This mainstay technique enables scientists to see the ultrastructural details of fabricated systems, molecular arrangements of man-made nanostructures and the subtle changes associated with friction and wear in surfaces. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry, geology, biochemistry and the environment. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",

NSF-funded SEM has also been used for collaboration with many industrial companies for helping our industrial partners improve their products and development new products.
