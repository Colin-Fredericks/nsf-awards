 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a Systems Security and Software Security in Senior Projects (S4-SP) program to incorporate aspects of software security, computer, network, operating systems and database security into all phases of capstone projects. The four major goals of the S4-SP program are: (a) develop course modules in the areas of systems security, software security and cryptography; (b) integrate and use the course modules in the Software Engineering and Senior Capstone Project courses; (c) develop a Virtual Security Lab (VS Lab) that can be remotely used by other institutions; and (d) develop a sequence of two elective courses on Systems Security and Advanced Information.\r\n\r\nThe S4-SP program establishes a model for incorporating aspects of systems security and software security in a capstone project. The security learning modules are self-contained and no prior security background is required. The security control implementations in the Senior Projects are platform-independent.\r\n\r\nJSU is a Historically Black University (HBCU) and more than 90% of its students are African-Americans. Other HBCUs and smaller institutions can efficiently incorporate the security modules as an essential component of their undergraduate Computer Science curriculum without requiring a dedicated security course. The Virtual Security Lab is accessible to other institutions at no additional cost.",
