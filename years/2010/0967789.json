 "awd_abstract_narration": "0967789\r\nLuo\r\n\r\nOrganic polymer based photovoltaic (PV) cells are a sustainable and potentially cost-effective device platform for the conversion of solar energy to electricity.  However, the solar energy conversion efficiency of current polymeric solar PV devices is still only around 6%.  A fundamental issue that limits the performance of polymeric solar cells is the disparity in achieving high efficiencies for light absorption, exciton dissociation, and free electron diffusion towards the cathode.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nIn this research, self-aligned, electrochemically grown, conducting polymer nanowires will be used to create an ordered, inter-digitated, donor-acceptor heterojunction that has the potential to substantially increase photovoltaic efficiency.   The first objective is to understand the growth of self-aligned conducting polymer nanowires and nano-porous polymers by an electrochemical deposition process, in order to control nanowire dimension and density.  The second objective is to optically and electrically characterize these materials, and then establish a correlation between growth conditions and nanowire properties. The third objective is to fabricate and test a conducting polymer, nanowire based, interdigitated heterojunction photovoltaic device.  These studies are expected to establish fundamental relationships between device performance parameters and material / device preparation conditions.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is potentially transformative because it seeks to develop a new approach for the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency polymeric photovoltaic devices.  Furthermore, the proposed research has the potential to improve basic understanding of nanoscale material growth mechanisms for conducting polymers, and therefore has the potential to open up new opportunities for organic optoelectronics. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe proposed education and outreach activities focus on course development and training of high school teachers.   Research outcomes will be integrated a course on optoelectronic and nanoelectronic devices at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The principal investigator will use the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach at CMU to deliver a training/education program for high school teachers in nanoscience, where they will receive hands-on experience in nanoscence and learn how to bring these concepts into the classroom.  Teachers will receive training/education credit hours.",

To date, however, there are still major issues preventing organic solar cells from practical applications.   Among them, efficient carrier extraction has become an outstanding problem, especially now it has been demonstrated that internal quantum conversion efficiency in polymer solar cells has reached ~ 100%.  Currently, bulk heterojunction represents the state of the art device configuration for organic polymer solar cells.  Fundamentally, low carrier collection efficiency can be caused by geometry and morphology of the donor and acceptor phases, as well as basic material properties such as defect density and intrinsic carrier mobility, etc.  Two correlated but distinct approaches have been taken trying to solve the following problems: 1) poor percolation and electric continuity of each phase and their random connection to anode and cathode, 2) imbalance carrier transport of electron and hole due to intrinsic low hole mobility in conducting polymers.  The project contains the follow major thrusts:\nThrust (I): Electrochemical growth of nano-porous polythiophene-based conducting polymers and its application in bulk heterojunction solar cells:\nElectrochemical polymerization of 3-D poly-3-methyl-thiophene (P3MT) nano-networks was investigated.  It was found that oxidation current density of 0.5mA/cm2 or higher is required to create significant 3-D nano-structures.  Efficient P3MT/PCBM bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the 3-D P3MT nano-networked structures. In these devices, completely percolated nanoscale donor and acceptor phases can lead to efficient dissociation of exciton followed by effective transport of hole and electron towards anode and cathode, respectively. \nThrust (II): Electrochemical growth of metallic CNT-polythiophene core-shell nanowires and its application in polymeric solar cells:\n\nNovel metallic carbon nanotube (CNT) &ndash; polythiophene (PT) core-shell nanowire networks have been prepared electrochemically by growing polythiophene around the interconnected metallic CNTs. Donor-acceptor heterojunction was fabricated subsequently by infiltrating PCBM into the openings of the CNT-PT core-shell nano-network structures.

To achieve more ideal 3-D conductive nano-network systems has been a main focus for the recent study.  The study includes two separate approaches: 1) 3-D CNT nano-networks and 2) 3-D gold nanowire networks.  New methods that can significantly improve the 3-D CNT and gold nanowire structures are reported.\nThrust (IV): Extremely flexible polymeric solar cells based on transparent CNT electr..."
