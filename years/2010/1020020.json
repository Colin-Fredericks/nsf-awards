 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a grade 3-5 Learning Progression that will provide a coherent approach to teaching energy in elementary school and will lay a strong foundation for further learning in middle school. This work draws on and complements the learning progression and curriculum for matter being developed and tested in the Inquiry Project (NSF award 0628245).  The project will identify a network of core concepts and principles about energy fundamental and general enough to be compatible with scientific ideas about energy, yet within reach of 5th graders, that could allow productive learning in middle school. In collaboration with teachers, clinical interviews and \"teaching interviews\" will be administered to 3rd, 4th and 5th graders, recruited from urban after-school programs, to identify precursors to the core ideas, as well obstacles to learning them.   The project will outline a grade 3-5 learning progression for energy taking into account the findings as well as relevant standards, curricula, and science education literature.",
