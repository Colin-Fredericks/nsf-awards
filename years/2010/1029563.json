The PI will take advantage of Matlab's parallel computing engine which has advantages over lower level coding. The research goal is to write high-level, but rapid performance codes. The Matlab \"distributed computing engine\" will be installed as part of the cluster operating system. This will allow a very large distributed memory model and facilitate 3-D computational experiments. The cluster will be used to develop codes simulating 3-D multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradients, quadratic velocity/linear pressure elements, 3-D unstructured mesh relocation algorithms, transport, diffusion and melting algorithms, and boundary condition analyses. Additional studies in reservoir engineering and sustainable energy will be supported. The high-level code development will allow more rapid research results and the new cluster will open up research themes in computational geosciences previously unable to be entered by the PI. Student training will be enhanced by the higher-level code capabilities and processing power. A pending IGERT proposal focusing on sustainable energy would be a beneficiary of this system. The PI along with students will assemble the machines and load the OS and Matlab software. The geodynamics group will perform any necessary repairs. \r\n\r\n***",
