 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore novel all-dielectric metamaterials that can provide integrated resonance responses due to interaction between resonating inclusions. The approach is to combine theoretical studies, computational full-wave modeling of multi-element arrays, designing various material architectures, and prototyping.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The performance of metamaterials with negative refractive index is mainly analyzed by using homogenization theory, which does not account for the effects caused by resonance field spreading beyond resonator boundaries and integration of multiple resonance responses due to resonance field overlapping. This project aims to reveal the contribution and potential of cooperative resonance phenomena and to develop advantageous all-dielectric alternatives to existing metamaterials. Integration of knowledge from different disciplines, employment of powerful simulation tools, and approbation of the latest achievements in materials integration will provide deep insight into the nature of wave processes in engineered structures with integrated resonances, advance understanding of the refraction, cloaking and wave confinement effects, and uncover unknown metamaterial properties. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Development of low-loss all-dielectric metamaterials with new functionalities will trigger innovative solutions for radio frequency, microwave, and photonic devices and systems. This work will impact communication, imaging, medical, and homeland security equipment. Expected advances will enrich research and education opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will attract students to the complex field of electromagnetics. Dissemination of new knowledge will be provided by its incorporation into interdisciplinary courses and by publications and presentations at national and international conferences including the newly organized workshop ?Women in Electromagnetics.?\r\n",
