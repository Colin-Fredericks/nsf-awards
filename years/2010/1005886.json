Upgrades to the WNMU campus network will reduce network file transmission delays and establish network access at new locations on the campus. NNMC will expand broadband access on campus by: 1) establishing a new fiber optic link between two buildings on campus, 2) upgrading campus network switches and routers, and 3) providing new campus-wide wireless service. NTC cyber improvements will leverage a larger Internet to the Hogan project initiated in 2000 that has four major components: 1) educating in advanced wireless and high performance computing; 2) partnership building within the computational science community; 3) deploying an advanced wireless network to serve the Navajo Nation's most remote communities; and 4) building the Din\u00e8 Grid which provides high value educational, telemedicine, public safety, research, and communication tools to the college and to the Navajo people.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe campus network is expected to improve reliability and security, enabling development of an integrated library search and retrieval system and increasing student access to collaboration technologies and online research tools. The upgrade will facilitate deployment of the campus gateway connection to the New Mexico Computing Applications Center. The project will enhance synergy among NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 and Track-2 research efforts in the areas of climate and water resources.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe three institutions engaged in this project are rural, regional, minority-serving institutions with missions and educational programs geared toward workforce development. NNMU is 70% Hispanic and 5% Native American. NTC is 99% Native American and WNMU is 49% Hispanic and 2% Native American.  The three institutions serve significant populations of female and non-traditional students. The broadband and cyber connectivity improvements resulting from the project activities will enable enrichment of course content, expanded delivery areas, and stronger workforce development programs. Enhanced collaboration with other institutions in New Mexico, including research and course sharing through distance education, will be enabled through these investments.",
