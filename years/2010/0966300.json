 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UWP)proposes to increase the number of students, particularly women, entering the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Science(EMS) and retain them through graduation.  The plan is to offer 140 scholarships over a five-year period to academically talented but economically disadvantaged students, who are seriously interested in Electrical, Civil, and Environmental Engineering, Mathematics and Science careers.  The Engineering programs all received the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accreditation.  A Program Leadership Team (PLT) consisting of Principal and co-Principal Investigators (PIs and co-PIs) is to oversee all aspects of the program.  The UWP administration, student support services, and the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Science are all committed to assisting with program goals and objectives.  Letters of commitment from all groups signed by each individual are provided.  In addition, the housing department is committed to developing a living and learning environment, where STEM scholars are within proximity of each other. \r\nThe project is aligned with the mission of the University of Wisconsin system.  The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UWP) is one of thirteen, four-year comprehensive campuses supporting the University of Wisconsin System's Growth Agenda for Wisconsin 2009.  As a STEM focused campus UWP is leading the system-wide initiative and is to play a key role in meeting this growth agenda for Wisconsin.",
