 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grassland ecosystems comprise over 30% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and provide a resource base for extensive agricultural activities such as ranching. Grasslands are sensitive to climate change because they exist where hot, dry weather is common and rainfall is unpredictable, and because their plant communities may rapidly shift in response to rising climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Grassland soils contain large stores of long-lived carbon, which could either buffer climate change, or accelerate it if this carbon is released to the atmosphere. Soil microbial communities are the ultimate drivers of soil carbon uptake or loss. This project investigates how plant-microbe interactions regulate soil carbon cycling within an ongoing, state-of-the-art, manipulative climate change experiment in grasslands near Cheyenne, Wyoming, the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment. Thirty plots are exposed to combinations of climate conditions, including warming and CO2 conditions expected to occur before the end of the 21st century, and altered precipitation. An important component of the experiment is the comparison of carbon and nutrient cycling between native and disturbed grasslands with distinct plant communities, including invasive species. Laboratory and growth chamber experiments applying molecular and isotopic methods will test specific hypotheses generated from observations and measurements in the field. This project is expected to reduce uncertainties related to interactions between soil nutrients, biological communities and climate change, leading to improved predictions of future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and associated warming effects.\r\n\r\nThis project will reach out to agricultural resource management agencies, ranchers and landowners who are concerned about impacts of climate change, disturbance and weed invasion on rangeland productivity, by conducting annual Field Days at the PHACE site and publishing articles in the popular press. Cross-site collaboration and data synthesis will be promoted by incorporating soil data into a comprehensive database. The project will provide strong interdisciplinary training to two graduate students, several undergraduates, and two postdoctoral scientists from under-represented groups. In-service middle school science teachers participating in the University of Wyoming Master's of Science in Natural Science degree program will be invited to the field site for hands-on lesson development, and minority high school students will be mentored. The new Summer Soil Institute at Colorado State University (http://soilinstitute.nrel.colostate.edu) will bring students to the PHACE field site for sampling and analyses.",
