 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI requests funding to test the feasibility of instrumenting an unmanned vehicle, the Liquid Robotics Incorporated (LRI) Wave Glider, to run standard oceanographic lines like those found in the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CALCOFI) program. It is intended that Wave Gliders will make the standard set of underway observations currently performed on CALCOFI cruises. By providing a more cost-effective approach to collecting these types of data, Wave Gliders can become integral components of a continental-scale, integrated ocean-observing system. A major part of the proposed research effort involves the development of a scientific quality echo sounder with the appropriate multi-frequency capability, data storage, payload characteristics, and low-power consumption required for successful integration with the Wave Glider. In addition to the proposed use such an echo sounder will support other applications in bioacoustical oceanography and fisheries acoustics that take advantage of the scientific and economical benefits of unmanned vehicles and Lagrangian platforms (e.g., drifters, floats, and gliders).  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   \r\n\r\nThe wave glider seems like an innovative platform for an echo-sounder because it stays on the surface, has continuous satellite GPS and data telemetry, and the potential for solar charging. An echo-sounding capability on such a platform would be a significant advancement for biological/fisheries research and management. Imagine the benefit of augmenting or even replacing expensive ship operations that currently run echo-sounder transects for fisheries surveys with a fleet of cost efficient gliders that could provide better spatial and temporal coverage.  In addition to the development and demonstration of a new sampling technology that may ultimately gain broad utility within the ocean science community the proposed activity will also provide experimental data to support at least one doctoral dissertation and will provide advanced instrumentation development experience to at least one Master of Engineering candidate. The PI has identified a specific doctoral student and an as-yet-undetermined Master of Engineering student who would be supported as graduate research assistants; there is no specific mention of efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups.",
