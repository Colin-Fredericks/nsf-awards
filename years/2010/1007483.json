 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, James Tour, Stephan Link and Angel Marti of the William Marsh Rice University will develop and study molecules that exhibit controlled motion on a surface, \"nanocars\".  The approach is to synthesize \"nanocars\" that incorporate fluorescent moieties within their frameworks and to continue expanding the repertoire of molecular parts that can be used to build these molecules.  The PIs will also incorporate molecular entities into the \"nanocars\" that exhibit photon driven rotation and may acts as a propulsion mechanism for the molecules.  Finally, the PIs will develop optical microscopy methods for tracking and characterizing the translation motion of the individual molecules and to utilize these methods to measure quantities such as collision frequencies and diffusion coefficients.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  Additionally, the PIs plan to develop informal science learning approaches aimed at middle school students.  Major principles in book chapters from middle school science curricula will be translated into bullet points, developed into dance songs (with professional help) and then added to open source Step Mania and Jamming software packages. \r\n\t\r\nThis work will enhance our fundamental understanding about controlling individual molecular movement across a surface.  Ultimately, such work could lead to the development of molecular machines that could control chemical transport and fabrication at ultrasmall dimensions.",
