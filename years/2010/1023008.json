 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit.  Membranes compartmentalize the cell interior and separate each cell from its environment.  The general dogma is that proteins form the transport pathways by which specific molecules are translocated across these membranes.   However, a naturally-occurring lipid, ceramide, has also been shown to form large channels capable of translocating proteins across membranes.  This coincides with ability of ceramide to initiate a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis.  A key step in this process is the release of proteins from mitochondria, likely through ceramide channels.   Proteins known to regulate the protein release (members of the Bcl-2 family) also regulate ceramide channels.  The proposed research is to understand how proteins control ceramide channels.  Since much evidence suggests that ceramide channels are rigid structures, highly cross-linked by hydrogen bonding, a working hypothesis is that proteins bind to the channel causing a structural change that ripples through the entire structure to form the channel.  This and other hypotheses will be tested using both kinetic and thermodynamics approaches and microfluidics.  In addition, the interactions between the proteins and ceramide channels will be probed by mutations in the protein and the use of chemical analogs of ceramide.  These complementary experiments will yield insights into the novel regulation of lipid macrostructures by proteins and will link biophysical and mechanistic understanding of cell biological function.  This research will also add to our understanding of the extremely important cellular process of apoptosis.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The work has and will continue to involve the training of students at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels. Typically five to seven undergraduates (majoring in engineering, chemistry or biology) and one summer student from a local high school will work closely with the principal investigator.  The research has also greatly influenced the teaching of the investigator.  His growing recognition of the importance of understanding the underlying physics of biology has led him to advocate for a radical change in the teaching of physics to undergraduate life science majors.  As a pilot project, the PI will continue to teach an honors course entitled 'Physics of Living Systems' as part of a new physics curriculum, which will be expanded during the project period.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNature always seems to be more complex and more interesting than our current understanding.  The textbook function of lipids does not include the ability to form membrane channels and yet we find that ceramide, a lipid, does just that.  Further in textbooks, lipids are small molecules that can control the function of proteins yet we find that proteins control the ceramide channels.  A key step in the decision-making process leading to cell elimination by apoptosis is the formation of channels in mitochondria that release key proteins into the cytosol and yet we discovered that ceramide channels can do this and are controlled by the very proteins that control the onset of apoptosis.  We have made great progress in understanding these new phenomena and thus expanded our knowledge of what is possible, in addition to contributing to our understanding of the control of the process of apoptosis.   Having access to novel structures we have explored some of their physical properties.  These ceramide channels are larger in diameter than they are in thickness.  Thus they can be thought of as water-filled circles in the membrane each composed of hundreds of small lipid molecules that are weakly interacting, i.e. not connected together by strong bonds.  When we apply lateral pressure, they deform like a circular elastic does and like the elastic it returns to its previous shape when the pressure is reduced.  Again these properties have not been seen before and give us a window into the mechanical properties of nanoscale structures.  In addition to the ceramide channels, we have studied channels formed by a protein called Bax.  This is one of the proteins that regulates the ceramide channels but it also forms channels on its own.  To understand this regulation it is important to understand how each component acts separately.  Here again, the expectation from the literature was that Bax would form membrane channels in a simple way but we found unexpected complexity and beauty.  Bax can form large channels like ceramide but also small channels with complex properties.  The small ones seem to exist as triplets of small highly interacting channels.  These are also controlled by the voltage across the membrane in the same way that the channels responsible for the function of the nervous system and muscles are sensitive to membrane voltage.  These behaviors of cooperativity and voltage dependence reveal another layer of regulation and control previously unimagined.  When cells must decide whether to live or die, they need to integrate many signals and thus have many levels of regulation to help make the right decision.  In spite of this, wrong decisions are made leading to inappropriate cell death in stroke and heart attacks or lack of death of damaged cells as in cancer.  Thus understanding the layers or regulation is critical to be able to affect the outcome in a positive way.  Our discovery of new levels of regulation contributes to this process.   \n\nIn addition to the scientific advancement, the research has helped to train 4 graduate students and many undergraduates.  The experiences they have gained enriched their education and helped them determine their career direction.  Students from all walks of life worked together and helped each other to learn and perform challenging research tasks and solving problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marco Colombini"
