The meeting focuses on recent developments in ordinary differential equations, nonlinear evolution equations, dynamical systems, and applications.  The conference features plenary talks from leaders in these fields, as well as contributed presentations by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty.\r\n\r\nThe conference will foster collaborations between junior and senior researchers, providing recent PhD recipients with opportunities to present their work and to make contacts with researchers from other institutions.  The proceedings of the conference will be published as a supplemental volume of the Journal of Nonlinear Systems and Applications.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and minorities.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.math.usf.edu/7thde/",
