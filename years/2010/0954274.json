 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of species remains an especially difficult problem in biology because the processes through which reproductive barriers arise between diverging populations remain poorly understood. This project will advance understanding of the origins of diverse tropical plant taxa through study of the nature of reproductive barriers in Metrosideros, a highly diverse genus of tropical forest trees that vary in their degree of divergence and isolation.  This project will integrate molecular genetic methods and field experiments to determine the nature and degree of pre- and post-zygotic barriers to hybridization between co-occurring taxa at sites that vary in rates of natural hybridization. \r\n \r\nThis research will provide insight into the speciation process in long-lived forest trees, a group that is responsible, directly or indirectly, for much of the high diversity of tropical forest ecosystems. This CAREER project integrates research and education to promote scientific literacy and skills at all levels of the education pipeline in one of the most culturally diverse regions of the U.S.  The project will engage students from underrepresented groups in the STEM pipeline, which will broaden the career choices for these individuals while helping to advance the diversity of the science and technology workforce. The project includes development of graduate and undergraduate courses that include authentic research experiences, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to K-12 teachers and students.",

There are an estimated 100,000 tree species in the world, and trees are enormously important to commerce and the stability of ecosystems and climate, yet little is known about the processes that lead to the formation of new tree species.&nbsp; Hawaiian <em>Metrosideros</em> is a young (~4 million years old) group of at least 18 woody varieties or species that dominates the islands&rsquo; native vegetation and appears to capture multiple stages of the speciation process, like snapshots in time.&nbsp; <em>Metrosideros</em> taxa vary in vegetative traits, including leaf size, color and hairiness, and range from a mat plant that flowers when just a few inches high to trees over 40 m in height that can live more than 650 years.&nbsp; These forms occupy different habitats within the islands&rsquo; highly variable landscape, suggesting that ecology has played a principal role in the diversification of this group.&nbsp; The CAREER project involved field and controlled-environment studies of ecological divergence between taxa, hand-pollinations to examine fertility between taxa, and genetic marker-based studies of isolation among taxa, among other studies.&nbsp; The educational objectives of this program involved the integration of research and education at the undergraduate and graduate levels and in K-12 schools.&nbsp; This was done through investigative courses and curriculum enhancement in undergraduate and graduate programs, research training of undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach to local K-12 students and teachers through the establishment of the NGO, Hooulu Lehua, whose mission is &ldquo;to inspire growth in the native forests and youth of Hawaii.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Study results indicate that light quantity and quality, soil nitrogen, soil water-logging, temperature, and the mechanical stress of river currents are important drivers of divergence among <em>Metrosideros</em> taxa.&nbsp; Microscopy studies of leaves revealed micromorphological differences among taxa consistent with local adaptation to contrasting environments in addition to the obvious macromorphological differences.&nbsp; Adaptation of taxa to different environments is associated with selection against hybrids between closely related taxa and hybrid vigor observed in crosses between more genetically distant taxa.&nbsp; Our results also reveal a mix of partial intrinsic (environment-independent) barriers between taxa, including reduced hybrid fertility as a key intrinsic isolating barrier at the early stages of speciation in this group. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these results are still being prepared for publication, which is anticipated within two years.&nbsp; Ongoing studies are continuing to characterize the nature of post-fertilization isolating barriers across the speciation continuum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: This project has yielded the most diverse living collection of Hawaiian <em>Metrosideros</em> anywhere, including ~500 pure-taxon individuals (of 13 taxa) and intra- and interspecific first-generation hybrids (of various combinations of taxa) from controlled crosses and air-layering of branches in the wild; a small portion derive from an earlier NSF Research Initiation Grant.&nbsp; The collection is housed on the University of Hawaii Hilo campus and is a highly valuable resource for research, teaching and outreach, especially considering the current threat to Hawaiian <em>Metrosideros</em> caused by the <em>Ceratocystis</em> fungus (i.e., causing \"Rapid Ohia Death\"). &nbsp;Through its integrated research and education plan, the CAREER project sponsored the mentoring of 12 undergraduates, 11 M.S. students, and one postdoc, and the engagement of &gt; 350 G4-12 students in environmental education or hands-on research experiences through Hooulu Lehua.&nbsp; By engaging students of all ages every year - from G4 through graduate students - including many from under-represented and/or under-privileged groups - the CAREER project exposed a broad range of students to locally relevant science and related career opportunities.&nbsp;
