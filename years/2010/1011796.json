 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, M. G. Finn of The Scripps Research Institute will design and prepare dynamic polymers based upon reversible covalent bonding.  The approach is to develop rapid and quantitative nucleophilic substitution reactions based upon reversible intramolecular anchimeric assistance, to apply these methods to dynamic polymer synthesis and dynamic polymer crosslinking, and to adapt the reactions to building dynamic surfaces.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate students and graduate students, enhancing infrastructure for research and education through collaboration between groups at The Scripps Research Institute and UC Santa Barbara, and hosting a local high school or teacher for summer research in each year of the project.\r\n\r\nThis work will enhance our fundamental understanding about dynamic polymers: long chain molecules that have an average length at any given moment but constantly break apart and reform over time.  Polymer chains are the fundamental units of many materials, including plastics, and the development of new types of polymers could lead to new applications in biomedical materials, coatings, and composites.",
