 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering program supports research to 1) better understand how the cell regulates the production of medicinal alkaloids from cultures of the Madagascar periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) and 2) use a new strategy based on gene silencing to enhance the production of these critical pharmaceutical compounds.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project will improve the production of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) in cultures of Catharanthus roseus.  C. roseus produces several highly-valued pharmaceuticals, including the anti-cancer drugs vincristine and vinblastine, but the slow growth rate of the plant and the low concentration of product are significant barriers to efficient drug production.  The high cost and need for these pharmaceuticals motivate our research to better understand their biosynthesis and ultimately overproduce these compounds using C. roseus cultures.  The goals of the proposed research are to describe the transcriptional regulation of enzymes required for TIA biosynthesis and to design an effective engineering strategy for overcoming innate blocks to TIA biosynthesis.  The specific aims of this research are 1) to develop transgenic C. roseus hairy root cultures with altered expression of transcriptional regulators, 2) to characterize the alkaloid profiles and transcriptional profiles of genes relevant to TIA biosynthesis, and 3) to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of TIA production. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of TIA biosynthesis will provide the basis for new genetic engineering strategies for enhancing TIA production from C. roseus cultures. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The vision of this research is to address the need for an alternative supply of critical plant-derived pharmaceuticals using plant cell cultures.  Increasing the volumetric productivity of these pharmaceuticals from plant cell cultures will reduce the cost of the drug to the patient and enable a dependable supply of the drug.  In addition, the PI/Co-PI will 1) incorporate concepts and examples from their research into their courses and develop new lab modules, 2) co-advise graduate students and undergraduates in interdisciplinary research that applies biochemical engineering, genetic engineering, and molecular biology approaches to this research, and 3) support K-12 STEM education by hosting teachers and students through hands-on research experiences in their laboratory.",

Cram\n\nNSF Project Award Title: Transcriptional Control of Alkaloid Biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus Cultures\n\n\n\nThis NSF-funded research project focused on understanding how plants regulate the biosynthesis of valuable pharmaceutical compounds.   Plants are a rich source of valuable medicines; in fact, 25 - 50% of all prescription drugs used in the U.S. are extracted from plants or are based on chemical structures originating from plants.  Specifically, we study the production of a class of compounds known as terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) from cultures of the medicinal plant, Catharanthus roseus.  The C. roseus plant produces several highly-valued pharmaceuticals, including the anti-cancer drugs vincristine and vinblastine.  The high cost ($4 &ndash; 20 million/kg) and need for these anti-cancer compounds motivate our research to better understand their biosynthesis and ultimately overproduce these valuable TIAs economically using cultures of C. roseus.  \n\nThe goals of this research project were to investigate the regulation of TIA biosynthesis in C. roseus cultures by the plant hormone jasmonate, and to increase TIA production by manipulating the levels of their molecular switches with genetic engineering and jasmonate.  \n\nOur findings illustrate two molecular mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of TIA biosynthesis in C. roseus, which are regulatory motifs potentially found in the regulation of other plant compounds.  In the regulation of TIA biosynthesis in C. roseus, jasmonate induces the expression of molecular switches that turn on and turn off TIA biosynthesis.  The level of the on- to off-switches are tunable by jasmonate dosage and control the level of TIA production.   In C. roseus, one molecular mechanism involves the co-induction of the off-switches by high levels of the on-switches, resulting in a feedback mechanism for attenuating the activation of TIA biosynthesis.  The second molecular mechanism for tight regulation is the compensating function of other off-switches. \n\nIntellectual merits:  Through this research, two challenges for enhancing TIA biosynthesis and overcoming its tight regulation were uncovered. This fundamental understanding is relevant to how plants control the production of its defense-related compounds.\n\nBroader impacts:  The vision of this research is to address the need for an alternative supply of critical plant-derived pharmaceuticals.  By understanding the regulation of TIA biosynthesis, more effective strategies can be designed for improving the production of TIAs or other pharmaceutical compounds from plants.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carolyn W Lee-Parsons"
