An emphasis on students from the Four Corners area, especially Native Americans, is important to the continued growth and development of this region. To achieve the goal of increasing the number of well qualified US citizens in technical areas the following objectives are central to ASP.\r\nObjective 1: Increase the number of students graduating in engineering, physics, and math.\r\nObjective 2: Provide 15 scholarships per year to financially needy, academically talented students who meet the academic criteria and show a strong potential to be a successful graduate.\r\nObjective 3: Provide academic mentoring, cohort activities, and support services that enable ASP Scholars to successfully complete their undergraduate degree.\r\nObjective 4: Improve workforce integration by strengthening partnerships between the College and industry partners throughout the Four Corners Region.",
