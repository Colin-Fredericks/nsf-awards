 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaboration between the University of South Carolina and Marshall University.  It is establishing strategies to aid faculty in the design and implementation of special instructional modules (EFFECTs) designed to foster critical thinking. This proposal leverages the success of a Phase I CCLI project that defined the pedagogical structure for the EFFECTS, generated six EFFECTs, and developed an assessment methodology. Each module contains three elements: 1) a decision worksheet that guides an initial design for the first class period, 2) active learning modules and journal questions during the next n class periods, and 3) material to guides a group discussion to produce a final design during the last class period.  Using these modules in several classes under the earlier grant led to gains in the students' core knowledge and critical thinking skills. Developing a systematic approach that enables other faculty to use EFFECTs is a key aspect for disseminating the approach widely through the engineering education community.  To achieve this, the investigators are working to develop instructional material to teach the EFFECTs to faculty, to expand current assessment tools, to develop a community of practice to support the design and implementation of EFFECTs, and to assess the strategies developed to design and implement EFFECTs.   Dissemination is being accomplished through web postings, including links with the NSDL, through conference presentation and journal publications, and through faculty workshops.  A comprehensive evaluation effort, under the direction of an independent expert, includes the monitoring of student learning outcomes using instruments for measuring scientific reasoning skills, critical thinking skills, and content knowledge.  Broader impacts include the dissemination of the material and the evaluation results, faculty workshops, and outreach through existing K-12 programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF project focused in the implementation and assessment of Environments For Fostering Effective Critical Thinking (EFFECTs).  The primary goal of EFFECTs is to stimulate critical thinking in engineering students.  This is accomplished by providing students with an environment conductive to foster critical thinking including an appropriate context, engaging realistic engineering problems, the opportunity to provide estimates for these problems and revise these estimates as new content is learned.  The outcomes of this particular award can be divided i) effectiveness of the EFFECTs, ii) training for instructors, iii) development and dissemination strategies of EFFECTs.\n\nAn introduction to Civil Engineering course used focusing on EFFECTs was shown to be effective in increase the number of students returning to sophomore year in good academic standing (81%) when compared with students that did not take this course (67%) in a three year study.  Students also reported a preference of EFFECTs when compared to the methods used in other science and engineering classes and thought that the concepts taught using EFFECTs were easier to understand than in traditional classes.\n\nEFFECTs were implemented through a Civil Engineering curriculum at the University of South Carolina.  This implementation has shown several benefits such as improving the instructional skills of faculty, engaging students using active learning, and promoting self-reflection and critical thinking.  Furthermore, EFFECTs could have an influence in the development of professional skills, something that is often difficult for instructors to include in their engineering courses.  One hundred percent of the students responding to an optional senior survey indicated that they agree or strongly agree with the statement \"Overall, the EFFECTs exercises created opportunities for me to work in teams\".  The number of EFFECTs students experienced during their studies also had an influence on their perception on their professional skills.  Students that were exposed to more than one EFFECT had a higher overall rating when asked if EFFECTs help them develop ABET professional skills such as written and oral communication skills, contemporary issues, and understanding professional and ethical responsibilities of engineers.\n\nA significant effort was done in developing material to help instructors develop and implement EFFECTs in their courses.  The EFFECTs framework requires faculty to be familiar with active learning and other pedagogical strategies.  A EFFECTs framework was designed to help faculty develop EFECTs and implement EFFECTs in stages, increasing their chances of success.  This framework was taught at annual workshops hosted at the University of South Carolina, Marshall University and at one American Society of Engineering Education South East Section meeting.  Overall over 100 instructors and graduate students attended the workshops and EFFECT focused presentations organized bu the PIs.\n\nAn online repository was developed for EFFECTs as part of the dissemination plan.  The repository can be found at http://sdii.ce.sc.edu/effects.  A total of 218 users visited the site in 2014 alone.  The site has 30 active learning modules and 12 full EFFECTs to date.  This repository is serving other research and educational projects based on the EFFECTs methodology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juan M Caicedo"
