 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to measure the temperature distributions along the tool-chip interface and along the tool-workpiece interface, through transparent cutting tools, during the machining of hard to machine alloys. Two non-contact optical thermography techniques, namely, infrared thermography and two-wave laser induced fluorescence, will be used for full-field, high resolution measurements of the temperature fields along the surfaces of cutting tools. Transparent cutting tools of two designs will be used to optically access the rake and flank faces. Tool coatings made of temperature sensitive phosphors will be applied over transparent tools to enable fluorescence thermography. A newly developed split-optic will be used to simultaneously measure the infrared intensity in two wavelengths. The spatial resolution of the measurements will be from one to ten micrometers. With two-wave laser induced fluorescence, temporal resolution as low as one microsecond can be achieved. These capabilities will represent a major improvement over the current state of the art. \r\n\r\nThe development of thin film sensors for high speed, full field, surface temperature measurements will be of use in a variety of applications requiring non-contact temperature monitoring. This study will be the first application of fluorescence thermography to study cutting temperatures and will lead to the first direct observations of the flank face temperature of new and worn tools. Measurement of the variation of the temperature distribution through the thickness of the workpiece will help improve our understanding of the plane stress to plane strain transition. The measured temperatures will help validate finite element simulations of machining, and lead to improved material constitutive models, friction models and tool wear models. Research results and methods will be incorporated into academic courses. A partnership will be formed with the McNair scholars program at Wichita State University to attract underrepresented students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary inspiration for this project comes from the need to make a direct measurement of temperature at the point of contact between a cutting tool and the work material.  Models for predicting the deformation of metals during cutting rely partly on precise knowledge of the temperature at the contact point.  Most measurements currently available are indirect and involve an estimate with a finite error.  Our project anticipates development of a new technique that would provide access to the contact point temperature by interrogating a surface with a suitable laser stimulus and a subsequent fluorescence from a doped oxide phosphor.  Our research partner is Wichita State University, who have the necessary background for developing the temperature measuring technique, and we at Northwestern University possess the oxide coating background for developing the phosphor coating to be applied to the cutting tool.  The model for this first effort will use a sapphire cutting tool, because it is hard, has predictable properties, and is transparent to the laser light and the fluorescence.  The phosphor coating must have similar mechanical properties and high temperature resistance as the sapphire for the cutting tool application.\n\n \n\nOur project involved the synthesis (by reactive sputter coating) of an Al-Y-oxide (YAG or yttrium-aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12)) doped with Dy for use as a phosphor material that can be excited by a laser. Other applications could use such coatings that enable the direct measurement of temperature in extreme environments where measurement may not otherwise be possible or is at best unreliable.  The initial stage of the project involved building the sputtering system and the development and calibration of the process to create Al-Y oxide.  The next stage focused on the further process development and characterization of such films and included the use of heat treatment (ranging from 500C to 1000C) to create crystalline films from the amorphous deposits.  The final stage required the doping of the sputtering target (alloy with 3:5 ratio in Y:Al) with Dy and creating the doped crystalline coating on sapphire substrates.  Tasks included inserting Dy into the metal alloy target and calibrating the resulting composition in the coating (typically a few at%). By the end of the project, crystalline, doped coatings had been fabricated for initial testing.  However, there was not enough time or funding to be able to supply coatings to our collaborators, as the project came to an end.  Four undergraduate engineering students were trained in the process development and in characterization techniques such as  SEM and XRD during the project.  Laser and IR testing were to be done by a research group in Wichita State Univ.  If this work could be pursued, further fine-tuning of the process would be needed to improve adhesion of the films and a range of concentrations would be investigated to determine the optimum doping level.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael E Graham"
