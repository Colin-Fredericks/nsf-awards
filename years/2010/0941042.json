 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project, which is a collaboration involving Northern Illinois University, Texas A & M University, and North Carolina State University, is to develop course materials in modern manufacturing technologies and establish methodologies for collaborative teaching and learning of these materials. The course materials reflect advanced manufacturing processes recently adopted by industry and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and have the potential for significant near-term impact on industry. The course is taught simultaneously at all three universities and the students are collaborating across university boundaries and so the project includes significant efforts in the design and development of collaborative teaching and learning mechanisms. The evaluation, being conducted by an experienced evaluator, is examining the effectiveness of the instructional material and strategies and the effect on student learning. The project team is disseminating through website postings, conference presentations, and journal publications.   Broader impacts include the dissemination of the instructional materials and results.",
