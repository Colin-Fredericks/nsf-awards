This meeting will assemble a diverse group of experts, young researchers, and students working in the quickly-developing interdisciplinary field of applications of analysis on graphs to mathematical physics, nanotechnology, microelectronics, chemistry, materials science, photonics, number theory, discrete groups, and fractals.\r\n\r\nThe conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.  \r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/AGA/agaw06.html",
