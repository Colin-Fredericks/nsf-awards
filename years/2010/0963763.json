 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fifth Pacific Rim Conference on Mathematics (PRCM) will be held at Stanford University from June 28, 2010 through July 2, 2010. The organizing committee consists of Tai-Ping Liu and Richard Schoen. It will be a high-profile, broad-based conference covering a wide range of areas of mathematics which are well represented in universities on the Pacific Rim. The PRCM will have 10 sessions each with a plenary speaker and six session speakers. The sessions are in the following areas: 1) Algebraic Geometry, 2) Combinatorics, 3) Differential Geometry, 4) Electromagnetic Waves, 5) Functional Analysis, 6) Kinetic Equations and Gas Dynamics, 7) Mathematical Imaging, 8) Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, 9) Number Theory, and 10) Random Systems and PDEs. The full list of organizers and speakers is available on the conference website at <http://math.stanford.edu/PRCMindex.html>.\r\n\r\nThe PRCM was conceived in the middle 1990s by a group of mathematicians from over 10 major universities on the west coast of the United States, in Canada, China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Korea, and Australia. It has been held every three years since 1998 in various locations on the Pacific Rim. This summer's PRCM will be the first to be held in North America. \r\nOne of the main reasons for initiating this meeting was the recognition that the Pacific Rim region is not only economically vibrant, but also becoming increasingly important in scientific research. The objectives are to present the latest trends in mathematical research to a wide audience and to develop stronger ties between mathematicians in the Pacific Rim region. We expect the PRCM to be attended by approximately 200 mathematicians from Pacific Rim universities.",
