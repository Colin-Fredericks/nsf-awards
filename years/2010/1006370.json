 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nPolymeric membranes are widely used in technologies ranging from municipal water treatment to food processing to industrial gas separations. The separation efficiency and flux across the membrane are two of the key factors that determine their ultimate utility. These figures of merit are closely tied to the nanoscale morphology of the membrane in many cases. Two strategies that utilize block polymers as the principal components for the preparation of various nanostructured membranes with tunable attributes are proposed. Block polymer self-assembly coupled with the integration of functional attributes into these hybrid macromolecules is a powerful and versatile platform for the preparation of advanced membrane materials. The proposed research activities build on the principal investigator's past efforts with functional block polymers that have resulted in efficient ultrafiltration, gas separation, and proton exchange membranes for applications in water purification, ammonia purification, and direct methanol fuel cells. Specific targets in the proposed work include nanostructured high-density polyethylene membranes by a self-assembly approach and nanostructured thermoset membranes by a reaction induced phase separation approach. The complete characterization of the resultant materials will be undertaken using a bevy of modern techniques and the implementation and testing of new membranes derived from these materials will be accomplished. The target materials described have tremendous potential to impact a broad swath of important technologies. The basic research and development emphasis will be aimed at new materials for water purification, battery, and fuel cell applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nMembranes are thin sheets of material that can be used to purify a wide variety of heterogenous mixtures. Many industrially relevant membranes are made from polymers. Such polymeric membranes are currently used in technologies ranging from municipal water treatment to food processing to industrial gas separations. Membranes with higher efficiency and overall performance are targeted in this proposal. Strategies that rely on precision design and synthesis of innovative hybrid polymeric materials that can adopt complex but controlled nanostructures will be undertaken. The membranes generated in this work will be thoroughly characterized, evaluated, and compared to currently available materials. The technological implications of the proposed work are far-reaching and promise societal benefit. Water purification, lithium-ion battery and fuel cell technologies are far from maturity but are extremely important for global sustainability mandates. The basic research described in this proposal will provide the necessary fundamental underpinnings for the development of next-generation technologies in these areas. In addition to the basic research efforts, several outreach activities will be integrated into the overall program. As one example, a chemical demonstration show called \"Energy and U\" that emphasizes the important topic of energy (where it comes from, how it's used, and how it's converted) will be performed annually to over 3000 K-12 students.",
