 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to organize and conduct a two-day workshop to enable and promote collaborative research agendas between architectural and engineering design researchers. The intellectual merit of this workshop lies in the knowledge gained by aggressively engaging the issues at the contested border between engineering design and architecture.  The objectives of this workshop are to: 1) provide a forum to identify and discuss the barriers to effective collaboration between architecture and engineering design researchers; 2) allow participants to share best practices and successful collaborative strategies; 3) examine how the barriers and best practices identified should impact design education; and 4) identify collaborative research directions for architectural and engineering design researchers to pursue at NSF. The workshop will engage 50 people from academia, industry, and government agencies by inviting participants from a wide range of architectural design and engineering design communities. The results of the workshop will be documented in a report that will be distributed through a website and emails to appropriate communities.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this workshop will promote design pedagogy to improve educational practices in both engineering design and architecture.  Synergies between communities will be explored and identified, with new research agendas being developed. The workshop has the potential to significantly impact the way in which architects and engineers approach the design of complex building structures, particularly in light of the present emphasis on green design. The attractiveness of project-based learning will be explored and emphasized to attract the best and brightest to the design professions. Representatives from Philadelphias Charter High School for Architecture and Design (CHAD) will be invited to participate in the workshop, extending Penn States current outreach partnership and presenting the challenges and opportunities from offering pre-college design education to a diverse population of students.",
