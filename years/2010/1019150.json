  "por_txt_cntn": "Outcome addressing intellectual merit\nWith the financial support provided through this project, 50 students had the opportunity to participate, some of them as the first time, in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 2010 International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC), which was held in Erie, PA, from October 12-15, 2010. MSEC is the flagship research forum sponsored by ASME Manufacturing Engineering Division (MED). The conference provided students with a unique intellectual environment in which they attended high-caliber technical presentations, were exposed to the state-of-the-art manufacturing research, interacted with peer students, and met with senior leading researchers in the field. \n \n\n\nOutcome addressing broader impacts\n\nIt was estimated that more than 75 undergraduate and graduate students attended MSEC 2010 to learn about the latest progress and current challenges in manufacturing research. Of the 50 students supported by this project, 26% was from the underrepresented groups. Interactions with other students also potentially established future domestic and international collaborations. Additionally, student participations from the underrepresented groups encouragingly integrated diversity into conference and research-related activities.\n \n \nOutcome Summary\n We received total 61 applications. For the selection process, a 3-member ad-hoc committee (Yong Huang, Kevin Chou and Hitomi Yamaguchi) reviewed the applications and made recommendations. With the financial support provided through this project, 50 students had the opportunity to participate, some of them as the first time attendee, in the ASME 2010 MSEC in Erie, PA, from October 12-15, 2010. MSEC is the flagship research forum sponsored by ASME MED.\n \nThis was a four-day conference with multiple parallel sessions to address, present and discuss research issues in a wide spectrum of current manufacturing processes/systems with different scales. Conference Proceedings were published on CD containing all the accepted papers and poster. The conference provided students with a unique intellectual environment in which they attended high-caliber technical presentations, were exposed to the state-of-the-art manufacturing research, interacted with peer students, and met with senior leading researchers in the field. \n \nIn addition, the conference participation is invaluable in developing the skills for this highly talented group of students who, as future manufacturing professionals and academics, will drive U.S. efforts to regain a competitive edge in manufacturing technologies. These experiences are expected to shape the students\u00c6 future careers in manufacturing science and engineering.\n \nIt was estimated that more than 75 undergraduate and graduate students attended MSEC 2010 to learn about the latest progress and current challenges in manufacturing research. Of the 50 students supported by this project, 26% was from the underrepresented groups, 76% was for technical paper presentations, 78% was in a Ph.D. program, and 38% was US citizens. Student participations from the underrepresented groups encouragingly integrated diversity into conference and research-related activities. Interactions with other students also potentially established future domestic and international collaborations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Chou"
