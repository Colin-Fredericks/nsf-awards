 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Stencil of the University of Denver will undertake a detailed study of the enigmatic star epsilon Aurigae.  In the year 2010, the star will undergo an eclipse by a massive, dusty circumstellar disk.  These eclipses take place only about every 27 years.  In this effort, Dr. Stencel and his collaborators will use interferometric observations to make high-resolution images of the stellar surface and the disk, and to examine the properties of the disk compared to those in other systems.\r\n\r\nThe project will have broader impacts in education and workforce development through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.  Results from this study will be widely disseminated at scientific meetings.  This effort is part of a larger international collaboration which will study this star with many different observational techniques.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Summary, NSF AST 10-16678.\n\nFor many decades, the bright star, epsilon Aurigae, has confounded astronomers, because the third magnitude object dips to nearly 4th magnitude - every 27 years - but with no visible companion .  The latest dimming, 2009-2011, enabled professional and amateur astronomers to collect an unprecedented array of measurements that seem to finally provide a consistent description for this most troubling of the stars. \n \nWhat has been long known is that the obvious star is a high luminosity F type star that outshines the sun by nearly 50,000 times, is a bit hotter than the sun (7500K versus solar 5750K), and has solar abundances (except for enhanced sodium &ndash; more about that later).

Answer: mass transfer as a result of Roche Lobe overflow.   The unique thing about epsilon Aurigae is that the eclipses provide a tomographic or CAT scan of an astrophysical disk, and the disk itself is in so-called transitional or debris disk phase, like the famous case, beta Pictoris. \n \nUsing interferometric imaging &ndash; we detect a disk-shaped object, long and thin, causing the eclipse by covering very nearly 50 percent of the F star [Nature 2010 April].   Rarely in astrophysics can we be so certain, but the pictures do not lie.  More importantly, we can estimate dimensions of the disk from the transit, relative to the previously mentioned 2.3 milli-arcsecond diameter of the F star.  The disk is estimated to be at least 12 milli-arcsec long by 1.1 milli-arcsec thick.  We can convert those angular sizes to Astronomical Units (AU &ndash; the earth orbit radius), if the distance is known.  As previously mentioned, the distance is large enough (about 2,000 light years) to be difficult to measure by any modern method, including HIPPARCOS.  Adopting the result by astrometry expert, Peter van de Kamp*, the distance is 580 +/- 30 pc (1,840 LY).  This suggests that the F star spans nearly 1 AU, while the disk spans about 8AU, and is half an AU thick.  Equally important, with a given set of orbital parameters, relative velocities can be deduced from our measurements, which provides a key to the mass ratio and individual masses.  The work of iterating consistent solutions for an orbit as constrained by photometry, spectra and imaging is an important part of the Ph.D. thesis work ..."
