 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry has a strong and broad representation at the research institutions of the Northeastern states. AGNES will be a new series of biannual workshops that intends to further the interaction and collaborations between the algebraic geometers in the area. Each workshop will be held over a weekend at one of the participating institutions. The workshops will include research talks by renowned experts and junior researchers, both from outside the area and within. Professional development sessions and introductory pre-talks will be aimed particularly at graduate students. Every workshop will culminate with an open problem session. It will thus give an opportunity to disseminate recent results and developments, and exchange ideas and views about future directions of algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of spaces defined by polynomial equations. Many of the spaces occurring in nature are of this type, and for this reason algebraic geometry has found diverse applications in the sciences. In particular, there are strong connections with recent work in theoretical physics (string theory). This grant will support a series of algebraic geometry conferences in the Northeastern states. The key aims of the series are to expose graduate students to a broad spectrum of research in the field and to improve communication between the many algebraic geometers in the northeast.",
