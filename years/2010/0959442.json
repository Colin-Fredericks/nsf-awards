 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of an X-ray diffractometer to support basic research programs through the departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry at Marquette University. The instrument also has broad inter-institutional use, supporting the basic research programs of additional faculty members at regional institutions.  The diffractometer supports and enhances research programs that address structural aspects of biological macromolecules in a wide variety of systems. These programs include research on the structure and function of metabolic enzymes, protein-protein interactions contributing to essential cellular complexes, structural mechanisms of gene transcription and regulation, and the structure and function of proteins with antibacterial or antifungal activity.  Structural biology is integrally tied to an undergraduate education in biology, biochemistry, and chemistry. The X-ray diffractometer at Marquette will be used to expose both graduate and undergraduate students to the increasingly accessible technique of macromolecular crystallography. Projects that involve the crystallization of proteins and DNA are well suited to undergraduate researchers who are gaining their first experience in the laboratory. Undergraduate students conducting independent research at Marquette learn crystallization techniques and gain first-hand experience with the X-ray diffractometer. Demonstrations are also performed for high school students in the Milwaukee School of Engineering's \"Students Modeling a Research Topic\" (SMART) program and in Marquette's Equal Opportunities Program. The addition of the X-ray diffractometer for macromolecular crystallography complements Marquette's infrastructure in NMR and small molecule X-ray crystallography, and enhances Marquette's ability to perform cutting edge research while maintaining our dedication to providing students with a diverse spectrum of research activities and opportunities.  Results from the studies enabled by the new equipment will be disseminated by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through publication in peer-reviewed journals.",
