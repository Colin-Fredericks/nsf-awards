 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop photovoltaic devices based on tin (II) sulfide (SnS).  The properties of SnS, including bandgaps, carrier density and mobility, chemical and thermal stability, and metallurgical properties, promise the possibility to achieve relatively high conversion efficiency given state-of-art process control and device design.  In this project, close space sublimation (CSS) technique, a thin film fabrication method proven for low cost and high manufacturability, will be used to synthesize SnS.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to produce photovoltaic devices based on low-cost and environmentally-friendly materials.  There is no doubt that solar electricity has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as an alternative and renewable energy source.  However, most of the current solar cell technologies have one or more of the following issues that, (1) raw materials are not abundantly available; (2) toxic materials are used; (3) overall cost is high.  This project will address these issues by developing photovoltaic devices using SnS, a semiconductor material that can be supplied on a massive scale and at low recovery costs. \r\n",
