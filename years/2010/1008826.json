 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation has provided support for five educational workshops, to be held before the start of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) 2010 annual meeting. The workshops will provide an opportunity for scientists, core facility managers, students and postdoctoral fellows interested in life science technologies to receive hands-on training and learn about state-of-the- art biotechnology. The funding will allow twenty-five Educational Awards, scholarships for undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellow, and core personnel to attend the educational workshop of their choice. The workshops include: 1) Introduction to Proteomics Platforms: Applications for Qualitative and Quantitative Studies; 2) Targeted Proteomics; 3) RNA Demystified for Life Science Core Laboratories; 4) Next Generation DNA Sequencing: Platform-Independent Analysis You Can Use; and 5) Managing Performance and Productivity in the Laboratory Today.  \r\nThe education offered by the workshops would enable the adoption and use of new technologies to answer advanced questions in life science-based research, supporting new, enthusiastic researchers in the use of both established and cutting-edge technologies. Advertisement of  the fellowships through the ABRF Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) program would allow reaching out to students and core personnel from underrepresented groups and encourage their participation in the Workshops. Broadening the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in core research would enhance the capabilities of these individuals, as well as allow them to bring these skills back to their home institutions.",
