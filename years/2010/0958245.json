 "awd_abstract_narration": "All land plants grow in association with complex microbial communities both on above\r\nground plant organs (called the phyllosphere) and below the ground on roots (called the\r\nrhizosphere). The relationships between a microbiota (the community of microbes\r\nintimately associated with a plant) and its host can vary from pathogenic to symbiotic.\r\nThe microbiome (the set of genes encoded by any particular microbiota) can perform\r\necosystem services by providing the host plant with critical nutrients, protection from\r\npathogens, production of functional plant hormones, and provision of tolerance to\r\nstressors like heat. The plant, in turn, provides the microbiome with an improved\r\nenvironment, including a complex array of energy sources released by deposition of\r\nplant-based sugars into the soil. Decaying plant tissue and carbon-rich root exudates\r\nredirect large amounts of fixed atmospheric carbon to the soil, making the rhizosphere a\r\nlarge carbon sequestration zone, important in the balance of carbon in a changing\r\nenvironment. Site specific characteristics of climate and soil that influence the yield of\r\nmaize and other crops and the productivity of any plant community rely in part on the\r\nrespective rhizosphere microbiome. This research will ultimately lead to agricultural\r\npractices designed to increase plant health and productivity, carbon sequestration, and\r\ndisease resistance through the rational utilization of the probiotic capacity of soils and\r\nthe local environment. The project team is a collaborative interdisciplinary group from\r\nUNC-Chapel Hill, Cornell and the DOE Joint Genome Institute. The experiments to be\r\ncarried out will define the rhizosphere microbiota and associated microbiome using two\r\nimportant model plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, the premier model for rapid\r\ndiscovery in plant biology, and Zea mays, the premier model for genetic dissection of\r\ncomplex traits in crops. Data generated by the project will be made freely available (http://www.bio.unc.edu/dangl/lab/projects/Metagenome_2-3-10.htm; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/), and will provide starting points for a variety of deeper studies into the complexities of host-microbe interactions. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows.",
