 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate education in solid mechanics influences the preparation and success of engineering majors in some of the engineering disciplines with the largest enrollments, including: mechanical, civil, and aerospace. Improvements in undergraduate education in this important field will lead to graduates who are better equipped to address the increasing breadth of materials used in engineering applications. Therefore, this project is conducting a two-day workshop on the future directions for undergraduate curricula in mechanics of solids, involving redesigning content, improving student education, and teaching of courses. Participants include experts in mechanics of solids, faculty members who have pioneered new teaching approaches, and recently graduated students (undergraduate and graduate) who are in the workforce and academia. Approximately 40 workshop participants are exploring new directions in designing and teaching courses in the area of mechanics of solids. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is addressing the following topics:\r\n  - Growing Application of Polymeric, Biological, and Geological Materials\r\n  - Promising Approaches to Teaching\r\n  - Key Differences between Behavior of New and Traditional Materials\r\n  - Missed Connections between Failure Modes and Stress and Strain\r\n  - Packed Courses\r\n\r\nParticipation of a large number of key figures in education in mechanics of solids from both research and educational perspectives is generating increased visibility of the workshop. The outcomes and results are being published in journals to further expand the influence of the workshop.",
