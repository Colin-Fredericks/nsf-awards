 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to incorporate nanoparticles and filtration membranes into vapor compression systems to improve energy efficiency.  The approach is to identify nanoparticles with proper surface properties and suspend these nanoparticles in a surfactant type base material.  This will not only enable the nanofluid with the refrigerant to improve the heat transfer occurring in the condenser of a typical vapor compression system, but also solve the problems such as sedimentation, cohesion and corrosion that happen with conventional heterogeneous solid liquid mixtures.  A novel membrane system will be introduced to collect the nanoparticles at the outlet of the condenser and return the particles to the inlet of the condenser, thereby preventing particles from entering the compressor. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to improve the energy efficiency in vapor compression systems.  There is a demand for high performance cooling systems used in medical devices, computer chips, residential appliances, industrial cooling and refrigeration systems.  Nanofluids have been known for their superior heat transfer properties.  The challenge is how to introduce the nanofluids into a vapor compression system, which is addressed by this project.  The anticipated result of this project is about 10% reduction in energy consumption of vapor compression systems.",
