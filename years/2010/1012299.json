 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is focused on research to develop reinforced silicon carbide hollow spheres.  This effort will apply a modified version of its proprietary hollow sphere production process in combination with novel materials. Novel characteristics resulting from the hollow sphere structure to be realized include: low cost bulk production of individual loose hollow spheres, uniform shape, uniform dimensions, dimensional stability, and low apparent density.  Additionally, the hollow spheres will possess the important structural and thermal characteristics of silicon carbide including extreme hardness, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient, thermal shock resistance, high abrasion resistance, high melting point, and high resistance to oxidation or corrosion caused by other materials.  These hollow spheres will ultimately be used to form continuous complex net shapes. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the availability of lightweight, high-strength, high-temperature material structures not previously possible.  Hollow silicon carbide spheres have commercial potential for high-performance applications, especially for net shape superstructures in supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles.  These materials find specific applications in high-temperature environments, such as the exterior surfaces of space reentry vehicles, inside combustion chambers, and as nozzles in jet engines, rocket engines, and power generators.  Hollow silicon carbide spheres have applications that include thermal insulation, impact absorption (armor), catalyst support, metal and gas filtration, automotive heat engines, and mechanical seals. The knowledge generated about silicon carbide during this project can also be transferred to other related materials such as boron carbide.",
