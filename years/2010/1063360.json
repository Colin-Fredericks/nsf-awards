 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory study by researchers at WestEd is examining ways that teacher-level factors (including teacher background variables and instructional practices) and student-level factors (such as self-rated mathematics interest and proficiency), and interactions among these factors, are associated with American Indian/Alaska native (AI/AN) student academic achievement in middle grades mathematics.  The ultimate goal is to identify malleable factors that, if changed, could improve teachers' practices and AI/AN student achievement in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe study has two main phases.  Phase I is exploring data from the 2007 National Indian Education Study (NIES), which compiled information on student performance on NAEP assessments and collected information from a large sample of AI/AN students and their teachers through individual questionnaires. The NIES information links NAEP performance data and NIES survey data in ways that will assist understanding of how particular teacher-level factors and student-level factors (and the interactions between these two factors) relate to student learning. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) is being used to study the relationship between student/teacher-level factors and student performance.  Phase II of the study involves qualitative analysis of data from several hundred interviews and classroom observations in selected schools at three sites in Alaska, Arizona, and New Mexico to enable deeper understanding of AI/AN contexts of teaching and learning and why particular teacher-level and student-level factors are/are not associated with student performance on the NAEP mathematics assessment as analyzed in Phase I. \r\n\r\nStudy data sources and application of multi-level modeling techniques will shed light on how teachers in particular cultural settings apply standards, adapt and implement curriculum, and assess their students in ways that promote student learning and achievement. The long-term payoff from this work will be enhanced understanding of ways to provide culturally responsive STEM education and increased performance and participation of AI/AN students in STEM careers and STEM-affected social and personal decision-making.",

Identifying ways to improve such understandings can enhance the educational advancement of all students in STEM areas. \n\nPhase I\n\nIn Phase I of the project, linked data from the National Indian Education Survey (NIES) and the NAEP 2007 mathematics assessment were analyzed to identify possible associations between student, teacher, and school factors and American Indian or Alaska Native mathematics achievement.\n\nFindings\n\nTeachers\u00c6 use of students\u00c6 responses to oral questions during classroom discussions for purposes of evaluation and planning instruction was negatively related to AI/AN student performance on the NAEP mathematics test.\nTeachers\u00c6 provision of cultural resources in mathematics instruction was negatively related to students\u00c6 performance on the NAEP mathematics test.\nStudents\u00c6 awareness of their tribal/cultural identity was positively related to their performance on the NAEP mathematics test.\nStudents\u00c6 self-rated mathematics knowledge (self-efficacy) was positively related to their performance on the NAEP mathematics test.\n\n\nPhase II\n\nIn Phase II of the project, researchers conducted extensive qualitative research in Arizona, New Mexico, and Alaska to explore possible malleable factors that could, at least in part, explain the findings of Phase I.
