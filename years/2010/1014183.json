A manufacturing process for high-speed, continuous, and large-area manufacturing of high aspect ratio and three-dimensional polymer micro/nanofiber arrays with a compliant backing layer will be studied. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide repeatable fibrillar adhesives with large volume and high uniformity for applications in sports, defense, space, robotics, and other industries.  The processes and methods to be developed in this study would also improve the understanding in the nanomanufacturing of high aspect ratio polymer structures with three-dimensional features.",
