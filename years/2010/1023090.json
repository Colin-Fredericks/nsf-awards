 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will respond to one of the driving questions of the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH): \"To what extent is the Arctic system predictable?\"  The project will quantify near-term (seasonal to decadal) predictability by drawing upon the observational records of surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure and sea ice coverage. The near-term predictions will be placed into a framework of probabilities, based on the recent record of variability, that the upcoming period (1, 2, 5, 10? years) will see various increments of change of temperature, precipitation, pressure and sea ice.  Longer-term predictability will be quantified in terms of decadal likelihoods of change based on output from a suite of global climate models, with the likelihoods integrated across models and forcing scenarios.  Potential predictability inherent in low-frequency variability will be assessed and compared with results from global studies.  Spatial mapping of the probabilistic results will be implemented at a website that will allow users to construct pan-Arctic maps of the probability-of-exceedance of a threshold of a selected variable in a particular timeslice.  Finally, we will provide an Arctic focus for the seasonal-to-decadal predictability of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5), which will enable the diagnosis of Arctic predictability inherent in the initial states of the ocean and surface variables (snow, ice).  The broader impacts of the proposed project lie in the utilization of the results by the user community (stakeholders, planners, and Arctic communities).  The products of this study will link the science of Arctic change, as captured by Arctic observations and global climate models, with a \"responding\" component that includes adaptation and mitigation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Arctic Predictability Project focussed on identifying predictability of temperatures and sea ice in regions around the Arctic.  In general, the timescales of the predictability ranged from 0 to 30 years.  Our results are expressed in probabilities of temperatures or sea ice areas exceeding a certain threshold in an n-year mean.  For example, in Figure 1, historically, the probabilities of any 20-year mean of air temperatures being warmer than the next is 100%.  For 10-year mean air temperatures, these probabilities are smaller (&lt; 70%).  According to the historic record of Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent (Figure 2), the probability of a 30-year mean ice extent being greater than a subsequent 30-year mean is 100% for the summer season, but only 58% for the spring season (Figure 3).  This is due to long-term oscillations in the sea ice record that show up in the spring season, but not the summer.\n\nPredictability of air temperatures in the future are expected to be dominated by long-term warming trends.  Figure 4 shows that the probabilities of any 15-year period being warmer than the previous 15-year period in western Alaska are all greater than 50/50, but range widely from greatern than 80% likelihood to just a little over 50%.  These results are from a set of seven simulations of a global climate model (CCSM) simulating the climate for the next century with increasing greenhouse gases.\n\nIn another prong of this research, we developed a regional sea ice prediction algorithm to forecast regional sea ice anomalies several months to seasons ahead of time.  The forecast identifies a set of optimum atmospheric and surface variables as predictors and uses these in a statistical forecast.  Observed (black) and forecast (blue) sea ice area anomalies in the Barents Sea for the month of March are shown in Figure 5.  These forecasts are made using data from the three months prior to the forecast period (i.e., previous Dec. - Feb.).\n\nOther results are outlined here:\n\n*  In the study of the high- and middle-latitude associations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the PDO-associated atmospheric signals were found to vary spatially and across seasons, but with month-to-month continuity.  The most significant signals occur during winter in northwestern North America (including Alaska and the Yukon) and in the southeastern United States, where a positive PDO is associated with negative heights, consistent with underlying temperatures.\n\n*  In explaining why the Arctic has warmed at about twice the global rate since the 1960s, our synthesis paper (Walsh, 2013) shows that the reduction of sea ice and snow cover has contributed to the high-latitude warming, as the maximum of the amplification during autumn is a fingerprint of the ice-albedo feedback.  There is evidence that atmospheric water vapor, a greenhouse gas, has increased in the Arctic over the past several decades.  Ocean heat fluxes into the Arctic from the North Atlantic and North Pacific have also contributed to the Arctic warming through a reduction of sea ice.\n\n*  Our published works show that temperature change in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo, ocean heat storage, and increased downwelling longwave radiation associated with warming and increased water vapor.  A combination of global climate model output, observed trends and expert judgment leads to the conclusion that Arctic-wide summer sea ice loss is very likely (&gt;90% chance) to occur before 2050 with a possibility of loss within a decade or two, which in turn will further increase Arctic temperatures during fall months. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William L Chapman"
