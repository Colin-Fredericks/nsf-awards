Non-uniform distribution of muscle fiber strain in squid mantle muscle: implications for musculoskeletal system structure, function, and evolution.  \r\n\r\nJoseph T.

This ubiquitous shape, however, may incur a previously unrecognized cost - large non-uniformities in shortening among the muscle cells arranged circumferentially around the body.  Such non-uniformities pose serious problems for the muscles, connective tissues, and neural control systems of the muscular organ, and may force muscle cells in some regions of the body wall to operate with reduced mechanical efficiency during locomotion and movement.  We have identified a hollow cylindrical muscular organ, the mantle of squids, in which circumferential muscle cells at different locations likely produce different amounts of force, shorten at different velocities, and generate different amounts of mechanical work during a single contraction of the tubular body.  We will use morphological, electromyographic, and biomechanical approaches to investigate these potential problems and identify mechanisms in the skeletal support system of the mantle that may mitigate them.  The results of our work promise to reveal new general principles of function for skeletal support systems, not just for soft-bodied invertebrates but for all animals with cylindrical muscular organs.  Our research will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from diverse ethnic backgrounds to learn experimental techniques in kinematics, muscle physiology, and microscopy.  Furthermore, our student participants will gain experience in the collaborative and integrative nature of science as they work in teams with peers from different institutions to collect and analyze data, and present the results of their work at national and local scientific conferences.",

This ubiquitous shape, however, may incur a previously unrecognized cost &ndash; large non-uniformities in shortening among the muscle cells arranged circumferentially around the body (Figure 1).  Such non-uniformities pose serious problems for the muscles, connective tissues, and neural control systems of the muscular organ, and may force muscle cells in some regions of the body wall to operate with reduced mechanical efficiency during locomotion and movement. \n\nWe investigated non-uniform muscle shortening in the mantle of Atlantic longfin squid.  The circumferential muscles of the mantle, which may be most familiar to the reader in their deep-fried form, provide power for jet locomotion.  One of the major discoveries of our work is that contractile properties of the circumferential muscle cells vary as a function of their position in the mantle.  Muscle cells near the inner surface of the mantle produce higher force, relative to peak isometric force, at a given length compared to muscle cells near the outer surface of the mantle (Figure 2).  The result of this transmural difference in the contractile properties of the circumferential muscles is that all of the circumferential muscle cells in the mantle can produce approximately the same force at any instant in time during jetting, thus reducing one problem that non-uniformities in muscle shortening may pose.\n\nThe importance of the discovery of transmural variation in the length-force properties extends beyond the muscles of squid.  It demonstrates an alternative mechanism for achieving uniform force output in a muscle or muscular organ; the previously described mechanisms for vertebrate cardiac muscle required complex fiber trajectories that are not present in the mantle.  \n\nWe also discovered that the architecture of the connective tissue fiber arrays that support the mantle varies transmurally to accommodate the gradient of strain.  Intramuscular connective tissue fibers are present in the squid mantle and are important in controlling deformation, reinforcing the mantle, and in the storage and return of elastic energy.  We focused our work on one of the arrays, Intramuscular Connective Tissue Array 3 (IM-3).  The collagen fibers in this array are oriented parallel to the circular muscle fibers of the mantle and have been described previously as frequently showing a \"wavy\" or folded appearance (Figure 3).  Given their orientation and distribution, fibers near the inner surface of the mantle wall must accommodate greater strain during mantle contraction and expansion than those near the outer surface.  We had hypothesized that this strain differential could be accommodated either by differences in the arrangement of the fibers or in their material properties.  Our results are consistent with a difference in the arrangement; the fibers near the inner surface are more highly folded in a contracted mantle than those near the outer surface (Figure 4).  When the mantle wall is in a fully expanded or hyperventilated state, the fibers are unfolded so that fibers near the inner and the outer surface show identical arrangement and lack of folding.  Thus it appears that the intramuscular collagen fiber length and arrangement is modulated as a function of position in the mantle wall.  We believe that these data have important implications for connective tissue fiber reinforcement of a diversity of cylindrical soft-bodied animals that rely on hydrostatic skeletal support and also for the reinforcement of the blood vessels in the closed circulatory systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates.\n\nIn addition to our scientific discoveries, we trained seventeen undergraduate college students, two graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow.  All of the students gained valuable experience in a variety of specialize..."
