The instrumentation provides a means to test applicable techniques from research projects on a large scale through vetted experiments and will be accessible to all users via two integrated measurement approaches that\r\n-\tExecute within the protected sandbox of a user Web browser to provide low impediments encouraging broad user participation while still yielding useful Internet data.\r\n-\tPerform more extensive application-oriented performance tests from a user's machine and is not constrained by the sandbox.\r\nThe former makes use of entertainment applications in the form of games and videos to help engage users and increase participation. The application-oriented nature of the latter tests yields performance data that can be uploaded for sharing among network researchers while providing feedback to users on network applications of interest. This feedback serves as an incentive for user participation. Thus, the platform provides information about the network applications that interest home users and conditions in which these applications operate. Researchers can use the platform tests from their own measurement points (MPs) and then calibrate the characteristics of their MPs with others. The entertainment orientation of the sandboxed platform serves provides an environment to decide how best to employ the use of videos and games for measurement. The open research area offers a training opportunity for students.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project promotes teaching and training through integration with systems courses and the Interactive Media and Games Development (IMGD) program. The work also aims to broaden participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups through IMGD. Moreover, the available data sets are likely to provide a foundation for scientific discovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project investigates a network measurement approach centered on\nuser-specific interactions with the Internet.  A primary goal is to provide\nmeasurement instrumentation accessible to all users via the protected\nsandbox of a user Web browser, which provides low impediments to encourage\nuser participation while still yielding useful Internet performance data to\nusers and scientists.  The platform takes measurements relevant to specific\nonline activities such as browsing Web news sites, watching streaming\nvideos, playing online games, or participating in video conferences.  The\napplication-oriented nature of these tests is an incentive for users in\nproviding valuable feedback while still yielding performance data that can\nbe uploaded for sharing among network researchers.\n\nA secondary goal of the work is to apply the principles of reducing\nimpediments and providing incentives to users of mobile platforms\n(e.g., smart phones).  In this case, the incentive for users is to\nfocus on the resource (CPU, network, power) usage of applications\ninstalled by a user.  Not only does the platform measure this resource\nusage, but it also provides predictions for future usage of these\napplications.\n\nThe project has resulted in three significant outcomes.\nFirst, a project outcome includes the deployment of a system that\nmeasures the network performance (upload/download throughput,\nround-trip time and jitter) between a client browser and a server.\nThese measurements are performed between the browser and the project\nserver as well as between the browser and any third-party server on\nthe Web.  The measurements can be done via either the JavaScript or\nFlash sandbox platforms within the browser and returned to the project server for storage in a database.  The overhead of these sandbox\nplatforms for both the JavaScript and Flash were validated using two\ndifferent approaches for making tests from each of these platforms.\nThe stored data is available for subsequent analysis by both the\nprincipal investigators and other scientists, after suitable data\nanonymization.\n\nSecond, a project outcome identifies and builds performance\nmeasurements for specific online activities (e.g., browsing Web news\nsites, watching videos, playing games, accessing email) performed by\nusers and how the performance of these activities can be predicted\nbased upon underlying network performance measures that the platform\ncan obtain.  Users can see their session-level results across multiple\napplications.  Network researchers can analyze results across all\nusers to be displayed for different network and work settings.\n\nThird, a project outcome applies the principles of the\nproject---maximize performance measurement incentives while minimizing\nimpediments---to mobile platforms.  This includes development of\napplications for both the Android and IOS mobile platforms.  These\napplications not only perform measurements and display information to\nusers on resource usage for the user's installed mobile applications, but have the capability to upload measurements to the project server\nwhere they are stored and can be analyzed along with data collected\nfrom other devices.  The results of this analysis can then be\ndownloaded by the mobile application to provide the user more\ncomprehensive information on the expected cost (e.g., network and\npower usage) of each application relative the perceived benefit of\nthis application.\n\nThe primary intellectual merits of this project are an invaluable,\nlarge-scale understanding of network performance from the\napplication-oriented vantage point of most Internet users.  This\nuser-centered perspective is original and contributes to the body of\nresearch on network design and experimentation.  Furthermore, the\nproject demonstrates that the same design principles, high incentives\nand low impediments, can be extended to mobile platforms to encourage\nuser participation and increase the amount of data gathered.\n\nThe project also has had many broader impacts. ..."
