 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on determining the rates, mechanisms, and causes of molecular motion in adsorbed polymer systems. An understanding of the properties of adsorbed polymers requires knowledge of both the structure and dynamics in interfacial systems. The behavior of the interfacial systems becomes more important as the size of the systems is reduced. The properties of polymer systems at interfaces will be determined using a variety of techniques, including, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and also modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), and other techniques. The chemical/spectroscopic results will be correlated, when possible, to physical property studies, such as the measurement of adhesion in thin films. Of specific interest to the work outlined in this proposal are the effects of plasticizer in polymer films, the dynamics associated with end groups in adsorbed polymers, the behavior of chains \"grafted from\" silica surfaces, the structure and dynamics of adsorbed copolymers, and the nature of polymer nanocomposites.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis research will result in improving the reliability and usefulness of critical electronic and other devices and systems that are important in today's high tech world.  Successful development of stronger and lighter-weight composite materials can improve electronic devices, such as microchips, sensors, and computer memory.  Because many of the properties of polymers (long chain molecules, like those in plastics) used in manufacturing these devices are not understood, the usefulness of these devices may be limited and critical failures possible.  Accordingly, by determining properties and behaviors of materials used in these complex systems, device manufacturers will be able to produce better, more reliable devices. In addition, the students trained in this area will enhance our national competitiveness in the important technological area of material science. \r\n\r\n",
