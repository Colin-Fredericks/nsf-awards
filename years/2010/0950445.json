Organic semiconductors are attractive for application in electronic devices due to their high performance, as well as their compatibility with low-cost, high-throughput processing techniques. The continued expansion of organic electronics is driven by the cross-disciplinary expertise of both academic and industrial researchers. This partnership has led to significant advances in the fundamental understanding of these materials, as well as improvements in the efficiency and operational stability of organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. Many of these systems are being actively developed as part of next generation, energy efficient displays and solid-state lighting fixtures, as well as in\r\nphotovoltaics for low-cost solar energy utilization. To fully capitalize on these unique devices, significant gaps in fundamental understanding as well as non-trivial technological challenges must be overcome. This symposium will include significant new developments in the understanding and implementation of organic semiconductors for sustainable energy applications including displays, lighting, and photovoltaics. Other topics of interest include device physics, development and characterization of new materials and device architectures, and novel processing methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSymposium S on Organic Materials & Devices for Sustainable Energy Systems at the Fall MRS Meeting is geared toward research presentations regarding the use of organic semiconductors for the efficient generation and use of energy.  The confirmed invited speakers include many top researchers in white organic light-emitting devices and in organic photovoltaic cells. The grant will provide funds for junior faculty to attend this meeting.\r\n",
