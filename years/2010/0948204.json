 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit. This accomplishment-based renewal (ABR) proposal requests funding to continue a multi-faceted program of research bearing on the properties of accessory minerals in the Earth's continental crust. The overall goal is to enhance capabilities for determining the timing and intensity of crustal geologic events and processes ranging from igneous activity and metamorphism to uplift and exhumation rates. Research during the last funding cycle (2005-2009) focused mainly on development of tools and techniques for characterizing high-temperature processes: i.e., geothermometers for zircon, rutile, titanite and quartz and the diffusion data needed to evaluate their resistance to diffusive resetting. Exploratory efforts were made to investigate the role of defects on oxygen diffusion, and to develop techniques to characterize He diffusion in accessory minerals. Because diffusion of He produced by radioactive decay of U and Th has numerous applications in quantifying time-temperature histories of shallow crustal rocks, future research will shift substantially toward applications in this area. (U-Th)/He thermochronometry is a powerful technique for characterization of thermal histories of geologic systems. Underpinning the technique is knowledge of the mobility (diffusion) of He in accessory minerals (e.g., apatite, zircon, titanite, xenotime and monazite). Measurements of He diffusion in zircon and apatite are generally consistent with information deduced from bulk-release studies of natural crystals containing radiogenic He. In the case of zircon, direct profiling reveals substantial diffusive anisotropy, with faster diffusion rates parallel preferred crystallographic orientations as generally pedicted by molecular dynamics simulations. Future efforts will focus on: 1) identifying the underlying cause for differences between bulk-release and direct-profiling results for apatite; 2) extending the study to other accessory minerals; 3) assessing possible He saturation effects on diffusion; 4) evaluating the role of radiation damage in He diffusion; and 5) development of computer codes for modeling anisotropic diffusion in non-spherical grains. Work will also continue on development of accessory-mineral thermometers, including evaluation of the effect of pressure on the Ti-in-zircon thermometer and calibration of a crystallization thermometer for apatite.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide fundamental information on the behavior of key rare-element minerals in the Earth's crust and enable extraction of information from them regarding crustal processes and evolution. Emphasis is on acquisition of basic experimental data, but systems are strategically targeted in the hope of furthering knowledge in areas of broad significance to the solid-earth sciences. This work provides new tools for addressing petrological and tectonic problems, and will hopefully lead to refinement of molecular dynamics and first-principles modeling of diffusion processes in minerals.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. This project will contribute to development of methods to quantify T-t histories of metamorphic and igneous rocks. Because the work focuses upon minerals that contain radioactive elements, results will also be directly relevant the radioactive waste isolation arena (e.g., He diffusion measurements). Moreover, the proposed studies involve development of new experimental methods and crystal-growth techniques that may find applications in other fields (e.g., ceramic engineering). Lastly, this project will support one PhD student and involvement of several undergraduates in aspects of the proposed research.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntroduction\n\nThe term \"accessory mineral\" is used in reference to small crystals that are widely dispersed in rocks of the continental crust.  The atomic structures of most accessory minerals require a specific element&mdash;phosphorus, zirconium or titanium, for example&mdash;that is relatively rare, and it is for this reason that these minerals are typically limited in abundance to less than a percent or so of the rocks that host them.  Despite their general scarcity, accessory minerals are of enormous economic and scientific value.  These small crystals scavenge and sequester valuable metals like the rare earths, zirconium, hafnium, uranium and thorium; consequently, natural processes that concentrate accessory minerals can result in economically valuable ore deposits.  The fact that accessory minerals contain radioactive elements means that they also have the potential to provide scientists with information about the ages and time scales of natural phenomena such as volcanic activity, mountain building, erosion and long-term climate change.  In order to fully exploit these applications, however, a much more in-depth understanding of the properties of accessory minerals is needed. Key areas for future research concern the rates at which atoms move around within the crystal structures of accessory minerals, and the conditions in and on the Earth under which accessory minerals are stable.\n\nGoals of the research\n\nThe main goals of this 5-year project were: 1) to measure the rates at which helium atoms&mdash;produced by radioactive decay of uranium and thorium&mdash;migrate (diffuse) within accessory mineral structures; and 2) to develop mathematical models that will allow ourselves and other scientists to maximize the benefits of the new data as they apply to natural systems.  Specific questions include:\n\n1) If the crystal structure of an accessory mineral is elongated or skewed (anisotropic), is the migration rate of helium faster in one direction than another? Established theory says that if the crystal structure is direction-dependent, then atomic migrations may be as well.\n\n2) Does atomic-scale damage to the structure of an accessory mineral affect the migration rate of helium atoms?\n\n3) Can we develop relatively simple equations that describe how helium and other \"impurity\" elements in accessory minerals respond to heating?  This is an important question because elements like helium and lead that are produced by radioactive decay constitute time clocks for natural phenomena that range from meteor impacts to mountain building.\n\nOutcomes and significance\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nHelium diffusion.  Using direct measurement techniques developed at RPI, we characterized migration (diffusion) rates of helium in calcium phosphate (apatite), zirconium silicate (zircon), titanium oxide (rutile), calcium titanium silicate (titanite), and cerium phosphate (monazite).  These were strategic measurements in the sense that existing data obtained by less direct \"bulk degassing\" techniques showed substantial variation from one study to the next, and also because the methodologies of previous studies yielded no information on possible direction-dependence (anisotropy) of diffusion.  Interestingly, even though all the minerals we examined have anisotropic structures, only zircon and rutile show marked anisotropy in helium diffusion.  For both of these minerals (and at all temperatures investigated), helium migration parallel to the long axis of a crystal is about 100 times faster than diffusion perpendicular to the long axis.  Toward the end of the project period, we also showed quantitatively that the damage to crystal structures caused by radioactive decay has a dramatic enhancing effect on helium diffusion. These findings make it possible to predict more accurately whether and how helium in a specific accessory mineral in Earth's crust will respond to changes in its environment.\n\nMathematical models of diffusion with changing temperature.  We developed general equations that describe diffusion in accessory minerals for specific time-temperature scenarios likely to occur in nature (these are theoretical treatments that assume knowledge of diffusion behavior over the relevant range of temperature).  We derived relationships for diffusion in an anisotropic, cylindrical crystal (not unlike zircon or apatite), which allows more accurate simulation of diffusion in realistic natural crystal shapes.  We also presented general equations that make it possible to calculate diffusion effects during natural heating events&mdash;which can be gradual (as in metamorphism) or nearly instantaneous (as in meteorite impacts).  Lastly, we showed how to extract cooling-rate information from \"interrupted\" diffusion processes in natural samples.  These contributions are first-of-a-kind results that provide researchers in petrology and geochemistry with new tools to model natural systems and interpret observations from them.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe main broader impacts of the project involved human resource development, implementation of new experimental protocols (ion implantation and nuclear reaction analysis), and development of equations for modeling diffusion under natural geological circumstances where temperature changes with time.  Doctoral students and undergraduates alike gained valuable experience in the conduct and analysis of high P-T experiments that is transferable to any discipline of science and technology. Three highly-skilled PhD scientists completed their studies and have moved on to productive research positions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: E. Bruce Watson"
