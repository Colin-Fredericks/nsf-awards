In addition, this arena provides a unique opportunity where academics and industry leaders can interact on issues in nanotechnology. Current issues that will be discussed at INC6 includes energy and environmental challenges facing mankind in particular targeting to decrease CO2 emissions and increase the viability of renewable energy solutions - and the associated societal implication and issues. Also, another major challenge that will be discussed includes a look at logic switch replacement technologies for CMOS and what alternate state variables are viable options. Semiconductor industry related questions and topics that will be discussed include nanoscale interconnects, thermal management, directed self-assembly, and fault tolerance. At a high level, the spirits of the meeting will target world regional groups co-operate to implement strategic and beneficial cooperative programs to progress mandkinds? development through nanotechnology and its associated intellectual merits.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The INC6 conference provides an arena where global senior researchers, industry leaders and policy makers from North America, Europe and Asia will hold discussions on a variety of efforts in nanoscience, along with opportunities for collaboration. Young scientists will also be invited to present posters highlighting their work and will give them a chance to exchange information and ideas with these technologists. The broader impact we foresee coming from the INC6 is the dissemination of relevant and current nanotechnology issues permeated to the next-generation of technology leaders. The event will provide an opportunity for academic, gov lab and industry to meet in a forum where the purpose of cooperation and coordination is targeted, leading to lasting collaborative science and technology relationships and alliances to more effectively solve and innovate solutions to many grand challenges faced today.",
