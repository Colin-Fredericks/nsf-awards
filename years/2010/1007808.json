 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second cumulant tensor  of a multivariate distribution is its\r\ncovariance matrix, which provides a partial description of its\r\ndependence structure (complete in the Gaussian case). Innumerable\r\nsuccessful statistical methods are based on analyzing the covariance\r\nmatrix, e.g. imposing rank restrictions as in principal component\r\nanalysis or zeros in its inverse as in Gaussian graphical models.\r\nMoreover, the covariance matrix plays a critical role in optimization\r\nin finance and other areas involving optimization of risky payoffs,\r\nsince it is the bilinear form yielding  the variance of a linear\r\ncombination of variables.  For multivariate, non-Gaussian data, the\r\ncovariance matrix is an incomplete description of the dependence\r\nstructure.  Cumulant tensors are the multivariate generalization of\r\nunivariate skewness and kurtosis and the higher-order generalization\r\nof covariance matrices, and allow a more complete description of\r\ndependence.  The research investigates a number of problems in theory,\r\nestimation, algorithms, and applications around modeling higher-order\r\nnon-Gaussian dependence with cumulant tensors.\r\n\r\nData arising from modern applications like computer vision, finance,\r\nand computational biology are rarely well described by a normal\r\ndistribution, though  analysis often proceeds as if they were.  For\r\nexample, one cause of the financial crisis and the damage it did to\r\nmany investors was an over-reliance on the variance-based risk\r\nmeasures appropriate primarily for normal distributions. This can\r\nallow risk to be in a sense hidden in the higher-order structure,\r\nwhere it can be ignored or even made worse by application of\r\ntraditional risk metrics.  Cumulant tensors provide a promising avenue\r\nfor modeling higher-order dependence.  Success in developing these\r\nmodels will have broad impacts in the analysis of real-world data with\r\ncomplex dependence, particularly in modeling and managing financial\r\nrisk and in dimension reduction, and could help improve the robustness\r\nof parts of the financial system.",
