 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises an experimental and theoretical study of the roles of crystal-lattice defects, which are characterized spatially at the nanometer-to-micrometer scale, on the plastic (permanent deformation) and anelastic (time-dependent recoverable, or transient, deformation, which is the source of the attenuation of seismic waves and the physics behind mechanical relaxation) responses of mineral assemblages representative of the upper-mantle rock of Earth.  Specifically, we will examine the roles played by (i) heterophase boundaries (crystalline boundaries separating different minerals) and (ii) subgrain boundaries (crystalline partial-boundaries within component crystals) on the mechanical dynamics.  The work emphasizes both spatial and temporal scaling.  Spatially, it is the nanometer-to-micrometer scale defects (and their spatial distribution, also at the micrometer scale) that effect the mechanical response at the scale of kilometers and greater.  Temporally, one must select appropriate thermodynamic potentials of stress & temperature and appropriate rock microstructure so as to mimic the physics of deformation active in the Earth over geological time with those active in laboratory experiments, which are completed over hours.  Technically, the experimental work emphasizes (a) the role of grain- and heterophase-boundary sliding in the development both of spatial separation of phases (metamorphic layering) and of fabric (i.e., crystallographic-preferred orientation of minerals-CPO); (b) the transient creep and, related, attenuation dynamics associated with both of these phenomena; (c) the spatial scaling of phase separation as a function of flow stress and the impact of such scaling on attenuation; (d) the correlation of transient creep/attenuation responses in polycrystalline aggregates with their response(s) in stress relaxation.  The theoretical aspect emphasizes (a) application of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to the problem of strain-effected phase separation and (b) application of a plasticity \"equation-of-state\" to the attenuation response of polycrystalline aggregates.\r\n\r\n\tThe work has multiple applications in geophysics.  Discerning the structure of Earth's mantle through interpretation of seismic data depends on understanding the anelastic response(s) of the constituent minerals and rock. The seismology community is interested in understanding the effects of, e.g., (i) fabric, (ii) chemical potentials (specifically of water and oxygen) and (iii) strain-effected layered structures on attenuation.  The active tectonics community is deeply interested in the microphysics of transient creep, which is related to attenuation.  These phenomena are all affected/effected not only by grain boundary processes, but also by dislocation motion and related dislocation structures, which have received, so far, little attention in experimental studies of attenuation/transient creep.  Both will be the emphases of this work.  Additionally, the science itself addresses issues of (i) 'atomic self-assembly' via large plastic strain and (ii) the length scales of energy dissipation; theories and their development relating to hierarchical materials with unique physical (and, thus, economical) properties (e.g., materials combining high stiffness with high damping, multilayer or percolative structures with distinctive electrical or optical response, etc.) can be anticipated as a 'by-product' of the research being pursued.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntrinsic Merit\n\nThere are two general sources of information concerning the chemistry and structure of Earth at depth: the geological record and the geophysical record.  (Our understanding of the Earth involved integrating these sources of information.)  The geological record is that recorded in rocks, particularly igneous rocks, collected on Earth\u00c6s surface but which represent magmas (the liquid portion of partially molten rock) generated within the Earth and transported (via gravity: magmas are less dense than rock) to the surface, where they crystalize.  The geophysical record is that generated by seismology.  When earthquakes occur, the elastic waves traverse the planet, both at depth and at the surface; the physics of those waves, specifically, their velocity, how rapidly they are damped (\"attenuation\") and how they split into component waves (with differing velocities and damping properties) can be used to infer (i) the mineralogy of the planet at depth, (ii) the gradient in temperature with depth and (iii) the deformation condition at depth.  Interpreting the seismological record is made difficult by the fact that wave velocities, attenuation and splitting are convoluted in the materials physics of the rock.  This research focused on experimental studies of plastic flow and its effect on rock texture (i.e., morphology and shapes of the mineral grains composing the rock) as well as its effect on wave attenuation.  Two types of rock were studied experimentally: (a) silicates representing Earth\u00c6s upper mantle (~50-400 km depth); (b) H2O ice.  (Experiments on ice were pursued to understand the physics as they would be manifest on one of the ice planetoids of the outer solar system, e.g., the Jovian moon Europa.)  We have successfully demonstrated that active plastic deformation changes the damping properties; they change in such a way that the deformed material can exhibit damping behavior that is independent of the size of the mineral grains composing the rock.  This result&mdash;and the understanding it provokes&mdash;is new, and important.  For example, the result suggests an approach where wave attenuation can be employed to characterize the deformation state (stress and deformation rate) of the mantle.  The result also speaks to the capacity of tidal forces on Europa to create and sustain a liquid-water ocean beneath the ice shell covering the surface.  (This is important if one contemplates the possibility of creating and sustaining life on another planet.)\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe research is fundamental and so is extrapolative beyond Earth/planetary science to the realm of structural engineering materials.  For example, one can imaging employing controlled deformation processing of engineering alloys to achieve materials that combine the desired, but seemingly antithetical, properties of high stiffness with high damping&mdash;with obvious application to aircraft and spacecraft.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid F Cooper"
