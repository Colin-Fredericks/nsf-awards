  "por_txt_cntn": "\n                My research as a 2010 NSF EAPSI fellow, which was conducted at Kobe University with my host and co-author Takashi Unayama, focused on the household spending response to an increase in consumption taxation (e.g. sales tax), using Japan\u00c6s April 1997 Value Added Tax (VAT) rate increase from three to five percent as a case study.  In particular, we examined two aspects of the spending response.  First, we estimated the intertemporal substitution response to the rate increase.  That is, we measured the extent to which the impending rate increase caused households to bring forward purchases to avoid the price hikes associated with an increase in the consumption tax rate.  Second, we estimated the income effect associated with the rate increase.  That is, we measured whether the rate increase had any impact on household consumption over a longer period of time. \n\n            Our findings indicate that Japanese households engaged in a significant amount of intertemporal substitution in the two months preceding the increase in the VAT rate, as household expenditures were three and nine percent higher in February and March 1997 than they would have been in the absence of a rate increase.  Consistent with theoretical predictions, the intertemporal substitution response is largely driven by increased outlays on durable goods (e.g. televisions) and storable non-durable goods (e.g. laundry detergent).  Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that Japan\u00c6s April 1997 VAT rate increase did not have a negative impact on household consumption over a longer period of time, which we suspect is due to reductions in income tax rates that offset the burden imposed by the consumption tax rate increase.\n\n            This research is important for several reasons.  First, governments in both developed and developing countries have become increasingly reliant on consumption taxation as a source of revenue, but there has been little empirical research conducted on the effects of these taxes on either household or firm behavior.  Second, the average household is likely aware of changes in national consumption tax rates, and also that an increase in the consumption tax rate will translate to an increase in the prices of goods and services which they consume.  As a result, an increase in the consumption tax rate provides the appropriate natural experiment to measure the sensitivity of household consumption to price changes, an important topic in Economics.  Finally, in regards to Japan, debate over whether to further increase the country\u00c6s VAT rate, which is the lowest of any developed nation, has been obscured by the largely unsubstantiated claim that the 1997 VAT rate increase was responsible for Japan\u00c6s \"double dip\" recession in the late 1990\u00c6s.  We hope that our results will allow for a more rational debate over the merits of a future rate increase.\n\n            Personally, I have benefitted greatly from the research conducted as an EAPSI Fellow.  Professor Unayama and I were fortunate to have the opportunity to present our results at Japan\u00c6s Ministry of Finance in August 2010, and our paper is now a Working Paper for Japan\u00c6s Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry.  Furthermore, the research completed in Japan lead to funding from the International Tax Policy Forum to conduct similar research in New Zealand, where I spent the first four months of 2011.  Both papers will serve as chapters in my dissertation.  Finally, I have recently begun work on the final chapter of my dissertation, in which I intend to construct a model of household consumption and use the intertemporal substitution results from the Japan and New Zealand papers to derive parameters that describe consumer\u00c6s sensitivity to price changes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David B Cashin"
