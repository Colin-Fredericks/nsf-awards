Specifically, Raman and infrared (IR) microscopy will redefine our relationship to our research samples. Working together, these tools will enable new kinds of analyses that will significantly advance our research. For archaeological and museum research, Raman and infrared microscopy will add quantifiable dimensions to complement traditional methods of analysis. This precision will enable anthropologists to identify the provenience of many Native American artifacts that are scattered around the world in museums and private collections. Quantitative comparison of their fingerprint spectra will demonstrate with precision and objectivity whether archaeological pottery samples were manufactured at the same locale or not. Raman and IR microscopy are non-destructive, unlike many other techniques with similar goals. This feature is critical because each artifact is unique; when one is destroyed, the research cannot be repeated. In the biological and chemical sciences, IR and Raman analysis will enable innovative studies with significant impact on human health and the environment. These instruments are singularly well suited to the study of toxins and contaminants in complex substances such as animal tissues, as well as in naturally occurring soil-water environments. The identification and characterization of short-lived HNO complexes will further our understanding of the physiological role of the elusive HNO molecule. The Raman and IR microscopes will be housed and cared for by the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, which is a primarily undergraduate institution serving both urban and rural communities.  Acquisition of these instruments will enable our students to realize broader research and career potential in these diverse fields.  \r\n\r\nLayman Summary: \r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nState-of-the art microscopic techniques are increasingly important to anthropologists, as they always have been to the chemist or biologist.  Raman and infrared (IR) microscopes will enable us to determine with unparalleled precision the origins and chemical makeup of the samples that are the focus of our research.  Specifically, these microscopic techniques will enable anthropologists at SIUE, and our colleagues at other institutions, to determine where and/or when Native American artifacts were made, and from what materials they were made.  Our samples include archaeological pottery and stone tools, as well as more recent Native American artifacts.  These can be compared with Native American materials held in museums and private collections around the world to determine trade patterns as well as migration routes.  It is important to note that Raman and IR analysis, unlike many similar types of analysis, are not destructive to the artifacts or other materials being studied.   Biologists and chemists in our group will use the microscopes to analyze samples including bones and soils to look for the presence of poisons and other contaminants.  The results of their work will provide information about past human health, and will also provide timely information about the potential impact of environmental contaminants on the health of living humans.  The Raman and IR microscopes will be housed and cared for by the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, which is a primarily undergraduate institution serving both urban and rural communities.  Using these microscopes will enable our students to realize broader research and career opportunities in anthropology, archaeology, biology, chemistry, and environmental sciences. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).",

Raman and IR spectrometry are non-destructive and complementary methods which yield information about how molecules  vibrate. A material\u00c6s characteristic set of molecular or crystallographic vibrations can lead to knowledge about what samples are made of, through distinctive spectra akin to a fingerprint or signature.  Such spectra can be compared to the spectra of other materials to determine if they are of common origin. The samples analyzed in our research included archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, art objects, animal bones, soil samples, pure  compounds and solutions at electrode surfaces. A microscope was required to achieve adequate resolution in the analysis of these diverse complex samples.  Three main areas of intellectual merit are described here.\n\n         Dr. Julie Holt and her students obtained data on an extensive set of archaeological ceramic materials, soil samples, and clay samples from across the United States, but with a focus at this stage on the Illinois materials.  The analysis of the data seems to indicate that it will be possible to assign rough regional origins to Midwestern Native American pottery, at least within the state of Illinois.  It should be noted that the St. Louis region appears to have been inhabited for centuries, and SIUE itself is a rich archaeological site.  The\nbroader impact of this activity is that we can understand trade and migration during the precontact-period in Illinois. This research will potentially transform how archaeology is approached in the Midwest, and could radically alter our\nunderstanding of the Native American past in this region.  These promising studies will continue after the grant period is over.\n\n         Dr. Edward Navarre and his students developed a research project utilizing the Raman microscope for surface chemistry studies.  Raman spectra were collected of a droplet of a sample dissolved in water, as the temperature of a tungsten filament increased through stages of water evaporation and sample atomization in a specially designed cell in the microscope.

The point is to use a tungsten filament such as those found in light bulbs as an inexpensive core of a sample analysis system.  The results so far have implications which will affect the design of currently unavailable low-cost and portable atomic absorption systems for applications such as the analysis of lead in paints.\n\n          Dr. Michael Shaw and his students obtained data on metalloporphyrin compounds which are sensitive to the presence of air.  A porphyrin is a ring-shaped structure of atoms that can bind a metal in the center, akin to how hemoglobin holds iron.  We looked at iron and ruthenium compounds which were models for different types of metalloporphyrins found in the blood and liver.  The microscope showed the students how their methods of preparation could be improved by clearly showing crystals of impurities, and by helping the students to identify the impurities separate from the target compounds.  Starting with pure compounds, the students could proceed to analyze the metalloporphyrins\u00c6 behavior in the vicinity of an electrode by Raman or IR spectrometry.  The bottom line is that the data gives indications of how the compounds\u00c6 structure and chemistry changes when electrons are added or removed.  If we know what the chemical consequences of electron-transfer are for model compounds, then we can look for similar spectra fingerprints for biological metalloporphyrin enzymes which have a role in human health.\n\n         Other broader  impacts have also been realized.
