 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a theoretical study of molecular and atomic interactions at the high pressures characteristic of the interiors of giant planets. Two different first-principles computational approaches---density functional molecular dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo---will be used, to (1) simulate interfaces between ice and metallic hydrogen to understand their stability, particularly as related to giant planet formation and core growth; (2) simulate hydrogen-helium mixtures to understand helium rain and its effect of the cooling and radiated luminosity of Saturn; (3) predict the degree to which neon is depleted in Saturn's atmosphere through the process of neon sequestration by helium rain; (4) calculate equations of state for giant planet interiors, with an eye toward explaining the surprisingly large sizes of \"hot Jupiters\" and refining the temperature profile of Jupiter itself; and (5) calculate the electrical conductivity of H-He mixtures to better understand magnetic field generation and ohmic dissipation of tidal perturbations in giant planets. A graduate student will be supported and trained in this project, which will also produce high-accuracy tables of equations of state for exoplanet modeling. These equations of state will be made available to the research community. The PI and collaborators will also produce an interactive website called \"Planet Builder\" where students and the public can see how interior composition and physical conditions influence the overall characteristics of planets, in comparison with those in the Solar System.",
