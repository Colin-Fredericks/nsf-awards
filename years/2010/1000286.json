 "awd_abstract_narration": "The WashingtonBaltimore-Hampton Roads Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR Alliance) is led by Howard University (HU) with Morgan State University (MSU), Bowie State University (BSU), the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), Hampton University (HAU), Norfolk State University (NSU) and Virginia State University (VSU) along with the community colleges associated with these HBCUs.  Community college participation in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and Virginia include:  Prince George?s Community College, Danville Community College, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College, Howard Community, Germanna Community College, Cecil College, John Tyler Community College, Southside Virginia Community College \r\nOver the past fourteen years of the Washington Baltimore Hampton Roads-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP) Program, there has been significant research and teaching infrastructure building at all of the WBHR-Alliance Institutions; strategic expansion of STEM degree offerings at the BS, MS, and Ph.D. levels; new courses in STEM; increased degree production at all levels; improved retention; significant increase in the number of technical publications in refereed journals; progression and graduation rate increases at all institution; awards of nationally recognized fellowships including the Rhodes Scholarship, Hewlett Packard Fellowship, NSF graduate fellowship; and increased collaboration with major research institutions, national laboratories, and industry. \r\nThis project will (1) position the WBHR-Alliance for sustainability by integrating its most effective interventions into the institutional operations at member campuses, and by building enduring relationships within the Alliance and with other major research institutions; (2) interest students in and prepare them well for STEM graduate study, institutionalize research experiences for undergraduates throughout the alliance, along with GRE tutorials, state-of-the-art STEM seminars, and other assistance; (3) create pathways to a STEM baccalaureate for students at community colleges, by including them in WBHR-LSAMP summer programs and academic-year courses, facilitating their transfer into STEM B.S. programs at WBHR-LSAMP institutions, and ensuring their successful completion of the STEM degree, ready for graduate study or a STEM career; (4) Increase the number of STEM students participating in international research experiences at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes from this project are expected to result in a 5% increase in STEM B. S. degrees and an increase in students from underrepresented minority populations entering STEM graduate studies.",
