A limiting factor for widespread use of CNTs is their inherent high Van der Waals forces typically causing agglomeration of CNTs into bundles.  Using a wet process of various surfactants in aqueous solutions has been shown to individually disperse CNTs, thereby functionalizing the CNTs to be able to bond to the metal powder surface.  An understanding of the mechanisms and underlying microstructural interactions associated with various BMG-surfactant-CNT combinations is vital to the processing and development of BMG-CNT composites via Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) with enhanced mechanical behavior.\n\nSPS is an ideal tool for studying the fabrication of BMG-CNT composites due to its ability to quickly consolidate powders using uniaxial pressure along with a DC current.  The use of electric current has been found to allow for lower temperature consolidation and densification and has been rationalized to occur through the break up surface oxides on powders by generating a spark and/or plasma\n\nApparent improvements in mechanical behavior was also achieved with an average increase in Vickers hardness values with an of ~4% and ~8% with composites containing 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt%, respectively.
