The proposed Center is a single-university Center at Auburn University. \r\n \r\nCAVE, founded in September 1999, is a research organization in new technologies for electronics packaging, reliability, prognostics, and manufacturing related to harsh environment applications. CAVE addresses both fundamental scientific issues and the critical needs for operation in extreme environments. CAVE is poised to continue its contributions to the development of a US core competence in design and manufacturing of electronics for harsh environments through its focused membership, experienced faculty, and state-of-the-art facilities.  The Center membership included major automotive, aerospace, and defense electronics OEMs, as well as their supply infrastructure including manufacturers of printed wiring boards, components, electronics materials, and assembly equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe Center will continue to develop and implement new technologies for the packaging and manufacturing of electronics, with emphasis on the reliability, prognostics, and cost effectiveness in harsh environments. The Center proposes to integrate academic learning with industrial problems for students' education. The broader impacts of the CAVE Center research will be achieved through: special programs for middle school science teachers and students; broad dissemination of research findings through publications, workshops, short courses, and the www; partnering with industry and federal agencies; and, involvement of under-represented groups in undergraduate and graduate research projects. \r\n",
