 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alabama A&M University in Normal, Alabama will initiate a Center for Forest Ecosystem Assessment (CFEA) as a 5-year Center for Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST: Phase II).  The Center renews a previous project, funded as HRD-0420541. Al-AMU is one of the few Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with a doctoral program in natural resources and environmental sciences, and the renewal of this CREST program will serve to maximize NSF?s investment in long term ecological research and for increasing minority presence in natural resource professions. The goal for the Phase II of the CFEA is to enhance and expand the effort at Al-AMU to be the leading research Center in forest ecosystem ecology and assessment in the southern Cumberland region, educating future natural resource scientists, particularly from groups that are currently underrepresented in the sciences, expanding the temporal and spatial database for long-term climate change study, and enhancing faculty capacity and intra-and inter-institutional collaborations to make CFEA self-sustaining in the future. \r\n\r\nLong-term forest ecosystem research and assessment can provide important ecological insights and are crucial for improving management of ecosystems and natural resources. The underlying research theme is to systematically and synergistically examine the relationship between forest disturbances and the forest ecosystem dynamics, at the temporal scale from immediate to long-term responses, at a spatial scale from individual genetic makeup to landscape patterns and process, at non-living level from carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus  to ecosystem processes such as carbon balance and storage, and at the biological level from individual wildlife behavior to biodiversity, community dynamics, and ecosystem services. The Center is organized into three subprojects: (1) Ecological Community Responses and Dynamics, (2) Ecosystem Functions and Processes, and (3) Coupled Dynamics of Human and Landscapes. The participants will emphasize inter- and trans-disciplinary synergies and continue to enhance the research productivity of individual faculty and expand the presence of students historically underrepresented in natural resource sciences.\r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed Center will build upon the accomplishments of the first CFEA funding period to examine the relationships between forest disturbances and the ecosystem dynamics that occur over scales from the molecular to the regional.  The research will improve the knowledge of disturbance ecology under changing environment and climate, and will contribute significantly to the disciplines of forest management, restoration ecology and conservation biology. The work will involve a number of agencies, from federal through local communities.  The investigators and their students will have access to an uncommonly large scale field ecological experiment, and the results will have direct impact on forest ecosystem management practices.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nAl AMU has a strong record of preparing underrepresented minority students, particularly African Americans, for STEM careers, including advanced degree education. During the previous 5-plus years of the CFEA, 25 faculty members (more than 60% minorities), 35 graduates (awarded 20 MS and 7 PhD, more than 70% minority), 100 undergraduates and 35 high school students have been involved in the research. Continuation of the project will contribute substantially to increase the ethnic diversity of natural resource scientists serving society. The project will support the first professionally accredited Forestry Program at a Historically Black College or University as well as one of the few doctoral programs in natural resources and environmental sciences at an HBCU.  The renewal project will involve significant outreach into communities and high schools to enhance recruitment and public awareness of environmental issues, especially in the Southern Cumberland Plateau Region that comprises parts of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.  The collaborations with federal and local agencies, as well as private landowners, will benefit the research efforts, establish future sustainability for the CFEA, and help to promote ecologically sustainable resource management practices.",

There are three thrust (sub-project) areas of research: (1) Forest community responses and dynamics; (2) Forest ecosystem functions and processes; and (3) Coupled dynamics of humans and landscapes. The &nbsp;research has three focal areas, with the primary one being at the William B. Bankhead National Forest, second at the Alabama Black Belt, and the third at Jackson County, AL/Winchester County, TN.</p>\n<p>Research in the Bankhead National Forest focuses on the responses of varying ecosystem and community components of the forests, as the USDA Forest Service established a long-term research project with the purpose of examining how prescribed thinning and burning of forests (and several combinations of) affects the reestablishment of deciduous hardwood trees&mdash;primarily oak species&mdash;in areas that were historically planted with loblolly pine. The Center&rsquo;s initial researchers had the rare opportunity to collect pre- and post-treatment data across a four block randomized complete block (RCB) experimental design. Across all thrust areas, researchers and their students have examined the responses of birds (Jill Wick, 2008; Emily Summers, 2014), herpetofauna (Bill Sutton, 2010; Timothy Baldwin, 2013; Iwo Gross 2017), mammals (Kelvin Young, 2008; Patience Knight, 2017), soils (Meiko Thompson, 2012; Fritz Ntoko, 2013; Dessy Owiti, 2014; Jonjala Jackson, 2016; Jazzalynn Smith, 2017), plant community (Joel Zak, 2008; Dana Virone, 2010; Clint Patterson 2011; Santosh Ojha, 2016; Yu Han 2017),&nbsp; molecular ecology (Fetun Desta, 2014; Rashid Farid, 2014), and applications of GIS and remote sense for natural resource assessment (Szymanski Fields, 2012; Kathleen Roberts, 2013). Research in northeastern Alabama and Tennessee is similar to that in the Bankhead, though with slightly different goals and slightly different experimental designs. Researchers here also examined responses of a variety of components within the forest ecosystem to different silvicultural methods, primarily forest vegetations (Shanta Parajuli 2006), birds (Adrian Lesak, 2005; Lisa Gardner 2008; Eric Margenau, 2014; Brandie Stringer, 2015; Richard Borthwich, 2015; Marissa Adams, 2016; Mercedes Bartkovich, 2017) and herpetofauna (Zachary Felix, 2007; Florence Chan, 2007; Chelsea Scott, 2008; Andrew Cantrell 2014). Research in the Black Belt of Alabama has primarily been on social perceptions of minorities as land owners and agricultural farmer (Buddhi Gyawali, 2007; Nieva Brown, 2009). There has also been a lot of research that covers a more broad part of the landscape, such as John Carpenter and Tim Baldwin&rsquo;s research on Cerulean Warblers and pool-breeding amphibian ecology in forests.</p>\n<p>The Center has positively benefitted the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences as well as the College of Agricultural, Life, and Environmental Sciences by appealing to students and creating important research in a variety of STEM related fields. Peer-reviewed publications, number of professional presentations given, and number of graduated students directly attests to this.</p>\n<p>In addition to the NSF funds, the center leverage more than $10M dollars or in-kind support from agencies such as the USDA, US-EPA, USDA-FS, NASA, the State of Alabama, the City of Huntsville, private sectors, and our own institution, AAMU.&nbsp;&nbsp;These resources have allowed us to fund research and engage our students in that research. McIntire-Stennis funds became available to the Center&rsquo;s forest ecosystem research and graduate assistantships. The Center&rsquo;s research professors benefited from 2 months release time for those professors to work on their project and advise MS and PhD students. The center made significant contribution to train STEM related undergraduate students by securing two NSF grants: Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Undergraduate Research and Mentoring in the Biological Sciences (URM) (total $1.5 million). The Center also has taken a leadership role in international collaborations for research and educational exchanges and established collaborations with countries with China, Brazil, Costa Rica, Honduras, etc. These international efforts have been funded by National Science Foundation, US Department Agriculture and partners in these countries (total ~$1.5 million).&nbsp; The university has established a long-term collaboration with several institutions in China.&nbsp; Many our graduate students (&gt;15) received fellowships from National Science Foundation, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Department of Agriculture, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (total ~$0.75 million).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Center has established lasting partnerships with local, state, national, and international organizations, governmental bodies, and other learning institutions. A few of these organizations are USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, William B.
