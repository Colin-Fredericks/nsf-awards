 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamical response of the tropical thermocline to continued greenhouse gas forcing represented one of the primary feedbacks influencing the future evolution of ocean warming, and understanding of past variability of this response based on paleo records is crucial for accurate simulation of future changes by global ocean/atmosphere models. The impact of the Indonesian Throughflow on the western Indian Ocean thermocline is rarely considered explicitly in climate models, despite the fact that it represents a substantial transfer of heat and energy. This project is aimed at analyzing trends in stable isotopes, trace elements, and radiocarbon in multiple coeval sclerosponge specimens to arrive at a robust, biennially resolved reconstruction of western tropical Indian Ocean thermocline change across the 20th century. The comparison of the radiocarbon trends with stable isotopic/trace element trends will help determine the extent to which the characteristics or strength of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) were responsible for the inferred thermocline changes. The research will generate valuable baseline data for assessing present and future impacts of anthropogenic environmental change on deep reef fauna. The award supports a graduate student's dissertation research, as well as outreach efforts in collaboration with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.",

This project was, using 14C, to establish the chronology of  a novel sclerosponge archive to assess tropical thermocline variability within the Indian Ocean.  A companion project is exploring the isotope geochemistry of the sclerosponges.\n\nIn 2007, a series of dredges were conducted off of the Seychelles Bank (roughly 5.5&deg;S, 57&deg;E) which brought up a variety of carbonate material from depths ranging from 60-150m.  A large portion of this material was made up of sclerosponges of genus Acanthochaetetes&mdash;biologically simple organisms that precipitate high-Mg calcite in apparent isotopic equilibrium with seawater. Sclerosponges are found throughout the tropics at depths of 0-500 meters and are slow growing at rates up to 2mm/year.  This collection presents an ideal opportunity to assess TIO thermocline variability and determine its forcing mechanisms throughout the 20th and likely into the 19th century.\n\nThe Seychelles Bank, located in the western TIO, is characterized by stepped terrace and drowned coral reef morphology, associated with sea level changes from the last deglaciation.  The stepped morphology provides strong vertical constraints on dredge depth and, therefore, the depth at which individual sclerosponges grew.
