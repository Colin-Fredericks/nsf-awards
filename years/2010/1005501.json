 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project supported by this award is to create new computer programs to calculate the interactions and properties of systems of three nucleons (atomic number A=3) using the most general form of interactions allowed by the physical laws of nature.  These new computer programs will be made publicly available, thereby allowing other researchers to explore different parameters of the interaction or different interactions without the need to write the intricate computer programs needed to explore a three-nucleon system.  A main motivation for this study is to understand the complex interactions between protons and neutrons in the nucleus; however the computational techniques used can also be applied to other areas of physics where three-body interactions are present, such as atomic physics (research with cold atoms) and particle physics (quark interactions inside the proton).\r\n\r\nThe method of predicting the behavior of three or more interacting bodies is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. While the interactions of two particles are fairly easy to calculate, the so-called three-body problem is much more difficult to solve.  A method attributed to Faddeev is now widely used, but the implementation of the Faddeev equations requires long and involved calculations that are best suited for powerful computers. The traditional approach to calculating the Faddeev equations uses a mathematical technique called partial-wave expansion.  However, as the energy increases in the three-body system, this mathematical technique becomes inefficient.  The current project utilizes a novel mathematical approach of taking spin traces, which allows the three-body problem to be solved at much higher energies, and generally increases the flexibility of implementing a wider class of inter-particle forces.  Hence, this project will provide a better theoretical framework for the investigation of the three-body problem than is presently feasible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project is to produce a computer program to solve\nthe quantum mechanical three-body problem for a variety of different\nphysical systems.  The three-body problem is the simplest problem\nwhere it is possible to perform quantitative studies of nuclear,\nsub-nuclear and atomic reactions and structure. Three-body systems are\nsufficiently simple that it is possible to make experimental measurements\nof all of their properties and at the same time perform calculations that\ngive exact predictions of a given quantum mechanical model to within\nthe uncertainties of the experimental measurements. \n\nThe solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem for\nrealistic mathematical models is computationally intensive and\nrequires specialized techniques.  The effort needed to produce a\nworking program is significant and often beyond the expertise of\ngroups that could benefit from having access to such a program.\nHaving a flexible program will provide these groups with access to a\nthree-body program without having to duplicate the significant effort\nneeded to create such a program.\n\nWhat is new about our program is that it uses computational\nmethods that allow us to compute solutions that are sensitive to\nphysics on much shorter distance scales than can be realized in other\navailable three-body programs.\n\nOutcomes:\n\n1) We reformulated the most cited force (the Argonne V18 interaction)\nbetween nucleons in a form that is compatible with the computational\nmethods used in our three-body programs.\n\n2) We made the program for this interaction freely available to the\npublic on the web.  This form of the interaction, expressed in terms\nof momentum variables, is needed for many other applications.\n\n3) We produced a program to solve the three body-bound state problem,\nincluding the effects of special relativity, in a form that can be\ngeneralized to treat high-energy collisions.\n\n4) We produced the first plots of relativistic three-body wave\nfunctions as functions of momentum variables.\n\n5) We identified four types of relativistic effects in the three-body\nbound-state problem and showed that while some of these effects are\nlarge, significant cancellations result when they are combined.  This\nprovides important feedback on how to properly include relativistic\ncorrections in calculations of more complex systems.\n\n6) Work is continuing on including the effects of relativity on the\naddition of intrinsic angular momentum in the three-body systems as\nwell as on the treatment of collisions in three-body systems.\n\n7) The research performed by the post doc who wrote the three-body\nprogram has led to a successful job search, which will allow him to\ncontinue working in this field and impact the next generation\nof students.\n\n8) The results of this work were disseminated in two publications in\nthe Physical Review and were presented at a number of conferences,\nworkshops and seminars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wayne N Polyzou"
