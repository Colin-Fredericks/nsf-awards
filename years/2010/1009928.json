Their presence refashioned the thermodynamic behavior of the gas collecting in the first bound cosmological objects, and catalyzed the transition from the Population III star formation mode into the pervasive, metal-enriched, clustered, Population I & II mode that heralded the epoch of the galaxies.  The behavior of metals in the early Universe was stochastic, inhomogeneous, and subject to nonlinear and nonlocal feedback effects.  This project will explore the complexity of metal dispersal by studying the transport and mixing of metals and dust in the first structures.  It also targets the nucleosynthetic footprint of pre-galactic metal enrichment in the nearby Universe.  The researchers will continue their successful use of large-scale numerical simulations to model the multi-scale build-up of structure, focusing on the transport of metals from their sources in the first supernovae into the cosmic web, their mixing with the primordial gas, their fallback into the first galaxies, and finally, their influence on the fragmentation of the proto-galactic medium and star formation.  Importantly, the team will mirror the simulations using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement methods, to constrain any numerical systematics.  They will characterize nucleosynthetic heterogeneities in the first galaxies, caused by fine-grain mixing of proto star-cluster gas driven by turbulence, and consider the observational characteristics of these first galaxies with an eye to future observations.  They will also study the transition from gravitational infall and virialization to turbulent fragmentation and local gravitational instability.\r\n\r\nThis work addresses the observable properties of first objects and will therefore guide astronomical searches with next-generation infrared facilities.  Involved graduate and undergraduate students will learn advanced astrophysics and cutting-edge methodologies for large-scale numerical modeling and the visualization of multi-scale systems.  Created animations will be freely available through a comprehensive web-based introduction to the formation of first objects, aimed at the general public.  The newly developed algorithms will be made public towards the end of the award.  The principal investigator will continue his previous writing of popular articles.",
