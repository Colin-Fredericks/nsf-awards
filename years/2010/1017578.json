 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to technology and industry trends, parallelism and energy\r\nefficiency have emerged as critical considerations in future computing\r\nsystems.  The investigators observe that many convenient models for\r\nwriting parallel programs can lead to significant redundancy in\r\ncomputation and data.  This redundancy can be used to improve\r\nperformance and reduce energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThe investigators observe that many parallel software models\r\n(e.g. data parallelism, Single-Program Multiple Data (SPMD),\r\nmulti-programming, and high-throughput computing) consist of multiple\r\nthreads of computation with very similar instructions streams and\r\nworking sets of data. The trick, however, is to design efficient\r\nmechanisms that both exploit this similarity and effectively support\r\nthe differences.  This project will follow two research thrusts to\r\neliminate redundancy across five application domains. First, the\r\nresearch will explore multi-threaded processor core designs that\r\neliminate redundant instruction fetch and/or execution.  Second, the\r\nresearch will explore content-aware caching techniques that reduce\r\nredundant storage of identical data across parallel threads and\r\nprocesses.",
