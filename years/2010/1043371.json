 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to The Franklin Institute to establish a Phase I Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP), which will focus on assessing and developing effective climate change education strategies for urban audiences, in collaboration with The Center for Climate Systems Research, a unit of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, The University of Pittsburgh Center for Learning in Out of School Environments (UPCLOSE), the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the New York Hall of Science, the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Science and the Association of Science and Technology Centers. The overall goal of the CCEP Phase I project is to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts. \r\n\r\nLed by The Franklin Institute, the partners will create the Urban Climate Education Partnership (UCEP) project, which will establish local networks within four urban centers -- Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Queens, NY, and Washington, DC -- forging links with informal and formal education partners, community groups, city government, and policy makers. Together this network will create and disseminate learner-focused climate education programs and resources for urban audiences. It is the vision of the UCEP to create an infrastructure of lasting collaborations to improve public understanding of and engagement with the science of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe audiences targeted by this project are those within the urban environments of the core network cities. This partnership's specific goals include: 1) identifying critical climate change adaptation and mitigation issues facing urban populations; 2) creating a set of Urban Learning Networks (ULN) each tasked with conducting inventories of new and existing educational resources for four specific target audiences (families, schools, communities, or adult/policy groups); 3) determining which critical climate issues resonate the most with their selected target audiences; 4) creating a plan for implementing programming created for each selected audience; 5) serving as a test bed for cross-platform implementation among network hubs, and 6) assessing the impact of cross platform climate change education.\r\n\r\nThe key deliverable of the UCEP Phase I project to develop a robust strategic plan for education, research, and evaluation activities for each city. Once implemented, the plan will increase climate science literacy for crucial urban audiences through the development of an integrated package of cross-platform climate education initiatives. Programs and curricula will be developed to be targeted (aimed at specific audiences), coordinated (presenting consistent and clear information about the science of climate change) and concentrated (delivered many times, through many programs). \r\n\r\nMore information on this project is available by contacting the PI, at ssnyder@fi.edu",
