 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the dynamics of risky behavior, specifically how people's social contexts and feelings jointly influence whether they chose to engage in personally risky behavior. What kind of power people believe they have in situations, how they cope with stress, and whether these processes lead them to refrain from or engage in risky inter-personal behavior. The research uses a field experimental method in which the same study participants anonymously report on their thoughts, feelings, and risky decision-making behaviors each day for several weeks. \r\n\r\nThe research draws upon theories that are broad, based in health psychology and the social psychology of power, but in order to consider the local social context or \"ecology\" fully, the research will focus on a particular group of at-risk people: Asian American and Pacific Islander men because 1) health statistics show that the increase in HIV-infection rates are rapid and unabated with this population, 2) they experience other health problems at higher rates than other populations and little is known about the causes for that disparity, 3) there is very little research in the HIV-prevention and intervention research that addresses their particular situations, needs, and vulnerabilities. In addition to considering individual stress and coping variables, the research also considers how feeling unaccepted either in the majority community or in the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities may influence participants' behavioral choices, particularly choices that involve other people. The research will consider how resources and needs influence the psychology and behavior behind risk or safety.\r\n\r\nThe results will be disseminated to the larger scientific community to contribute to an understanding of how sociocultural, contextual, and group-based factors interplay with individual-level variables regarding risky behavior. In addition, these findings may suggest feasible new methods of data collection with ethnic minority and other vulnerable groups. The field research, theory, and experimental results from this project will provide a strong basis for developing social interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the behaviors and consequences for psychological and physical health that can result from social inequality.",
