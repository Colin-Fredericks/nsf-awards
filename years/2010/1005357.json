 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international Group on Earth Observations is coordinating efforts to build a Global Earth Observation System of Systems, or GEOSS. This system of systems  will proactively link together existing and planned observing systems around the world and support the development of new systems where gaps currently exist. It will promote common technical standards so that data from the thousands of different instruments can be combined into coherent data sets. The GEOPortal offers a single Internet access point for users seeking data, imagery and analytical software packages relevant to all parts of the globe. It connects users to existing data bases and portals and provides reliable, up-to-date and user friendly information vital for the work of decision makers, planners and emergency managers.\r\n\r\nGEO is a voluntary partnership of governments and international organizations. It provides a framework within which these partners can develop new projects and coordinate their strategies and investments. As of September 2009, GEO's members include 80 Governments and the European Commission. In addition, 56 intergovernmental, international, and regional organizations with a mandate in Earth observation or related issues have been recognized as Participating Organizations. GEO is governed by annual Plenary consisting of all Members and Participating Organizations. It is the GEO's primary decision-making body. The USA is represented through the (USGEO), a subcommittee of the U.S. President's National Science and Technology Council, comprising two White House offices and fourteen U.S. departments and federal agencies. The NSF, as a co-chair agency of USGEO, is contributing support to the United States Group on Earth Observations (USGEO) for planning and logistical support for the upcoming GEO-VI Plenary in Washington, DC, November 17 and 18, 2009.",
