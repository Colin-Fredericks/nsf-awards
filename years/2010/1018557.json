This project addresses these issues, the relationship between accountability and other goals (such as user privacy), and the requirements (such as identifiability of violators and violations) for accountability in real-world systems.  This clarification of the important notion of accountability will help propel a next generation of network-mediated interaction and services that users understand and trust.\r\n\r\nThe project's technical approach to accountability as an essential component of trustworthiness involves two intertwined research thrusts.  The first thrust focuses on definitions and foundational theory.  Intuitively, accountability is present in any system in which actions are governed by well defined rules, and violations of those rules are punished.  Project goals are to identify ambiguities and gaps in this intuitive notion, provide formal definitions that capture important accountability desiderata, and explicate relationships of accountability to well studied notions such as identifiability, authentication, authorization, privacy, and anonymity.  The second thrust focuses on analysis, design, and abstraction.  The project studies fundamental accountability and identifiability requirements in real-world systems, both technological and social.  One project goal is to use the resulting better understanding of the extent to which accountability is truly at odds with privacy and other desirable system properties to design new protocols with provable accountability properties. Building on that understanding and insights gained in designing protocols, the project also addresses fundamental trade-offs and impossibility results about accountability and identifiability in various settings.  The broader impacts of the work include not only engagement with students but also  a new perspective on real world accountability in trustworthy systems.",

This project took the view that, when security violations occur, the essential quality of \"accountability\" is that the violators are punished.\nAlthough \"accountability\" is widely agreed to be important and desirable, there has been little theoretical work on the subject; indeed, there does not even seem to be a standard definition of accountability, and researchers in different disciplines use it to mean different things.

This clarification of the important notion of accountability can help propel a next generation of network-mediated interaction and services that users understand and trust.\nThe most significant project outcome is a definitional framework for accountability, together with its application to the study of accountability in \"open\" and  \"closed\" systems.  This work shifts the focus from evidence and verdicts (which typically involve identification and identity) to punishment.  The definitional framework includes a deterrence-based definition of accountability, formalized in utility-theoretic terms, that allows for exploration of the relationship between punishment and the strength of the connection between system users and \"nyms\" they may be known by in the system.  We demonstrate the usefulness of the definitional framework by applying it to the study of \"open\" and \"closed\" systems for accountability -- that is, systems that differ in the extent to which they require a user to be bound to a nym in order to participate in the system.  This represents a step toward the important goal of formally reasoning about the relationship between accountability and identity.\nAdditional project results included a study of approximate privacy, exploration of so-called side channels in Facebook, and a game-theoretic consideration of when it can be useful and appropriate to collaborate with opponents while still working to defeat them in the long run.\nBecause accountability is a multidisciplinary area that includes both technical and policy aspects, a major part of the project involved organizing, participating in, and giving presentations at events bringing together specialists from a variety of relevant disciplines.
