 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the science behind developing nano rare earth particles and their role in the protection of cells under radiation environments. Potential payoffs include (1) engineering of nanoparticle surfaces for biomedical applications, (2) understanding and simulating the interaction of nanoparticles under harsh radiation atmospheres and (3) the use of nanoparticles in the prevention of radiation induced damage.  The work tests the hypothesis that cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) protect gastrointestinal mucosa from radiation therapy (RT) without protecting the tumor.  This will be a major breakthrough in cancer treatment if it is successful.  Project scope includes the synthesis and characterization of bare and polymer coated CNPs, numerical modeling of the nanoparticle-cell relationship to study the prevention of radiation damage by nanoceria, and determining the effect of CNPs on irradiated gastrointestinal mucosa and tumor in vitro.  Broader impacts of the work are focused on biomedical applications and potential applications of nanotechnology to cancer treatment.  The research will be integrated into various courses taught at the University. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in this project.",
