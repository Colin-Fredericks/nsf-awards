This project is creating a series of low-cost, quantitative laboratory experiments that teach students how to perform investigations using state-of-the-art fluorescent microarray technology; a technology previously not available to large-scale biology courses. The microarrays allow students to conduct inquiry-based investigations exploring plant biodiversity, systematics and evolution. As part of the evaluation process, undergraduate research students are conducting the experiments to ascertain the robustness of all procedures, instructional materials and equipment to ensure wide-scale educational adaptation of this technology. The microarrays and instruction materials are being made available to the larger biology community.\r\n\r\nThis project is being co-funded by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.",

Students can now use supercomputing resources to determine the collection of genes that respond to changing concentrations of phosphorous.  Phosphorous is an essential plant nutrient but is considered a water pollutant when the concentration becomes too high.  From genomic information, student can propose hypotheses and test their hypotheses with DNA technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stokes S Baker"
