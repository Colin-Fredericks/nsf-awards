This research will utilize a mixed methodology approach combining quantitative data from surveys with qualitative data from interviews, classroom observations, and content analysis of textbooks and policy documents. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis research informs education and curricular policy in post-conflict nations. In societies that have undergone inter-group conflict and must deal with past human rights violations and mass atrocities, the construction of a new civic identity and interpretation of past events is paramount for societal reconstruction and for preventing future conflicts.",
