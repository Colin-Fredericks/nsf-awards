Challenges include developing faculty communities, using more robust evaluation methods, and encouraging broader adoption. This project supports a two-day workshop for computer science PIs to expand the scope of their Type 1 projects and write competitive TUES Type 2 proposals.  Twelve teams of two investigators are being recruited.  The workshop leaders and guest speakers have experience managing Type 2 projects.  It is hosted by the University of Texas at El Paso.  Materials will be made available to the computer science education community.",
