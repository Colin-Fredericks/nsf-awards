Corbato\r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThis RII Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Cyber Connectivity (RII C2) award would leverage the facilities and statewide reach of the UEN to expand the capabilities of the of the research and education communities to more effectively engage faculty and students across Utah in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. The proposers seek to extend network capabilities (initially provisioned at an aggregate bandwidth of 30 Gbps) of the Research@UEN optical network to BYU to complement capabilities under development for Utah State University (USU) and UU. Research@UEN?s Phase-1 development includes the Salt Lake City metropolitan optical network and a fiber-based spur to Logan in support of UU and USU, respectively. The RII C2 project proposes southward extension to Provo for BYU that can enhance the level of collaboration and computational engagement among the three institutions, and greatly expand their capabilities to collaborate with researchers nationally and internationally through high-speed access to the national R&E networks, Internet2, and National LambdaRail (NLR).\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit :The research and education initiatives of this RII C2 project will enable collaboration among academic researchers and with peers at national laboratories, establish experimental networks, and lead to next generation network development efforts. Connecting to Research@UEN will strengthen the ability of the research institutions to recruit and retain new faculty leaders. The wider deployment of optical networking connections is critical to ability to collaborate aggressively and to share large volumes of data with colleagues across the country and the globe. With similar optical networks now either in operation or under development in most other states, Research@UEN is essential to the three Utah research universities? ongoing research competitiveness and collaborative capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project seeks to launch a multi-institutional effort that will enable research on issues of importance to Utah while strengthening STEM training of its youth. Research@UEN and the campus network upgrades will contribute to economic development in Utah through the training of CI-and networking-fluent students and staff and facilitating of faculty research collaborations with local companies. The ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive optical networking infrastructure for all institutions of higher education in Utah.",

Two significant benefits are supporting current throughput and performance expectations for interdisciplinary research collaboration involving Utah academic researchers and the degree of higher education ownership and control that will help the network scale as these requirements naturally grow over time.\n\nWe worked closely with the long-standing, statewide Utah Education Network (UEN) as it received additional ARRA-based funding from a National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) award.  This coordination resulted in a significant leveraging of NSF\u00c6s investment.  The related segment enabled by the NTIA funding was the 101-mile extension from Salt Lake City to Logan, Utah, in support of the state's third major research university, Utah State University (USU).   Through the combination of these two awards, we established - for the first time - optical network connectivity among the principal research universities in Utah and tied them to the national, 100-Gbps backbone of the Internet2 Network in support of the broader NSF EPSCoR objectives in Utah.\n\nIn addition to acquiring fiber optic cable from two wholesale telecommunications carriers, a significant advance was our forging three public sector partnerships with the Utah Transit Authority (UTA), the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), and the City of Provo for sharing cost effectively the necessary optical network capabilities (e.g., right of way, conduit, fiber).  We worked with UDOT and BYU to extend the optical network along the 45-mile optical fiber path between Salt Lake City and the BYU campus in Provo.  BYU contributed fiber obtained through Provo City to interconnect with this fiber that our team acquired through UDOT. \n\nThis network also connected to the Salt Palace Convention Center in downtown Salt Lake City to support the temporary high-performance and wireless networks (SCinet) for the SC12 high performance computing conference and exhibition in November 2012. SC12 attracted nearly 10,000 international attendees.  SCinet supported nearly 800 Gigabits per second of external bandwidth.
