The title of the workshop is \"Workshop on the auroral substorm and its importance on the development of solar-terrestrial research\".  This international workshop commemorated the birth of the concept of the auroral substorm and was attended by 60-70 scientists from the international space physics community.  Dr. Gjerloev was in the program committee and responsible for administrating the funding received from NSF. \n   Students and underrepresented groups were invited to apply for financial support to attend the conference.  Without this support they would not be able to participate. In all meeting announcements it was emphasized that financial support will be available and that the organizing committee strongly encourages these groups to submit abstracts.  Dr. Gjerloev submitted the invitation to several US and European newsletters.  With an estimated airfare of $2000 per person we were able to fund 10 participants with a priority on the above groups.
