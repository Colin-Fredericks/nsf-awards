Much of the\r\nwork concerns \"fusion frames,\" which provide a natural framework\r\nfor performing hierarchical data processing.  Recent advances in\r\nhardware technology have enabled the economic production and\r\ndeployment of a large number of low-cost components, which in\r\ncombination enable reliable and efficient operation.  Across many\r\ndisciplines there is a fundamental shift from centralized\r\ninformation processing to distributed or network-wide information\r\nprocessing.  Data communication is shifting from point-to-point\r\ncommunication to packet transport over wide area networks where\r\nnetwork management is distributed and the reliability of individual\r\nlinks is less critical.  Radar imaging is moving away from single\r\nplatforms to multiple platforms that cooperate to achieve better\r\nperformance.  Wireless sensor networks are emerging as a new\r\ntechnology that potentially enables cost-effective and reliable\r\nsurveillance.  All these applications involve a large number of data\r\nstreams, which need to be integrated at a central processor.  Fusion\r\nframes are a recent development designed precisely for these\r\napplications.  The investigator develops concrete constructions of\r\nfusion frames and the algorithms needed for their implementation.  \r\nWorking directly with engineers guarantees that advances here have\r\nImmediate implementation.  The techniques are also applied to\r\nproduce Grassmannian frames for quantum physics -- especially\r\nQuantum information theory, quantum state tomography, and quantum\r\ncryptography.  Finally, frame theory has shown that the 1959\r\nKadison-Singer Problem is equivalent to fundamental unsolved problems\r\nin a dozen areas of research in pure mathematics, applied mathematics,\r\nand engineering.  This project develops the needed frames for resolving\r\nwhat is now one of the most significant open problems in mathematics. \r\n\r\n     We have now entered a new era where the Defense Department,\r\nHomeland Security, and industry must process amounts of data that\r\noverwhelm even current computer capacities.  Especially for\r\ndefense, it is critical to be able to process these data in real\r\ntime, which is becoming more and more difficult.  The problems\r\ncaused by this \"information overload\" are escalating rapidly\r\nevery year and need to be addressed immediately and quickly. \r\nTherefore, it is of vital national interest to automate as much\r\nof the information fusion process as possible.  But at this time,\r\nin the area of information fusion the fundamental mathematics\r\nnecessary for such an automated system is far behind the current\r\nneeds.  The investigator and his students develop the mathematics\r\nnecessary for tackling these critical needs.  This includes\r\nmethods for storing and processing information in parallel --\r\ni.e. dividing it into multiple subsystems for simpler processing\r\nand then \"fusing\" the results to get the desired outcomes.  It\r\nalso includes developing distributed sensing networks that can\r\nkeep an area under surveillance while taking into account severe\r\nphysical limitations of the systems such as low communication\r\nbandwidth, limited signal processing power, limited battery life,\r\nor the topography of the surveillance area.  Such an automated\r\nsystem must be able to combine a large number of sources of quite\r\ndisparate information while leaving almost no room for error. \r\nThe investigator and his students address these needs as well as\r\ntry to anticipate the next level of difficulties that will arise.",

In particular, phase retrieval by projections was developed which is needed in twinning for x-ray crystallography.   In another direction, properties of fusion frames were developed for engineering applications in distributed processing, wireless sensor networks, packet-based encoding and multiple antenna radar.   In yet another direction, equiangular tight frames were developed and generalized.  ETF\u00c6s have application to communication theory, quantum cryptography, spherical designs, strongly regular graphs and quantum information theory.  The Restricted Isometry Property was studied and refined.  RIP is fundamental for the application of compressed sensing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter G Casazza"
