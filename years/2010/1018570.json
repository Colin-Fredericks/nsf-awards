 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced Grid-Enabled Algorithms to Discover Conformations of Proteins\r\nProteins are molecular machines that need to move in order to function. Computationally one can model their motion according to physical equations of motion that are weighted according to an energy function. Discovery of the shapes or conformations of proteins is a sampling problem in a very high dimensional space, and thus difficult. Solving this problem can assist in the discovery of biologically relevant intermediates of reactions, design of new medicinal drugs, and better characterization of their biological function.\r\nThis proposal will develop new algorithms and software to discover the conformations of proteins. We exploit distributed or grid computing to pursue exploration of the conformational space. We use a dimensionality reduction approach where the search is confined to the slowest and most collective motions of the protein. This greatly accelerates sampling and is scalable to large proteins. We will apply our technique in two algorithms, replica exchange and the on-the-fly string method. Replica exchange uses multiple simulations at different temperatures and performs periodic exchanges among them to achieve annealing. The string method finds a minimum free energy path that connects two known conformations of a protein: for instance, inactive to active enzyme. Our technique automatically finds ?slow? and collective variables along which to search conformations. \r\nIntellectual merit: Our methods hold promise to accelerate the search by 3 or more orders of magnitude, opening entirely new avenues of research related to large conformational changes that happen over long timescales for larger proteins.\r\nBroader impacts: These algorithms will be released as open source software with a Python interface and GPU-accelerated implementations, and will be able to use large distributed systems. Validation will be done on a specific protein system for which experimental data is available. \r\nIn collaboration with the Shodor Foundation, we will involve high school students and teachers in developing web content in support of the work on this proposal. We will explore whether including these materials in courses raises interest in computational biology or biology or computation.",
