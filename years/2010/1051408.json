 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together a cross-disciplinary and cross-national set of scholars from two currently separate fields of study -- socio-legal studies and disaster studies -- to develop a new more sophisticated research agenda in the near future that draws from the intersections of these two areas of study. Scholars at the workshop will work to develop the basis for new intellectual directions in the impact of natural and man-made disasters on the attribution of risk and blame; the application of existing rules; the introduction of new norms and rules; the development of new governmental institutions; and the re-constitution of the social understanding of identity, responsibility, rights and the role of law. Consistent with the goal of expanding international collaboration in these fields, the site for the proposed workshop is the Onati International Institute for the Sociology of Law in Onati, Spain.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will foster exchange and collaboration among a range of international scholars from a variety of disciplines. It also has the potential to initiate a new and potentially transformative line of research in currently disparate areas of research.",

Law both creates and mitigates the conditions for disaster, and draws together participants in response and recovery.  The place of law in\nstructuring what people do and how people engage the law has been\nunder-explored while disasters near and far become more visible to us daily,\nincluding via blogs and social media as well as more traditional electronic and\nprint media.  Uncertainty and risk spread, and law is an appealing fix. However, people remake the law as they make claims to insurance agents, courts and government officials, and not everyone will see the law as designed to fix problems, nor are the problems people have always those legal officials imagine. Finding the patterns in legal engagement and response is crucial to adapting to risk and mitigating and responding to\ndisaster.  Participants in this workshop have built new collaborations and brought complementary analytical skills to analyzing what states do in responding to disaster.  The project has resulted in an edited collection of essays with another forthcoming, and informed the teaching and public\noutreach of multiple scholars.  Issues discussed include law as causal in disaster, law as the occasion for revising immigration restrictions, law as assuming criminality in the aftermath of disaster, and assumptions about the responsibility of individuals in disaster embedded in law.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Phillips"
