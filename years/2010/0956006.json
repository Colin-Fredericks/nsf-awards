 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Dybowski and his students from the University of Delaware will refine methods for calculation of NMR parameters of compounds of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and thallium, all spin-\u00bd nuclei using ZORA-DFT calculations on models that mimic the local environment of solid compounds, as well as measure these parameters for materials that represent various chemical environments.  These heavy metals are essential to technologies as diverse as car batteries, semiconducting devices, and high-temperature superconductors, and the means to identify the chemical structure, such as NMR, provide information on them.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of analysis with NMR is the use of sophisticated computational methods to infer the electronic structure (the basis of the chemistry), particularly from proton and carbon NMR spectra.  The connection of the NMR spectroscopy of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and thallium to the electronic state, although theoretically understood, is much less well developed.  The proposed calculations require one to deal with large numbers of electrons and the electrons must be treated as relativistic particles - tasks that tax even the ability of modern computers.  Graduate and postdoctoral students who work on these tasks will be developing the next stage of analysis with NMR spectroscopy, a skill that will allow them to widen the use of NMR spectroscopy to problems of materials science underlying much of modern technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn chemistry, generating materials is important.  But, identifying the natuer of a material is an equally important procedure.  Spectroscopy has come to be a major method for identifying and characterizing materials.\n\nOf the various spectroscopi techniques used to identify materials, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy holds a prominent place in materials characterization, because of the uniqueness of the relatiionshiip between the spectroscopic response and the natuer of the material.  Ialmost any chemical research institution, there will be at least one, and likely several, NMR spectrometers.\n\nTo identify and characterize solid materials requires one to understand the connection between the NMR response and the nature of the material, most particularly the structure.  The connection can be crated emipirically or theoretically. The thrust of the work supported by this grant has been to develop a theoretical framework that allows one to make this connection with precision and reliability.  Of special interest to us has been the relationship of local solid structure and the NMR spectroscopic response of materials that conatin heavy atoms like lead and meercury.  The result of these efforts is a set of theretical calculational techniques that predict the NMR signatuer from knoweldge of the solid-state structure of the material.\n\nHaving established the theoretical framework, we applied the technique to stud processes such as the deterioration of master paintings because of the formation of lead soaps.  We also have applied this technique to the analysis of the so-called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), to semiconducting solids, and to pharamceutical identification.  In all of these cases, the theoretical prediction of NMR properties allows one to associate the NMR signature with particular structural features.  For example, the structures of lead salts of fatty acids have been shown to fall into two classes.  In another example, the calculational technique allows determination of the local structure of an active pharmaceutical ingredient that cannot be deermined by other methods.\n\nUnder this grant, four graduate students, two men and two women, developed experimental and theoretical skills required for understanding complex materals.  Although the theoretical calculations are sbutle and esoteric, these applications demonstrate how important these theoretical techniques are to an understanding of the nature of materials around us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cecil R Dybowski"
