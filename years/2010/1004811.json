Seven undergraduate students per year will join research groups for ten weeks of summer research in a number of fields, including nuclear physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics, plasma physics and device physics. Student research in these areas will lead to publication and presentation at national conferences, as has been established by the prior results of each group.   Hope College has a long tradition of students and faculty working side-by-side in the laboratory on significant research projects.   With proper guidance, student researchers are expected to be involved in the planning, execution, interpretation and dissemination of the research.    This award is funded through the Physics Division and the Division of Materials Research.",
