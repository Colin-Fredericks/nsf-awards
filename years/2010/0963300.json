 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nThis award will permit the renovation of the Research Building of the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute (PARI). This facility is located in rural North Carolina at the former NASA Rosman Tracking site, which dates back to the 1960s. The renovation consists of several sub-projects, namely nonstructural repairs to a leaky roof, repairing the HVAC, repairing and renovating electrical generation equipment, renovating the fire alarm and equipment monitoring system, renovating the telecommunications system, and repairing the associated antenna structures for two 26-meter radio antennae. \r\n\r\nPARI's mission is to provide research space for scientists, students, and non-professionals. Current research focuses on radio surveys of the Milky Way Galaxy, various projects in time-domain astrophysics, and studies of the wind speeds in the upper atmosphere of the Earth. The radio observations are conducted on-site using two 26-meter radio telescopes. The facility is host to a large and growing collection of astronomical glass plates, which are being digitized and cataloged for use in time-domain studies. \r\n\r\nPARI provides research opportunities to university faculty and students, citizen scientists, and K-12 students. PARI is a member of the NSF supported North Carolina Math and Science Education Network and the North Carolina Alliance to Create Opportunity Through Education. Its location in rural North Carolina provides a unique opportunity for science research and education in an under-served part of the country.",

The research is coordinated on PARI\u00c6s campus through our Research Building.  PARI hosts four long-term major research programs, as well as short term (1-3 year) research programs often associated with testbed instrumentation or astronomical/aeronomical observation campaigns.  One long term project is the only project in the world dedicating the use of PARI\u00c6s 26-m radio telescopes to observations of a small nebulae which are a component of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Another project focuses on time domain astronomy, where about one hundred years of astronomical images are digitized, and the information used to study long term variations in astronomical objects and the nature of non-stellar components of the Galaxy.  A third project is studying the Earth\u00c6s upper atmosphere, measuring wind speeds and temperatures using an optical etalon interferometer installed in a small research outbuilding on the PARI campus.  A fourth long term project monitors changes in the period of rotation of neutron stars &ndash; stars that are remnants of supernova explosions.  This project shares one of the 26-m radio telescopes.  As these major projects continue, other smaller, or shorter projects are set up at PARI and required a state-of-the-art research building.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nPARI is a science laboratory where the blend of research, education and public outreach combine to make scientific inquiry and training available to users from leading edge research scientists to virtually anyone with an inquiring mind. In addition to university professors, graduate and undergraduate students who use of the facility, research opportunities are open to K-12 students, especially minority students through several NSF sponsored programs, private foundation support and other university programs. A primary component of these projects includes an educational emphasis on incr..."
