 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes program of the Chemistry Division is co-funded by the Biomolecular Systems Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. The award supports work by Dr. Hang (Hubert) Yin at the University of Colorado at Boulder to carry out fundamental studies on understanding the molecular recognition in cellular membranes and to establish a solid foundation for an integrative chemical biology educational program in the Front Range region. Integral membrane proteins regulate pivotal biological processes through their transmembrane domains. But molecular recognition in the cellular membrane is little understood due to the lack of available probes with high affinity and specificity. Dr. Yin's group aims to develop a generally applicable method to probe molecular recognition in representative membrane protein systems (e.g. Escherichia coli aspartate receptor, Tar). The pedagogic activities involve establishing an infrastructure for a progressive, integrative chemical biology program that empowers diverse groups of students, researchers and educators. Collaboration with local high schools will be carried out, promoting chemical biology and biotechnology interest in the youth. Another major focus of our integrative research and education program is on promoting under-represented minority groups in science within the Boulder population. This work will positively impact scientific advancements and the local community by: (1) expanding the fundamental understanding of molecular recognition in cellular membranes; (2) shedding light on the poorly understood mechanisms of signal transduction across membranes, and (3) integrating research, teaching, and outreach activities at the University of Colorado at Boulder.",
