Using official data on employment, earnings, and productivity in manufacturing industries, this investigation will study the extent to which increased earnings inequalities are associated with improved productivity or, conversely, may be simply aggrandizing the higher salaries of already privileged employees with greater bargaining power which thereby depletes revenues for pay raises among less advantaged workers. The findings will thus shed light on the critical issue of whether rising inequality is necessary to avoid economic stagnation or whether the decline of the middle-class is simply the result of exacerbating salary differentials that do not commensurately promote economic growth.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the extent and sources of underpayment and overpayment in the labor market will inform and advance public policy debates about the efficacies of current programs and laws relating to the regulation of the labor force. By identifying which specific groups of workers are not fully compensated for their productivity (and which groups may be significantly overpaid), the results will have important implications for such issues as the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit, federal income tax rates, industrial and trade policies, family-leave regulations, welfare reform, affirmative action, civil rights law, and immigration legislation.  \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVirtually all social scientists agree that income inequality has been rising during the last few decades in the U.S.  In a democratic country where beliefs in prosperity and economic opportunity for all are widely shared, understanding the sources of this rising inequality is an important issue for researchers to scientifically investigate.  This task is especially significant because various social problems---such as long-term unemployment, persistent poverty, lowered school performance, mental illness, drug abuse, crime, teenage pregnancy, and divorce---are likely exacerbated by rising inequality.\n\nGiven this context, this research investigated economic and demographic statistics on productivity and income inequality for the labor force employed in the manufacturing sector from 1971 to 2001.  We studied these data because they are widely regarded as having higher quality and reliability.  The major research objective motivating our research is ascertaining the extent to which rising income inequality in the manufacturing sector is associated with increased industrial productivity.  If the higher earnings of some workers primarily reflect their greater abilities, job skills, and work efforts, then industrial productivity should rise to the extent that earnings differentials rise (after accounting for other relevant factors).  Conversely, if rising earnings differentials do not enhance industrial productivity, then they may more likely derive from monopolistic bargaining power or other organizational advantages that some employees may be able to utilize in order to extract higher salaries which are not necessary for the enhancement of industrial productivity.\n\nWhile individual workers certainly often vary from statistical averages, our results regarding the latter indicate that female workers, younger workers, Hispanic workers, and blue-collar workers as overall groups have tended to have been underpaid over this time period relative to their statistical contributions to the economic value of their industries.  Conversely, professionals, managers, and older workers (who often have greater seniority in their firms) have tended to have been overpaid over this time period relative to their statistical contributions to the economic value of their industries.  According to economic theory, the \"invisible hand\" of market competition is supposed to impartially administer economic discipline to all employees equally.  Our results suggest, however, that those with greater bargaining power within their companies (i.e., professionals, managers, and older workers with greater seniority) may be less subject to the discipline of market forces because their earnings are significantly greater than the economic value of their contributions to industrial productivity, at least on average in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIn other related results we investigated changes over time in these relationships.  In this regard, our findings do not suggest extensive change except for Hispanic workers.  The degree of underpayment among Hispanic workers during the 1970\u00c6s was quite small but it grew to an underpayment of 16 percent during the 1980\u00c6s and then to 31 percent during the 1990\u00c6s.  We speculate (but cannot substantiate with these data) that this increasing underpayment of Hispanic workers may perhaps relate to a rising number of undocumented Hispanic workers in the manufacturing sector over this time period. \n\nDue to the complexity of these statistical models and the limitations of the data, we stress that our results should be viewed cautiously until further research can assess the robustness of these findings.  We furthermore underscore that our results are limited to the manufacturing sector which, although large, does not employ the majority of the American labor force.  Future research expanding upon and improving upon our general approach may be worthwhile.\n\nNonetheless, tentative implications of our findings for public policy discussions may b..."
