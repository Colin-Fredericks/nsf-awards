The meeting focuses on recent developments and new challenges in symmetry methods for analysis of mathematical models that arise in a broad range of physical applications.  The conference topics include:\r\n-- Linear and nonlinear Lie symmetries of differential and difference equations: hidden (higher order) symmetries, differential invariants.\r\n-- Separation of variables theory and its relation to symmetry; applications to spinor equations and general relativity.\r\n-- Super-integrability of classical and quantum systems.\r\n-- Exact and quasi-exact solvability for Schrodinger eigenvalue equations.\r\n-- Relationship between symmetries and super-integrability of differential systems (especially hidden symmetries) and the theory of special functions.\r\n-- q-algebras and q-special functions; Askey-Wilson polynomials.\r\n-- Representation theory of Lie algebras, quadratic algebras, and cubic algebras.\r\n\r\nThe conference will assemble leading experts, promising younger researchers, and graduate students from around the world to assess the rapid advances in the area, reach a consensus on what are the most important problems, and evaluate the most promising directions for further advances. The conference will include a panel discussion that takes stock of the field, to be documented and posted online.  The conference encourages and supports participation by graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, women, and minorities.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/s4/",
