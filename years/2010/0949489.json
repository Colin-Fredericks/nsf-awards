 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex organisms such as animals and plants are made up of many different types of cells.  Different types of cells organize together to form organs (like the heart or kidney), where the cells must work together to function.  The genes and molecules that cells use to coordinate their development and make these complex structures are not well understood.  This project uses a simple, microscopic animal (the worm, C. elegans) to identify genes important for organ development, and to study how these genes work during organ formation.  The research findings will identify how the complexity of multicellular organisms is achieved.  They will also decode the DNA sequence information that results in a gene turning 'on' in certain cells, or 'off' in others.  Because of the simple research organism and the straightforward experimental methods, the research project is integrated into a training program for future research scientists and innovators.  Undergraduate research teams will learn current techniques in molecular and cellular biology, participate in experimental design and discovery, practice scientific communication skills, and develop team-building and leadership abilities, as they complete the research objectives.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe cells in our body all contain the same set of genes and DNA.  What makes one cell type different from another is which genes are active - or expressed - as RNA (and protein).  Gene expression is orchestrated through the combined activity of different transcription factor proteins.  The intellectual merit of this project relates to expanding our understanding of how transcription factor proteins influence the expression of other genes, to better understand the complex relationship between a given factor and its targets.  The work identified a number of prospective target genes for a Pax type transcription factor, and characterized the differences between targets in one cell type compared to another cell type.  The work also contributed to the development of new analytical methods and algorithms for the inference of transcription factor gene regulatory networks.  The broader impacts of the project relate to providing a long-term research experience for undergraduate students.  During the project period, 20 undergraduate students participated for between 1 semester and 4 years of mentored research. Eight of the student participants were from groups traditionally underrepresented in science.  All students received mentoring from the PI, as well as peer mentoring and support, and developed their skills in scientific writing and communication, as well as laboratory methods. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Helen M Chamberlin"
