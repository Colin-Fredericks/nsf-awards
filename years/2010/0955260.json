 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current EEG/MEG based neuroimaging technologies receive limited attentions in functional neuroimaging because their reliable performances have not been successfully demonstrated in sophisticated brain tasks. The need for more reliable, efficient, innovative EEG/MEG neuroimaging technologies that have high spatial and temporal resolutions is urgent. The goal of proposed research is to advance functional neuroimaging technologies in studying human brain functions, via integrating novel techniques from different disciplines, i.e. multi-resolution mathematic models, large-scale computation, advanced signal and image processing, and high-end measurement devices. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\n\r\nThe proposed research consists of applying the well-established L-1 norm regularization technique to a different application domain, namely EEG/MEG image analysis. The problem of image analysis is an undetermined problem, and as such some form of regularization is required. The traditional approach is to apply L-2 norm minimization, which is a valid method when measurement errors are Gaussian random variables. However, when the measurement errors are exponentially distributed, it is more meaningful to use L-1 norm minimization. Moreover, the L-1 optimal solution is supported on a finite (usually small) number of data points, thus naturally taking advantage of the sparse nature of the optimization problem. The novelty of the proposed research is the investigation of sparsity inducing models of neural behavior. In the case of neuro-imaging, it is known from biological factors that during any one millisecond interval, only a tiny fraction of the neurons in the brain \"fire\". The proposed research therefore has the potential to identify the parameters that describe this behavior. As partial evidence of this, the PI has obtained some preliminary results based on synthetic data, when the correct answer is known, and the results are encouraging.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\n\r\nThe project will generate novel problem-solving strategies for scientific problems using advanced engineering principles, and to clinical practice for neurological patients through the potential for reduction in loss of life, job, and income. By incorporating authentic learning education activities, we will broaden the participation of all levels of students, K-12 teachers, and other educators, in biomedical research and research educations.",

Much of the recent progress in cognitive neuroscience, concerning scientific issues related to language, attention, memory, and many others that were in the past intractable, derives from technological advances of neuroimaging. Meanwhile, neuroimaging technologies are rapidly entering clinical practice and have dramatically advanced our capability in medical diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and presurgical planning of various neurological diseases.</p>\n<p class=\"HTMLBody\">The goal of this NSF funded project is to seek to bridge the gap between the needs in modern human brain research and the availability of non-invasive neuroimaging technologies to reconstruct brain activity with accurate spatial distribution and precise timing, which is not available at the time we set off the project about six years ago. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been the prevailing neuroimaging technology six years ago in researching the human brain, but it is limited by its low temporal resolutions (~6-10 seconds), while neuronal events happen at milliseconds. Nowadays, fMRI is still the dominant neuroimaging technology due to its spatial penetration, while computational neuroimaging technologies based on electroencephalography (EEG) and/or magneto-encephalography (MEG) have regained the significant interests in the neuroimaging domain, partially due to the efforts of this NSF funded project, together with other researchers in the neuroimaging community with similar research interests and efforts in the past six years. Our contribution has been to realize the opportunity for redefining the reach of &ldquo;old&rdquo;, but classical, neuroimaging technologies, i.e. EEG and MEG, to push their advancements by integrating novel modeling and computational methods into data analysis, and to extend their applications in noninvasively addressing important clinical problems, particularly in the area of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, that have not been addressed sufficiently or only addressed using invasive means or other neuroimaging technologies.</p>\n<p class=\"HTMLBody\">It is well known that body surface recordings like EEG and MEG, made to infer functions within the body suffer from low spatial resolution and source ambiguity problems because of the volume conductor effect. To deconvolute the volume conductor effect, so-called EEG/MEG &ldquo;inverse problem&rdquo; should be solved, which poses significant mathematical challenges due to its non-uniqueness. Our work utilized novel multi-resolution modeling techniques (figure 1) and new mathematical principles from recently developed Compressive Sensing theory to solve EEG/MEG inverse problems. The result has been the creation of a new suite of electrophysiological imaging techniques, which is pushing the envelope of what we know about how to model and compute inverse problem in probing body functions from surface recordings. A significant result from this research activity makes the possibility of reconstructing brain source extents beyond only localizing source locations from existing EEG/MEG neuroimaging technologies (figure 2). This is of paramount importance in neurosurgical planning. As an example, extents of epileptic sources, not just locations, to make decisions on areas to be surgically resected for epilepsy patients are currently determined using invasive technologies in clincial routines. Our work on these computational neuroimaging technologies have demonstrated to provide such indicators using noninvasive EEG/MEG signals only (figure 3). Our work also demonstrated, for the first time, the specific networked brain activities can be reconstructed as well (see an example in figure 4), which is the one of two key mechanisms, i.e. dynamics and network, underlying the mystery of human brain functions. With the dynamic nature of EEG and MEG signals, the computational technologies we developed are ideal tools in researching human brain functions and are even better than fMRI in many aspects. In this NSF funded project, we pioneered modeling, signal processing, and computation to accomplishes all of these, which are the intellectual merits of the accomplished project outcomes. More importantly, with these great advances, novel and more valuable diagnostic measures for various brain disorders from neuroimaging technologies have been further indicated to generate broader impacts in clinic.</p>\n<p class=\"HTMLBody\">Together with these research activities, we further integrated our research outcomes into educational activities to make broader impacts. These efforts included the development of two new biomedical engineering courses at the University of Oklahoma, the creation of new hand-on educational materials of biomedical topics for authentic learning, lab research activity and education for high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and outreach education activity for young kids and K-12 students and teachers.
