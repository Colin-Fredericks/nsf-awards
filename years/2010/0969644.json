 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's Tensor Triangular Geometry is an umbrella program covering the \r\ngeometric study of tensor triangulated categories in algebraic geometry, \r\nmodular representation theory, stable homotopy theory, motivic theory, \r\nnoncommutative topology, and beyond. Be they modules, spaces, motives or \r\nC*-algebras, objects are usually too wild to be classified up to \r\nisomorphism. However, one can always classify classes of objects stable \r\nunder the basic constructions which are: suspension, cone and tensor \r\nproduct (such classes are known as thick tensor-ideals). This \r\nclassification is made by means of subsets of a certain topological \r\nspace, constructed by the PI and called the triangular spectrum. This \r\nspace has been computed in stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry \r\nand modular representation theory, using the work of Hopkins-Smith, \r\nNeeman-Thomason, Benson-Carlson-Rickard and Friedlander-Pevtsova. \r\nComputing the triangular spectrum in noncommutative topology \r\n(equivariant KK-theory) or in motivic examples is a major ongoing \r\nproject where progress has recently been made. The broader ambition of \r\ntensor triangular geometry is that of building brides across some parts \r\nof mathematics as follows: Identify the concepts, results and techniques \r\nfrom any area covered by tensor triangular geometry which can be \r\nabstracted and consequently applied to all other areas under the \r\numbrella. Recent activity has exhibited numerous such phenomenons, in \r\nthe PI's work and beyond, like filtration by dimension of supports, \r\ngluing techniques, Picard groups, Witt groups, and more.\r\n\r\nTensor triangular geometry is a relatively new theory which can \r\nsimultaneously claim a large catalog of examples ranging from Algebra to \r\nAnalysis, a strong corpus of abstract techniques and a broad range of \r\napplications. The strength of tensor triangular geometry is illustrated \r\nby several new theorems in algebraic geometry and modular representation \r\ntheory, whose statement does not involve tensor triangular geometry but \r\nwhose proof does. This project is highly interdisciplinary and appeals \r\nto mathematicians from very different horizons.",
