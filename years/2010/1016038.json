 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on metamorphosis for shape analysis, which relies on a shape transformation\r\nmodel within which shape variation is coupled with other transformations of the data, permitting\r\ntopological changes, or partial advection of attributes attached to the deformed objects. This results\r\nin a versatile framework in which many different models can be devised, based on any mathematical\r\nstructure that can both be advected by diffeomorphisms and embedded in a Hilbert or\r\nRiemannian space. This construction equips the space of deformable objects of interest with a new\r\nRiemannian metric, allowing for the comparison of these objects, and for the use of tools associated\r\nto data analysis in Riemannian manifolds, like the representation of data sets in exponential\r\ncharts. The research will involve models of metamorphosis in which the deformable structures are represented\r\nby images, densities, or measures, in two or three dimensions. One of the main issues in\r\nthis context is the computation of geodesics, either as a variational problem (shortest path between\r\ntwo points in the manifold) or as an initial value problem (solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for\r\nthe evolution of geodesics). The numerical analysis of both problems is challenging, especially\r\nwhen one adds the requirement for the two solutions to be numerically consistent, in the sense that\r\ndiscrete solutions of the first problem coincide with discrete solutions of the second one, which is\r\nimportant for applications. This research will address these issues, by developing variational\r\nintegrators for the initial value problems, and shooting methods for the boundary value\r\nproblems, in contexts that will involve solutions that combine smooth and singular components.\r\nThe PI and collaborators will also deploy and extend of a comprehensive software\r\nthat provides a collection of algorithms associated to diffeomorphic matching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of shape analysis is to understand and represent variations of shapes in data sets of\r\ndeformable objects (like collections of landmarks, images, curves or surfaces). This issue is important,\r\nin particular, for the characterization of anatomical variations in medical images, and of\r\ntheir relation with pathologies. One of the main areas of applications in this context is known as\r\nComputational Anatomy, and methods from mathematical shape analysis have already been used for\u00a0\r\nseveral successful applications. Examples of developments in this domain include collaborations of the PI with\r\nresearchers at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, or at the Institute for Computational Medicine at\u00a0\r\nJohns Hopkins University, on the analysis of brain disease and of cardiac failure.\u00a0\r\nThe theory and tools that will be developed in this research will enable the analysis of situations that cannot be\u00a0\r\nhandled by previous methods, which work under the assumption that anatomical variation can be essentially described\r\nby smooth changes of shape. The proposed approach, called metamorphosis, will be able to address cases\r\nfor which these assumptions are not satisfied, and make possible, for example, the analysis of images\r\nthat include dramatic changes between subjects. This includes the analysis of datasets measuring the evolution\r\nof tumors, or describing brain recovery after a major stroke. The research will contribute to the emergence of new solutions\r\nin such contexts, and make the related software available to the scientific community.",
