Seven new students in each of the first two years of the project are receiving scholarships for four years, subject to sufficient progress towards an undergraduate STEM degree. S-STEM Scholars enroll in a special First Year Seminar. Seminar instructors utilize relevant Hope College support programs to provide academic and professional development events over the entire four year experience to inform students of opportunities that enable them to successfully prepare for and enter a STEM career. Additionally, S-STEM Scholars serve as role models for other students in the Holland area who may lack the confidence to pursue undergraduate STEM degrees.",
