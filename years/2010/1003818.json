 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team, in this collaborative proposal, aims to produce regional decadal-scale climate forecasts from paleo proxy data.  Generally, the researchers will improve existing analytical methods and develop new statistical methods for the reconstruction of past climates from heterogeneous geological proxies (tree rings, ice cores, speleothems, corals, sediments), with particular emphasis on regional variability over the past two millennia. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research team will use the regularized expectation-maximization algorithm (RegEM) algorithm to exploit linear covariation in space among different climate variables or proxies to impute missing values and estimate climate statistics. The goal is to directly address uncertainties in data, especially surrounding missing data within a series.  This is important for paleoclimate data sets since the spatial or temporal series may not be continuous.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts involve the training of students across disciplinary boundaries in a timely integration of statistics and climatology.",

Once again using GraphEM, Jianghao reconstructed global surface temperature over the past 2,000 years, and -- just as importantly -- rigorously estimated its uncertainties.\n\nThe global mean is shown in Fig. 2, and suggests, like a large body of previous work, that we really do live in extraordinary times: it is very likely warmer now that it has been in 2,000 years, and the rate of warming over the twentieth century does seem awfully unusual as well. But the beauty of a climate {\\it field} reconstruction is that one can probe the {\\em spatial} patterns and regional characteristics of this warming.  Fig. 3 thus shows that most regions are very likely to have experienced this warming, and that it was most intense over high-latitude northern continents. \n\n \n\nThere is much more that one can do with such a rich reconstruction. We are now working to diagnose the effects of variations in solar luminosity, explosive volcanism, and how this compares to climate model simulations. Most importantly, we are making all the code and data publicly available so others can check -- and extend -- our work. We are very thankful for the opportunities afforded by this grant, which will serve as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of natural climate variability, bringing man-made climate change into sharper focus. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julien Emile-Geay"
