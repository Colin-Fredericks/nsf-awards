 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative award will support formation of a Physics of Living Systems Graduate Student Research Network, a trans-institutional community-based network of graduate students and graduate student educators all working on the physics of living systems. The initial participating institutions are the University of California, San Diego (which will coordinate the program), the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Princeton University, Yale University, Cambridge University, and University College, London.   The network structure will allow students at participating institutions (and a select number of other students) to meet their peers (both in-person and in-silico) and collectively help define the research agenda for this field. It will also allow for the creation of visiting internships, which will serve both as a way of broadening students perspectives on possible approaches to difficult research topics and as a way of creating collaborative ties between groups at the various sites. This structure will also enable the exploration of various means of educating these students in biology, while also ensuring that they develop and maintain a firm grounding in physics.   This award is supported by the Physics of Livings Systems Program in the Physics Division in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, as well as Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

Under this PoLS award, the faculty in the Center for the Physics of Living Cells at the University of Illinois (UIUC) organized in 2014 an international meeting with its colleagues in the Physics Department and the Center for NanoSciences (CeNS) at the Ludwig Maximillian University (LMU) with graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from 7 PoLs partnering US Universities and 5 International (IPoLS) partnering Universities. Direct outcome of this meeting was the establishment of an exchange program with the BIophysics Center of Excellence and CeNS at the LMU and Max-Planck Institute in Munich which is still ongoing and provides support for the exchange of 4-8 graduate students between UIUC and Munich research laboratories. Most recent activity allowed 7 physics graduate &nbsp;students from Munich to attend the Hands On Cell Simulations Workshop organized by NIH/NSF IPoLS at the Beckman Insititute/UIUC in July 2018. This award also provided support for the creation of a new lecture series \"Physics of Living Systems\" in which leaders in emerging fields of biological physics and quantitative biology were invited for seminars and extended visits with various laboratories at UIUC. The topics ranged from molecular mechanisms of size control in budding yeast, exploring G-protein coupled receptors structure, dynamics, and assemblies with single molecule fluorescence, neuronal avalanches in condensed grey matter, to bone mechanics and cell function during growth and aging. These seminars and visits promoted new research projects in neurobiology, chemotactic responses of bacteria, and development of hybrid deterministic-stochastic simulations methods for cellular processes. This award also provided partial support for 3 graduate students engaged in these new research projects.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zaida&nbsp;Luthey-Schulten</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546275109493_flyer--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546275109493_flyer--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Images from Cell Simulation Workshop Flyer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546275109493_flyer--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Images from Cell Simulation Workshop Flyer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Left: 3D image of yeast cell reconstructed from cryo-electron tomogram.Right Top: 3D image of crowded bacterial cell with DNA Right Bottom: Reaction diffusion master equation describing state of cell undergoing cellular reactions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tyler Earnest and Zaida Luthey-Schulten</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zaida&nbsp;Luthey-Schulten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Images from Cell Simulation Workshop Flyer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279415738_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279415738_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS 2017 Meeting Program 1-4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279415738_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS 2017 Meeting Program 1-4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Venice Conference on Design and Control of Nanosystems: Exchange between Junior NanoNetwork in Munich and UIUC PoLS facultyand students</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CeNS/LMU/SFB1032</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zaida&nbsp;Luthey-Schulten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS 2017 Meeting Program 1-4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279601691_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279601691_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:credits\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279601691_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:credits\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Organizers and Supporting Institutes for Venice Meeting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CeNS/LMU/SFB1032</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zaida&nbsp;Luthey-Schulten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:credits</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279759331_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279759331_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:Partial Program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1026550/1026550_10049880_1546279759331_BoA_CeNS_Venice_2017_web-3_Page_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:Partial Program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Opening Program for Venice Conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CeNS/LMU/SFB1032</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zaida&nbsp;Luthey-Schulten</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Center for NanoScience/NSF IPoLS  2017 Meeting:Partial Program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
