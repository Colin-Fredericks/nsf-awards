 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study knowledge transfer oriented data mining (or\r\nKTDM). Given two data sets, the idea of KTDM is to discover models\r\nthat are common to both data sets, as well as models that are unique\r\nin one data set. These common and unique models with respect to the\r\ntwo data sets will provide a tool to leverage the already-understood\r\nproperties of one data set for the purpose of understanding the other,\r\nprobably less understood, data set. This EAGER project is to\r\nconcentrate on models in the form of a diversified set of\r\nclassification trees. The KTDM approach is useful for real-world\r\napplications in part due to its ability to allow users to narrow down\r\nto particular models, guided by known knowledge from another data set.\r\nIt will help towards realizing transfer of knowledge and learning in\r\nvarious domains. The project will support a graduate student and will\r\nseek collaboration with experts in the medical domain. These will\r\nincrease the impact of the project.
