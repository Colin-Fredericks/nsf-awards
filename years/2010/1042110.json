Rizkalla, will establish a new research-based academic nanotechnology track within the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME) Departments in established Bachelor of Science (BS) degree programs.   \r\n\r\nINEC will be attractive to a broad range of students in STEM disciplines.  Each year at least 30 new students will join this track and at least 100 students may take new nanotechnology courses as electives. INEC will enhance nanotechnology research and education locally and nationally by: 1) Enhancing the existing curricula, 2) Providing a Multidisciplinary Educational Model with Naitonal Impact, 3) Enhancing Industrial Impact, and 4) Enhancing Impact on Minority and Under-Represented Groups.",
