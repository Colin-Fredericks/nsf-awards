This\r\n\"large K and small n\" problem is a very challenging problem that requires thinking about statistical inference at a fundamental level. Employing an auxiliary data-generating approach to reason directly toward probabilistic inference , the PIs develop methods that are probabilistic and have desirable frequency properties. A sequence of topics to be investigated include 1) one-sample and two-sample \"large K and small n\" multinomial inference; 2) large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing; 3) application in genome-wide association study; and 4) associated efficient computational methods.\r\n \r\nThe \"large K and small n\" multinomial inference is motivated by genome-wide\r\nassociation studies with a large number of genotypes from single\r\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data. SNPs are major genetic variants that may\r\nassociate with common diseases such as cancer and heart disease. With new \r\nstatistical methods and computing software to be developed in the project, the\r\nresearch is expected to generate useful tools for applied statisticians and\r\nscientists who are challenged by very-high-dimensional count data.",
