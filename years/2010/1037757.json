 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks integrate validated means of measuring development of creativity in engineering courses, then make these measures broadly available to the STEM community.  The PIs have previously developed metrics to measure creativity based on an action-assessment cycle in which individuals both create and consume creative actions and artifacts.  The metrics developed will be applied in a test-bed of five diverse courses in order to understand methods of effectively assessing creativity. \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project are to test the previously developed framework for creativity assessment and thereby increase the ability of instructors to foster creativity in engineering courses.  Tools for measuring creativity will be shared, via a web site, with the community of creativity and evaluation experts in order to foster broader application of the theoretical framework and instruments.  Within the PI's institution the project, if successful, will impact the creativity of students which may have long term impact on innovation.",
