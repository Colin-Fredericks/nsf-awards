 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among silk producing organisms, spiders are unparalleled in their reliance on silk and variety of ways they use silk.  Most spiders have multiple types of silk glands, with each type synthesizing a task-specific fiber or glue.  Previous molecular studies of spider silk evolution and mechanical function have focused almost entirely on the attributes of the main structural proteins (fibroins).  However, the spider silk system necessarily includes fibroin as well as non-fibroin genes.  Hence, in this research, state-of-the-art genomic methods will be used to identify all the major elements and their relative abundance within the gene repertoires that underlie silk synthesis in cob-web weaving spiders.  The functional significance of the gene repertoires will be assessed by relating them to the mechanical properties of the various fiber types produced by three different species.  These results will enhance the understanding of how spiders make their high-performance silks.  This knowledge is relevant to the biotechnological efforts to mass-produce synthetic spider silk for industrial and medical applications.  In terms of educational impact, this research will directly involve undergraduates at a primarily undergraduate institution (Washington & Lee) and a minority-serving institution (UC Riverside) through incorporation into classroom curricula and student research projects.  Importantly, the grant will enable undergraduates to travel between the institutions for cross-training and to present at national science conferences, which will let the students eyewitness the collaborative nature of research and career opportunities for professional biologists.  Project results will be broadly disseminated by depositing data into genetic databases, publication in scholarly journals, incorporation into press releases, and presentations to school children and the general public. \r\n",

There are over 45,000 species of spiders, and much of their evolutionary and ecological success can attributed to their use of silk to catch food, protect themselves, and reproduce. Indeed, spiders are unparalleled among arthropods in the diversity of silks that they are able to synthesize. Most spiders produce a variety of task-specific silks. This means that an individual spider, such as a black widow, makes a number of different silks that can be spun into safety draglines, domiciles, three-dimensional webs, sticky snares, or swathing for enveloping eggs. The tailoring of silk types for particular functions has led to a phenomenal range of silk mechanical properties. For example, a spider can produce dry fibers that are extremely strong and tough from one set of silk glands, as well as gummy secretions that are wet and sticky from another set of silk glands. Support from the NSF enabled a team of researchers to understand how silk glands within the same individual can produce silks that are radically different from each other.
