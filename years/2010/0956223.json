 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Testing and Assessment proposes a two-day workshop on assessing 21st century skills building on two previous workshops.  The first workshop explored employer demand for employees who possess these broad transferable skills, which were defined as adaptability, complex communication, non-routine problem solving, self-management/self-development and systems thinking.   The second workshop considered the intersection between science education reform goals and the 21st century skills, examined models of high quality science instruction that may develop the skills and discussed teacher readiness to integrate the skills in instruction.  Both workshops expressed the need for assessments that can measure the attainment of 21st century skills.  This workshop is to describe research on assessment of 21st century skills to inform policies and practices.  The workshop is lead by an expert in assessment and convenes an expert committee of educational measurement specialists, cognitive psychologists and experts in job analysis and employment testing along with practitioners in schools.  The committee investigates the types of assessments available and associated technical reports and designs the workshop to review them.  Knowledgeable experts are commissioned to write papers and speak at the workshop.  An individual author writes a summary report to be disseminated by the NRC.  In the second year the NRC reconvenes the leadership of all three workshops to identify the next steps to provide research-based guidance to educational leaders seeking to infuse 21st century skills into instruction.",

The first part of the workshop, held on January 12-13, 2011, in Irvine, California, focused on\nresearch and measurement issues associated with assessing 21st\nskills.  The second part, held on May 4, 2011, in Washington DC, focused on policy and practices issues. To provide a focus for the workshop, the steering committee defined three broad clusters of 21st century skills: cognitive skills, interpersonal skills, and intrapersonal skills. A report summarizing the workshop discussions was reviewed in accordance with NRC procedures and published in September, 2011. It is available at:  http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13215.\n\n\nIn Phase 2, the NRC built on this workshop and other previous NRC activities on 21st century skills to conduct a consensus study of deeper learning and 21st century skills. The final report, along with the report brief, press release,\nand responses to the study, can be found at:   http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/BOTA/Education_for_Life_and_Work/index.htm\n\n\nThe consensus report defines \"deeper learning\" as the process of learning for transfer.  Through this process, students develop a blend of transferable knowledge and skills which the committee refers to as \"21st century competencies.\"  These competencies fall into three broad domains: \nThe cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains. Comparing this\ndefinition of deeper learning and 21st century competencies with the new Common Core State Standards in mathematics and English language arts and the NRC Framework for K&ndash;12 Science revealed important areas of overlap.  However, developing these higher-order competencies within the disciplines will require additional instructional time and resources to support sustained instruction and practice. \n\n\nThe report identifies instructional design principles to foster deeper learning and development of 21st century competencies in the cognitive domain. \nFurther research is needed to determine whether these principles, derived from research in the cognitive domain, could plausibly be applied to design instruction aimed at interpersonal and intrapersonal competencies.  The report recommends that foundations and federal research agencies support studies on teaching and learning for transfer, as well as research to:    \n\n increase our understanding of the relationships between 21st century\ncompetencies and adult outcomes; \nshed light on how to design instruction to help students develop transferable knowledge and skills in the interpersonal and intrapersonal domains; and \ndetermine whether and to what extent knowledge and skills developed in one discipline or subject area can transfer to another. \n\n\n\nThe primary intellectual merit of phase 1 of this project was to move the\ndiscussion about 21st century skills forward -- from discussions that primarily centered on identifying the skills to discussions about approaches for assessing them.  In the process, workshop participants discovered that there were no agreed-upon definitions of these skills;  without agreed-upon definitions, it is difficult to develop assessments that can be used on a large scale. Furthermore, questions were raised about the extent to which assessment results would be trustworthy and have fidelity. That is, there were questions about how susceptible assessments might be to faking (especially under high-stakes conditions) and the extent to which assessments could be\ndesigned so that they captured the actual processes involved in emonstrating\nthe skills. Laying out the concerns provided the first step toward addressing\nsome of the challenges, laying the foundation for the consensus study.\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of Phase 2 includes clarifying the meaning of \"deeper\nlearning\" and \"21st century skills\" and identifying instructional design principles to deve..."
