 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research addresses how to best prepare students for the grand, complex challenges of 21st century engineering projects. The hypothesis of the project is that such grand challenges require \"broad thinking\". This research project attempts to understand when and how broad thinking develops in engineering students in order to create better learning experiences. To gain such insights the PI?s will examine data collected in the Academic Pathways Study, a multi-institution dataset on the paths students take when navigating an engineering degree program. More specifically, the project focuses on three separate questions: 1) What degree of broad thinking do students demonstrate during the course of four years of undergraduate engineering education? 2) What is the relationship between broad thinking and intention to pursue engineering beyond the undergraduate years? 3) How do educational experiences help engineering students develop broad thinking? \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is to learn how to better design college learning experiences for engineers so they are broad thinkers. Since many of the grand challenges and opportunities for engineering in the 21st century are broad in scope, complexity, and impact, engineers with a narrow focus may not be successful at addressing these challenges. The study may also learn if those who think broadly earn engineering degrees at the same rate as more narrow thinkers, and if not why this is.",

These efforts focused on extending the analyses of data collected as part of the previously NSF-funded Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (CAEE); and in particular the Academic Pathways Study (APS) within CAEE. This work has led to stronger cross-institutional collaborations among PIs, senior researchers, graduate students, and international visiting scholars as well as research products that include both conference presentations as well as journal articles.\n\nThe specific objectives as articulated by the project's three research questions have been addressed by the major activities as demonstrated by the associated research products:\n \n RQ1:  What degree of broad thinking do students demonstrate during the course of four years of undergraduate engineering education?\n\n This question was further operationalized through an exploration of the impact of broad thinking on approaches and conceptions to design. Also explored was how conceptions of design-related tasks (such as the design of a retaining wall system to contain flooding) are influenced by knowledge of real-world events (such as Hurricane Katrina).\n\nAlignment of findings regarding four year trends and gender differences in conceptions of design was reiterated in both the longitudinal and cross-sectional APS data sets.  Over time, evidence of acquisition of engineering-specific language was seen and cross-sectional gender differences suggest that increased demographic diversity in engineering would contribute to greater diversity in design approaches.\n\nAn important implication emerging from the work on framing or associating design problem-solving with\n certain kinds of real-world events is the potential of this approach improve engineering students\u00c6 capacity for broad thinking and concern for others&mdash;the kinds of competencies needed for addressing issues of sustainability, ethics, and social justice.\n\nRQ2:  What is the relationship between broad thinking and intention to pursue engineering beyond the undergraduate years?\n\nVisiting Scholar Sanne Haase from Aarhus University in Denmark spent time at Stanford University in 2011 which resulted in a unique opportunity to conduct a cross-national comparison of data collected using the APS Academic Pathways of People Learning Engineering Survey (APPLES) instrument. The quadrant analysis framework of confidence in psychological motivation and professional skills from the APPLES data was further refined and expanded upon for the Danish context.\n\nThis cross-national comparison of APPLES data from Denmark and the United States informed the refinement of the quadrant analysis framework for the Danish students by looking at the importance of math/science skills, and interpersonal and professional skills for successful engineering.  Four distinct engineering student profiles were developed with different characteristics in terms of motivation and confidence that would logically lead to different educational approaches to foster broad thinking engineers.\n\nRQ3:  How do educational experiences help engineering students develop broad thinking?\n\nGaining a deeper understanding of how involvement in engineering and non-engineering extracurricular activities can affect the development of professional and interpersonal skills, motivation, and creativity led to a mixed methods analysis approach involving both survey and structured interview data from the Academic Pathways Study.\n\nThe findings from the quantitative analyses show positive relationships between entrepreneurial attributes and involvement in engineering and non-engineering extracurricular activities. Preliminary interview analyses illustrate how these activities foster entrepreneurial attributes and contribute to students\u00c6 engineering education experiences, in general.\n\nKey outcomes from this work have included the research findings (as described aboe),..."
