 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the collaborative RAPID research project of Profs. Amy McKenna, Alan Marshall and Ryan Rodgers of the National Magnet laboratory at Florida state University. The collaborative team will employ start of the art mass spectrometry instruments in the national magnet laboratory to determine the exact molecular signature of oil from the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. They will monitor the evolution of this molecular signature over time as the oil degrades to determine what degradation by-products are formed. Samples for this study will be provided by Prof. Christopher Reddy of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who received an NSF RAPID award (OCE-1043976) to develop estimates of hydrocarbon dissolution fluxes arising from the sea floor oil seep and upwelling oil plume emitting from the Deepwater Horizon wellhead. \r\n\r\nThe study is crucial to elucidate the impact of the Deep Horizon oil spill on the ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico. Better understanding of the molecular signature of the oil and its decomposition products over time is imperative to development of clean up strategies to restore the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf coastline to their condition prior to the Deep Horizon oil spill disaster.",
