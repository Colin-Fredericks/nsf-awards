 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diurnal cycling of the tropical mixed layer is central in the dynamics governing air-sea exchanges of heat and moisture which, in turn, are central to a variety of equatorial phenomena including Tropical Instability Waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, El Nino/Southern Oscillation, tropical storm cyclogenesis, and the overarching cycle of monsoon seasons. The enhanced stratification below the seasonal mixed layer is also important, as it regulates vertical fluxes into the surface layer from the cooler, nutrient rich upwelling waters below.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the processes that control turbulent mixing of momentum and tracers in this transition layer is an outstanding problem in upper-ocean physics. Based on both modeling results and prior observations, this project's investigators will pursue the hypothesis that turbulent structures in an active mixed layer, combined with shear across the upper pycnocline, generate energetic Near-N Internal Waves (NNIW). These NNIW are confined to the region of elevated buoyancy frequency in the uppermost pycnocline. When they break, they contribute to turbulent dissipation and mixing across the transition zone. In the tropics, the most likely candidate for this kind of NNIW generation is nighttime buoyancy-driven convection combined with the Equatorial Undercurrent shear. The tropical generation of NNIW will compared with previous temperate-latitude observations of the analogous generation by Langmuir circulation and inertial currents, using new observations taken with a combination of a High-resolution Phased Array Doppler sonar, the fast-profiling CTD, and the High-resolution Acoustic Doppler systems aboard the R/V Revelle.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. The project focuses on a link in the air/ocean system that is vitally important yet incompletely understood: net mixing through the uppermost layers of the sea. The mixed layer and uppermost pycnocline together form a crucial barrier between the atmosphere and deep ocean, controlling the net fluxes of heat, momentum, nutrients, and greenhouse gases. This uppermost layer is also vital to marine life, setting the scene where light and nutrients meet, and where pollutants and contaminants are dispersed. Appropriate scaling of these fluxes has been shown to be important to global air-sea coupled simulations, which can be sensitive to both the degree of surface mixing and to the mixed layer depth. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts. The results will help improve air-sea exchange estimates, and hence both environmental and climate effects, thereby helping improve the information by which long-term policy decisions are made. The results and interpretations will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific understanding and facilitate both decision making and further scientific work.\r\nThe proposed activity will provide training and scientific opportunities for a graduate student, and data to support ongoing scientific studies involving students, post-docs, and summer interns. Partnerships and collaborations across institutions will be actively developed.",

Among the instruments fielded by our group were the &ldquo;Fast-CTD&rdquo; (FCTD), a novel &ldquo;Phased-Array Doppler Sonar&rdquo; (PADS), and the ship-board &ldquo;Hydrographic Doppler Sonar System&rdquo; (HDSS) comprised of a 140 kHz and 50 kHz 4-beam sonars in the standard &ldquo;Janus&rdquo; configuration. In addition, the Melville group (SIO) fielded a variety of sensors largely in the air, including a complete MET-suite, and cameras and probes carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The core questions addressed are: Do high-frequency internal waves interact with mixed layer motions? (Yes.) Do they affect entrainment and mixing in the upper pycnocline? (Yes.)</p>\n<p>Are they related to air-sea fluxes? (Yes.) And finally, are they related to undercurrent variations? (Not directly or in any obvious way.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using the FastCTD, HDSS and HiPADS, we were able to observe high frequency internal waves at the equator with frequencies of 2-3 cycles per hour, wavelengths of 600-700 m, and westward phase velocities. Since our observation platform (R/V Roger Revelle) was moving at 1 m/s east, the waves as observed have frequencies of 7-10 cycles per hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first 3 figures show color plots of density, velocity, and power spectral density associated with high frequency internal waves. We were able to observe these signals at all depths from 10 &ndash; 200m. The amplitude of this signal is consistently similar from 60 &ndash; 200m and is strongest near the surface at 20 &ndash; 60 m.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spectral analysis shows the high frequency internal waves have more than 10 times the power compared to the signatures at low frequency. Our analysis of shear and stratification also suggest that the high frequency waves are generated at depths near the surface where the background zonal velocity is westward; and they extract energy from the marginally stable region of high shear and stratification at depths of 40 &ndash; 80 m.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our analysis suggests that these are important to the overall momentum budget, helping to balance input from windstress (wind generally from the East) and the deeper friction acting against the Equatorial Undercurrent (flowing toward the East).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, images from the PADS show that plankton and other swimming fauna are able to maintain position relative to the ship, since the water at about 100 m depth is flowing East at the same speed as the ship (see Figure 4). The fauna swim down behind the ship, getting into the faster flow, and when they get ahead of the ship they swim up again, into the slower moving water, and drift back toward the rear. If this cycle is displaced slightly forward, the sonars show a downward bias in vertical velocity; conversely, if displaced slightly aft they introduce an upward bias. These biases can be of order 10 cm/s, so they are not negligible!
