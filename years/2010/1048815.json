This meeting serves to sustain and build networks of researchers and practitioners in engineering education.  In addition, the meeting serves as a venue to evaluate the effectiveness of EEC programs and allow NSF staff to work with PIs in strategizing how to improve programs to meet long-term goals.  The research team will undertake both to manage the meeting, build networks of researchers and practitioners, as well as work with NSF to develop evaluation tools.  \r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to sustain engineering education programs funded by NSF, involve a broad range of participants who are interested in engineering education research, and improve the outcomes of projects supported by NSF funding.",

Participants reported high levels for outcomes related to networking, research collaborations, and new teaching practices. More than half of the survey respondents reported meeting people they will likely stay in touch with, and 40% reported encountering new teaching practices they plan to implement. Notably, respondents also reported meaningful outcomes that resulted from prior conferences, including networking, employing new approaches to research dissemination, implementing and sharing new tea..."
