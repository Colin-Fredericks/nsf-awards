The central hypothesis is that for a given distribution of impounded sediments, small dam deconstruction can be sequenced such that impounded sediments released downstream increase the available habitat created by the channel morphology and thereby improve the downstream ecosystem.  A series of laboratory flume experiments will measure sediment transport rates and changes to the downstream channel bed under various combinations of sediment mixtures and small dam deconstruction phasing sequences for each of several scaled dam sizes.  Geomorphic variability in the downstream channel will be measured after each phase of dam deconstruction, and data analysis will result in a series of qualitative and quantitative descriptions of small dam removals under a range of conditions.",
