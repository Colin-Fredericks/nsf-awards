 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to integrate the three sequential stages that typically are required to get complex mechanical assemblies to function and assemble properly.  The first of the three stages is the setting of limits on the geometric variations by design engineers.  The second is conversion of these limits by manufacturing engineers to process plans, the step-by-step procedures used in a factory to accomplish the manufacture of a part or an assembly.  The third is the conversion of measured points on the surface of a part during quality control inspection to a form that may be used for direct comparison with the limits set by the designer.  The method is to extend the concepts of a newly developed mathematical model for design both to complex geometries and to the domains of manufacturing and inspection of mechanical parts.  The new model represents the design limits as boundaries in multidimensional geometric space.  The boundaries separate smaller variations, which are acceptable, from larger ones that are not.  The new math model is unique because no other model represents all classes of limits used in the practice of design and manufacturing.  \r\n \r\n     The benefits from this award, if successfully carried out, will be a first mathematical model to integrate manufacturing variations in mechanical parts in a manner that will be consistent with the standards used in practice.  Further, until now, all geometric manufacturing variations have been attributed to manufacturing processes, not to the geometry of the feature and the specified limits to the variations.  The proposed use of the new mathematical model for design will enable a new way of thinking by separating variations that are purely geometric from those that come from characteristics of manufacturing processes and machines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The three major tasks for the project were (1) to model profile tolerances and to apply math models both (2) to precision machining of complex parts and (3) to CMM metrology.  In addition, a 4th  task was to educate more students in the subject of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing.\n\n \n\n1st : The modeling of profile tolerances was achieved for line-profiles, and testbed software was created and used to validate the model.  The model can be used to represent any line-profile from standard specifications.  Each profile is decomposed into line-, circular arc-, and freeform-segments.  The T-Map primitives for all of these are transformed to their representations in the same global reference frame.  The T-Map for the complete profile, which represents the designer\u00c6s intent for allowable geometric manufacturing variations, is obtained as the intersection of these, i.e. those points common to all the primitives. This model for profiles is compatible with the T-Maps we have created for all the other features and tolerance classes.  T-Maps for patterns of line-profiles were also produced, and an algorithm was developed for identifying, from measured points, the minimum-zone for a manufactured line-profile, such as the outline of a cut-away opening to accommodate an adjoining part.\n\n \n\n2nd : The outcome for this task has been to develop an interactive process for converting a process plan for making a part into a machine-readable data structure that represents manufacturing errors for the candidate process plan.  A process plan is a set of instructions, generated from computer representations of detailed design drawings, for the manufacture of a part.  Such plans are detailed about machines, tools, fixtures, and operating parameters, but, at this time, tolerances, which control the amount of geometric variation that is permitted, show up informally, if at all.  Yet, design documents represent this information in a standard way and in great detail to ensure that produced parts will assemble and function properly. \n\nThe inputs to the process are the characteristics of specific manufacturing machines, fixtures, and the part to be manufactured.  The manufacturing errors in the data structure can then be converted into an n-dimensional geometric point space, called an m-Map.  Tolerance-Maps, which already exist and are a computer representation of a designer\u00c6s recommended limits to manufacturing variations, can be used as a reference with the m-Maps.  Simply put, if the manufacturing m-Map for a feature and a process plan fit within the designer\u00c6s T-Map for that feature, then the process plan will produce parts that assemble and function properly.  And, if not, then alternate process plans, which better restrict machine errors, need to be generated and compared to the same T-Map. \n\n \n\n3rd :  A comprehensive set of normative algorithms was developed to identify minimum zones and one-sided fits of points measured on linear, planar, circular, and cylindrical features.  The algorithms were validated with both virtual and manufactured parts.  The algorithms and fits are consistent with a designer\u00c6s tolerance specifications because the two-sided minimum-zones assess form, and the one-sided fits identify datums.  A designer uses a datum as a reference when dimensioning other features on a part, such as holes or slots.  We also found that manufacturers of measurement machines identify minimum zones by capturing computationally all the measured points with inner and outer boundaries, both of which are parallel to a least-squares, i.e. average, fit.  We note that the results from this computation method are always on the safe side from the point of view of meeting assembly requirements.  However, our constrained fits could avoid rejecting some parts and/or lead to cheaper manufacturing methods since a true, and acceptable, minimum-zone is always the same or smaller than the one obtained from the average (least-squares) fit. \n\nMeasurem..."
