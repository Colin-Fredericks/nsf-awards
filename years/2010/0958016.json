 "awd_abstract_narration": "The protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus causes \"Dermo\" disease in the eastern oyster, and is responsible for the catastrophic decline of natural and farmed oyster populations. This has resulted in severe damage to the estuarine ecosystem along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. Because iron is essential for growth, intracellular parasites such as P. marinus must acquire iron from their hosts for successful proliferation. Until recently, however, the mechanisms involved in iron uptake by intracellular parasites have remained obscure. The iron requirement for P. marinus proliferation has been demonstrated and the iron transporter Nramp (Nramp; Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein)cloned from both the parasite (PmNramp) and its oyster host (CvNramp). This has led to the hypothesis that PmNramp represents a mechanism for iron uptake that enables the parasite's successful invasion and proliferation within the oyster host.  This project will use molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches to characterize Nramp in P. marinus to gain insight into its role in virulence, and the impact of competition for iron on the outcome of the parasite/host interaction. it is anticipated that this project will lead to new insights into their role(s) in the virulence of parasites of medical and veterinary relevance. Given the regional relevance of oyster disease, this project is significant in that it will contribute to development of novel intervention strategies to restore natural and farmed oyster populations.  From the educational standpoint, the oyster-P. marinus system is well suited for classroom integration of fundamental scientific principles related to host-parasite biology, and this project will involve the participation of undergraduates and high school students and teachers mostly from underrepresented minorities from the Baltimore area, both as interns at the bench and in the classroom, through training programs such as ExPERT (NSF), Chesapeake Teacher Research Fellowship (NOAA), Living Classrooms, Ingenuity, Baltimore Community College, and mentorship programs from Howard, Prince George, and Baltimore Counties.",

Among these, the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus causes \"Dermo\" disease in the eastern oyster and is responsible for catastrophic losses in both native and farmed oyster populations, with a significant impact on the integrity of the estuarine environment.  Parasites like P. marinus, have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms to recognize, infect, and proliferate in their hosts. For example, intracellular parasites rely on strategies to block or evade killing by host macrophages, while acquiring nutrients to satisfy the basic needs and proliferate.

In our studies supported by the NSF we discovered that P. marinus expresses multiple, polymorphic Nramp genes (PmNramp1-3), and characterized their structural, functional and evolutionary aspects as an iron uptake mechanism. Most importantly, through yeast complementation approaches we demonstrated for the first time for a protozoan parasite that Nramp imports environmental Fe. Further, our studies on the mechanistic aspects of iron transport activity of PmNramps by  construction of chimeric PmNramp species and site-targeted mutagenesis, validated the structural basis for transport function that was predicted by our homology modeling initiative. Given the key phylogenetic position of P. marinus within the Alveolata, our studies contributed novel insight into the mechanisms of metal acquisition in protozoan parasites in general, and apicomplexans in particular. Furthermore, in the oyster hemocyte we identified, cloned and characterized Nramp species (CvNramp1 and CvNramp2) that based on the predicted topologies, would represent bona fide Nramp homologues. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that in the oyster hemocyte phagosome environment, the phagocytosed parasite and the host phagocytic cell compete for available iron with homologous iron uptake mechanisms mediated by the parasite and host Nramp membrane transporters. Thus, our studies were aimed at elucidating the roles of parasite PmNramps in enhancing P. marinus virulence through a \"tug-of-war\" for iron with the oyster host. The functional analysis of the competing PmNramps and CvNramps in their efficiency for iron uptake should contribute to identify the oyster CvNramp variants that are able to outcompete the parasite PmNramp and enable the oyster to fight and defeat the parasite. Although a considerable body of knowledge has been developed on intracellular parasites affecting mollusks towards controlling parasitic diseases, a defined..."
