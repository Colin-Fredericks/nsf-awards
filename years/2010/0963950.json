 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Edward K. Snajdr and Dr. Shonna Trinch (both of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York) will undertake research on the dynamic and mutually transforming relations between local communities and urban development projects. The research will be carried out on Atlantic Yards, New York City's largest urban redevelopment project in the past 50 years. Atlantic Yards, which will consist of a new professional basketball arena and a collection of high-rise towers set to be built in a residential area of Brooklyn, offers a unique opportunity to study the contested city, a space where different people compete to define, create, and contribute to urban life.  \r\n\r\nThe researchers will employ a combination of data collection methods, including ethnography and particiant observation; interviews with representatives of all stakeholders; repeated surveys of a random probability cluster sample of households; and discursive and textual analyses of archival and web-based information. These data will allow them to track changes in representations by supporters and opponents; correlate changes in perceptions with other variables; and build a model of how different processes of place-making unfold, interact, and change over time.  \r\n\r\nFindings from this research will help to understand new patterns in contemporary urban development, including the effects of new technologies of communication, contributing to social scientific theories of urban life. The results of this research will also be of use to policy makers, politicians, developers and community groups to address a range of ethical, material, economic, cultural, and social issues surrounding the process of urban redevelopment.",

The intellectual merit of our ethnographic research is to gain an understanding of how cities get built and how people attempt to have a &ldquo;say&rdquo; in what the built environment will look like, how the state and city should invest in development, and how \"space\" will ultimately be made into culturally contextualized \"place.\" In addition to studying whether and how people have a &ldquo;say&rdquo;, we also collected data on how what people say gets taken up by government, by businesses, by developers, and by national, regional and local community groups and neighborhoods as well as by individuals living in the city. These research goals focused specifically on the case of Atlantic Yards, a 22-acre redevelopment project consisting of a professional basketball arena and several residential and office buildings at the border of two neighborhoods in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p>The data collected consisted of the following: 1) Ethnographic Interviews. We interviewed activists, community organizers and leaders, clergy, government officials, small business owners and residents and former residents of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights (and surrounding communities), including individuals who lived in the footprint of the Atlantic Yards construction area, individuals representing the organizations who supported the Atlantic Yards project plan and who participated in the selection and training of Brooklyn residents who sought employment at the arena. We also interviewed individuals in the Hispanic and African-American communities in the neighborhoods of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights; 2) Archival<br />Research. Archival research has included hundreds of pages from websites and Internet blogs related to Atlantic Yards. We gathered a print media archive of local and national reporting on the project ranging from June 2003 thru December 2012, and a legal archive of lawsuits and decisions based on the project. Other archival materials include photos of the transforming<br />neighborhood space and the project footprint, signage and print matter created by groups and individuals opposed to or who support Atlantic Yards. Additionally we have gathered census data from the neighborhood surrounding the site, including the 2010 and 2000 census (available on American FactFinder), and data from 1990, 1980 and 1970 (available on CDrom databases at New York Public Library). 3) Mapping. We mapped the site including socio-economic data, signage, demonstrations, traffic flow, pedestrian use and other ethnographic events and details related to the site. 4) Participant Observation. We have conducted participant observation at community meetings, public hearings, activist planning meetings, demonstrations, jobs training programs and other neighborhood activities. 5) Survey.
