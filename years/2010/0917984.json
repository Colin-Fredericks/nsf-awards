 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (A:C)  partnership between Kansas State University, an NSF PFI graduate (0438691), and Pittsburg State University (PSU), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee)--seeks to simultaneously develop and formalize a process to accelerate the commercial development of bioscience products, processes and technologies and provide meaningful Early-Stage Technology Development (ESTD) experience to Kansas's future technology engineers and entrepreneurs.  This project will accelerate the movement of bioscience discoveries to commercialization for a leading agricultural biotechnology state and region, Kansas. In particular, there is merit in designing ways to produce more value from current bio-based waste streams, including those from ethanol production processing streams.  This project represents a new approach to linking world class agriculture and bioscience investments in the state to new innovation methods, particularly scale-up methods for bio-processing.\r\n\r\nThe project will enhance general economic well being in Kansas.  It will increase the transfer of technologies to Kansas companies; stimulate the formation and assist the development of technology-based businesses in Kansas; increase new products brought to market; and provide access to a coordinated Early-Stage Technology Development (ESTD) resource that significantly accelerates the development and hardening of new bioscience-based products, processes, and technologies in Kansas. The major societal impact will be the creation of wealth and high-paying jobs for the citizens of Kansas.  In addition, creating a model process that benefits both the technology creator/inventor and the recipient will stimulate transformation of intellectual property created in both company and university laboratories into commercial products.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in education about commercialization activities and thus, Kansas's future technology entrepreneurs will learn to define and conduct successful bioscience ESTD projects.  \r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions:  Kansas State University (lead institutions), Pittsburgh State University (PSU), and Kansas State Olathe-Innovation Campus; Private Sector Organizations: Kansas Environmental Management Associates (KEMA) LLC.; Lifeline Foods (St. Joseph, MO); MGP Ingredients, Inc. (Atchison, KS); and State and Local Government: Kansas Bioscience Authority (KBA) and Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation (KTEC).",
