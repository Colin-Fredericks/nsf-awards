This summer school, part of an annual program organized and sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC), focuses on recent developments in the understanding of conservation laws.  The program begins with a tutorial on the subject, followed by lectures to introduce the participants to current research.  The program is designed to balance the mathematical, computational, and modeling aspects of conservation laws, and it aims to expose participants, especially graduate students, to current areas of active research in the field.\r\n\r\nConservation Laws (or balance laws) are systems of partial differential equations that arise naturally as models for a variety of physical phenomena, including fluid dynamics, magneto-hydrodynamics, combustion, oil recovery, and nonlinear elasticity.  The focus of this summer program is on recent developments in the understanding of such equations.  Beginning with a rapid tutorial phase, the program will expose participants to current areas of active research and help prepare them to pursue open problems in the field.  The program will touch on both theoretical and computational aspects of conservation laws, and application areas (old and new) in which conservation laws play a central role will be highlighted.  Participation of members of groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and supported.\r\n\r\nSummer school web site: http://math.uwyo.edu/rmmc/2010/",
