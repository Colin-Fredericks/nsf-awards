 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the most basic atomic fragmentation processes will be studied.  By monitoring the motion of all fragments produced in the reaction complete information about the atomic system will be obtained.  These studies directly address one of the most fundamentally important, and yet unsolved problems in Physics, the so-called few-body problem.  Its essence is that any system with more than two mutually interacting particles cannot be described analytically by theory even when the initial conditions and the forces acting within the system are precisely known.  Therefore, detailed experimental data on the most basic systems are crucially important to guide theoretical efforts in finding numeric solutions.  This work addresses systems of 3 to 5 active particles and stringently tests theoretical models which numerically treat few-body interactions.  Understanding such simple systems is a prerequisite for describing more complex systems on a fundamental level.  \r\n\r\nAdvancing our understanding of the few-body problem, and then making the transition from few to many particles, has far-reaching ramifications in almost all areas of modern research.  For example, modeling chemical or biological processes requires simulating interactions involving many particles.  Understanding such reactions has major impacts on developing new chemical compounds and on future medical applications like e.g. new cancer therapy methods.  Interactions with or within e.g. clusters, plasmas, solids, and Bose-Einstein condensates also involve a large number of particles.  For such complex systems theoretical models developed for basic 3 to 5 particle systems can serve as a base to provide a more detailed description.  As a last example, theoretical few-body models developed for atomic systems can be applied to elementary particle reactions and thereby help to advance our understanding of the underlying nuclear forces in such systems, which at present is still rather incomplete.",

For proton and heavy-ion impact we demonstrated that the evolution of the collision sensitively depends on the coherence of the projectile beam, an important point which has been overlooked in theoretcial studies of the past.  This outcome led to the resolution of one of the biggest puzzles in atomic collision physics of the last decade.  We also found an unexpected breaking of symmetry in the fragmentation pattern of collisions between heavy ions and polarized target atoms.  Symmetries play an important role in physics.  Our experimental observation has triggered significant theoretical activities and the breaking of the symmetry can now be reproduced by theory.\n\nOur positron and electron impact studies show that there are important differences in the probabilities that an interaction will occur and how the target atom or molecule will respond if the sign of the incoming particle changes, i.e. if the direction of the electric field between the incoming particle and a target electron is reversed.  This provides more information about how matter interacts with matter on the atomic scale and it shows how antimatter-matter interactions are similar, or different.\n\nThe results of our studies have significant broader impacts well beyond our research area.
