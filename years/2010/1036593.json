 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CREST Center for Energy and Environmental Sustainability (CEES) at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) brings together faculty and researchers from 2 colleges and 6 academic departments to focus on three broad areas of energy research: 1) Biofuels, 2) Wind Energy, and 3) Energy and the Environment. The research in biofuels and wind energy will address the need to curtail green house gases (GHG) by advancing bio-renewable and wind substitutes for depleting fossil based hydrocarbons. Basic research will address technological problems associated with the optimal conversion of biomass into biofuels and wind into wind energy. The Energy and Environment subproject will focus on improvements in the nuclear and fossil fuel utilization to support environmentally responsible energy production and consumption from these energy sources. The research outcomes from CEES are expected to fill some important technological gaps in the biofuel production yields, wind turbine designs and advanced nuclear reactors. \r\n\r\nThe first overarching goal of the Center is to build a nationally recognized energy research program at PVAMU in energy engineering. This will be accomplished by leveraging currently-funded research, education and outreach activities across the campus; improving research infrastructure at PVAMU; building external research collaborations; and enhancing energy engineering research in areas of strength at PVAMU. The second overarching goal of CEES is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who successfully complete BS, MS and PhD degrees in STEM fields. CEES will strive to encourage students to pursue careers in industry, academia or national labs, particularly in the cutting-edge engineering fields of renewable energy, environmental and nuclear engineering.  CEES will build a multi-disciplinary education and research community centered on energy engineering to provide new curricula, research experiences, multi-level mentoring and a host of professional development experiences for undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed Center will involve collaborations with several universities, industrial partners, and national laboratories to conduct research on transitional and transformative global energy systems research.  The research subprojects will focus on optimization of biofuels production yields, development of optimization tools applied to wind turbine research, cogeneration involving nuclear and wind power systems, life cycle assessment of conventional, nuclear and renewable energy systems; and fuel cycle analysis for next generation nuclear reactors. CEES will help to establish a multi-disciplinary education and research community of students and faculty, with national partnerships, in the area of energy engineering.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nPVAMU is a Historically Black University (HBCU) with a strong record of preparing underrepresented minority students, particularly African Americans, for STEM careers, including advanced degree education.  The proposed CREST will strengthen that capability by establishing an Energy Engineering Learning Community, and undergraduate minor in Energy Engineering, and a Master?s degree focused on the subject area.  New curricular materials will result from the project.  The project will develop a wide variety of educational and outreach experiences, with emphasis on partnerships with other research universities, industries, and national laboratories, to provide opportunities for students at PVAMU and for developing the pipeline of students from K-12 and community colleges.  The Center will establish beneficial collaborations with two other, related CREST projects (at California State University-Los Angeles and at Texas A&M University at Kingsville).",

CEES had three research thrust areas: Biofuels, Wind Energy, and Energy and Environment. Over the course of the grant, the Center has achieved its goals of (1) conducting and publishing research focused on transitional and transformative technologies for global energy solutions, (2) developing new national and international partnerships and collaborative research teams working in the research areas of biofuels, wind energy, and energy and environmental sustainability and (3) developing an Energy Engineering minor for undergraduates and an Energy Focus for graduate students. CEES activities have expanded the research capabilities of PVAMU by providing new infrastructure (laboratory and office space) and equipment (liquid, gas, ion chromatography, UV/Vis spectrophotometer, computing cluster and workstations, major air quality research measuring equipment) and by improving the quantity and quality of externally funded research grants.&nbsp; CEES engaged PVAMU students in cutting-edge research to meet scientific and technological challenges critical to enabling environmentally responsible and sustainable energy. Intellectual Merit: The Center continues to strive to make PVAMU a national resource in the area of renewable energy and environmental sustainability issues. The Biofuels research focused on thermochemical production of biofuels through biomass pyrolysis into bio-oil and biochemical hydrolysis of biomass into fermentable sugars for fermentation to bio-ethanol. As part of the research, a new ionic liquid-catalyzed process was developed for cellulose conversion into biofuels. The research subgroup created some novel metal ion-modified acidic ionic liquids as catalysts for highly efficient hydrolysis of cellulose and later biofuel production with the aid of other catalysts. The research group also synthesized some biodegradable polymers from renewable biomass, for example, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural based polymers and poly (2,5-furandicarboxylic acid-co-glycerol). The Wind Energy research focused on (i) understanding of the complex flow field around wind turbine blades to improve blade design for in-land wind farms, (ii) building a Finite Element Method (FEM) dataset for structural analysis of the turbine blades, and (iii) applying surrogate models to perform multi-objective optimization of the rotor blades. The results obtained to date allowed us to significantly improve the efficiency of wind turbine blades through improved design. Our design of certain pointed-tip blades yields better aerodynamic forces, which would result in higher power in the dynamic stall region (10-15 m/s wind speed) than the original NREL(National Renewable Energy Laboratory) blade. The material reduction of the wind blade shape also helps in structural stability, which hopes to be proved by structural analysis in future work. The Energy and Environment thrust area (1) Conducted Monte Carlo Simulations of Nuclear Fuel Burnup; (ii) conducted photochemical modeling of emissions control and statistically analyzed the long-term ozone and other air pollutants in both regions of the Greater Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth; (iii) performed life cycle analyses of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from conventional (fossil fuels), nuclear, and renewable energy (biofuels, wind) technologies, bioethanol/biodiesel powered cars, heavy-duty trucks, buses, and electric vehicles in the USA, especially in the Greater Houston area; (iv) carried out shale oil produced water treatment obtained from a&nbsp;Permian Basin shale oil play&nbsp;with a zwitterion-modified cellulose acetate forward osmosis membrane.&nbsp;During the research period, CEES has built broad collaboration with various university and national labs. With the infrastructure support provided by CEES, some faculties at CEES have successfully obtained some other research fundings from NSF, NASA, DOE, DOT, and USDA. Broader Impacts: (i) The Energy Engineering minor was established at PVAMU. A total of 35 scholarships (19 Women 26 from underrepresented groups) were awarded for students to pursue either energy engineering minor (or course work) or energy research. (ii) A total of 948 undergraduate students were exposed to 48 courses (24 different courses with 24 repeated), and another 545 graduate students enrolled in 45 graduate course offerings (20 different courses with 25 repeated) in the broad energy engineering field. (iii) 9 post-doctoral candidates were supported, and 7 of them moved on to permanent positions. (iv) A total of 202 students (68 graduate (40% women, 47% from underrepresented groups) and 134 undergraduate (40% women and 70% from underrepresented groups ) were supported either directly through the Center grant or other leveraged activities.&nbsp; Products: 1 Book, 162 articles (111 Journal Articles, 6 Book Chapters, and 43 peer-reviewed Conference Proceedings/Extended Abstracts), and about 180 presentations made at regional, national, and international conferences, and more than 2/3 of presentations given by graduate and undergraduate students. (vi) CEES has significantly contributed to and supported the education and outreach activities for undergraduate students at Prairie View A&amp;M University, K-12 students in local elementary and high schools, and underserved communities in the Greater Houston area and Waller county in Texas.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
