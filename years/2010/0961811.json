A combined deep-tow sidescan sonar and dredging/wax-coring cruise is planned to the region. The recent discovery of volcanism in the SEMFR suggests that mantle wedge asthenosphere has been drawn into the rifts  and thus the PIs hope that their volcanic products may  more directly reflect variations in slab fluxes and mantle melting associated with varying P-T conditions and breakdown of hydrous minerals in the underlying slab. The regional bathymetric and geophysical data synthesis will allow the PIs to kinematically model rift evolution.",

As the rifting region widened, mantle advection rates would decrease as would mantle temperature eventually suppressing melting. The SEMFR area is distinct from other forearc rifts where subduction is very slow or absent and narrow plate boundary zones develop.  We think that this contrast is determined by a high hydration rate and weak lithosphere leading to broad rifts at the southern Mariana margin whereas low hydration rates and stronger lithosphere lead to narrow spreading center..."
