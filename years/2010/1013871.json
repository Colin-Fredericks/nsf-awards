Ships will be required to either install scrubbing equipment for removal of sulfur compounds from residual fuels currently burned, or they will need to switch to more costly low sulfur distillate fuels.  A switch to low sulfur fuel would increase current fuel costs by over 88%.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses an enormous market need, offering a \"green\" and cost-effective solution to hydrocarbon pollution prevention in maritime environments.  New regulations are being enacted in the shipping industry requiring Sulfur Oxides (SOx) reduction in ship engine emissions, and subsequently a wash-water treatment system to remove total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) prior to discharge.  The SOx scrubbers remove the SOx and other contaminants from the engine exhaust emissions by scrubbing it with an alkali water-stream.\n\n \n\nThe overall goal of this research was to investigate the efficacy of a biological system\u00c6s ability to degrade hydrocarbon contaminants from scrubber water into harmless end products, thereby providing a more cost effective and environmentally friendly solution than current methods.  The unique challenges of this project are the high concentrations of sodium sulfate present in the wash-water and the low PAH (i.e., ppb) concentrations required in the system effluent.\n\n \n\nThe specific objectives of this SBIR project were:  to selectively culture halophilic and/or halotolerant microorganisms for TPH and PAH reduction; design and construct bench-scale bioreactors using such microorganisms; and conduct flow through efficacy experiments using the bench-scale bioreactors.\n\n \n\nEnSolve utilized cultures from its own hydrocarbon degrading stock cultures, PAH degraders, and halotolerent cultures from other sources for development of this project\u00c6s microbial inoculum.  Many of EnSolve\u00c6s cultures have been utilized for hydrocarbon remediation in the marine bilge water environment (i.e. exposing these cultures to saline environments). \n\n \n\nEnSolve designed and constructed a laboratory scale treatment system for treating simulated scrubber waste water.  Filtered water with sodium sulfate concentrations between 0 and 15% was pumped to each treatment system along with a stock solution of diesel fuel #2, surfactant, and PAHs for 131 days.  Commercial bleach (2 to 5%) was added to the Poison Control system.\n\n \n\nThe analytical results (Table 1) revealed consistently higher rates of diesel removals in the biological reactor systems compared to the Poison Control.  There were significant PAH reductions in all of the reactor systems, including the Poison Control.  Plate counts and GAC extraction indicated that the non-poison control samples had significantly more colony-forming-units (CFUs) and DNA over the Poison Control samples, strengthening the conclusion that biological reduction of petroleum hydrocarbons was present in the biological reactor systems. \n\n \n\nThis Phase I study was highly successful with EnSolve completing all of the project objectives:  we were able to show biological activity in the presence of sodium sulfate concentrations up to 15% and highly efficient removal of petroleum hydrocarbons.  As a result, EnSolve anticipates that a properly engineered biological treatment system can achieve the targeted effluent concentrations.  A commercially successful system would address an estimated $3 billion market.  \n\n \n\nEnSolve believes that the Phase I testing, analysis, and potential commercial impact support a Phase II SBIR Project award by the NSF to complete the commercial development of a full-scale scrubber water treatment system.\n\nTable 1:  Effluent Diesel concentrations and removal rates in Scrubber Water Treatment System \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReactor   #1 (0% Salt) \n\n\n\nReactor   #2 (5% Salt) \n\n\n\nReactor   #3 (5%+Bleach) \n\n\n\nReactor   #4 (10% Salt) \n\n\n\nReactor   #5 (15% Salt) \n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Diesel (ppm)\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n19.5\n\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\nDiesel % Removal\n\n\n\n97.5%\n\n\n\n99.5%\n\n\n\n84.3%\n\n\n\n96.8%\n\n\n\n98.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard L Penny"
