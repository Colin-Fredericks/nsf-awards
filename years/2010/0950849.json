 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal development requires a diverse array of cell movement events to shape the body plan and generate an embryo with three distinct tissue layers.  Significant among these movements is the process of collective migration whereby groups of polarized cells move in a directional manner while maintaining some level of contact with each other.  However, the fundamental question of how this process is coordinated to promote the directional movement of large cell populations remains unanswered.  This research project will address this question by utilizing the zebrafish as a genetic and embryological model system that can be manipulated using a variety of molecular techniques.  In addition, the optical clarity of the zebrafish embryo affords the opportunity to perform microscopic imaging of cell migration in a live vertebrate animal.  This project will determine (at both the cellular and biochemical levels) how specific proteins shown to be important for establishing cell polarity function to regulate collective or group cell migration events.  This project is significant for the following reasons: (1) it will benefit society by providing novel insight into the complex process of collective cell migration, a process that is important for normal animal development and (2) it provides a unique training opportunity for post-doctoral scholars and undergraduate students to learn how to collect and analyze data from an animal model system.",

One of the major questions addressed was how a protein call Vangl2 specifically controls the cell surface activity of the protease Mmp14. Proteases are enzymes that degrade or chew up proteins outside of cells including proteins linked to cell migration. We identified a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby Vangl2 (also a cell surface protein) regulates the endocytosis or internalization of cell surface Mmp14. This means that Vangl2 can control the amount of cell surface Mmp14 protease activity in migrating cells. Through this mechanism, Vangl2 can influence degradation of proteins required for cell migration. Notably, we showed that Vangl2 mutant zebrafish embryos (with no Vangl2 protein) have very little fibronectin surrounding the cells engaged in collective or group migration. Fibronectin is a degradation target of Mmp14 and is a critically important structural protein for cell migration. Thus our results have provided a critical mechanistic link between Vangl2, Mmp14, fibronectin, and collective or group cell migration events. This research has provided excellent research training to Julie Dunlap, a former Vanderbilt undergraduate student who was pursuing a degree in Public Health. Julie worked on this NSF project to gain a research prospective on science that she could combine with her education and research on socioeconomic disparities in healthcare in poorer countries. Julie is a co-author on two published research papers and is now a Masters of Science in Public Health and Certificate of Health Policy graduate student at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN.
