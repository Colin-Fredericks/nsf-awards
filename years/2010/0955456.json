 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award will enable the PI, Patricia Vahle, Assistant Professor of Physics at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, to participate in the commissioning and operation of the NOvA Integration Prototype Near Detector (IPND). This CAREER program describes a plan of research with realistic potential for broader impact which takes good advantage of the PI's experience and expertise and positions the PI to make a significant contribution to NOvA in the areas of calibration and data analysis, areas which are obviously important too for future particle physics experiments. The IPND will be installed on the surface at Fermilab starting in the summer of 2010, providing a test bed for the NOvA detector design and systems integration. After a year of running on the surface, the detector will be disassembled and reinstalled underground, becoming the NOvA near detector. The neutrino data collected with the detector allow for the development of detector calibration techniques, signal versus background separation algorithms, and tests of the simulation of nuclear hadronization and reinteraction processes, all of which are crucial to the success of the experiment. Within the broader impact, the project will be a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc. The IPND program offers ample short term hardware and analysis projects, ideally suited to an undergraduate summer research experience. To ensure a vibrant scientific program into the future, one needs to capture the imagination of students well before they enter college. To that end, Vahle proposes providing local high school and middle school teachers the opportunity to participate in summer research projects on site at Fermilab. In the summers she is in Williamsburg, she would exploit the relationship developed between the W&M neutrino group and the local school teachers by employing a teacher for several weeks over the summer to help develop, then implement, science events.",

It is created in fusion reactions powering the Sun, in the interactions of cosmic rays in our atmosphere, in Supernovae, in reactors and accelerators. It is one of the most abundant particles, making understanding the neutrino crucial to understanding our Universe. According to the ``Quantum Universe,'' a report prepared by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, figuring out ``what neutrinos are really telling us'' is one of the fundamental questions facing High Energy Physicists today. \n\nThe 2015 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations. These oscillations, can only occur if neutrinos have mass. Recent experiments have definitively observed neutrino oscillation and strongly indicate that neutrinos are massive particles, implying physics beyond the Standard Model. While the nature of this new physics is still unclear, some theories predict the existence of unobserved partners of the neutrino with masses as large as 10^16 GeV/c^2.  Full understanding of neutrino mixing may have profound consequences on our explanation of the history, structure, and fate of the Universe.\n\nThe physics of oscillations is described in terms of the differences between the squares of the masses of the neutrinos, three angles that characterize the magnitude of the mixing, and a possible CP violating phase. The current generation of neutrino experiments aim to measure each of these fundamental parameters of nature, determine the absolute mass and the mass hierarchy, and uncover the underlying nature of the neutrino.  The program of study is divided among different experiments and projects conducted within the neutrino program at Fermilab.\n\nSpecifically, the NOvA experiment is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, in the NuMI neutrino beam at Fermilab.  The experiment uses two functionally identical detectors, a near detector (ND) on site at Fermilab, and a far detector (FD) 810 km away in Ash River, Minnesota. Both detectors are sited 14 mrad off axis, so they see a narrow band beam, peaked at 2 GeV, an energy well matched to measure oscillations over the 810 km baseline.\n\nNOvA has 2 main physics goals.  First, we measure muon neutrino disappearance as a function of energy, which is sensitive to the mass splitting, and the mixing angle theta_23.  Second, we measure electron neutrino appearance, which is sensitive to the mixing angles theta_13 and theta_23, and the CP phase, delta.  Additionally, matter effects can enhance or suppress the electron neutrino appearance probability, depending on the mass hierarchy.  With the longest baseline of current oscillation experiments, NOvA is uniquely sensitive to the mass hierarchy.\n\nFirst results from both oscillation modes were announced in August 2015.  First publications followed in early 2016 (Phys.Rev.D93.051104, PRL.116.151806).  Second results, corresponding to double the exposure of the initial analyses were just released at Neutrino2016 by Professor Vahle Interestingly, the muon neutrino disappearance data prefer non-maximal mixing, though not yet with a strong significance.  In the electron neutrino analysis, 33 events were observed, with a predicted background of 8 events.  Using the NOvA muon neutrino disappearance results as constraints, the electron neutrino data begin to exclude regions of parameter space in the inverted hierarchy.  Antineutrino data will be useful in further constraining the possible parameters.  NOvA is planning to run with antineutrinos in Spring 2017.\n\nMINOS/MINOS+, also a part of the Fermilab neutrino program, was the predecessor to the NOvA experiment.  MINOS provided the highest precision measurements on the larger mass splittings, until these results were overtaken by NOvA (and other experiments) in 2016.  Since the start of the NOvA program, MINOS/MINOS+ has ..."
