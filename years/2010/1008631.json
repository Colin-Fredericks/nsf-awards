The PDE solvers apply to problems\r\ninvolving: (i) Various physical observables (elastic and\r\nelectromagnetic fields, linear and nonlinear acoustic fields,\r\nthermal fields, fluid-flow) within and around (ii) Complex\r\nstructures (photonic or electronic devices, singular geometries\r\nwith corners, edges or cracks, anatomic geometries, air, water or\r\nland vehicles built from metals or modern composite materials),\r\nand containing (iii) Fluids or solid materials -- including\r\ncomposite elastic media, dielectrics, perfect and lossy\r\nconductors, compressible and incompressible fluids, as well as\r\nmedia leading to dispersion and frequency-dependent absorption. \r\nThe computational methodology underlying the proposed work is\r\nbased on a class of numerical solvers and surface-representation\r\nand meshing methodologies developed in recent years under the\r\ndirection of the investigator.  These are Fourier-based integral\r\nand differential solvers that can produce solutions with\r\nhigh-order accuracy, unconditional stability, and no numerical\r\ndispersion, for realistic engineering geometries including\r\nfeatures such as full aircraft, complex anatomic configurations\r\nfor medical applications, complex photonic or electronic devices,\r\netc.  In practice, these types of solvers have demonstrated up to\r\none-thousand times faster numerics, for a given accuracy, than\r\nsome of the most competitive solvers otherwise available: the new\r\nmethods can enable solution of previously intractable problems. \r\n\r\n     The project impacts upon a variety of areas of societal\r\ninterest, including medicine (diagnostic and therapeutic\r\nultrasound with application to, e.g., tumor detection, kidney\r\nstone destruction, and targeted drug delivery), electrical\r\nengineering (optics, electronics), military and civilian remote\r\nsensing and communications (radar, sonar, stealth, antennas),\r\ndesign of efficient air, water or land vehicles, etc.  The new\r\nalgorithms, which in a number of challenging case studies have\r\ndemonstrated up to one-thousand times faster numerics than\r\nprevious approaches, enable solution of previously intractable\r\nproblems in areas such as those mentioned above.  The project\r\nalso trains graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral\r\nassociates.  Undergraduate students, for example, carry out\r\nsummer-long research projects in an integrative environment\r\ninvolving graduate students and postdocs as well as the\r\ninvestigator and some of the industrial and lab researchers who\r\npropose specific engineering problems.",
