Organothiol adsorbates on gold will be used to adjust the surface properties of the solid support including polarity, charge, work function, redox properties, and degree of electronic conjugation.  Photocurrent generation will be correlated with molecular and bilayer structural changes.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of charge transfer and the relationship between film structure and photocurrent generation will shed light on important current-limiting processes, and help improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.  The educational initiative includes classes and demonstrations to broaden awareness of alternative energy generation, and outreach activities for a broad audience in Alabama.",

Unlike photosynthetic proteins, which are often fragile and hard to obtain artificially, lipids can be synthesized and obtained in large quantities.

This approach has not only offered us a powerful window to scrutinize many key factors in light-to-electrochemical energy conversion processes, but also provided us ample opportunities to interact with and educate the general public about our energy future.\n\nSignificant Outcomes\n\nThis six-year journey has yielded at least four significant outcomes.\n\n1. Novel Molecular Photovoltaic Systems Based on Electrode-Supported Lipid Bilayers. Our research in the past few years has produced three new photovoltaic models using various electrode-supported lipid bilayers (Figure 1). With these, we're able to advance the utility of lipids in molecular photovoltaics.\n\n2. Analytical Power of Hybrid-Bilayer Based Photoconversion Systems. Here, the assembly is consisted of precisely one monolayer of thiols and lipids each. Their packing order is also fixed, with lipids on top of thiols that are directly grafted on the underlying gold surface. Each monolayer in addition displays a preferential orientation, thanks to the Au-S bonding at the bottom and the lipid/water interface at the top.

Targeting students at all levels of the educational ladder, our educational programs have brought renewable energy research to the attention of hundreds of young minds and cultivated their critical thinking of sustainable future. Here, for example, we\u00c6re able to base off our research results to develop a \u00e6Glow Show\u00c6, demonstrating many key chemistry concepts in energy-related research. This show is billed as the best glow show the State of Alabama has to offer and over the past few years has attracted approximately 400 young students.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe results illustrated above are certainly satisfying. However, in order to completely unravel this complex chemistry and thus be able to fully tap its application potentials, more time and effort are in order. With your support and understanding, ..."
