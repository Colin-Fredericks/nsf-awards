 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient Co-limitation in Young and Mature Northern Hardwood Forests\r\n\r\nTemperate forests have long been thought to be nitrogen (N) limited, but chronic N deposition from air pollution should reduce N limitation over time, and theory suggests that ecosystem productivity should be co-limited by multiple nutrients. Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore nutrient limitation in relation to successional change in managed forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.\r\nThe Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model includes P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and is being applied to simulate succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, the investigators will test the patterns of resource limitation.  The model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.",

In 2011 we began long-term low-level additions of N, P, and N+P in 13 forest stands distributed across three sites in the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire (Figure 1). At Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), which is underlain by granite, we have three young, three mid-aged, and three mature stands. At both Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HB), on granodiorite, and Jeffers Brook (JB) on amphibolite (metamorphosed basalt), we have one mature and one mid-aged forest stand. Each stand has four plots treated annually with N (30 kg N/ha/yr as NH4NO3), P (10 kg P/ha/yr as NaH2PO4), both N and P, and control. These relatively modest rates are designed to alter site fertility while minimizing artifacts associated with high doses of fertilizer. These treatments allow us to test for NP co-limitation and to challenge balanced forest nutrition and thereby induce mechanisms that maintain co-limitation (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Foliar N:P in the untreated mid-age and mature stands indicate that most of our sites are P-limited rather than N- limited (Figure 3). Consistent with P limitation, plots receiving P moved into the co-limited range, and those receiving N were even more P limited after 5 years of treatment, according to their foliar N:P ratios (Figure 3). Tree growth responded more to P addition than to N addition in mid-aged and mature stands (p=0.02; Figure 4). These results are surprising because temperate forests on glaciated soils have been presumed to be N- limited, but they are consistent with predictions of the MEL model, parameterized for our experimental conditions (Figure 5).

The majority of the students were from underrepresented groups, including many first-generation immigrants, reflecting the rich diversity of the city of Syracuse. Many of the students devoted enough time to the project to earn a college credit. The students processed root samples from various soil depths, sorted leaf litter by species, evaluated herbivory by insects and counted maple leaf skeletonizers (found while sorting litter), analyzed soils, identified snails, built sap flow sensors, and learned to do data entry and analysis. Ten of these students have traveled to New Hampshire to conduct research in the field. One student presented her work on soil pH at the Annual Cooperators Meeting at Hubbard Brook. One conducted her senior thesis project on snails that she collected in our sites. Seniors have gone on to many public and private universities and colleges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ruth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Yanai</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031698192_Yanai_Figure2_model--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031698192_Yanai_Figure2_model--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conceptual Model of N vs P Limitation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031698192_Yanai_Figure2_model--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conceptual Model of N vs P Limitation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual model of N vs P limitation in forests, showing factors that cause systems to deviate from co-limitation by N and P and the mechanisms that favor co-limitation by conserving or acquiring the more limiting nutrient.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">unpublished</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ruth&nbsp;D&nbsp;Yanai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Conceptual Model of N vs P Limitation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031826860_Yanai_Figure3_Foliar--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031826860_Yanai_Figure3_Foliar--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Foliar N and P\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0949324/0949324_10017435_1509031826860_Yanai_Figure3_Foliar--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Foliar N and P\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Foliar P and N in 2015 for maple and beech in mid-aged and mature stands.

Slides from those meetings are linked from the project website. Some projects were also presented at REU meetings or at home colleges, one of which won an award.\n\nEighty-two high school students have participated over the last four years in research in the Yanai lab, through a partnership with \"ESF in the High School.\" Twenty-four of the students have received NSF funding from RAHSS. The majority of the students were from underrepresented groups, including many first-generation immigrants, reflecting the rich diversity of the city of Syracuse. Many of the students devoted enough time to the project to earn a college credit. The students processed root samples from various soil depths, sorted leaf litter by species, evaluated herbivory by insects and counted maple leaf skeletonizers (found while sorting litter), analyzed soils, identified snails, built sap flow sensors, and learned to do data entry and analysis. Ten of these students have traveled to New Hampshire to conduct research in the field. One student presented her work on soil pH at the Annual Cooperators Meeting at Hubbard Brook. One conducted her senior thesis project on snails that she collected in our sites. Seniors have gone on to many public and private universities and colleges.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ruth D Yanai"
