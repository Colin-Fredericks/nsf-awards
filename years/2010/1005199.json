 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is for a nine-week summer program at Colorado State University. The Site pertains to the scientific study of mind and brain within the fields of perception, cognition, perceptual neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience. Participants attain specialized training and research experience in one of two topic areas of their choosing: human learning and memory, or human visual perception and cognition. Ten students will be selected from across the country, focusing on undergraduates from minority serving institutions and non-Ph.D. granting institutions. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The centerpiece of the program is an intensive research experience in which each participant develops, runs, and analyzes her or his own experiment under the mentorship of a faculty member who specializes in the study of human learning and memory or visual perception and cognition using behavioral and/or neuroscientific approaches. Participants will also \r\n\r\n(a) attend a weekly, thematic research seminar within the topic area of their choosing, with participating faculty alternating in presenting and leading the discussion of methods, issues, and findings from their own area of inquiry; \r\n\r\n(b) attend an additional weekly seminar that covers topics pertaining to research ethics and professional development;\r\n\r\n(c) participate in workshops on the use of the staffs state-of the-art equipment (driving simulator, EEG equipment, eyetracker, etc.); \r\n\r\n(d) participate in additional workshops on experiment construction and data analysis using E-Prime and SPSS; \r\n\r\n(e) go on a site visit to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center to learn about fMRI and MEG methods; and \r\n\r\n(f) optionally complete a sophomore-level course entitled Mind, Brain, & Behavior, either as a guest or for course credit. \r\n\r\nAs a capstone experience, students will present their work in poster format during a research symposium held at the end of the nine-week session. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: A central goal of the program is to stimulate interest in the science of mind and brain by integrating research and education, and by providing knowledge, skills, and experiences that are rare at the undergraduate level. In doing so, the program enhances participants' prospects for pursuing graduate study and careers in science, especially for those participants who do not have comparable opportunities at their home institution.",

We were particularly interested in providing this opportunity to students from historically underrepresented populations, as well as students from institutions that lack comparable research opportunities and lack access to state-of-the-art research facilities and equipment. During the summers of 2006-2012, we brought a total of 73 students to Colorado State University for a nine-week summer research program, with over 80% of them from primarily undergraduate institutions, over 70% of them women, and over 60% from underrepresented populations. These students, under the mentorship of a faculty member, attained specialized training and research experience in a topic area withn the field of perception, cognition, perceptual neuroscience, or cognitive neuroscience. With the guidance of the faculty mentor, each student developed, administered, and analyzed her or his own experiment. In addition, they (a) attended a weekly research seminar in which participating faculty presented and led discussion of the methods, issues, and findings from their own area of expertise; (b) attended a weekly seminar that covered topics pertaining to research ethics and professional development; (c) participated in workshops on the use of our state-of the-art equipment (driving simulator, EEG equipment, eyetracker, etc.); (d) participated in additional workshops on experiment construction and data analysis using E-Prime and SPSS; (e) went on a site visit to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center to learn about fMRI and MEG methods; and (f) optionally completed a sophomore-level course entitled Mind, Brain, &amp; Behavior.

When asked to rate whether their overall experience was a positive one, the average student rating was 4.9 out of 5 (with 5=strongly agree) and when asked whether they'd recommend the program to other students, the average rating was also 4.9 out of 5. The intellectual impact was quite significant. Students not only gained knowledge in the particular topic area in which they conducted research, but also considerable knowledge and experience pertaining to experimental design, statistical methods, ethics, and the written and oral communication of research findings. In addition, they acquired skills in using various research tools and equipment. Reflecting this, when asked to rate whether the program was helpful in understanding and appreciating research on the mind and brain, the average student rating was 4.9 out of 5, and when asked to rate whether the program was helpful in acquiring research and laboratory skills, the average rating was 4.8. It is also noteworthy that the research conducted by participants has contributed in a meaningful way to our general knowledge about the mind and brain. Student research projects have resulted in several peer-reviewed journal articles and over 50 presentations at regional and national professional conferences, with the student participants as co-authors. The program also fostered the development of the next generation of scientists studying the mind and brain. Students reported that the program was quite useful in helping them decide whether they wished to an advanced degree and career in science, and that the program gave them the confidence and initial set of skills to do so.
