Affinity constants are used to characterize the strength of interactions from biomolecule to biomolecule. The new non-linear optical method responds to changes in electric charge in the solid/water interface when free biomolecules from the solution complex with biomolecules that are bound to the solid side of the interface. The proposed technique may provide a new path in the search for novel drug therapies.",
