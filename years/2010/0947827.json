 "awd_abstract_narration": "The latter half of the twentieth century led to a remarkable scientific achievement:  the establishment of the so-called Standard Model of particle physics. As a theory, it incorporates all known particles and forces of nature, excluding gravity. It has been extremely successful in describing known phenomena, but we are prompted to ask whether there is physics beyond the Standard Model.  Are there new forces of nature, or new states of matter, which are important to the universe?  In this project, the PI intends to explore new theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on interesting phenomenological signals absent in most conventional models. He will study many topics including unexpected signals of the dark sector in terrestrial and cosmological experiments, models which allow wider ranges of flavor violation, connections between neutrino masses and dark matter, and models of dark matter motivated by cosmic ray signals. By exploring what connections could exist between these apparently disparate fields --- dark matter, cosmic rays, neutrino physics, and collider physics --- the PI hopes to gain insights into the possible nature of these diverse unexplored phenomena, and find ways in which terrestrial and cosmological studies can complement one another.\r\n\r\nThis project is also envisioned to have two key broader impacts.  First, the PI will maintain a continued effort to participate in summer schools and will compile a regularly updated set of lecture notes on dark matter.  This will provide an important resource for graduate students or interested faculty in a rapidly evolving field.  Second, the PI will continue his very successful outreach effort with the Governor's School West in Salem, North Carolina. This public summer school draws students from across the state, from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, providing an opportunity to promote physics research and careers to interested and talented students, and counsel them on pursuing such a path. This program has been highly successful over the last several years, and offers year- on-year interactions with new groups of students through an established educational setup.",
