 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Resource Center for System Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA) expands the work of the regional center by providing programs and services to increase the preparedness of the national cyber security workforce.   A survey - conducted with business, industry, government and educational institutions - identifies current and future national workforce needs, and informs curricular and professional development.  The Resource Center serves as a focal point for program improvement of cyber security and information assurance curricula, instructional programs, degrees and certificates as well as for institutions interested in hosting or participating in cyber security skills competitions.  A national cyber security and information assurance academy for faculty is established.  The Center has established partnerships with other ATE cyber security centers and national organizations such as the Cisco Learning Institute, Skills USA, FEMA, and the Competition Industry Advisory Board to provide cyber security challenge competitions for secondary and two year college students.  The partnership between CSSIA and NDG develops a standardized software that will include scheduling, authentication, replication, virtualization, curriculum integration, teaching and learning collaboration, archiving and distributable updates to work on top of VMRware to support both competitions and curricula. The independent evaluation provides information about the activities performed to reach the goals and outcomes and also the impact of the activities on the participants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to demonstrate how community colleges could address the nationwide shortage of skilled cyber security professionals.  In 2014, the Center for Systems Security &amp; Information Assurance (CSSIA), Brookdale College and the SANS Institute embarked on an initiative.  This initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation, was designed to identify and train a small group of highly motivated and computer skilled individuals to complete a fast track cyber security education program. These individuals would be identified and selected based on their participation in the Cyber Aces National Competition.  The Illinois Cohort specifically targeted returning veterans of the Iraq/Afghani conflict. \n\nThe Illinois Cyber Aces Academy was able to identify 12 highly motivated individuals to form the first Cyber Aces Academy.  Ten of the participants were veterans. The identification of veterans in this type of program had several benefits.  The majority of the veteran cohort participants would come to the program with existing or having held previous security clearances.  Many organizations hiring cyber security professionals need individuals that can be granted high level security clearances.  The veteran participants also brought to the program the ability to collaborate and work as a cohort to complete a very rigorous one year education program. \n\nThe Illinois program built upon the Brookdale Cyber Aces Academy. The Illinois Cyber Academy would differ from the Brookdale model in two dimensions.  First, The Illinois Academy would demonstrate how existing NSF sponsored curriculum and resources could be leveraged to decrease cost and participants completion of program curriculum while maintaining program rigor. The second variation from the Brookdale model involved increasing the amount of experiential learning made available to cohort participants. \n\nThe overall success of the program has exceeded initial expectations.  The retention rate exceeded 80% and all participants completed a major portion of the program.  The overall goal was to have each cohort participant complete 6-8 security courses in a fast track delivery system.  Each participant was also required to pass the corresponding industry certification.  At this point, there are still ten active cohort participants who have completed five courses and are on the sixth.  All the participants completed the first four courses and the corresponding industry certifications.  We expect the remaining ten participants to complete 8-10 courses and corresponding certifications.  The credentials that these individuals have earned have made them highly employable.  Over half of the current participants have already found employment in the cyber security field. This project is a demonstration of the effectiveness of business and academic partnerships.  An unexpected outcome of this project has been the willingness of the cohort participants to serve as mentors and give back to the cyber security community.  Several of the cohort members have volunteered as coaches for local Cyber Patriot high school teams.  Others have volunteered as TA's for the US Cyber Challenge camps.  Another supplemental outcome was the ability of our faculty to sit through courses and improve their credentials by earning advanced industry certifications.\n\nThe current cohort is scheduled to complete their training cycle on October 31st.  Several organizations and businesses have sponsored aspects of this program and are eager to employ the successful graduates of the program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/14/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John L Sands"
