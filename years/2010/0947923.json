 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental science graduate students at the University of California Santa Cruz will work with teachers and students at Watsonville High School to develop and implement inquiry-based components of their Environmental Science and Natural Resources Academy curriculum. The objectives of SCWIBLES (Santa Cruz - Watsonville Inquiry-Based Learning in Environmental Sciences) are to (1) train graduate students to effectively represent the process and outcomes of ecological and evolutionary research to a culturally diverse society, and to work with diverse stakeholders to identify critical scientific needs for environmental problem solving, and (2) provide teachers with research experience and inquiry-based tools to help students become well informed natural resource stakeholders who can work with scientists to solve environmental problems in the future. The project includes a summer program for joint Fellow-Teacher research and curriculum development, a summer program to motivate student involvement in environmental sciences, mentoring year-long Senior capstone projects, and community forums to highlight student science activities and STEM-based careers. Fellows will receive specialized graduate training in educational theory and practice focused on effective science communication in a multilingual, multicultural society. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental issues disproportionately affect communities of color, while professionals in environmental sciences are overwhelmingly white. SCWIBLES aims to increase the diversity in the environmental sciences by increasing the academic success and career opportunities for students in a rural public school district with >75% Hispanic students and a history of under-performance. It will enhance pathways to jobs and postsecondary education in regionally important fields of agriculture, environmental management, and green technology. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) National Science Foundation (NSF) GK-12 program SCWIBLES:  Santa Cruz-Watsonville Inquiry-Based Learning in Environmental Sciences, was an exciting graduate training program designed to improve communication skills of environmental scientists and to enrich inquiry-based education in a rural, Latino-serving high school on the central coast of California.  This five-year partnership between UCSC and Watsonville High School in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District, supported graduate student researchers in environmental sciences and public high school teachers to develop more effective communication between scientists and non-scientists and to enrich science education in a rural, Latino-serving high school.\n\nThe GK-12 SCWIBLES program partnered 26 UCSC doctoral students from the Environmental Studies Department and the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department with 18 teachers at Watsonville High School in science, technology, math, social sciences, and English. Together, they worked as co-researchers in the field and in the lab, developed and implemented inquiry-based science curricula, brought exciting learning opportunities to thousands of high school students, and inspired a new generation of environmental problem-solvers.  \n\nGraduate student fellows were able to share their excitement for research with broad audiences of students and teachers, by developing inquiry-based lesson plans based on their expertise, involving teachers directly in their dissertation research, and through regular formal and informal discussions with students about their research discoveries and the trials and joys of life as a researcher.  In turn they learned, from teachers and students, how to speak more clearly about their own work, and about what science does and does not offer to public well-being and informed decision-making.  Fellows also expanded their scholarly expertise to include cutting-edge research literature in science education, as well as a deep understanding of the evolution of science teaching in public schools.  Such training has strongly influenced our Fellows as many move on to teach and mentor students at universities around the country. \n\nSCWIBLES teachers and their students actively and successfully embraced new approaches to inquiry in their learning practices.  An in-school native plant garden provides access to ecological research right outside the classroom, and well-tested SCWIBLES learning modules, from individual lesson plans to multi-week units, continue to be part of the curriculum.  The Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD) has a renewed and strong engagement in the Science and Engineering Fair, using SCWIBLES-developed materials to train teachers and students in how to develop science fair projects.  Teachers have participated in hands-on science opportunities outside of SCWIBLES, and we hear regularly from students who have gone on to science as a career.\n\nSCWIBLES faculty, teachers, and graduate fellows became deeply engaged in the challenging transition to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  SCWIBLES faculty provided professional development teacher workshops.  Fellows, faculty, and teachers published original articles for use by professional teachers to help with specific aspects of implementing the NGSS, such as the key practice of developing and using models and structured and effective approaches to help students ask testable questions. The GK-12 SCWIBLES program leaves a legacy of strong UCSC-PVUSD ties that will continue to foster the co-development of science education opportunities. GK-12 SCWIBLES also developed a rich and diverse collection of NGSS-ready, inquiry-based learning modules, available to teachers everywhere, with a searchable index at scwibles.ucsc.edu  and accompanying videos at our YouTube channel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory S Gilbert"
