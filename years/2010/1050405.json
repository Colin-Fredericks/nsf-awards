 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oleg Prezhdo of the University of Washington is supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for the development of novel simulations approaches  for nonadiabatic and semiclassical molecular dynamics, their implementation within time-domain density functional theory and the investigation of the fundamental questions posed in the recent time-resolved experiments performed on nanoscale materials. This work provides a detailed, atomistic picture of photo excitation dynamics in real-time and in direct connection with experiment.  The research focuses on the quantum properties of condensed phase environments at the nanoscale, such as decoherence, state-specific dynamics, zero-point energy, and non-adiabatic transitions, providing more rigorous treatments of ultrafast phenomena.  These methods are applied to the excitation dynamics in novel nanomaterials, including wet-electrons, carbon nanotubes and nanoribbons, and metallic particles.\r\n\r\nThe PI and his coworkers develop methods to study many important features of  nanoscale systems. These studies  are the first to  provide the highly desirable details and understanding of many experimentally observed phenomena,  generating the theoretical basis for the development of novel devices for solar energy conversion, electronics, and imaging.  The PI also develops novel teaching tools for use both in introductory and advanced chemistry courses.\r\n",
