 "awd_abstract_narration": "We investigate computational methods for moving the activity of a  complex dynamical network from one state to another. Complicated  nonlinear networks appear to be multistable and multirhythmic, a mix  of chaotic and periodic stable attractors, together with other  metastable transients that may be effectively stable for the time  interval of an engineering application. Computational methods will be  developed for steering between basins of attractors, and tested in  three different experimental platforms: primary neuronal cell cultures  from vertebrates and invertebrates, hippocampal slices from rodents,  and defect activity in convection rolls in nematic liquid crystals. Better understanding of these test cases could be a first step to new  approaches to neural engineering, machine learning, and optimization  of energy transfer and production. The experimental examples have in  common a lack of known equations of motion, which severely limits the  use of classical control theory and motivates development of our new techniques.\r\n\r\nThe hallmark of complex systems behavior in engineering devices is the  appearance of dynamical patterns that vary in time and space. In this  exploratory study, we will expose the main problems and bottlenecks  that need to be overcome to enable low-power steering between  different spatiotemporal patterns in engineered networks, and to begin  to develop efficient computational methods to accomplish this  switching quickly and automatically. The project includes theoretical,  computational, and experimental components. Methods will be developed  and tested experimentally in systems that have nonlinear, complex  network characteristics, such as primary neuronal cell cultures,  hippocampal slices from rodents, and nematic liquid crystals.",

From systems like weather and finance that shape our environment, to neuronal and other physiological processes that govern our biological existence, complex systems are exceedingly important to our daily lives.  With complexity comes diverse behaviors that can be beneficial or detrimental.  For example the human brain is capable of conscious thought but also of epileptic seizures.  In order to maximize the utility of these systems while at the same time minimizing their risks, it is necessary to first identify the spectrum of behaviors that can arise in these systems.   This grant provided the funding to develop groundbreaking mathematical algorithms that can identify, from empirical data, the dynamical structure of complex systems.
