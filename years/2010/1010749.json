 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will expand the functions and applications of  FieldScope, a web-based science information portal currently supported by the National Geographic Society (NGS).  The goal is to create a single, powerful infrastructure for Public Participation in Science Research (PPSR) projects that any organization can use to create their own  project and support their own community of participants. FieldScope currently provides various tools and applications for use by its existing user base that includes the GLOBE project and the Chesapeake Bay monitoring system. The application enables users to contribute volunteered geographic data collection efforts and sharing information among both professional and amateur users. The project would develop and test an enhanced version of the existing FieldScope application.  The project supports major programming development for a fully-functional web-based application that would significantly enhance the usability of the current application.  Along with programming new features and capabilities, the project involves extensive evaluation of the new capabilities and involves three citizen-based organizations as testbeds.   \r\n\r\nThe project will increase the capability of the existing system to handle large numbers of users and user groups and also increase the number and variety of tools available to any user; provide customization through the adaption of common APIs; and provide for expansion of computer space through use of virtual servers in a cloud computing environment thereby limiting the need  for installed hardware.  This approach would maximize storage and computing power by being able to call on resources when necessary and scaling back when demand decreases.  \r\n\r\nThe platform would include advanced visualization capabilities as part of a suite of analytic tools available to the user.  Social networking applications would also be incorporated as a way of enabling communication among users of a particular site. The operation of the portal would be supported by the NGS and made available free of charge to any group of users applying for space. Nominal fees will be applied to large organizations requiring large computing space or additional features.  User groups can request NGS supply custom features for the cost of development and deployment. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of this project is extensive and focused on formative evaluation as a means to identify user preferences, from look and feel of the site to types of tools desired and types of uses expected. The formative evaluation would be conducted ahead of any commitment to programming and formatting of the features of the site. \r\n\r\nThe project responds to a need expressed throughout the citizen science community for web-based applications that enable individuals to engage in a topic of interest, interact in various ways on such a site including the submission of data and information, analyze the information in concert with others and with working scientists in the field, and utilize state-of-the-art tools such as visualization as a way of making sense of the data being collected.  There have been numerous proposals to create similar types of sites from various groups, each based on its own perceived needs and grounded in its own particular discipline or topic.  This activity could serve this community more broadly and save similar groups the trouble and expense of creating sites from scratch.",

The initiative was designed to provide a forum where leaders, businesses, organization, and citizens would come together to solve this problem. Per their website, the Initiative \"includes annual Potomac River Watershed Cleanup and Potomac Watershed Trash Summit, as well as a strategic framework with five core components including public education, policy, regulation, enforcement, and market-based approaches.\" The individuals who lead cleanup events upload their data to an AFF website, and these data are then shared with FieldScope, where they are available to other users and the public.
