 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UWP)entitled \"NUE: Undergraduate Science and Engineering Workforce Education in Nanotechnology and Microsystems (USE-NanoMEMS)\", under the direction of Dr. James Hamilton, will build on the UWP existing minor in Nanotechnology and Microsystems to educate students, workers and the public in issues of Nanotechnology and Microsystems and provide a major in nanotechnology. Building on existing undergraduate research programs, the students will be able to focus on basic and applied multidisciplinary R&D in nanotechnology, as applied to solar technolgies,alternative energy and graphene device and coating technologies, as are being developed at UWP.\r\n\r\nAll future UWP engineering (currently more than 2000 students and growing) will be exposed to at least two Nanotechnology modules while taking the required Introduction to Engineering and Engineering Economics courses.  The program will also be available to science and non-engineering students at UWP, especially with respect to the ethical, environmental and societal aspects of nanotechnolgy. USE-NanoMEMS will further extend to many of the 175,000 students withing the 26 campuses that comprise the UW-System through the System-wide Nanotechnology Center for Collaborative R&D that is based at UWP.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goals of the USE-NanoMEMS interdisciplinary initiative were to advance nanotechnology education at several levels.  This included students in science and engineering, but also extended to students not in engineering, and further to the general public.  The grant supported UW-Platteville faculty across several disciplines as they worked to develop curricula that would meet the needs of our science and engineering workforce, as well as the general needs of society as it decides how nanotechnology should be developed and applied.\n\nWhen the grant was awarded, UW-Platteville had only a new, growing Minor in Microsystems and Nanotechnology, but an interest in expanding that to its strong engineering programs.  We now have three paths on our campus for students with an interest in this area:  (1) the Minor, for students in science and engineering &ndash; revamped from its original form; (2) an emphasis area within the successful Engineering Physics major, which enables students to gain knowledge and training in the area of nanomaterials while earning an accredited engineering degree; (3) a new, multidisciplinary science major in Microsystems and Nanomaterials, in which students take courses from physics, chemistry, and biology, and build on these with courses in both nanomaterials and in the \"traditional\" science areas that support their career goals.  Though new, the latter two options are quickly gaining in popularity, and we have begun investigating articulation agreements with regional technical colleges with nanoscience programs.\n\nThis grant directly supported these efforts by supporting the development of (a) a novel, hands-on laboratory course for freshmen interested in any of the three aforementioned degree paths; (b) numerous laboratory and curriculum modules in a dramatically overhauled introductory nanoscience course &ndash; modules that cover nanoscience topics from chemistry, biology, and physics; (c) new upper-division courses in nanomaterials, developed in direct response to fruitful discussions with our industrial advisory board; (d) a revised course on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS); (e) a \"senior capstone\" research course. \n\nBeyond the degree paths, another outcome was extending \"nano\" to a vastly greater number of students.  To this end, the grant supported the following extension to non-majors:  (a) a module incorporated into an existing General Engineering course, thus exposing every engineering student on campus to key ideas of nanotechnology; (b) a module on nano-ethics, incorporated into an existing general education course on science, technology, and ethics; (c) a segment on the disruptive economic impact of nanotechnology, which has been added to the \"Engineering Economy\" course required by several engineering disciplines.\n\nFinally, this work has spread to include outreach to the general public.  Faculty involved with this grant have run a \"nano room\" at the annual Engineering Expo held on campus; additionally, a new \"science as art\" competition has extended the reach and exposure of the work of our students in this area (image attached).\n\nBeyond classroom pedagogy, students have also been able to focus on basic and applied multidisciplinary R&amp;D in nanotechnology as applied to solar technologies, alternative energy and graphene device and coating technologies, as have been under development at UW-Platteville.\n\nWith UW-Platteville\u00c6s historical emphasis on educating the complete person, via general education core courses, and the historical emphasis on encouraging international experiences and hands on training for the students, our university thus has played an important role educating the scientific and engineering workforce of the Midwest. The USE-NanoMEMS initiative has thus fostered well-rounded, technically sound global citizens to contribute to nanotechnology enhanced industries, and to a society in which these technologies will become commonplace.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/201..."
