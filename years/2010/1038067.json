Berthold Community College, FBCC, Turtle Mountain Community College , \r\nTMCC, and Sitting Bull College, SBC, and North Dakota State University, NDSU, is the \r\nculmination of more than 11 years of active engagement in STEM education on the reservation, \r\nincluding a year-long academic sabbatical at TMCC by an engineering professor.  It supports a \r\ntribal college vision of expanded life-choices for reservation residents that could provide more \r\ntechnical competency for tribal decision-making, infrastructure improvement and the \r\nopportunity for personal and tribal advancement without loss of cultural heritage.  For NDSU \r\nthe benefits would include expanded participation of culturally diverse students, shared \r\nfulfillment of the 1862/1994 land grant mission, improved faculty-student communication and \r\ninteraction and expansion of the talent pool entering STEM professions.  The heart of the \r\nproposal is the interaction of tribal high school, tribal college, mainstream University and \r\nengineering profession stakeholders to facilitate the recruitment, education and support of \r\ntribal students to acquire and hone the skills that will allow them to enter the engineering \r\nprofession or contribute in some other fashion to their communities and the nation.  The \r\nproposal will accomplish this vision by impacting students through interactions with faculty/ \r\nstaff, curriculum and supporting functions/agencies.  All of this will be accomplished in a \r\nculturally supportive fashion.",
