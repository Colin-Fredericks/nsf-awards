 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Walter E. Rudzinski and colleagues Michael Blanda, Chad J. Booth, Debra Feakes and Jennifer Irvin from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Texas State University - San Marcos will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The upgraded console will allow pulsed field gradient experiments and much faster data collection and increased student accessibility. The spectrometer will also have an auto-sampler. The instrument will be used to support research activities such: 1) self-assembly of inherently chiral calix[6]arenes into helical nanotubes; 2) development of high performance polymeric materials; 3) investigation of polyhedral borane anions; and, 4) study of electroactive polymers with improved n-doping stability and the effects of dopant ions on electroactivity\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have a positive impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
