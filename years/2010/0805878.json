More specifically, problems to be\r\ninvestigated include: Direct and inverse spectral problems for\r\nSchrodinger operators in various semi-classical settings,\r\nrigorous analyses of semiclassical approximations commonly used\r\nin the physics and quantum chemistry communities (Bohr-Sommerfeld\r\nconditions, approximate propagators and computation of\r\ncorrelation functions), as well as quantum-mechanical analogies\r\nof constructions in symplectic geometry (like symplectic\r\ncutting).  The settings will be both classical (when the phase\r\nspace is Euclidean) and more geometric (e.g. when the phase space\r\nis a compact Kahler manifold or the cotangent bundle of a\r\nconfiguration space).\r\n\r\nThe relationship between mathematics and physics is profoundly\r\nimportant for both the theory and applications of these subjects.\r\nIn one direction, mathematics is the language of physics and its\r\nmethods can have powerful applications; in the other, physical\r\nproblems often give rise to new mathematical problems that can be\r\nextremely fruitful.  The proposed research will study problems at\r\nthe interface between quantum mechanics and geometry.  The\r\nproblems are generally of two kinds: spectral, meaning related to\r\nthe energy of a quantum system, and dynamical, comparing the\r\nevolution of a quantum system with its classical counterpart.\r\nThe spectral problems seek to understand the relationship between\r\nthe possible energy levels of a quantum system and the geometry\r\nof the corresponding classical system.  The dynamic problems\r\nshould result in a better understanding of the underpinnings of\r\nsome popular computational methods in quantum chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The research that was conducted under this award is on the mathematical aspects of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics.  The mathematical theories describing classical and quantum mechanics are very different:  Classical mechanics is based on geometry, while quantum mechanics is based on analysis,  which is advanced calculus.  One is deterministic, the other probabilistic.  Yet there is a very deep connection between these two fields, and the outcomes of this project significantly add to the understanding of that connection.  They also uncover new aspects of the quantum-classical relationship.\n \nOur main results give some answers to the general question:  To what extent the vibrations of an object reflect its geometry?  In our setting vibrations refers to to the quantum energy levels, and we show that in a number of cases the quantum energy levels do determine much of the geometry, or classical mechanics, of the same system.\n \nOther results we have obtained indicate how to extend the classical notion of time to complex-valued notions of time, in classical mechanics.  Complex-valued means that complex numbers (including the square root of (-1)) are now to be considered \"fair game\" in the classical world. The insight on how that happens comes from quantum mechanics.  Interestingly, this is related to deep problems of geometry (over the complex numbers).\nWe have also obtained results on quantum systems that are subject to evolve within certain energy bounds.  We have constructed a sound mathematical theory for particles subject to such energy bounds.  Further, we have obtained strong numerical evidence that shows that, under such bounds, a quantum particle would split as it reaches the boundary of the allowed energy.  The center of the particle(s) follow the contour lines that represent the classical dynamics of the same system.  This is a new phenomenon we can predict, based on our theoretical resulst as well as on our numerical calculations.\nIn this way our results contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics, and also suggest intriguing lines of further research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alejandro Uribe"
