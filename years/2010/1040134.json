 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Karin Crowhurst and colleagues Eric Kelson, Paul Shin, Thomas Minehan and Yann Schrodi from California State University Northridge will acquire a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as the investigation of protein dynamics and structure in the neurotrophin and RGS families of signaling proteins; to better understand the mechanisms of signal transmission and regulation; synthesis of C-aryl glycosides to use as nucleoside analogues and for sequence-specific DNA binding; preparation of ruthenium complexes that selectively catalyze inner-sphere hydride transfer to ketones; synthesis of trinuclear group 4 metal complexes to catalyze nitrogen activation/hydrogenation; and design and synthesis of enediyne-based aromatase modulators, a promising class of therapeutics for breast cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists and biochemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",

Protein studies require \"high field\" spectrometers such as a 600 MHz instrument, because they have a lot of atoms and are more difficult to study.  A higher field provides better resolution in this situation.  Some molecules that are studied by the chemists in our department have some complex characteristics that are difficult to study at lower fields (such as 400 MHz) and as such they benefit from this kind of NMR, as well.\n\nSince the NMR was installed two years ago it has been very well-used.
