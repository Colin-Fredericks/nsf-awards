 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nExperimental evidence has shown that the quantum solid He-4 partially decouples mechanically from its moving container wall.  An exciting yet controversial interpretation of these experiments is that the quantum solid He-4 behaves as a superfluid while retaining its crystalline properties.  It is generally agreed that the presence of defects such as dislocation lines and grain boundaries is somehow involved.  In this project, experiments will be carried out to measure both ultrasonic propagation (for probing the defects) and torsional oscillation (for probing mechanical decoupling) will be simultaneously measured in the identical sample of solid He-4 in order to elucidate the relationship between these two effects.  Fourth sound, which propagates in a material only if the material becomes a superfluid, will be searched.  A successful observation of fourth sound propagation will supply a definitive evidence for superfluidity of solid He-4.  Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will participate in a truly frontier research of modern condensed matter physics.  Undergraduate students will be involved in the research as honors and independent projects.  They will all be exposed to the modern technologies in instrumentation, data acquisition and analyses.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how quantum mechanics affects the physical properties of solids is one of the most important goals of solid state physics field.  Measured by the degree of delocalization or \"fuzziness\" of atoms, solid helium at very low temperatures is the substance known in nature most affected by quantum mechanics.  It is then crucial in fundamental physics and ultimately in utilization of materials to acquire thorough knowledge of the properties of solid helium.  The internal structure such as defects and crystalline faults in solid helium will be measured by non-destructive high frequency ultrasound propagation techniques.  This ultrasound probe will be complemented by the measurement of the mechanical response of the same solid to a moving body attached to its surface.  Comparison of these two measurements is designed to reveal the origins of quantum mechanical behavior of solid helium and ultimately other solids of technological importance.  The exciting fundamental research in the project will be experienced by participating undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows.  All participants will be exposed to the modern technologies in instrumentation, data acquisition and analyses.  The research experience will be an excellent training ground in preparation for becoming a part of scientific work force in the U.S.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding how quantum mechanics affects the physical properties of solids is one of the most important goals of solid state physics field.  According to the degree of uncertainty in atomic location, solid helium at very low temperatures is the best solid material to search for macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics.  It is then crucial in fundamental physics and ultimately in utilization of materials to acquire thorough knowledge of the properties of solid helium.\n\nTheoretical studies of quantum mechanical behavior of solid helium indicated that the solid helium might behave as a superfluid without viscosity.  This bizarre behavior attracted many experimentalists to search for this effect.  Evidence for superfluidity in solid helium was found in an experiment in which solid helium was rotational oscillated around the axis of a cylindrical sample container.  In an attempt to provide a proof for this, we searched in our project for the unique sound wave propagation in solid helium known as fourth sound which would propagate only if the solid helium were a superfluid.  Unfortunately, our search showed that solid helium did not support fourth sound propagation and that solid helium did not behave as a superfluid.\n\nTo further investigate the unusual behavior of solid helium, the internal structures such as defects and crystalline faults in solid helium were probed by the non-demolition technique of high frequency ultrasound propagation.  The ultrasound probe was complemented by the simultaneous measurement of the mechanical response by applying a rotational shearing motion to the same solid helium sample.  Comparison of these two measurements revealed that the sample defects in the form of dislocation lines affected both shear modulus and in the loss of energy during mechanical motion of the solid helium sample.  Dislocation lines are formed during the material sample growth when extra lines of atoms are wedged into an otherwise perfectly aligned lattice of atoms.  Surprisingly, the presence of minute amount of impurity (here, He-3 atoms) on the order of several parts per million, was found to profoundly affect the properties of dislocation lines in solid He-4.   These findings may have application in understanding of the role of impurities in practical materials important to technology. \n\nThe exciting research at the forefront of science was experienced and shared by participating undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows.  All participants were exposed to the modern technologies in instrumentation, data acquisition and analyses.  The research experience served as an excellent training ground in preparation for all participants towards becoming an important part of scientific work force in the U.S. and beyond.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Haruo Kojima"
