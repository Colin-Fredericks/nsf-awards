 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to produce a book-length synthesis of findings in the field of phenotypic evolution.  This field is concerned with the evolution of body size, shape, coloration, behavior and other observable characteristics of plants and animals.  The synthesis will include theoretical results as well as observational and experimental findings.  The observational results that will be summarized range from evolutionary change over a few generations in contemporary populations to trends that occur in the fossil record over hundreds of millions of years.  The challenge faced by this book is to explain evolution over such diverse timescales in terms of natural processes that operate on a timescale of a few generations (e.g., inheritance, selection, population size).  Most evolutionary biologists agree that such an explanation should be possible, while disagreeing about the details. \r\n\r\nThe significance of this synthesis is that it will integrate recently developed theoretical models with observations of evolution in nature.  The synthesis is based on the premise that processes underlying evolution can be understood using powerful models that have been developed over the last 30 years.  Despite their power, these models are not widely used - even by evolutionary biologists - because of their mathematical nature.  Consequently, a major aim of this project is to make these modern models accessible to a wide audience that will include researchers, college students, and even high school students.  Accessibility will be achieved by using computer animations and simulations to illustrate both essential concepts and theoretical results. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis book presents a synthesis of current knowledge about phenotypic evolution, the evolution of the readily observed characteristics of animals, plants, and other organisms.  The phenotypes whose evolution we wish to understand include body size, demographic rates, physiology, disease rersistance and proclivity, and behavior, including intelligence.  All of these characteristics are affected by many individual genes as well as by the environment in which the organism finds itself.  Because of this diffuse basis for inheritance, theory for phenotypic evolution is a statistical science.  At the same time, we wish to study the evolution of many phenotypes simultaneously so advanced (multivariate) statistics and mathematics are required.  The book presents a synthesis of the our knowledge of the inheritance, mutation, and selection as they act of phenotypic traits and invoke evolutionary change.  The synthesis reveals simple graphic and animation solutions to the problem of visualizing elementary evolutionary forces.  For example, the problem of describing how selection acts within a generation as well as over deep evolutionary time (i.e., over millions of generations) can be solved with an adaptive landscape concept that depicts survival and reproductive value as a function of characteristic (trait) values.  The synthesis reveals that the configuration and movement of peaks on this landscape are the key to understanding the phenotypic diversification of life on earth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stevan J Arnold"
