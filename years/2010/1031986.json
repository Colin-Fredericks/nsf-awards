 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems studies conducted by the University of Cincinnati site (lead), the Missouri University of Science and Technology site and the University of Michigan site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\t\r\nThe proposed research focuses on methods for controlling and evaluating the quality of data used in prognostic applications of system health and indicating when maintenance is needed. The proposal is well conceived, well organized, and the goals and objectives of the research are presented well. The tasks to be accomplished over the two years are clearly outlined, as well as which of the cooperating institutions will carry out the work. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research answers a significant research question raised by the industrial partners. For many companies assuring the quality of datasets before actually performing prognostics can avoid unnecessary investment in redundant prognostics analysis due to poor quality datasets. Assured data quality will improve prognostics results, which leads to better maintenance decisions and significant cost saving. The IMS Center has actively involved minority and female graduate students and has provided a number of Research Experience for Teachers and Undergraduates (RET and REU) projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the past, significant\nresources and  effort was spent on\ndeveloping data processing and health monitoring models for condition based\nmonitoring applications, often to only discover at the end, that the initial\ndata collected was flawed and not suitable. \nThrough this research grant, a methodology and set of tools were\ndeveloped to evaluate the data quality using several metrics, in which one\nwould know whether the data was suitable for developing reliable health monitoring\nmodels and methods.  A novel spectral\nclustering method was used to detect outliers in the data and also used to\nevaluate whether the data was suitable for diagnosing different failure\nmodes.  A set of signal validation\nmetrics were also evaluated for determining whether the vibration signal is\ncorrect and should be used for later analysis. \nLastly, a set of metrics for evaluating whether the data is suitable for\nprognostics (failure prediction) were developed, including monotonic and\ntrendability metrics.\n\n\nThe developed methodology and tools\nwere evaluated on two separate applications, with the first example dealing\nwith a machine tool feed axis system used in manufacturing.  The data quality evaluation tools were\napplied to this feed axis condition monitoring data, and effectively removed\noutliers and determine which data sets could be used to develop models to diagnosis\nthe different failure modes.  The second\napplication dealt with renewable energy, and in particular a wind turbine\ncondition monitoring system.  The\nvibration signal validation metrics removed erroneous files.  The monotonic metrics evaluated the health\nmonitoring methods and determined that the component health trends were\nsuitable for prognostics (life prediction).  \nThe data quality methodology, tools, and case studies were disseminated\nin two Industrial Advisory Board Meetings (IAB 21 and IAB 23), a book chapter,\na journal paper, and two dissertations.\n\n \n\nThe  methodology and tools developed for data\nquality significantly impact the attended intellectual merits of this research\ngrant.  By proposing and then evaluating\na systematic methodology for data quality for condition monitoring and\nprognostic purposes, scientists and engineers now have a procedure to follow\nwhen developing these predictive monitoring systems.  No longer should significant resources be\nused to develop health monitoring models, to only realize at the end that the\ndata quality was not suitable.  The data\nquality methodology and tools were successfully demonstrated with two case\nstudies, in which erroneous data was removed and health models could be\ndeveloped in a more rapid and reliable manner. \nIt is believed that the scientific community and industry will further\nimprove and adopt this methodology for researching and developing condition\nbased monitoring and prognostic systems. \n\n \n\nThere is significant broader\nimpacts that could be impacted by this data quality methodology and tools.  Beyond the current manufacturing and renewable energy condition monitoring applications, there are vast other condition monitoring applications that would need this data quality evaluation (railway, solar panel degradation, electric vehicles). \nThese broader applications would need a customized version of the data\nquality tools to ensure that the data is correct for further analysis and\nhealth modeling.  In addition, as the\n\"big data\" aspect in manufacturing and other sectors become more\nprevalent, it is going to be even more imperative to have a suitable set of\ndata quality tools to evaluate all this data and determine which is useful for\nfurther analysis.  It is also quite\nunderstandable, that data quality metrics would be useful for a variety of\nother fields, including health care, social media data, financial data,\nsurveillance/security, and so on. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay Lee"
