 "awd_abstract_narration": "CF21 is a comprehensive vision that recognizes software as a primary modality for science research. The complexity of how disparate software elements form a cohesive, sustainable cyberinfrastructure becomes staggering, as more elements are produced from an increasing number of funded initiatives targeting technological capability and community interactions at national and international scales.  The environmental observatory community ecosystem must encompass all elements comprising this cyberinfrastructure, crosscutting through technologies, disciplines, communities, and practices towards accelerating scientific progress and competitiveness.  NSF-funded environmental observatories and related cyberinfrastructure projects are broad and span many communities including AON (Arctic Observing Network), CHyMP (CUAHSI Hydrologic Modeling Platform), CUAHSI HIS (CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System), CZOs (Critical Zone Observatories), HydoNexrad (Hydro Next-generation Radar), LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research), NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network), OOI (Ocean Observing Initiative), and WSC (Water Sustainability and Climate Program).  Each of these has their own software development efforts and has overlapping cyberinfrastructure requirements and science agendas, yet there is no unified effort that facilitates sustainable research, education and communication cross-cutting through all of them. \r\n \r\nThis NSF-sponsored workshop provides a forum for exploring how to realize the CF21 vision and yield robust, sustainable products and methods that respond to the growing cyberinfrastructure needs of the environmental observatory communities.  It addresses community architectures driving effective governance models for coordination of sustainable community practices including integration of community workflows, interoperability of resources, and virtual organization principles that will drive new science at the interstices of these communities.  The workshop provides the opportunity for open discussion among leaders in each of the environmental observatories, industry, HPC,  grid, cloud, campus bridging and workforce training on the topic of what constitutes a successful S2I2 institute.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn October 2010, RENCI and NCSA hosted an NSF workshop to discuss software development challenges pertaining to the NSF\u00c6s Environmental Observatory Networks (EONs).  Workshop attendees explored how NSF\u00c6s envisioned Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) would service EON and related cyberinfrastructure and water science communities to enable Grand Challenge transformative science not possible without an institute. The EONs span multiple NSF directorates and represent an ongoing NSF investment of nearly $1B.  Representatives from nine NSF-funded environmental observatories and observatory-related cyberinfrastructure projects attended, as well as five industry representatives and nine NSF representatives.  Workshop outcomes are being used to provide the NSF with the EON and water science communities\u00c6 needs in order to inform NSF\u00c6s Request For Proposal for the creation of Scientific Software Innovation Institutes.\n\nDiscussion of grand challenge problems such as the creation of a National Water Model revealed that science at this scale can only be addressed as a joint effort of a large number of research communities.  The group concluded that the governance of such a cross-community effort should be based on open source mechanics.\n\nIn water science and in many other scientific fields, a lack of inter-organizational coordination and inadequate software development practices significantly frustrates cross-community research efforts. NSF representatives attending the workshop stated they have begun to address this problem through the NSF\u00c6s Cyberinfrastructure Framework for the 21st Century (CIF21) strategy. The workshop highlighted that within the EONs, as within many research communities, software and data are inextricably linked.  The workshop revealed that interoperability is a Grand Challenge among the EONs and that lack of interoperability among data and software generated by different communities prevents scientists from fully utilizing information derived from software and data.\n\nJust as the scientific problems the NSF seeks to address are complex, so are the scientific software challenges faced by the EONs and water science communities.  There was consensus among the attendees that an S2I2 is necessary to coordinate inter-community and inter-agency resources to tackle the most challenging and complex observational and water science questions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ray Idaszak"
