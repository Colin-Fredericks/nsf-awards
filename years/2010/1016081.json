 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating the following three research problems concerning knowledge extraction and data mining from real-time stream systems:\r\n\r\nNovel Framework for Stream Mining Systems: \r\nThe project is studying how to formalize the problem of large scale distributed knowledge extraction from high volume streams by defining appropriate local and end-to-end objective functions, along with resource and delay constraints that will guide the different optimization and adaptation algorithms. \r\n\r\nTopology construction: \r\nThe project is studying methods to organize classifiers into a connected topology mapped onto a distributed infrastructure. The research starts by studying linear chains of classifiers and then seeks to extend the work to multiple chains working in parallel, and to classifier trees.\r\n\r\nDecentralized Solutions based on Interactive Multi-Agent Learning: \r\nFor large scale stream mining systems, where the classifiers are distributed across multiple nodes, the project is developing a decentralized decision framework and distributed algorithms for joint topology construction and local classifier configuration. In such distributed scenarios, optimizing the end-to-end performance requires interactive, multi-agent solutions to be deployed at each site in order to determine the effect of each classifier's decisions on the other classifiers.",
