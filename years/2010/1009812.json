 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for a two-year renewal of the St. Elias Erosion-tectonics Project (STEEP).  STEEP is a 9 institution, multidisciplinary study of the St. Elias orogen in southern Alaska that involves researchers examining the system from the outcrop to lithosphere scale.  To date, STEEP has produced 17 papers with another 9 submitted or nearing submission, sponsored 71 abstracts, will have matriculated 5 masters and 4 Doctoral students by Spring 2010, and fundamentally changed our understanding of Alaskan tectonics and the interaction of tectonics and climate in mountain building.  The renewal funds will be used for:  1) final processing and interpretation of some key datasets that were not acquired until year 5 of the project including the marine seismic survey (ship delays) and reoccupation of key GPS sites (weather problems in 2008); and  2) a complete integration of results which was not possible until now due to these delays. A complete integration and synthesis of these superb datasets has the potential to be transformative in our understanding of how crustal structure and tectonic forces interact with Earth surface processes of glacial erosion and sedimentary transport to grow a mountain range and a massive continental shelf.",

It examined the interplay between tectonic plate motion, erosion, glaciers, the ocean and climate that produced these mountains, the highest coastal mountains on the globe (Figures 1-3). This area is a world record breaker not only in terms of the extreme relief adjacent to an ocean, but it also features the largest and most erosive valleys glaciers on the planet. \n\n \n\nThe tempo of erosion is such that, if averaged over the entire STEEP area, a layer of rock equivalent in thickness to the average elevation of the range is eroded away within a million years. Despite the rapid erosion, the St. Elias Mountains stand out among the highest on the continent, and curiously, they most probably have been high for millions of years. This is based previous observations of ice-rafted debris in sediments cored in the Pacific; they indicate that the mountains must have been sufficiently high to support ice masses that reached the ocean starting five million years ago.

The relationship between the elevation of the mountains and extent of glaciers provides a powerful constraint on paleo elevations that does not exist for mountains that have not been shaped by ice.\n\n \n\nOur team has shown that the amount of rock removed by erosion must be closely offset by tectonic addition of rock and uplift in the STEEP region to sustain the St. Elias Mountains.  Indeed, in general, cooling ages in modern sediment show that rapid, sustained erosion coincides in space with zones of active deformation and high precipitation, as well as with rapid glacial erosion (Figure 4).\n\n \n\nSTEEP involved and impacted diverse disciplines.
