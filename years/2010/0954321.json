 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to identify the fundamental surface properties of a micromoldable liquid metal.  The liquid metal is a low toxicity, gallium-based fluid with a low viscosity (like water) at room temperature.  It forms a thin, solid 'skin' of oxide on its surface that allows the liquid to be micromolded into desirable shapes (e.g., wires, antennas) that may be useful for flexible electronics.   The micromolded metal is stabilized mechanically by the skin, which dictates the electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the surface of the metal. The research will explore the fundamental properties of this surface and identify means of manipulating, modifying, and tuning it to form functional electronics with surface-dictated properties.  For this project, new surface sensitive techniques will be developed and used to thoroughly characterize the unique properties of the skin of oxide on the liquid metal.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will enable the fabrication of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic components with tunable properties.  Example applications include soft electrodes for molecular electronics, deformable antennas, and electrical components for microfluidic devices. Devices made possible by the research will offer the advantages of durability and flexibility, and will be simple to fabricate.  The research will be integrated into a new course at NC State and graduate and undergraduate engineering students will benefit directly from involvement in the research.  An interactive module that discusses the research within the context of popular movies will be presented annually to an established program at NC State that aims to interest 11- to 14-year-old African-American and Hispanic boys in higher education and careers in science.",
