This Seminar has been supported by the NSF since 1991.  Geometric analysis is an important part of modern mathematics and is related to many other branches of mathematics. Using analysis as its main tool and differential geometry, topology and algebraic geometry as foundations, it has solved a large number of problems in global geometry, topology, several complex variables and mathematical physics.  There is much enthusiasm for its continuation among geometers, analysts and mathematicians of related fields at institutions from the southern California, as well as young geometric analysts cross the country. It is the unique annual meeting of its kind in the Southern California area, and continues to foster interest in geometric analysis at all levels.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Seminar is to promote interaction among mathematicians in Southern California who are interested in geometric analysis and related areas and to introduce graduate students and post-docs to some of the best works in geometric analysis.  The SCGAS has become an important and anticipated event for the Southern California region, as the success of the first sixteen meetings has demonstrated. In fact the SCGAS also attracts a substantial number of participants from all over the country.  The Seminar, organized jointly by UC-San Diego and UC-Irvine, will continue its commitment to encourage and support participation of graduate students and recent PhDs, especially young women and minority mathematicians, and will continue to invite top women mathematicians as speakers.  As a new feature to our proposal we will include a junior speaker for the proposed meetings.\r\n\r\nThe conference has a website at: http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~scgas/",

The conference featured 7 one-hour long talks by the following  speakers: Tobias Colding (MIT), John Lott (UC Berkeley), Yong-Geun Oh  (IBS, POSTECH, UW-Madison), Jie Qing (UC Santa Cruz), Yanir Rubinstein  (Maryland), Natasa Sesum (Rutgers) and Mu-Tao Wang (Columbia).  Over 80  participants, from the southern California region, throughout the United  States and other foreign countries, attend the conference.  More than  half of the participants were postdocs (14) and graduate students  (29).   The conference promoted much interactions and discussions among  participants through conference lunch, banquet dinner, and long breaks  between talks.\n\nThe seven talks consisted of the following contents: Tobias Colding  spoke about his new work with Bill Minicozzi on the singularities of the  mean curvature flow; John Lott spoke about his work with Bruce Kleiner  concerning how to \"flow\" through the singularities in three-dimensional  Ricci flows; Yong-Geun Oh described his recent work with Rui Wang on  defining contact homology type invariants without symplectivization; Jie  Qing reported on his joint work with Changping Wang and Jingyang Zhong  analyzing surfaces in conformal Lorentzian 3-manifolds; Yanir Rubinstein  talked about his recent work with A. Carlotto and O. Chodosh on the  different types of convergence rate of geometric flows.  Natasa Sesum  described her joint work with James Isenberg and Dan Knopf on warped  Berger solutions of Ricci flow; Mu-Tao Wang presented his joint work  with Po-Ning Chen and Shing-Tung Yau on defining the center of mass in  general relativity.\n\n \n\nConference posters were sent out to over 60 institutions throughout  the United States.   They included a number of teaching-oriented  institutions such as several California State Universities located in  southern California.\n\n \n\nThe conference indeed attracted a number of participants from local  teaching-focused institutions.  Participants included 5 faculty and  students from Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach, Cal State  Northridge, and Cal State San Bernardino.\n\nThe organizers also made a point to reach out to under-represented  minorities.  There were twelve women participants and four participants  (Abolarinwa, Hilaire, Birts, Reid) of African descent. \n\nThe URL of the conference webpage is at \n\nhttp://www.math.uci.edu/~scgas/scgas-2014/2014.php\n\n \n\nThe 2014 SCGAS conference promoted interactions amongst members of  the southern California mathematics community who are interested in  geometric analysis and related areas.  It also provided an important  forum for members of the southern California mathematics community to  interact with fellow mathematicians from throughout the US and other  parts of the world.  This year besides participants from California,  there were also participants from institutions located in 15 other  states - Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,  Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,  Utah, Washington, Wisconsin &ndash; and foreign countries such as China, South  Korea, United Kingdom.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lei Ni"
