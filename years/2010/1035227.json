 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will provide partial financial support for the Twentieth \r\nInternational Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods, to be held at \r\nthe San Diego Supercomputer Center on the campus of the University of \r\nCalifornia at San Diego, in February 2011.  Domain decomposition, in some \r\nform, is by far the most common paradigm for large-scale simulation on \r\nmassively parallel distributed, hierarchical memory computers.  This \r\nparadigm permeates almost all arenas of simulation, from such practical \r\nconcerns as numerical climate modeling, modeling of complex biological \r\nmolecules and biological processes, the design and testing of automobiles, \r\naircraft and other structures, and the modeling of complex porous media \r\nflows, to more abstract scientific endeavors such as modeling black holes \r\nand searching for the origins of the universe.  However, many users of \r\ndomain decomposition do not avail themselves of the most sophisticated \r\nand efficient methods known.  This has become more pronounced as the size \r\nof the large-scale scientific simulation community has grown with the \r\navailability of hardware in the past few years, particularly inside \r\nscientific communities without traditionally strong ties to the \r\ncomputational mathematics or computer science communities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this conference is to promote advances in domain decomposition \r\nmethods by encouraging interdisciplinary technical interchange throughout \r\nthe international computational science and engineering communities, and by \r\ntaking advantage of conference siting, to attract to this important area \r\nmany new U.S. scientists.  It is strongly aligned with NSF's, and more \r\ngenerally, our national priorities to promote and advance fundamental \r\ninterdisciplinary research in Computational Science and Engineering.\r\nNSF funding will make possible financial support for graduate students, \r\npost-docs, and other young researchers who otherwise might not be able to \r\nattend.  The funding will also allow for increasing participation of women, \r\nAfrican Americans, and Hispanic Americans from across the nation as well as \r\nfrom the diverse Southern California scientific community.",
