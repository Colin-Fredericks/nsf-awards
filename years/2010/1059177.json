 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this EAGER grant is to seek seed funding for the proof-of-concept demonstration through theoretical modeling, fabrication, testing and measurement of a novel dynamically switchable Electro-Magnetic (EM) slow-wave structure that is expected to find wide applications in spectroscopy, THz electronics, bio-sensing and bio-analyzing of hazardous materials. Specifically, for the first time, it will be demonstrated that birefringent anisotropic dielectric media embedded inside a corrugated regular periodic metallic structure, can be utilized to slow down and disperse EM waves in an innovative way that will also allow the new device to electro-optically control the EM wave propagation into ON and OFF (about 20 dB lower than ON state strength) states. Unlike conventional optical circuitry that requires a large amount of chip real estate, the proposed slow-wave device can be easily integrated on VLSI chips because of their smaller geometries and process compatibility with CMOS technology.\r\nIntellectual Merits:\r\nThe research will develop, for the first time, dynamically-controlled slow-wave Electromagnetic (EM) structures that can be easily integrated in VLSI chips because of their miniaturized geometries and process compatibility with CMOS technology. The theoretical study on various types of electro-optic materials as an anisotropic dielectric medium will reveal how varying refractive indices at different applied voltages will be able to disperse EM waves in distinguished modes so that with careful dispersion engineering, EM wave propagation can be turned on and turned off like a switch. This feature is essential in the design of three-terminal slow-wave EM devices both in the form of controllable waveguides and logic switches.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nBesides the fact that the proposed device is likely to find wide applications in spectroscopy, THz electronics, bio-sensing and bio-analyzing of hazardous materials, the educational objectives of this research project will impart interdisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students. Having an African American doctoral student in PI's research team already will help promote diversity and will encourage female and minority students to join the doctoral degree program in electrical and computer engineering. The PI has in the past spent considerable effort to write mathematical software for K-12 students and now intends to expose students to various types of innovative devices that will be fabricated in this project, which is expected to stimulate school students interest in Science and Engineering. The PI has an active collaboration with many US based companies such as Raytheon and HRL, as well as international research partners in Japan, Korea and China who had in the past published papers with the PI and exchanged research personnel. To promote research among undergraduate students, the PI annually holds Summer Interns program where undergrads from Michigan and overseas countries join the PI' laboratories to get exposed to research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nTerahertz (THz) is known as the scantly-explored and under-exploited \u00e6gap\u00c6 between microwave electronics and mid-infrared optics. With the development of various THz sources and detectors in the last decade, this underexploited frequency domain (\"gap\") has witnessed a slow evolution to become the \u00e6bridge\u00c6 between optical communication and electronic signal processing. The nascent convergence of wireless communication and computing has opened the possibility of the convergence of photonics and electronics. However, the barrier of co-integration of photonics and electronics is owing to the dissimilar dimensions of electronic components that are nearing 10 nm while the optical components carrying 100's of THz photonic signal have geometries close to 10's of microns. Recently, there has been extensive research on development of plasmonic devices as a result of the possibility of miniaturization of optical devices below the diffraction limit. \n \nSurface plasmons result from the free electron oscillation along the interface of metal and dielectric structures. Unfortunately, because of high material loss in THz frequency range (0.3-10 THz), it is not possible to utilize plasma in this region. Furthermore, conventional waveguides such as metallic wires, tubes, index-guiding silicon slab waveguides or sapphire fibers are not suitable because of group velocity dispersion and high material loss. A newly developed method to overcome the group velocity dispersion of terahertz wave and weak guiding at THz frequencies is the utilization of spoof surface palasmon polariton (SSPP) waves confined to the periodically corrugated metallic structures.\n\n\nSpoofed Surface Plasmon Polariton (SSPP) is known as a pseudo-surface mode that mimics the slow wave nature and localized E-M field distribution of the plasmon mode typically observed in optical domain. By introducing periodic corrugations on opposing surfaces of a metal-dielectric-metal structure, SSPP mode is realized for propagating THz signal, and its mode dispersion is strongly dependent on the geometric dimensions as well as the material properties of the architecture. \nAlso terahertz sensing has attracted numerous research activities in past decades. Due to the fact that many materials exhibit unique spectrum signatures in THz, different materials can be easily characterized in this band. Although in recent years a lot of research work has focused on wideband sensing to capture fingerprints of different materials in THz, the narrow band THz bio-sensing based on resonance has been pursued extensively as well.\n\n\nTraditionally, the change in DNA state from the single-stranded DNA to the double-stranded DNA molecules is investigated by tagging the target DNA with certain agents such as fluorescent ones. Although this method has widespread applications in DNA sensing, it has disadvantages such as the unwanted interference from the tagging agent and the extra preparatory steps. In biomolecules such as RNA and DNA, the refractive index depends on their binding states to known probes. Therefore, measurement of the change in refractive index enables the label-free direct detection and identification of genetic sequences. Examples of the state-of-the-art biosensing are integrated on-chip microstrip line resonator has been employed to sense refractive index change in DNA, and split ring resonators (SRRs) are used in chip-scale optics. \n\n \nThe main objective of the EAGER project is to develop fabrication technology for THz biosensing components as well as establishing theoretical foundation to model the interaction between slow EM waves in the form of SSPP signal and biomaterials. This emerging field of interdisciplinary research and education is envisioned making both scientific and commercial impact. \n \nIt may be noted that SSPP is a closed structure where biomaterials can be applied only one time before the upper and lower halves of the SSPP structure are assembled together. Therefore, to overcome ..."
