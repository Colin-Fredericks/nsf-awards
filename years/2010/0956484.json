 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: Chloroplasts are the organelles within plant cells that are responsible for the synthesis of organic molecules from the energy contained in sunlight.  This process of photosynthesis is the ultimate source of all food available on the planet.  In order for chloroplasts to function they must be able to take up proteins needed for their biosynthesis and homeostasis from the cytoplasm, and this requires the input of metabolic energy.  The molecular machinery responsible for the input of energy into the chloroplast protein import process is the subject of this research.  Specifically, the synergistic interaction of two different molecular chaperones in powering chloroplast protein import will be examined, both in isolation and in the chloroplast itself.  Elucidation of the details of this relationship is expected to inform future choices for modifications designed to improve the energy use efficiency of chloroplast biosynthesis and maintenance pathways.\r\n\r\n Broader impact: During the course of this research a number of young scientists will be trained in various disciplines of biological sciences.  This will include a senior researcher, a graduate student and numerous undergraduates.  These are the individuals who will be tasked with carrying forward biological research into the coming decades, including designing strategies for feeding the ever increasing world population.  A number of the undergraduates will be drawn from the UC-Davis Biology Undergraduates Scholars Program, which serves students from economically depressed circumstances or underrepresented ethnic groups, thereby leading to greater diversity in our future scientific leaders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nChloroplasts are the organelles in green plants that are responsible for photosynthesis and many other metabolic pathways.  More than 95% of the protein complement of chloroplasts are imported into the organelle after their synthesis in the cytoplasm.   Protein import into chloroplasts is driven by energy supplied by ATP.  The mechanism through which this energy is delivered to the molecular motors that drive the protein import reactions is the subject of this project.\n\n \n\nFor many years the ATP hydrolyzing motor for chloroplast protein import was thought to be Hsp93, a member of the Hsp100 family of molecular chaperones.  During the prior funding period our lab showed that a different molecular chaperone, Hsp70, was also involved in the import process.  We set out in this funding period to understand whether both of these chaperones did indeed operate in the chloroplast import motor, and if so, whether they did so in series or parallel.  Additionally we asked which of the two dominated the energy input to the reaction.  Finally, we asked these chaperones cooperated in an additional function attributed to molecular chaperones, the break up of protein aggregates and the refolding of denatured proteins. \n\n \n\nDespite setting up the disaggregase assay correctly, as evidenced by control experiments, we were unable to demonstrate that these two chaperones operated synergistically in the break up and refolding of protein aggregates.  Our experiments did establish, however, that even in the presence of Hsp93, Hsp70 is the part of the motor that dominates the energetics of the chloroplast import reaction.  This was accomplished by lowering the affinity of Hsp70 for ATP through site-directed mutation.  The mutated Hsp70 was transformed into the moss, P. patens, such that it replaced the wild type protein.  We found that chloroplasts isolated from these mutant plants now required a higher amount of ATP to import their proteins.  This demonstrated that the two chaperones did not operate in parallel, since wild type Hsp93 was unable to compensate for the mutated Hsp70 with a lowered activity.  It also showed that ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70 was the limiting energetic step in the import reaction.  Experiments in the next funding cycle will address the question of which steps in the import process the different chaperones act.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven M Theg"
