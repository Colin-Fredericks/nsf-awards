 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the fundamental physics of magnetic reconnection under realistic conditions such as at Earth's magnetopause.  The project will derive expressions for the scaling of the rate of reconnection as a function of the shear flow speed.  It will use both fluid and kinetic simulations to test the results of the scaling model and will compare the signatures of reconnection to in situ satellite data.  The project will incorporate the effects of shear flow on the recently derived coupling function for the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere. \r\n\r\nThe educational goals are oriented toward increasing the number of women and minorities in participation in science in general and space and plasma science in particular.  Particular emphasis will be placed on activities that may encourage students from lower socio-economic conditions to become involved with science.  The project will include the creation of outreach movies about space weather that will utilize the Tomchin Planetarium at West Virginia University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Grant AGS-0953463 has been immensely successful and productive, achieving its research and outreach goals in addition to many other accomplishments.  For research, the sun directs the magnetic field in interplanetary space outwards, where the field runs into Earth?s magnetic field.  There, the magnetic fields break in a process called magnetic reconnection.  Depending on the orientation of interplanetary magnetic field, the efficiency of the breaking can be weak or strong.  Understanding the efficiency of reconnection is crucial for predicting how Earth?s magnetic environment (its magnetosphere) responds to input from the Sun in the form of solar eruptions and the solar wind.  In this role, reconnection at the dayside edge of the magnetosphere is a crucial component of space weather.\n\nBefore this project, quantifying how efficiently reconnection at the dayside proceeds could only be achieved when accounting for asymmetries in the magnetic fields and plasma densities that naturally arise at the dayside.  However, there was no quantitative understanding of how flow around the magnetosphere due to the solar wind affected reconnection?s efficiency.  The objectives of this grant were to (1) predict the efficiency of symmetric reconnection with flow and test the predictions against fluid numerical simulations, (2) predict the efficiency for asymmetric reconnection with a flow and compare to fluid and particle numerical simulations, (3) determine how the results impact a leading quantitative prediction of solar wind-magnetospheric coupling efficiency, and (4) compare the predictions to observations from satellite data.\n\nEach of these activities were successfully carried out. We predicted the efficiency of symmetric reconnection with flow, and confirmed the results with fluid simulations.  We then derived predictions for asymmetric reconnection with flow, and confirmed the results with fluid and particle simulations.  A result of this work was the surprising prediction that flow would not strongly impact the efficiency of asymmetric reconnection at the dayside, contrary to the predictions of a leading 25 year old model.  We compared our predictions to satellite observations and confirmed the results were consistent with our predictions.  This implies that flow does not need to be included in the leading quantitative prediction of solar wind-magnetospheric coupling (under typical conditions).  The predictions should also be useful for fusion and planetary sciences research. Thus, we accomplished all of the research goals of the proposal.\n\nIn addition to the proposed work, we performed many other successful studies.  The most significant was a study of how to locate where reconnection occurs on the dayside in global numerical simulations.  We developed a new, simple, and robust technique to do so. We showed the technique works, used the result to compare models of the location of dayside reconnection, and studied the efficiency of dayside reconnection as the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field changes.  The ability to find reconnection sites in global simulations was so significant that a slightly modified version was implemented at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, so now anyone requesting a simulation can automatically be told where reconnection takes place.  Numerous other important studies were carried out.  Most recently, the PI provided the simulation support to help analyze data from the newly launched Magnetospheric MultiScale mission.  The discovery paper was published in Science.  All told, 24 publications resulted from this project, plus 1 that is in press and 7 that are under review.\n\nThis grant also helped train a number of students in research - four graduate students and one undergraduate.  They led six of the publications.  They received a national poster award, a NASA award for outstanding research, and one was a finalist for a nationwide research award.  Three graduate dissertations were produced. \n\nFor outreach, the proposed task was to generate materials for a movie to be shown in planetariums.  We did a numerical simulation and traced out magnetic field lines in an effort to show the reconnection process at work.  This is being incorporated into a full length movie under the direction of Pat Reiff at Rice University.  A finished product will soon be available for distribution.  In addition to the proposed work, we developed a collaboration with the local children?s science museum, now called Spark! Imagination and Science Center.  We designed and built a permanent hands-on exhibit called Space Weather, one of few in the world focussed on this important topic.  It continues to be on display and now reaches over 10,000 people annually.  In collaboration with the museum, we designed and created self-contained kits with hands-on materials and lesson plans.  We made seven kits and delivered them free of charge to every elementary school in McDowell County, West Virginia, the poorest county in the state which is in dire need of modern science instructional material.  Thus, we have produced high quality informal education products and they are being used, and will continue to be used, by large numbers of people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/08/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Cassak"
