 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing provides economic advantages from shared resources, but security is a major risk for remote operations and a major barrier to the approach, with challenges for both hosts and the network. NEBULA is a potential future Internet architecture providing trustworthy networking for the emerging cloud computing model of always-available network services. NEBULA addresses many network security issues, including data availability with a new core architecture (NCore) based on redundant connections to and between NEBULA core routers, accountability and trust with a new policy-driven data plane (NDP), and extensibility with a new control plane (NVENT) that supports network virtualization, enabling results from other future Internet architectures to be incorporated in NEBULA. NEBULA?s data plane uses cryptographic tokens as demonstrable proofs that a path was both authorized and followed. The NEBULA control plane provides one or more authorized paths to NEBULA edge nodes; multiple paths provide reliability and load-balancing. The NEBULA core uses redundant high-speed paths between data centers and core routers, as well as fault-tolerant router software, for always-on core networking. The NEBULA architecture removes network (in) security as a prohibitive factor that would otherwise prevent the realization of many cloud computing applications, such as electronic health records and data from medical sensors. NEBULA will produce a working system that is deployable on core routers and is viable from both an economic and a regulatory perspective.",

Unlike the existing Internet, the Nebula design  provides interdomain route selection and QoS.  A spectrum of malicious  attacks against the network, such as DoS, is no longer possible with the  Nebula protocols, and the system allows for rapid repair after  unintentional and byzantine failures.  Unlike other clean slate  projects, Nebula involves the minimal set of changes to the network to  accomplish this high assurance.\n\n\nAccomplishments:\n\n\n\nNEBULA is designed to provide secure, highly available, and robust  communication services to critical services in the emerging cloud and  mobile environment.  Unlike the existing Internet, the Nebula design  provides interdomain route selection and QoS.  A spectrum of malicious  attacks against the network, such as DoS, is no longer possible with the  Nebula protocols, and the system allows for rapid repair after  unintentional and byzantine failures.  Unlike other clean slate  projects, Nebula involves the minimal set of changes to the network to  accomplish this high assurance.\n\n\nWe have developed prototype implementations for both of our interdomain  routing protocols &ndash; TorIP and Arrow.   For TorIP, we have built a  prototype implementation of data plane functionality, including circuit  establishment, cell forwarding/credits, and rendezvous routers using  Click.  We have written 23 Click elements, totaling over 4500 lines of  code.  These perform header validation/parsing, cryptographic actions,  and routing table management.  For Arrow, we have developed two  different implementations of based on the Click software router and the  Serval network protocol stack, respectively. \n\nWe have also  developed a prototype for F10, which can route around failures in 10s of  microseconds for highly structured data center networks.  We have a  working system, and we believe the approach can be extended to more  general intradomain networks.  This fits with TorIP and Arrow as  follows: using resilient intradomain routing protocols,  ISPs will be  able to offer endpoints resilient service across their networks.  TorIP  and Arrow can stitch these offerings together to provide resilient end  to end service across the future Internet.\n\nWe also designed and  implemented APLOMB, a practical service for outsourcing enterprise  middlebox processing to the cloud. We were able to show that APLOMB  solves real problems faced by network administrators, can outsource over  90% of middlebox hardware in a typical large enterprise network, and,  in a case study of a real enterprise, imposes an average latency penalty  of 1.1ms and median bandwidth inflation of 3.8%.\n\n \n\nPublications:\n\n\n\n \n\nV.
