 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this research is to address the challenges of protecting adolescent online safety. This work proposes a set of research activities to investigate three aspects of online safety issues for the adolescent cohort: conceptualization, intervention, and education. The specific goals are to: 1) conceptualize information privacy for the adolescent cohort; 2) assess the effectiveness of parental mediation strategies; and 3) generate design recommendations for effective designs of online safety awareness and training programs. The intellectual merit of this work lies in both the strength of the interdisciplinary project team and the significance of the problem addressed. The team includes a broad range of expertise in the domains of information privacy and security, psychology, human-computer interaction, and family and youth resiliency and policy. This work will offer new insights that can address the issues of protecting children online safety as well as study the human-computer and human-human (parent-child) interactions that are aware of the well-being of families. \r\n\r\nThe findings will have a broader impact in increasing the online safety of adolescents. This work includes significant community outreach and dissemination, involving parents and adolescents from a wide demographic variety in terms of gender, income, ethnicity, and rurality. The proposed intervention approaches will strengthen the trust within parent-child relationship, by enabling parents to show empathy with a child's perspective, and provide choices and options whenever possible. This work will be the first step towards a more ambitious research and intervention project that the team plans to develop in collaboration with national non-profit organizations.",

Analysis of twelve parent-teen pairs revealed five key boundary challenges and discovered four distinct teen profiles based on varying levels of teen autonomy and parental control: 1) Compliant Followers (low teen autonomy, high parental control), 2) Confrontational Risk-Takers (high autonomy, high control), 3) Unlimited Risk-Takers (high autonomy, low control), and 4) Dynamic Negotiators (changing levels of both dimensions based on context). Dynamic negotiation between parents and teens appeared to be the most appropriate balance for allowing teens some space to make their own online decisions but with the oversight of their parents [4]. We also compared parenting styles (c.f., Baumrind and Valkenburg [5-6]) with teen moral development profiles (c.f., Kohlberg [7]) to show that more authoritative (engaged and responsive) parents tend to have teens with more advanced levels of moral judgment, which translates into more responsible and less risky online behaviors [8].</p>\n<p>Next, we performed a secondary analyses of a large-scale, nationally representative data set collected by Pew Research [9-10] to construct and validate a &ldquo;risk-as-a-learning-process&rdquo; framework of adolescent social media privacy behaviors.

Then, we examined how different parental mediation strategies further influenced adolescent social media privacy behaviors [10]. We found that the use of direct parental intervention by itself may have a suppressive effect on teens, reducing their exposure to online risks but also their ability to engage with others online and to learn how to effectively cope with online risks.
