 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abrasion by Bedload and Suspended Load: Experimental Study\r\n\r\nRiver incision into rock plays an important role in diverse problems ranging from practical to academic.  From dam spillway design, to river management planning including maintenance of suitable aquatic habitats in mountain rivers and river restoration efforts, to the long-term controls on the slope, width, and roughness of mountain rivers, a quantitative understanding of the mechanics of river incision into rock is essential and of broad interest. There has been substantial progress in the past decade on understanding the interactions among climate, topography, erosion, and tectonics; recognition of the central role of river incision into rock has been a key insight.  Exploration of the role played by bedrock channels, however, has been accomplished primarily with simplified stream power models (generic rule sets for river incision that lump together a diverse set of erosional mechanisms). Refined, and more realistic, model predictions require advances in our quantitative understanding of erosion processes. Field-based investigation of bedrock incision processes is essential, but does not allow the investigator full control of critical variables. Controlled laboratory experiments have increasingly been used to explore fundamental aspects of the physics of river incision, to test existing models, and to guide their refinement.\r\n\r\n\tThis research project at ASU includes flume experiments, data analysis, and theoretical development. The experiments will be designed to complement and extend previous flume studies. The primary controlling variables (flux and size distribution of sediment; channel slope; water discharge; and substrate hardness) will be varied in a systematic exploration of conditions, including the transition from bedload to suspended load transport. Bed morphology will be allowed to evolve naturally, and the critical feedbacks between bed morphology, fluid dynamics, sediment flux, and local erosion rate will be quantified.  Based on preliminary experiments, field observations, and previous numerical studies, we formulate quantitative hypotheses that can and will be tested by direct measurement of erosion rate, bed topography, grain saltation trajectories, sediment transport rate, and fluid flow conditions, thus allowing refinement of current theory. \r\nThe results from this research project will have important implications for basic science and a number of practical concerns of societal relevance. Advances in the understanding of the linkages between bedrock lithology, sediment characteristics and channel morphology are of potentially great value in solving applied problems of minimizing and mitigating for landuse impacts and restoring damaged riverine habitat and ecosystems. Engineering planning and management demand understanding of the processes that govern channel changes, including bed roughness and alluvial cover characteristics. A postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student and several undergraduates will receive invaluable training from this research project. Also, laboratory demonstrations will be developed for use in undergraduate courses and for public outreach events.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNumerical models are widely used to simulate the behavior of the earth system, including climate, atmosphere, rivers, lakes, estuaries and oceans.  In the field of hydrology, these models are utilized to simulate the flow and storage of groundwater in aquifers, and the exchange of groundwater with surface waters like rivers, lakes, and wetlands.  These models are important tools for water managers and policy makers to evaluate water supply and assess the impact of human development on the hydrologic system.\n\nThese models are based upon well-established physical principles governing the flow of water in the subsurface.  These principles lead to mathematical equations based on mass and energy conservation, however these equations contain important parameters that characterized the permeability and porosity of the subsurface material.  Therefore, in order to use these numerical models, it is necessary to have knowledge about the subsurface geology.  Since many aquifers are deep, it is challenging and expensive to directly observe subsurface geology.  On the other hand, it is possible to drill observation wells and measure the water pressure and it is also possible to measure the discharge of groundwater into rivers or springs.  Therefore, common practice is to estimate the subsurface geology indirectly by adjusting the parameter values so that the simulated water pressure and discharge agrees with the observed data.  This is the process of calibration, also called parameter estimation.   Traditional approaches to calibration are based on statistical regression.  These approaches assume that all error in the model results from imperfect estimates of the subsurface geology parameters.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many other sources of error in groundwater modeling, including errors in boundaries, natural recharge and discharge, and other processes.  These are sometimes called \"conceptual errors.\"  This means that during the calibration process, the parameter values are adjusted to non-realistic values in order to compensate for these other unknown sources of error.  Therefore, Predictions made with these calibrated models may be grossly inaccurate, leading to poor water resources management outcomes.   These inadequacies are becoming more apparent due to the increasing availability of water data and the use of continuous time sensors for water pressure.\n\nThis research project has developed a new framework for groundwater flow model calibration and prediction that explicitly recognizes that the model is an imperfect representation of reality.  We use new statistical approaches, along with statistical learning methods, in order to \"learn\" the structure of the conceptual error directly from the mismatch between the simulation result and the observed data.  We have used theoretical case studies to demonstrate the value of our framework, demonstrating that more realistic parameters of subsurface geology are estimated if we explicitly account for conceptual error.   We also obtain more accurate predictions with our framework, compared to traditional calibration approaches.  We have applied our new framework to real world case studies of groundwater flow models, and demonstrate that our method can result in improved predictions of water pressure and groundwater discharge into streams.   Our new framework can in principle be extended to other models of environmental and earth processes.  \n\nWe have also worked with educators to develop web-based tools to enhance high school earth science curriculum. Our tools allow teachers, students, and the general public to use groundwater simulation models to understand the impact of pumping on water table elevation and streamflow.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Albert J Valocchi"
