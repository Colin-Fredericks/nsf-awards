The R/V WECOMA is used by a variety of investigators on numerous NSF projects.  The equipment resides and is maintained in a shared use pool that is available to all funded NSF projects on UNOLS vessels. Upgrades to the capabilities of the ship and equipment pool naturally enhance the opportunities for new discoveries and greater understanding of oceanic processes across disciplines.  In addition, continuous upgrade programs ensure that the most modern and effective tools are available to new investigators and graduate and undergraduate students.  Providing modern tools and the best data possible is critical for the training of the next generation of ocean scientists. These instruments increase the accuracy and resolution of our under way data. This allows for higher quality and more reliable data for the users of the R/V WECOMA and the shore side data centers use in the future.\n\nEnhance Infrastructure for Research and Education:  The primary purpose of the Oceanographic Instrumentation Program is to improve the infrastructure available to ocean scientists, and students at sea. Updating and improving our salinity and sea surface temperature measurements enhances the quality and usability of ..."
