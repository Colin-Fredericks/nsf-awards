 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching objective is to investigate responses of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions to variations in climate parameters, such as temperature and humidity.  BVOC emissions, particularly isoprene, exert an important direct influence on atmospheric chemistry and an indirect one on climate.  Increased BVOC emissions in a warmer climate can exacerbate regional ozone pollution and reinforce global warming.  However, future BVOC emissions are uncertain due to a lack of understanding of plant BVOC production and emissions' acclimatization to climate change.  The specific objectives are to: determine urban-rural response gradients due to growth environment, such as T, [CO2], and [O3]; relate trace gas exchange to physical and biophysical drivers, including seasonality; and provide adequate flux data to improve isoprene response and feedback modeling on larger scales.\r\n\r\nAlong four sites from central Houston to Sam Houston National Forest, biometeorological data, and [CO2] and [O3] will be recorded year-round.  In addition, auxiliary data on microclimates and soil parameters will be collected.  Local trees to be studied include five oak species, sweetgum, and loblolly pine.  Expected temperature and CO2 gradients along the study sites are of order 1 K and 20 ppm, respectively.  Controlled laboratory, branch-level experiments performed by undergraduate students will complement the field data. \r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted by undergraduate and graduate students.  Undergraduate students will assist with field, and perform their own laboratory measurements and analyses.  The high school program will involve teachers and students in research through jump starting related GLOBE program activities at the same schools we deploy the expanded weather stations measuring the climate and air quality gradient.  Teachers and students can work with these data directly, generate their own earth science data, and interact with researchers during field measurements and workshops.",

Urban areas are hotter, drier, and typically have higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, and ozone (Image 1). To study the effects this environment has on certain trees, we set up expanded weather stations and measured leaf-level physiology and isoprene (a natural hydrocarbon) emissions at three sites in the Houston metro area, one at a high school north of downtown Houston, one at a heavily wooded suburban junior high school, and one in Sam Houston National Forest. Through seasonal, and inter-annual leaf-level measurements (Image 2), including the drought year of 2011 (Image 3), we were able to show that significant urban-to-rural temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> gradients exist, and that urban trees have developed and responded characteristically differently to their rural counterparts of the same species. As expected, the studied urban oak and sweetgum trees developed earlier in spring and responded more sensitively to stress. Contrary to expectations, however, the urban trees were less photosynthetically active but emitted more isoprene than their suburban and rural equivalents. They also had a greater tolerance for higher temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> levels in that they maintained higher isoprene emission rates, a result confirmed in different measurement years and across species. We conclude that these isoprene-emitting trees may acclimatize to future warmer and higher CO<sub>2</sub> climates, but that their physiology and emissions may not respond in the expected manner. Since tree emissions of isoprene are critical for atmospheric chemistry, their expected future increases may have repercussions for air quality, possibly boosting atmospheric ozone and/or particle formation.</p>\n<p>To better understand possible feedbacks from environmental stresses such as drought and high ozone levels, we also studied individual 3-4 year old oak plants in a whole-plant chamber in the laboratory (Image 4). We found that drought stress strongly, and ozone stress mildly, reduced photosynthesis rates. However, neither affected the plants&rsquo; isoprene emissions significantly. As expected, only severe drought stress reduced isoprene emissions, confirming results obtained during our field measurements during the Texas 2011 drought, and supporting current emission modeling schemes. We conclude that neither future droughts, nor elevated ozone are likely to affect plant isoprene emissions, while they do reduce plant health and increase mortality. Isoprene emissions may alleviate plant oxidative stresses from drought and ozone but at high costs to growth. And if that is the case, vegetation emitting isoprene may remove less CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere in the future, but return as much or more carbon to the atmosphere in the form of isoprene.</p>\n<p>Over the life of the project, two postdoctoral scholars, two graduate students, and six undergraduate students performed and contributed to research and outreach. Work in urban Houston (Image 5) provided ample opportunities to interact with curious citizens and homeowners &ldquo;volunteering&rdquo; their trees for measurements. Although the planned involvement of high school students in the project was not accomplished, faculty, postdocs and graduated students cooperated with school teachers and the Forest Service, communicating research results and the broader scientific aspects of the study surrounding vegetation responses to global warming. A lasting outcome of the grant is an annual workshop educating teachers on climate change science and communication.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/21/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gunnar&nbsp;Schade</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513873222341_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513873222341_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513873222341_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A conceptual model of using urban areas to reflect physical conditions similar to expectations from global warming developments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Gunnar Schade</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gunnar&nbsp;Schade</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513812761352_IMG_1105b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513812761352_IMG_1105b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0955438/0955438_10013884_1513812761352_IMG_1105b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A drought-stressed oak tree in The Woodlands showing early senescence.
