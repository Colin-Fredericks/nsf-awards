The Center for Scientific Computing and Mathematical Modeling at the University of Maryland is hosting the workshop. In addition to Tadmor , the organizing committee consists of Victor Batista (Yale), Shi Jin (University of Wisconsin), and Millard Alexander (Maryland). \r\n\r\nThe aim of the meeting is to bring together a group of experts to examine the current state of development of numerical techniques and to foster interdisciplinary research in the development of computational methods at the interface of quantum and classical dynamics. The list of invited speakers is multi-disciplinary, international and very diverse. The workshop organizers actively encourage participation from graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty and members of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nFurther information may be found at  http://www.cscamm.umd.edu/programs/qcp10/",
