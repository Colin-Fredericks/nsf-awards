 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Seiichi P. Matsuda, Ronald J. Parry and colleagues from the Department of Chemistry at William Marsh Rice University will upgrade a 200 and a 500 MHz NMR spectrometers, both of which will have solid state capabilities. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) studies of the structure and reactivity of transition metals in organic chemistry; 2) analysis of the structures of complex nano and composite materials; 3) use of NMR techniques to understand and manage the Earth's carbon cycle; 4) biosynthetic studies of biologically active natural products; 5) investigations of graphene nanoribbons and derivatives; and 6) analysis of organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials and biochemistry.",
