Prof. El Sayed's research program focuses on the development of plasmonic nanocatalysts, a new generation of materials at the frontier of the field of chemical catalysis. Prof. El Sayed and his students will examine the effects of two new properties of nanoparticles on the rates of chemical and photo-chemical reactions: 1) the cage effect on the rates of chemical reactions when they occur inside a nano-cage and nano-frame type nanoparticle; 2) the effect of plasmonic fields and other properties of nanogold on the rates of some chemical and photochemical reactions. The project will provide excellent educational opportunity for trainees desiring to work at the forefront of catalysis research.",
