A flexible single-layer and environmentally-friendly barrier that has both inorganic and organic properties will be used to allow a much thinner barrier to be effective, thus significantly reducing the manufacturing costs.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of a cost-effective thin film encapsulation technology to enable a wide range of applications such as emerging display, imaging, battery and power generating technologies.  These applications require a flexible, low-cost, and mostly transparent, thin permeation barrier to prevent oxygen and moisture from causing degradation.  In this project, large-area scalability and ability to encapsulate devices made on flexible substrates will be addressed.",
