 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the important concepts that modern developmental biology studies have uncovered is that the structure and function of genes important for development are often very similar among animals, even in those as different as insects and mammals. How then do these same apparently well-conserved genes produce the great diversity of animal forms? \r\n\r\nThe insect wing is a fascinating developmental system to study this question, because of the impressive range of existing structures. The proposed research will compare wing development of two different insects, a flour beetle (Tribolium) and a fruit fly (Drosophila). These powerful insect genetic model systems differ dramatically in wing morphology. The regulatory basis of fly wing development is well described. In the proposed research, Dr. Tomoyasu will use a combination of genetic and developmental approaches to study wing development in beetles, and compare it with that of flies to understand the molecular basis of morphological evolution. \r\n\r\nDr. Tomoyasu's research has previously shown that changes in the function of a Hox gene (a class of genes that has many critical functions during development) may have contributed significantly to the diversity of insect wing forms. The current research is focused on studying the mode of Hox action in beetle wings, which will lead to a better understanding of how changes in Hox function have contributed to morphological evolution.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will enhance undergraduate science education through active participation of undergraduate students in the project. Exposure of students to an on-going research project will allow them to learn how to apply their knowledge to a scientific project, which will complement their classroom education. \r\n\r\nDr. Tomoyasu is a participant in the Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program at Miami University, an NSF-funded program to encourage underrepresented students to consider a career in science. Dr. Tomoyasu will actively recruit students to the proposed research through the URM program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Dr. Tomoyasu will work to popularize the use of Tribolium in genetics teaching laboratories at the secondary and undergraduate levels. Tribolium has several traits that make it an excellent model organism in teaching laboratories (ease of culture, available genetic tools, etc.). Through the proposed project, Dr. Tomoyasu will develop several Tribolium research protocols suitable for teaching laboratories.",
