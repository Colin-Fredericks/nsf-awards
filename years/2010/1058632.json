 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary: This EAGER project is to promote interdisciplinary research and education involving computing as a central component.  A community of people who have been successful in such efforts and who have an interest in discussing the best ways to promote and strengthen these is being gathered together to discuss this area of high national interest.  The eventual outcome of this effort is to create a home for such discussion and fill the need to have a national venue. The primary goal is to create connections among the stakeholders and help to develop a clear view of impediments they might face and determine what types of support and encouragements the interdisciplinary research and education community might need.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project is creating a space for discussions around interdisciplinary research and education. This is very important for the support of the scientific enterprise, both applied and research oriented.  Creating a common forum with viable communication channels among diverse fields will provide new opportunities for mutual enrichment and significant intellectual products.\r\nBroader Impacts: The most significant impact of this will be within the nascent communities of trans disciplinary scholars. Although we know of specific instances of valuable efforts, these communities frequently expend too much of their energy and effort in overcoming impediments rather than in advancing knowledge in their combined fields. The specific results of this project will depend on what the members of the community decide, but possible results could include a new conference series, new publications, and new online communities designed specifically for these needs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWithin the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in interdisciplinary studies, especially in the sciences, to address the complexity of pressing global problems.  This report is addresses interdisciplinary computing: an emerging focus for scholars and educators both within and surrounding the computing sciences. In the science domains we see the dominance of big data, and the emergence of the Fourth Paradigm [Hey-6].  In fields as diverse as music, astronomy, anthropology, psychology, and modern languages we see reliance on machine learning to categorize, classify, and make decisions.  These fields rely not only on computing power, but also on the computing techniques and problem solving approaches that direct that power to solve big problems.  The reliance is not unidirectional, however.  Computing researchers who become immersed in these domains learn from the approaches that have been used to address problems at different scales.  They learn subtleties of problem solving requirements that may influence new algorithms with broad applicability.  They may learn classification approaches, user interface requirements, and necessary heuristics from best practices and research-based analysis.  The integration of computing and other disciplines benefits both fields.\n\nOver three years in four meetings of researchers, educators and practitioners currently engaged in some form of interdisciplinary computing, a picture emerged of how to support a climate of interdisciplinary computing.  The meetings were inspired by an NSF session at SIGCSE 2010 and meeting outcomes were elucidated at two subsequent ACM SIGCSE presentations. Our NSF funded exploration of this topic brought together researchers and industry representatives from fields as diverse as music, astronomy and journalism as well as other sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities.  The result was a greater understanding of the ways in which computing interrelates with many others, offering benefits to all contributors.  \n\nThese include:\n\nCreating an online community that invites in a broad constituency\nSmall-scale funding for start-up initiatives in both research and teaching\nCross-institutional initiatives to support sustainability\nWorkshops that focus on:\n\n\nMentoring: Faculty and administrators who have successfully implemented interdisciplinary computing work with representatives of institutions who are exploring how to support interdisciplinary computing.  Outcome is a report for the latter.\n\nEvaluation: Faculty and administrators who are in the process of implementing interdisciplinary computing collaborate to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their initiatives. Outcome is a set of reports, one for each participating institution.\n\nVisions: Faculty and administrators who have been successful, but want to extend the reach of, or sustain interdisciplinary computing, brainstorm novel approaches. Outcome is a single report that with individual addenda focused on how the local institution can implement and impact the vision.\n\nThese recommendations are predicated on insights that emerged during the first three meetings:\n\nNo field of inquiry in the 21st century extends its knowledge without the influence of computing.\nInterdisciplinary computing is inherently collaborative between computing specialists and specialists in other fields. It is not merely pair-wise: computational-X or Y-informatics, but often the collaboration draws from a number of fields.\nThe mundane concerns of intellectual ownership, boundaries on the discipline (e.g. silos), professional advancement, financial support, and institutional buy-in can diminish the pure intellectual joy that is evident in existing interdisciplinary work. \nImpediments are encountered in making the effective collaborations that are essential for the advancement of all the disciplines.  The computing disciplines are essential to and also dependent on nearly all other branches of intellectual discovery.\n\n\nT..."
