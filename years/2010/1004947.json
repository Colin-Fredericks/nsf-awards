 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Oregon State University. The program will support eighteen students/year during a ten week summer research program with 9 interns located on the Oregon coast at Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon and 9 interns in the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences (COAS) at the main OSU campus in Corvallis. The major field for this REU site is broadly defined as marine science, ranging from diverse biological and ecological topics (focused at HMSC) through the physical sciences (marine aspects of physics, geology, chemistry, and atmospheric science at COAS). The major objectives of the REU program are to i) provide students with the opportunity to experience research in marine science and an understanding of its interdisciplinary nature; ii) provide students with a unique educational opportunity and exposure to a wide range of marine science; and iii) increase participation in and access to marine studies for under-represented groups. Interns have directed research projects, a required report and oral presentation, and are encouraged to present at regional or national meetings. Additional activities include seminar series, field sampling, interaction with graduate students and related intern programs, career development training, scientific ethics discussions, and exchanges to learn about other interdisciplinary research conducted in Oregon's diverse environments.\r\n\r\nThe site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
