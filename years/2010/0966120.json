The program targets baccalaureate majors in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering technology and mathematics at Missouri Western State University (MWSU).  By providing extensive student support to awardees, including cohort building through and online virtual community and through common course work, learning communities, peer study groups, study sessions, a brown bag lunch series, an annual orientation program, and intensive mentoring, MAP is achieving the following programmatic objectives:  1) improved accessibility to MWSU education resources, 2) increased financial support, 3) enhanced retention through graduation, and 4) increased placement of students in applied learning opportunities with regional employers.",
