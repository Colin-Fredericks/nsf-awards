 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorado State University is awarded a grant to develop machine learning methods for predicting protein function.  The availability of protein function annotations supports the everyday work of biologists in multiple areas---from biomedical discovery to the study of plant drought resistance, and the design of bacteria useful in biofuel production.  Assigning function to proteins in sequenced genomes is a major undertaking, and with new organisms being sequenced daily, experimentally determining the function of all the proteins in those organisms is not practical, requiring computational assignment of function to proteins that have not been studied in the lab.  Computational scientists have been considering the problem of function prediction for over two decades.  Yet, the basic methodology for protein function prediction has not changed much during this time and remains that of \"annotation transfer\" from proteins with a known function using a method for sequence comparison such as BLAST.  Protein function prediction has several properties that make it difficult to apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to this problem, such as the large number of potential functions (thousands of possible terms), the fact that proteins can have multiple functions, and the hierarchical relationship between terms in the Gene Ontology (GO), which is the standard system of keywords used to describe protein function.  In this work the problem of annotating proteins with GO terms will be explicitly modeled as a hierarchical classification problem using the methodology of \"kernel methods for structured outputs\", which allows the modeling of complex prediction problems.  This methodology will allow the PIs to integrate a variety of genomic information - sequence data, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and information mined from the biological literature.  The award will lead to a function prediction method with state-of-the-art accuracy.  The project will have broad impact by providing the GOstruct method to the bioinformatics and biology communities in the form of downloadable software and an online-accessible function prediction server. Education will be impacted through the incorporation of the tool into new courses in programming for biologists and on kernel methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe problem of computationally assigning function to proteins is a key problem in bioinformatics.  It is challenging for several reasons:  a protein can have multiple functions, and the system of keywords used to describe protein function, the Gene Ontology (GO), has a complex hierarchical structure and contains thousands of terms.  This provides genome annotators with a rich vocabulary with which to describe protein function, but makes it sub-optimal to use standard machine learning approaches.  In the course of this award we developed a method called GOstruct.  GOstruct leverages advanced machine learning techniques that allowed us to model the full complexity of this prediction problem, and has been demonstrated to have state-of-the-art performance.  Another advantage of our approach is its modularity and ability to handle a variety of relevant data:  networks of functional relationships including protein protein interactions and coexpression networks, sequence similarity and other sequence-based features.\n\nIn recent years the function prediction community has initiated an effort for assessment of function prediction methods in a competition called CAFA (Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation).  GOstruct was one of the top performing methods in the first round of CAFA, and we continue to develop it following insights we had as a result of a comparative study of protein function prediction assessment protocols.\n\nAn important component of our approach was the incorporation of large scale data mined from the biomedical literature.  Published papers contain a wealth of information about various aspects of protein function; however, this information is unstructured and hard to extract automatically.  Even figuring out which protein is being discussed is difficult, as protein naming is ambiguous; the situation is even worse for describing its function.  Our collaborators/co-awardees at CU Denver and University of Melbourne developed a natural language processing pipeline that detects co-occurrences of protein names and descriptions of function in biomedical text.  This pipeline yielded over 30 million potential mentions of protein function that were provided to GOstruct to sift through, yielding performance that is on par with other sources of data commonly used for function prediction.  This is one of the first efforts at using large scale literature data for function prediction.  \n\nComplex ontologies are common in bioinformatics; another example is the human phenotype ontology (HPO), which is a newly developed ontology that provides a vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities associated with human disease.  We have demonstrated that the GOstruct methodology we have developed in this project is applicable to prediction of HPO terms, with better performance than several baselines.  This problem has not been addressed before so our experiments provide a useful benchmark for this problem.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Asa Ben-Hur"
