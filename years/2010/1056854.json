 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supported by this award is a two-day conference, \"Tradition, Innovation, and Creativity: Undergraduate Education for the 21st Century.\"  The conference will take place in Crystal City, Virginia on November 12 and 13, 2010. It is the fifth national meeting sponsored by the Reinvention Center, a unique educational consortium of research universities committed to improving undergraduate education. The Reinvention Center, housed at the University of Miami, is comprised of 63 dues-paying member institutions, each represented by its Undergraduate Vice President or Vice Provost (UVP). These educators constitute the UVP Network, which is the Reinvention Center's core. An elected Board and an executive director work with the UVP Network to determine priorities and activities.  \r\nThe 2010 National Conference will explore how innovation and creativity, which are both the means and ends of research, are transforming undergraduate education in American research universities. The focus is on state-of-the-art or recently tested approaches to learning, particularly those that have achieved success through new collaborations across and among academic fields and institutions. The conference takes up this theme in three broad educational areas: Science and Technology, Performing Arts, and Learning Inside and Outside the Classroom. The conference agenda emphasizes programs entailing engineering and the performing arts because their pragmatic and experiential approaches are broadly applicable to undergraduate education in general. As part of the Center's ongoing work on assessment, its newly formed Assessment Network will also report on its initial results and accomplishments. \r\nSpecific conference objectives include promoting innovation and creativity as a means of improving undergraduate education; exploring successful programs of integrated learning, particularly in science and the arts; examining exemplary models of interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration in the STEM disciplines, engineering, and the arts; increasing appreciation of the relevance and potential of multimedia and experiential learning inside and outside the classroom for innovating and improving undergraduate education; and exhibiting improvements in assessment practices developed by the Center's Assessment Network, with a special focus on writing as a means of strengthening and assessing learning in STEM and other disciplines. \r\nThe conference will consist of four plenary and at least 20 topical sessions structured to maximize interaction among participants. By using successful and fresh educational models from diverse fields to illustrate how innovation, creativity, and intellectual integration can improve undergraduate learning, participants will be drawn into the national conversation about intellectual pursuits. \r\nThe conference will have broad impact because 1) attending UVPs are uniquely positioned to adapt the conference's content to their home institutions, 2) the Center will publish its results in Proceedings and on its website, 3) past conferences have had substantial impact, and 4) subsequent UVP meetings will take up aspects of the program in detail.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "NSF Project Outcomes Report for the General Public\nSubmitted by \nPatricia A. Turner, Ph.D., Executive Director of the Reinvention Center\n\nIn response to a mid 1990s report on the status of undergraduate education at research universities, the Reinvention Center was organized so that faculty and administrators from America\u00c6s most competitive campuses could better collaborate on state of the art teaching techniques and other strategies to ensure that the very best students in the nation were getting the best possible education.  In addition to on-line tools such as list serves and websites, the Center brings together its members so that they can share best practices and demonstrate to one another cutting edge teaching resources.  Each conference program is an iterative one, that is to say, the evaluations submitted by those who participated in the 2008 conference were used to shape the program for the 2010 conference. \n\nTradition, Innovation, and Creativity: Undergraduate Learning for the 21st Century, with partial support from the National Science Foundation, was held in Crystal City, Virginia on November 12-13 in 2010.  Featuring four keynote addresses and 21 break out panels, the conference provide a one-stop shopping experience for faculty and administrators on the front lines in their home universities. \n\nIt is often the case that the demands of teaching and research that are so keenly felt on campuses leads to faculty left with little time to contemplate the public welfare.  The conference evaluations suggest that both old-timers and newcomers to the conference left refreshed, re-energized, and ready to apply relevant aspects of what they had learned to their home institutions and in their lives as citizens. To cite just one of many examples, several presentations at the meeting focused on the increasingly sophisticated tools that can be used to construct writing assignments that will measure student learning in the sciences.   Faculty members from other campuses learn about these tools at the Reinvention Center conference, take them back to their home campuses to share with other teaching faculty and, as a result, students benefit.  These students then make their way into graduate school or employment and the advantages of having had state of the art instruction are disseminated to a much larger public.  At the K-12 level, science education is losing ground to other countries that are placing a high priority on these disciplines.   The Reinvention Center is committed to sustaining the highest possible standards at research universities.\n\nOther findings include:\n\nExternal forces, e.g. rise of for-profits, fluctuations in private and public support, are having a significant influence on research universities.\nThe academic study of creativity has contributed to the development of concrete approaches that can be deployed to teach students how to be more creative.\nAttrition in engineering programs can be mitigated by the development of more hands-on lower division courses.\nStudents are eager to participate in credit-bearing activities that take them off campus.\nBoth public and private research universities are confronting consumer-oriented students and parents.\nThe expectations of accrediting agencies are requiring a sizeable investment.\nMany of the Boyer commission recommendations are now every day practices at research universities.\nBy focusing on the entire student trajectory (K-12 to graduate school), science and engineering departments can increase students who select STEM fields for college majors and decrease the migration of STEM majors to other fields.\n\n In terms of the last finding bulleted above, the University of Texas at Austin hosted a follow up meeting on April 29, 2011.  There participants were able to learn from colleagues in Texas and New Mexico about their successful strategies for connecting the pathways between high school, community college, research university and graduate school.
