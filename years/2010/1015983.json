 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biocomputing systems are being researched for multi-stage information processing in applications ranging from novel biosensors, to signaling and fast decision making in cases of trauma/injury, implantable devices, biofuel cells, and ultimately, interfacing of living organisms with Si electronics. This research program aims at advancing experimental design and theoretical modeling/optimization of primarily enzyme-based logic gates, as well as developing a toolbox of non-Boolean and bio-inspired network elements. Approaches will be developed for realizing interconnected networks, as well as for interfacing biochemical logic with bioelectronic systems. Models will be devised for improving the performance of biochemical logic networks in terms of noise reduction, robustness, fault-tolerance, and scalability, for information processing applications. \r\n\r\nThus, the present project will advance the basic science of scaling up information processing with biomolecules, primarily, with enzymes, beyond single gates to multi-element networks. The research plan involves both experimental investigations of enzyme-based biochemical gates and their networking as well as theoretical analysis of the concepts and results. Experimental aspects of the work will include the selection and networking of enzymatic systems performing logic processing of biochemical signals at various levels of complexity. The theoretical part will encompass optimization and computer simulation of the biocomputing systems to ensure their stable and fault-tolerant operation. We will specifically address noise reduction and robustness of biomolecular information processing systems.\r\n\t \t\r\nBiocomputing elements of even moderate complexity will allow effective interfacing between complex physiological systems and nanostructured materials and/or electronic devices. Thus, the broader impacts of this research will include the advancement of a new emerging technological paradigm: Networking of information processing stages that involve biochemical processes. We aim at taking out the wires and batteries, and reducing the overall need for electrical power supplies at those stages of information processing that are carried out on-site in implantable devices and other biotechnology applications, as well as contributing to the advancement of novel biosensor concepts. Significant educational impact will be achieved by training of postdocs and educating Ph.D. students, offering undergraduate research projects, K-12 outreach, and developing new coursework.",
