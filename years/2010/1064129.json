The work proposed here will tests a new\r\nmeans of re-engineering OLEDs for improved thermal performance based on the implementation of a direct, high resolution thermal imaging technique capable of measuring temperature profiles with a fine spatial and thermal resolution across the light-emitting surface of OLEDs.\r\n\r\nBroader impact:\r\n\r\nWe envision a long-term overall goal of engineering organic and quantum dot photonic devices for improved  performance. This proposal will significantly enhance the infrastructure for research and education at Mt Holyoke College, by creating a novel facility for the fabrication of organic and nanoscale optoelectronic devices.",
