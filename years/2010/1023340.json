 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sitting Bull College (SBC) STEM programs are poised to make dramatic impacts in producing Native American scientists. Major academic enhancements and increases in student enrollment programs have been established directly through the current TCUP grant and because of foundation provided by TCUP-supported activities. We propose a comprehensive initiation plan to build on our existing strengths through innovative programs, outreach, and a focus on research and technology education. The SBC TCUP project will directly affect 90 Undergraduate Researchers, 75 community professionals, 75 middle school students and 15 middle school teachers, five faculty members, one administrative person, two laboratory technicians, one secretarial position, and numerous students enrolling in SBC STEM courses.\r\nTo address emerging and established needs of our students and community, we propose the following goals (1) to enhance student abilities with scientific research methodologies through increasing research skills by providing authentic research opportunities by fully integrating student research into STEM courses, (2) to provide the community with a technologically-advanced workforce by producing cohorts of graduates with advanced training in biotechnology, pollution science, geospatial technology, GeoSciences, and wildlife conservation and training local professionals, K-12 teachers, and community members in applied science, and (3) to increase interest in STEM fields by a wider variety of students through innovative recruitment and retention programs (including Middle School Science Academy), increased online curricula, cohort building activities, a Native Science track, and investigating a Master?s Program.",

Each sophomore student, senior student, and graduate student was provided guidance from his/her research advisor during the curriculum-required research project.&nbsp; In total, 32 students conducted research during the 2016-17 academic year as a part of their curricular requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to curriculum-required research, seven SBC students chose to conduct scientific research during the summer months.&nbsp; Four students conducted research on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation examining the ecology of lands in and around bison pastures.&nbsp; Three students participated in the Native Undergraduate Tropical Research Opportunity (NUTRO) program in Costa Rica.&nbsp; The three research topics conducted by NUTRO students included; macroinvertebrate diversity and chemistry in anthropogenic water systems, microclimate comparisons within iguana habitats, and daily movement patterns of iguanas in tropical dry forest biomes.&nbsp; One science faculty member from SBC advised students with their projects during the three week NUTRO program.</p>\n<p>SBC continued to offer the graduate program in environmental science in fulfillment of the second goal of the grant; to provide the community with a technologically-advanced workforce.&nbsp;Two students were accepted into the college's second graduate cohort.&nbsp; One of the graduate students is advancing toward his master of science (M.S.) degree in environmental science, and is schedule to graduate within two years of beginning the program, which is the goal of the cohort plan.</p>\n<p>SBC was very&nbsp;successful in reaching the&nbsp;third goal of the grant.&nbsp; The third goal is to increase interest in STEM fields by including a wider variety of students.&nbsp; This goal of the grant involves the participation of area junior high school students in science-related activities on a monthly basis at SBC in a program called \"Sunday Academy\".&nbsp; The program has active participation from over 20 junior high school students each month.&nbsp; In total,&nbsp;115 students&nbsp;participated in the Sunday Academy program during the grant reporting period.&nbsp; There was also&nbsp;one SBC science faculty member,&nbsp;four area K-12 teachers, and one graduate student&nbsp;involved in helping with the Sunday Academy program.&nbsp; In addition to the Sunday Academy program, SBC hosted its third annual Summer Science Academy for junior high school students.&nbsp; The Summer Science Academy had 34 junior high school students participate in hands-on learning of scientific methodologies in a week-long summer camp session.&nbsp; At the completion of the camp, students presented findings from their research.&nbsp;&nbsp;One science faculty member from SBC and&nbsp;three mentors from SBC and area K-12 schools&nbsp;were involved in assisting and advising students with their research projects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/12/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Koreen&nbsp;Ressler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1023340/1023340_10020885_1520884728292_GraduateResearch--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1023340/1023340_10020885_1520884728292_GraduateResearch--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduate Student Conducts Winter Aquatics Study\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1023340/1023340_10020885_1520884728292_GraduateResearch--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate Student Conducts Winter Aquatics Study\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Clayton Lupe, SBC student in the Master of Science Program, conducted winter research on a lake in North Central North Dakota as part of the limnology course in which he was enrolled.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dan Buresh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Koreen&nbsp;Ressler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduate Student Conducts Winter Aquatics Study</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1023340/1023340_10020885_1442502856410_JuniorHighSummerScienceCamp2015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1023340/1023340_10020885_1442502856410_JuniorHighSummerScienceCamp2015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Junior High School Summer Science Academy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1023340/1023340_10020885_1442502856410_JuniorHighSummerScienceCamp2015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Junior High School Summer Science Academy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Junior High School students from Standing Rock communities participate in the 4th Annual Summer Science Academy.
