The PIs propose that STEM content provided through electronic media will be more readily accepted by youth because it is on their \"home turf.\"  IMX.org will be a new, highly engaging, online destination for tweens and kids at large. It is designed to leverage the Web 2.0 and tweens' fascination with media and popular culture, and to demonstrate the connections between the real world, everyday life, and STEM. The project will test a preliminary design with a focus group of 8-12 year-olds, convene a panel of experts and Advisory Board, and create a beta Web site to conduct formative research.",

NSF supported this early concept with a planning grant in July 2010 to develop a beta site.\n\nIMX was intended to be a transformative project with these intended impacts:\n\nTo inspire and motivate young learners, particularly 8- to 12-year-olds, and help them recognize that science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are full of creativity and wonder and offer powerful ways to look at the world.\nTo leverage innovative technology to motivate this target audience to become \"active\" participants in STEM. \nTo help children identify themselves as young scientists, engineers, mathematicians, technologists, and explorers.\nTo establish a new digital destination of exciting and relevant STEM content and grow a networked community that will build upon itself. \nTo provide a resource that is widely disseminated to children and also readily accessible to educators and the world at large.\n\n\nThe objectives for the 2010 Planning Grant were to:\n\nCreate preliminary designs      for a prototype Website (IMX.me) for purposes of research and testing      only;\nEstablish an Advisory      Board to inform project development and future planning;\nConduct formative      research; and\nContinue to monitor trends      in digital media and technology, and explore possible partners or      collaborators for the future.\n\n\nAll of the above was completed by December 2011. The prototype site was developed solely for purposes of research and testing, thus contains a limited set of live features, i.e., no live \"chats\" (only graphical indicators or icons) nor online communications. Features include:\n\nVideos\n\nThe IMX home page features an assortment of compelling viral video clips, chosen for their general appeal as well as potential connections to STEM concepts. The page has nine clickable video links, with the intention that IMX would launch with fifty video clips, but as an ever-changing, organic community, new videos would be premiered on a regular basis.\n\nThe Big Questions\n\nThe Wingsuit video was chosen to be representative of the IMX experience, in which each clip would be followed by a short animation in which our IMX host ponders some STEM-related questions, and entices the viewer to consider his or her own.\n\nInquiry Modules\n\nEach question leads to one of six INQUIRY MODULES, greeting users in these re-occurring and recognizable formats: click-through comics, interactive graphics, science demonstrations or activities, mini-games, career-related profiles, and the IMX Lab.\n\nThe IMX Lab\n\nXplorers are encouraged to begin and continue their adventures at MY IMX, where they can add virtual partners to their team of scientists; work collaboratively as they embark on scientific inquiries; tap into expert advice; and help their colleagues explore their investigations.\n\nIMX Webisodes\n\nThe IMX home page also featured visuals of a planned series of live-action Webisodes. In the planning grant phase, we tested two original concepts, Beyond Biodome and Survivors. Both had high appeal, and we believe this format will be particularly appealing to girls and also entice Xplorers to return to the site regularly.\n\nThe IMX Advisory Board formed in 2011 is a group of highly-respected, industry experts. Each member has agreed to remain on the panel for this proposal and future development of the project.\n\nFormative research was completed in December 2011. Below are key findings, conclusions and implications from the report released by MediaKidz Research &amp; Consulting on January 5, 2012: \n\nThe appeal of IMX.me was quite strong. IMX\u00c6s appeal held constant across boys and girls, different age groups, and children who had more or less positive attitudes toward science.\nThe children\u00c6s favorite part of IMX was the Lab.
