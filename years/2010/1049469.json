ISWC \r\nis a major international forum where visionary and state-of-the-art research on \r\nall aspects of the Semantic Web is presented. Priority will be given to students\r\n selected to participate in the doctoral consortium, followed by students who are \r\nfirst author on a paper accepted at the conference, followed by students who have \r\nother authorship on a conference or related workshop paper. The purpose of this \r\nproject is to allow students to share their research ideas, receive constructive \r\nfeedback, and develop connections that will enhance their research careers. The \r\nproject is expected to support between 10 and 15 students. \r\n\r\nFurther information can be found at the web page:\r\nhttp://iswc2010.semanticweb.org/travel-awards",
