 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants, plant-feeding insects, and insect-feeding wasps and flies (known as parasitoids) are central components of terrestrial forest ecosystems. These plants and insects represent more than half of all described organisms in the world and comprise a larger proportion of undiscovered tropical species. This project consists of an intensive plant, caterpillar, and parasitoid insect inventory at the Yanayacu Biological Station (YBS) in the Ecuadorian Andes. The objectives are: 1) to sample and catalog the diverse community of caterpillars and associated parasitoid insects at YBS to discover new species and understand interactions between species; 2) to disseminate this information with a searchable database accessible to scientists and the public throughout the world; and 3) to discover natural history information, such as caterpillar diets, development times, and what insects feed upon specific herbivores and plants. Such information is used to test hypotheses about how diversity evolved and how it affects variables such as ecosystem stability, forest productivity, or ecosystem services. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this activity includes significant advances in insect classification by naming new species, developing identification guides, providing specimens with associated molecular data to experts, as well as providing a critical inventory that can be used in conservation efforts in the equatorial Andes (a global hot-spot of biodiversity). These data will also be used to address a variety of basic and applied questions, particularly those associated with climate change and biodiversity. The broader impacts of this project include direct involvement of multiple local field assistants, senior scientists, postdoctoral researchers, collaborating insect specialists, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Therefore the project strengthens international scientific dialogue and relationships. The project includes enhancements in science education and research experience programs for minorities.",

A total of 12 classrooms (250 students) participated in May 2013.  The biodiversity study took place in four ecosystems:  cloud forest in Ecuador; broadleaf deciduous forest in New York and Ohio; grasslands in Wyoming; and tundra in Alaska.  Each site surveyed the insect communities of three 3 meter x 3 meter plots.   Photographs were taken of each insect found at each site.  In May 2014, the program was expanded to include participating classrooms and teachers in Florida, India, and Australia.\n\nOur work on the discovery of new parasitoid wasps and their host caterpillars in Ecuador is providing basic knowledge of the interactions of predatory wasps and plant-feeding insects, which in turn shape the distribution of cloud forest plants.  This knowledge may be used by forest scientists, ecologists, students, taxonomists, biocontrol wor..."
