 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator proposes to study the mapping class group and its various normal finitely generated subgroups. The project comprises three main parts.  There is a well-known dictionary for translating results for the special linear group over the integers into conjectures for the mapping class group. In the first part of the project the Principal Investigator aims to further this connection by studying homological questions surrounding an important object associated to the mapping class group called the curve complex which is analogous to the Tits building for the special linear group.  An important subgroup of the mapping class group is the Torelli group which one may view as the difference between the mapping class group and arithmetic groups such as the special linear group. The second part of the project aims to reprove Johnson's finite generation of the Torelli group from a geometric perspective.  The Principal Investigator sees this as a step towards a possible finite presentation for the Torelli group. The third part of the project looks at the geometry of various finitely generated normal subgroups of the Torelli group.\r\n\r\nTwo-dimensional surfaces are fundamental mathematical objects that appear throughout mathematics, physics, and other sciences.  In mathematics surface symmetries are a key ingredient in the construction and understanding of three-dimensional objects.  In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, surfaces arise as paths of strings in space-time called \"worldsheets.\" Surface symmetries have even arisen in the work of Jack Cowan (University of Chicago) on understanding how images are processed by the visual cortex in the human brain.  Symmetries of surfaces have been studied mathematically since at least the time of Euclid's Elements, but their modern study has developed rapidly over the past century.  The Principle Investigator proposes a study of symmetries of surfaces from three points of view. Firstly, the Principal Investigator intends to further a well-known analogy between symmetries of surfaces and symmetries of multidimensional grids (the latter having a well-developed theory of their own).  In the second and third parts of the project the Principal Investigator intends to investigate a particularly mysterious collection of surface symmetries called the Torelli group which one may view as the difference between symmetries of surfaces and symmetries of multidimensional grids.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project has been to understand certain properties of mapping class groups of surfaces and to explore one the many similarities that it has with the groups of invertible integral matrices.  Briefly, the sets of transformations of mathematical objects assemble into a general structure called a \"group.\"  For instance, the symmetries of an equilateral triangle form a group with six elements.  The transformation group of a sphere is much larger (in fact infinite).  Somewhere in between we have the mapping class group of a surface which is infinite but composed of compositions of a finite number of basic transformations.  This mapping class group is an essential part of our understanding of 2-dimensional spaces.\n\nThe mapping class group of a surface is a good object on which to develop a more general understanding of group theory.  Along with its importance for constructions in topology, it has many similarities to groups of interest in number theory such SL(n,Z), the group of invertible integer matrices. The major motivation of this project has been to better understand the relationship between duality groups (such as the mapping class group and SL(n,Z) and their dualizing modules.  In particular this project has aimed to take certain ideas from the study of groups like SL(n,Z) and replicate them for mapping class groups.\n\nThe group SL(n,Z) acts as a group of symmetries for a space called the spherical Tits building which one can view as a collection of infinitely many balloons glued together into a bunch.   The homology of the spherical Tits building is the dualizing module for SL(n,Z).  The analog for the mapping class group of the spherical Tits building is the curve complex.  In previous work the principal investigator identified a nontrivial class in the homology of the curve complex for certain surfaces.  One may think of this as isolating a single \"balloon\" from the curve complex \"bunch\".\n\nDuring the current project, the principal investigator and coauthors have been able to expand the list of mapping class groups for which they can identify a nontrivial class in the homology of the appropriate curve complex.  Moreover, they have simplified the description of the original nontrivial class from his previous work.   The principal investigator is currently engaged in a collaboration to complete the list of surfaces for which this can be done.\n\nAs the principal investigator better understands the structure of the dualizing module of the mapping class group, that is, the homology of the curve complex, he hopes demonstrate its potential as object from which to compute many important algebraic invariants of mapping class groups (or more general classes of duality groups) and their finite index subgroups.\n\nThe funds for this project have supported the following activities:\n\nThe revision and publication of the principal investigator's paper \"Homology of the curve complex and the Steinberg module of the mapping class group\".\nThe development of a collaboration between the principal investigator, J.
