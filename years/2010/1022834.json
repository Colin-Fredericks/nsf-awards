 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborators from five institutions will work to build and deploy an Arctic Ocean network of rugged and autonomous buoys (named ?O-Buoys?) capable of observing atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 and oceanic pCO2 for a period of up to 5 years (with each O-Buoy being operational for up to 2 years). The original O-Buoy project funded by NSF included design and testing of the O-Buoy. In the current project, 11 new O-Buoys will be constructed and deployed along with the four already built. As a pilot project, two of the new O-Buoys will include seawater sensors for CO2, oxygen, temperature and salinity in addition to the atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 sensors. Throughout the project, data from each O-Buoy will be subject to QA/QC protocols by automated processing initially, with preliminary data available on a regular basis on the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (CADIS) site. All final data and metadata will be ultimately archived on CADIS after final analysis at the end of each deployment. This network of O-Buoys, coordinated and clustered with other buoys in automated drifting stations, will enable the scientific community to first observe and, next, better understand the impact of Arctic surface change on atmospheric composition and chemistry. Outreach to local K-8 schools will include an ?Adopt-a-Buoy? program. Video footage from deployments/recoveries and interviews with colleagues and native Arctic people will be contributed to the ongoing http://www.arcticstories.net site, and activities and results will be communicated via the O-Buoy web site.",

These changes are profoundly affecting the physical, biological, and chemical properties of the ocean &ndash; ice &ndash; atmosphere system. The Arctic Ocean is an austere and hostile environment that is remote and difficult to access. These conditions make any observation difficult, but pose particular difficulties for autonomous sensors. Most long-term Arctic atmospheric observations, and in particular most chemical concentration data, have been collected at terrestrial bases around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean, mostly leaving Arctic Ocean locations without any observations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We thus built 11 atmospheric chemistry O-Buoys, with the latest in power management, instrumentation, and instrumentation control to develop a robust, unattended (that is, not serviced), self-contained, weather-tight, self-powered, ice-tethered buoy, to produce unprecedented data. Together with 4 existing O-Buoys (2 previously funded by NSF and 2 by Canada IPY), they were deployed in the Beaufort Gyre (13), the East Siberian Sea (3), and at or near the North Pole (2) for a total of 18 deployments (including three recovery/re-deployments).&nbsp; They were built to operate for up to 2 years; the average deployment length was 1 year, two O-Buoys sampled for over 2 years, while some deployments were intentionally shorter to enable recovery and redeployment. Our focus was on the measurement of three important gases, bromine monoxide (BrO), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as well as weather data.&nbsp; O<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are two of the most important greenhouse gases in our planet, yet with very few observations in the very cold Arctic Ocean region.&nbsp; Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> causes ocean acidification that has already been detected in the Arctic Ocean.&nbsp; BrO causes extraordinary ozone decreases and mercury deposition that occurs during polar springtime, with attendant significant implications for human and ecosystem health in the Arctic region.&nbsp; This atmospheric chemistry O-Buoy has enhanced the capability of the Arctic Observing Network to quantify seasonal and interannual variability in a fast changing and highly regionally variable ice field.</p>\n<p>We deployed an Arctic Ocean network of O-Buoys to observe atmospheric O<sub>3</sub>, BrO, and CO<sub>2</sub> over the full annual cycle, producing high quality data at climatically important, but logistically dangerous, locations.&nbsp; Daily data transmissions were by satellite communication from the O-Buoys to a home ftp site where raw data were archived and displayed for immediate observation. Throughout the project, data from the O-Buoys were initially quality-controlled by automated processing, with preliminary data available on a regular basis.&nbsp; At the end of each deployment, data were re-processed and submitted to the NSF Arctic Data Center. In addition, position and meteorological data were submitted to the World Meteorological Organization&rsquo;s Global Telecommunication System in near-real time for weather prediction and model validation. The data collected by this network of O-Buoys, coordinated and clustered with other buoys in automated drifting stations, is allowing the scientific community to first observe and, next, better understand how changes in Arctic sea ice extent, thickness and surface affects atmospheric chemical composition and processes.</p>\n<p>We shared the technology development, buoy assembly deployment opportunities and/or data quality control process with undergraduate and graduate students as well as with one Postdoctoral Fellow.

Technical and engineering staff developed and/or adapted skills on instrumentation deployed in extremely cold conditions as well as in control and analysis software. We shared developments and results with the broader scientific community via many presentations at scientific meetings or by invitation (37 presentations over 6 years). We also shared with the broader community by implementing an &ldquo;Adopt a Buoy&rdquo; program in local K-8 schools; by comparing Arctic and Maine weather data with students and teachers from Maine&rsquo;s rural island elementary schools and communities; by participating in career days; by giving talks whenever and wherever we were invited to in our 5 states (ME, NH, IN, AK, CA); and by interacting with policy makers on the relevance of Arctic processes to the rest of our planet. Finally, interviews with colleagues and native Arctic people as well as a film on ice and climate were contributed to Arctic Stories (http://www.arcticstories.net). Our data and photographs taken by the O-Buoy cameras were followed by many websites, such as the forum for Arctic Sea Ice, blogs, radio programs, and newsletters in the US and overseas.&nbsp; Most importantly, this exceptional 8-year data set enabled discovery about the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of atmospheric chemistry above the sea ice, as described in multiple publications.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Patricia&nbsp;A&nbsp;Matrai</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511981844086_obuoyfigforAONabstract--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511981844086_obuoyfigforAONabstract--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ice-tethered O-Buoy system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511981844086_obuoyfigforAONabstract--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ice-tethered O-Buoy system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">O-Buoy deployed in Arctic sea ice and O-Buoy tracks for 15 deployments during 2010-2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Patricia Matrai</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Patricia&nbsp;A&nbsp;Matrai</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ice-tethered O-Buoy system</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511983705788_O-BuoydeploymentforNSFProjectOutcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511983705788_O-BuoydeploymentforNSFProjectOutcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"O-Buoy deployment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1022834/1022834_10039186_1511983705788_O-BuoydeploymentforNSFProjectOutcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"O-Buoy deployment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">O-Buoys were deployed by helicopter or by icebreaker crane (not shown) into a hole drilled into a sufficiently thick ice floe.
