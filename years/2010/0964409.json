 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies higher-level abstractions for constructing distributed\r\nsystems that integrate information and computation across administrative and\r\ntrust domains. Current practice does not offer general, principled techniques\r\nfor implementing these systems securely. To develop these techniques,\r\nfundamental problems of security, consistency, performance, and system\r\nevolution are being explored. Problems studied include automatic, adaptive,\r\nsecure partitioning of programs and data across the nodes of a distributed\r\nsystem; new authorization logics for efficiently managing trust\r\nrelationships in a distributed system; new methods for increasing\r\nperformance of distributed systems while guaranteeing strong data\r\nconsistency; and new ways to securely and consistently evolve the structure\r\nof persistent information.\r\n\r\nThese topics are being studied in the context of Fabric, a new platform for\r\nsecure distributed computation. Fabric is intended to support secure\r\nintegration of information systems, a valuable capability for many application\r\ndomains, including in medicine, finance, education, government, and the\r\nmilitary.  For example, good methods for integrating distributed information\r\nsystems would support secure sharing of medical records between institutions.",
