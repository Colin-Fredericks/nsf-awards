In particular, the award supports  the design of what will go into the SCSE -- key program components and a preliminary design of its exhibit space. This request will also support the development of the SCSE's organizational structure and a transition plan for getting from preconstruction through Opening Day.   This science education center is planned to provide exceptionally innovative and cutting-edge exhibit experiences, expand educational opportunities for a wide array of students and teachers, and generally enhance the efforts of Homestake-DUSEL.",
