Regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-polyethyleneoxide (PHT-PEO) will be synthesized by coupling aldehyde terminated PHT chains with living styryl-PEO anions, and doped with the appropriate salts to make the PHT domain electron-conducting and the PEO domain ion-conducting. The morphology of the mixtures and charge carrier distribution will be characterized by standard techniques such as electron microscopy and X-ray scattering, as well as element-specific techniques such as energy filtered EM and resonant soft X-ray scattering. A combination of DC- and AC-impedance spectroscopy will be used to measure the ionic and electronic conductance of the doped copolymer. Concurrently with the experimental efforts, theoretical and simulation studies will be performed to understand the underpinnings of the experimental observations regarding morphology and dopant distribution, and to provide insight for designing second generation systems with optimal properties. In particular, a ribbon-coil model will be developed to predict the morphology of PHT-PEO systems. Theories that incorporate both ion solvation and chain deformation will be used to predict dopant distribution. Computer simulations used to predict ion transport will be validated using experimental measurements.\r\n\r\nThis work will be the first study of the simultaneous electronic and ionic transport in nanostructured polymer materials. The combined experimental and theoretical efforts will yield rich insights into: how charge carries are distributed in nanostructured materials, how the motion of charge carriers couples to the segmental dynamics of the polymers, how the local nanostructure and large-scale grain structure influences charge transport, and how doping agents alter the morphology of the self-assembled polymeric structures. These insights may lead to entirely new design strategies for electrode architectures in rechargeable batteries and fuel cells.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe research is in sync with the nationwide efforts at creating and ultimately manufacturing clean and more efficient energy technologies. The systems studied have potential to directly translate into new battery technologies. Furthermore, in both PIs? home departments,there is an increasing need among the graduate students to work in energy-related research areas; the  projects fulfill that need by providing them with the opportunity to do research in a technologically important area, while receiving a multidisciplinary training in theory, simulation, modeling, thermodynamics, synthesis and  characterization of polymers, optics, scattering, and electrochemistry. Equally important, the proposed research serves as a platform for developing new educational packages for high school and undergraduate students. In this respect, the PIs will develop and execute lectures and demonstrations on electrochemistry and batteries as part of the Math and Science Summer Academy program at Berkeley",

Experimentally, it was found that the addition of even a small amount of lithium salts considerably increases the propensity of the block copolymers to microphase separation into nanostructures such as layered lamellae.  We developed the first theory to describe the interaction between the lithium salts and the block copolymers, and how addition of salts affects the ordering behavior.  The key concept in our theory is the preferential solvation energy of the anions towards the PEO block, which provides a driving force for microphase separation.  Our theory enables us to understand (1) why the ordering transition can increase by 50 to 100 Celsius upon adding even a small amount of lithium salt to the block copolymers; (2) where the ions are distributed in the ordered nanostructures; and (3) whether the lithium ions are free or form ion pairs with the anions.\nThe results and predictions from our theory provides the theoretical basis for rationale design for battery materials.  The key concepts and ideas of our theory are applicable to many systems involving interactions between salt ions and polymers, such as fuel cells, membranes for water purification, etc.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhen-Gang Wang"
