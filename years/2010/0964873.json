This conference is a part of the year long Golden Jubilee celebrations at IIT Kanpur, as the Institute steps into its 50th year. It is also a meeting ground for the members of the Indo-US Center for Research on Fabrionics supported by the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum, New Delhi, with participation from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Northwestern University, UC Irvine, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Kanpur and a few other universities and institutes. There will be approximately 20 speakers from the US, and about the same number from India. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit \r\nIndia is making a strong investment in science and technology. This meeting represents an important avenue for interactions between US universities and Indian counterparts. The conference will focus on micro, nano and meso-scale fabrication and its relation to structure and properties and functionalities with emphasis on soft materials, self-assembly, self-organization and novel functionalities and applications in energy and environment. It will help explore cutting-edge of micro/nano fabrication, which is a highly interdisciplinary area with equal interest across many departments including chemical, mechanical, electrical and materials engineering, materials science, biosciences, chemistry and physics. \r\n\r\nBroader impact \r\nThis conference will allow US participants to learn about advanced research in leading institutions in India. This will directly enhance possibilities of international collaborations. It will provide exposure of participants to students at one of the best institutes in India, and help attract some of those to research laboratories in the US. Through both these avenues, one expects this interaction to directly impact the quality and quantity of research output in the US.",
