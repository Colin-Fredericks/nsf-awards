 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal requesting partial funding for a series of the Current Developments in Mathematics conferences organized by Professor Shing-Tung Yau and other members of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first of the three conference will be held at Harvard University in the Science Center building in November, 2009. This series of conferences is known for bringing together excellent speakers at the forefront of their field as well as attracting a large audience from all over the country.\r\n\r\nMathematicians in the Northeast part of America benefit from such activities. They come to participate and communicate with each other, and it is truly interdisciplinary activity. The topics are wide-ranging, from mathematical physics to computing to applied mathematics. People come to this conference all the way from Europe and Asia, and it has been very fruitful for all parties involved. The applications for funding are primarily for graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral fellows who travel from all over the country and many are female students and minorities. Some graduate students can get enough ideas from the talks to write their theses, and they can communicate with the speakers on their research topics.",
