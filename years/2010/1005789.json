Brown University's extended campus locations will gain high speed access to the computing facilities in the main campus. Other public universities and 2-and 4-year colleges will be connected to Brown University's research and computing facilities through the Ocean State Higher Education Economic Development and Administrative Network (OSHEAN). Upgrades to OSHEAN will strengthen collaborations of the North East Cyberinfrastructure Consortium comprising of institutions from Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, and Delaware and also improve connectivity to New York and Massachusetts. The RI Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which facilitates interaction among researchers and entrepreneurs, will also receive high bandwidth connectivity through the upgrades in this project. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe RI Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (RI-EPSCoR) focuses on studies of climate change effects on marine organisms, ecosystems, and food webs. These studies are fundamentally important to the global biosphere and locally to Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay. The high bandwidth connection provided by this project will facilitate efficient transmission and sharing of data among researchers across RI to make full use of NextGen DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools. Integrative metagenomic approaches to monitoring marine ecosystem, understanding the influence of rising ocean temperature and acidity on marine food webs, sustained biological production in the ocean, and identification of disease causing marine organisms will be pursued.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed cyberinfrastructure enhancements will increase Rhode Island's research capacity for collaborative work in marine life sciences. The proposed broadband capacity will revitalize the Jewelry District in Providence, RI to a biotechnology based Knowledge District and promote economic growth in the state. The RI-EPSCoR Academy's workforce development and diversity initiatives will be strengthened by the improved cyber connectivity among institutions of higher education in RI. Enhanced connectivity will enable wide area video-conferencing and marine life science research related telecasts to K-12 schools. Workshops to broadly disseminate bioinformatics programs are also included.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcomes Report\nPI: Edward Hawrot\nAward Number: 1005789\nApril 2014\nHigh-Capacity Cyber-Connectivity to the Jewelry District Campuses in Providence RI\nThe funds made available by the NSF EPSCoR C2 award mechanism have enabled Brown University, through its IT and Network departments, to leverage earlier institutional investments in fiber capacity, and its partnership with the OSHEAN organization, to increase by over ten-fold the broadband capacity available to scientists and engineers in Rhode Island.  OSHEAN is a non-profit coalition of Rhode Island universities, government agencies, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations dedicated to providing technology infrastructure services to its members and the communities they serve.  Prior to this C2 award, scientific researchers and engineers were limited in their ability to transfer research data into or out of RI research and educational institutions.  With the C2 award, broadband connectivity has increased from 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) to 10 Gbps per lambda (i.e., per laser light wavelength), and the equipment that was purchased will readily allow future transmissions rates in excess of 40 Gbps once those communication standards and protocols are established. \nThe award funds were used to purchase a Cisco ONS 15454 optical technology platform to support a number of access nodes that connect the main campus of Brown University to research buildings in the Jewelry District of Providence RI.  One of these buildings houses ICERM, the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, which is an NSF funded Math Institute, and the only one of its kind in New England.  The C2 award funds allow ICERM to Live Stream its various scheduled talks and presentations.  ICERM also maintains a Video Archive of all past talks and presentations for viewing across the optical network.\nTransfers of research data (e.g., DNA sequence data) that previously took several days across the 1 Gbps network, now take only a few hours (typically 3-4 hours).  This has allowed our researchers, such as Casey Dunn, the 2011 NSF Waterman award winner, and creator of the CreatureCasts videos accessible through the New York Times Science Video Channel, to pursue his DNA sequence data-driven research  which investigates the origins of biological complexity through work with  deep-sea creatures called siphonophores. His research holds clues about  how complex multicellular organisms, including humans, were formed.\nIn addition, the data transfer transactions across the new optical network are more stable and much less likely to experience a critical failure because of the shorter transer times.  This allows researchers to be more productive in their studies and to schedule more experiments.  The 10 Gbps optical network that was installed with the C2 funds has the additional benefit that if any of the installed nodes become non-functional, the network is capable of using the existing functional nodes to continue full communication ability.  The C2 funded optical network has been so reliable that it now serves as the network path for our researchers to connect with the 10 Gbps capability of the OSHEAN network, which provides access to national Internet and Internet 2 services. \nThe new 10 Gbps optical network also supports a number of RI-based researchers at the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College, and Roger Williams University by facilitating access to their EPSCoR enabled accounts at Brown's Center for Computation and Visualization, which houses a high-perfomance computer cluster.\nFinally, some of the C2 award funds were used to offer a two-week summer workshop in Bioinformatics for 20 high school students from RI schools.  This residential workshop included lectures, hands-on laboratory exercises, tours of research facilities, and a hands-on/interactive introduction to bioinformatics software used to analyze new DNA sequences obtained from studies of novel soil and marine m..."
