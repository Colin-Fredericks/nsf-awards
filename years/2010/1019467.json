 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphorus (P) is a critical element to the functioning of biological systems.  Phosphorous availability impacts plant productivity and, in some ecosystems, is a primary limiting nutrient. Climate change, particularly changes in precipitation and temperature, are likely to alter soil P cycling and availability to terrestrial vegetation.  However, terrestrial P research has long been hampered by an inability to measure aspects of the P cycle and thus relatively little is known about the effects of global change on the P cycle. The major goal of this project is to use innovative isotope tracer techniques to determine the impacts of climate change on the soil P cycle.  Phosphorous availability, mobility, and influence on vegetation productivity will be examined in experimental plots in California grasslands within the Jasper Ridge Global Change Project.  The influences of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, elevated temperature, increased precipitation, and increased nitrogen deposition on P cycling will be assessed in different soil horizons.\r\n\r\nThis work will contribute to understanding of global environmental change impacts on soil biogeochemistry and the role of linked biogeochemical cycles (phosphorous and nitrogen) in influencing productivity of grassland ecosystems.  New techniques for measuring P cycling will be further developed.   A postdoctoral researcher will be supported, undergraduate students interested in interdisciplinary research will be mentored, and outreach to high school students, and teachers will be conducted.",

The study site incorporates eight iterations of each of the four treatment combinations resulting in 16 separate treatments and 128 total treatment plots. A previous study on P biogeochemistry at the site by was conducted three years after the start of the experiment and concluded that in treatments where N was added plants exhibited signs of P limitation. The other three factors (CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature and water supply), did not increase P demand by the vegetation. This current study was conducted twelve years later and almost 15 years from the start of the experiment in order to determine if any further progression or decrease in P limitation conditions have occurred.</p>\n<p>We used a suite of measurements that may shed light on P availability to plants and P cycling in the soil. These include: total P concentrations and N:P ratios of the bulk aboveground biomass and of green <em>A. barbata</em>, and soil enzymes activity to evaluate changes in these indices over time. We also use C and N concentration and C:N and C:P ratios of <em>A. barbata </em>and of the bulk homogenized aboveground biomass. In addition to these measurements, P concentrations in different soil fractions and the oxygen isotope ratio of phosphate (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>P</sub>) in <em>A. barbata</em> and in the soil were measured. Results from this study suggest that similar to observations made only after 3 years of treatment N deposition was the only treatment that consistently increased P limitation but we also show that the P limitation of the system has increased slightly over time. These results suggest that the system responded quickly after the start of the experiment by increasing enzyme activity in the soil which provides more P to the plants and lowering the P content of the plants, and that the rate of change (increasing P limitation) is now progressing slowly. We also see that despite the higher enzyme activities in the soil and the impact on the plants there is relatively little difference between the inventory and distribution of P in the soil among the treatments. It is interesting and worthwhile to note, that despite the duration of the experiment the community composition seems minimally affected by the altered conditions. This may be due to the weedy and/or annual nature of many of the dominant species at this site and the fact that there are ample P reserves in the soil to be utilized by the plants as suggested by the P concentrations and isotope ratios in the soil. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project developed innovative methods to study P dynamics in soils and provided STEM education experiance to students of all ages.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Adina&nbsp;Paytan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493522808312_JRGCEMap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493522808312_JRGCEMap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A map of the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493522808312_JRGCEMap--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A map of the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A map showing the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment site and treatment setup</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">JRGCE</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A map of the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493525498026_Studentsinthefield--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493525498026_Studentsinthefield--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students in the Field\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493525498026_Studentsinthefield--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students in the Field\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UCSC students sampling soil and vegetation at JRGCE</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Travis Mallett</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students in the Field</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493526556451_Avena--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493526556451_Avena--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Abena Barbata\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1019467/1019467_10018531_1493526556451_Avena--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Abena Barbata\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Wild Oat a common grass in Jasper Ridge</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">wikivisually</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Adina&nbsp;Paytan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Abena Barbata</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
