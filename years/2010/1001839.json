The Lectures, which are well known and highly regarded, have been organized annually on a variety of topics and with a distinguished list of speakers and participants. The 2010 Barrett Lectures are entitled \"Discrete Differential Geometry and Applications\". This will be a five-day conference organized by Professor Kenneth Stephenson (Tennessee), and Professor Alexander Bobenko (Technical University, Berlin). The conference continues a sequence which started in Germany and has been instrumental in founding Discrete Differential Geometry) as a coherent topic. Three distinguished researchers, Rick Kenyon, Igor Pak, and Peter Schroeder, will be involved in organizing the five days, each devoted to a different aspect of DDG through hour talks and sessions for shorter talks. One evening there will be a contributed poster session, and one evening a contributed software demonstration session. \r\n\r\nThe conference is intended to introduce Discrete Differential Geometry and its unique mixture of theory, computation, and application more broadly in the US. Young researchers and graduate students are particularly important parts of the audience, and every effort will be made to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary audience, including women and minorities.",
