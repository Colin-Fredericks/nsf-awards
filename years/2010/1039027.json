 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Jerry Jasinski from Keene State College will acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector. The diffractometer would have single crystal and powder capabilities and measurements could be done at various temperatures. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as structural characterization of pharmaceutically related molecules, anticancer and anti-inflammatory compounds, therapeutic agents, model enzyme complexes, peptide mimic compounds, radiopharmaceutical chelator molecules, molecular magnetic materials and organometallic and inorganic compounds.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research in a series of Central New England Institutions that include Keene State University, Dartmouth College, University of New Hampshire, Saint Anselm College, Middlebury College, Williams College and Clark University.",
