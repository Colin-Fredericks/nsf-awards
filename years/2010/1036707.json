The Workshop will include a significant set of presentations, posters, and panels from a delegation of Chinese academic, research laboratory, and industry experts as well as graduate students. Participants will address topics that include Government support for the research, development, and utilization of special purpose hardware, including GPU and self-developed processors; in addition, applications will also be stressed. Speakers from industry will provide perspectives of the importance of such hardware for real applications.\r\nIn addition, a special effort will be made to include HPC R&D developments in Hong Kong. Another important component will be a panel in which panelists and the audience identify topics that are suitable for collaborative (US-China) research and the mechanisms for developing those collaborations. A key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US research community to interact and have direct discussions with top Chinese scientists who will travel to the US to participate. A specific goal of the Workshop is to motivate the preparation of joint research proposals with researchers from both US and China.",
