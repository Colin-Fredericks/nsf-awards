Specifically, as the Director of Distributed Robotics Lab, the PI proposes to investigate a unified platform that will enable inputs from a human via an Android-based graphical controller to coordinate and control a team of cooperative UAVs. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal involves the development of an algorithm for real time development of optimal quality of service solutions based upon the robot's current state and goal. If the algorithm is cooperative it would also enable multi-robot collaboration. \r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks to advance this research issue through extensive physics-based simulation. The broadest area of impact of this proposed work is the likely advances in multi-robot cooperation research, which will have clear benefits to society in disaster situations where time is of the essence. In addition, the plan that all development will be in standard languages using open source libraries and off-the-shelf operating systems increases the likelihood that others will be able to build from this work. The proposal also presents plans for actively recruiting minority and female students in the PI's laboratory. The proposed research will arguably promote collaboration between the PI's institution and several military centers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant activities supported both intellectual and developmental goals.  The intellectual goals were to develop and evaluate a CSP-based formulation of the QoS-based surveillance algorithms and to explore methods of human-on-the-loop surveillance that support and enhance trust.  Developmental goals included training both graduate and undergraduate researchers that have the expertise to create technology that enhances the use of automation in surveillance systems.\n\nQoS (Quality of Service) systems manage resources based on metrics that measure the ability of a system to deliver a specific level of performance.  Previous studies support the use of ALUL (Average Linear Uncovered Length) to estimate the length of time a target can operate within the region of interest without detection.  Decisions that direct autonomous surveillance (PTZ cameras and/or UAVs) are selected to maintain ALUL level (i.e. limit the amount of time a target can move without being detected).  This approach provides superior coverage (over more na&iuml;ve approaches) in constrained situations when optimal camera/robot placement cannot be achieved.  This approach is model-free in that no knowledge of the area (i.e. sidewalks, roads, etc) is used to plan actions.  A side effect is that operators can understand the impact of manually overriding an asset to the ability of the system to provide surveillance.  Using a dynamic, weighted constraint satisfaction approach to solving for the \"best next action\" allows for standard solvers to be used rather than the previous hill-climbing approach.\n\nIn addition, this approach was implemented into a test system to evaluate whether the ALUL concept supported operator trust in the system better than other methods.  This is important because previous studies show that surveillance systems with high levels of autonomy are less effective overall.  Operator trust is low unless the operators can verify that the autonomy serves to advance the overall goal.  Verification time spent by the operator reduces time and effort available for operator-based tasks.  The distributed test system consisted of 3 nodes:  Matlab node to run CSP solver, Webots as a 3D simulation environment and iPad (iOS) front end to provide information and to receive actions from the operator.   The task was to identify a simulated target moving in the environment.   A user study was conducted to compare the autonomous system to the semi-autonomous and manual system.  Measures considered four dimensions: subjective measures of workload, situational awareness and usability along with performance. \n\n \n\nThe study shows statistical significant results that support the use of Spatial and Temporal Environmental Cues (STEC) that provide insight to factors that affect the autonomous path of the UAVs.  Operator trust can be positively affected by appropriately attending to system input of a perception model which allows the operator to experience that the autonomous team\u00c6s actions are rational based on current environmental conditions.  Another hypothesis that appropriate user training would increase trust as the operator would understand the underlying algorithms.  This was particularly appropriate because of the natural explanation of the ALUL algorithm.  Interestingly metrics from trained participants did not vary significantly statistically from the non-trained participants and when combined with the STEC, garnered the lowest subjective ratings.  Ultimately this study shows a path forward to effectively using high levels of autonomy with operators-on-the-loop that includes visual cues over training.\n\n \n\nAdditional developmental goals focus on the training of new scientists.  One PhD, one Masters student and one undergraduate student were trained on both autonomous algorithm development, conducting effective user studies, using statistics to make interferences about underlying models, and creating and linking systems of distributed software/hardware resources.
