It also extends in a novel and transformative fashion earlier work that developed a music search engine based on identifying aesthetic similarities.  Automated transcription of musical sounds is still an open research area and one of exceptional importance.  While some limited transcription techniques are available, they lack critical abilities, such as inability to transcribe polyphonic compositions or difficulties in distinguishing sounds produced by different sources.  In addition, the frequency ranges are limited, thereby excluding a vast number of musical works.  The approach proposed in this project involves an innovative audio-to-MIDI transcription algorithm, which handles polyphonic compositions, captures harmonic, vocal and percussive instrumentation, is very efficient and works with sounds beyond human produced musical compositions, such as bird songs and sub/ultrasonic animal vocalizations.",

For instance, Pythagoras (c. 570 &ndash; c. 495 BC) discovered that musical pitch intervals could be described by numbers.  He and his students are credited with the discovery of mathematics, a term which they coined. \n\nPythagoras\u00c6s contributions helped shape the ideas of subsequent philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists, including Plato, Aristotle, and Kepler.

It resembles Pandora, last.fm, and iTunes Genius, except that it is fully automated (the la..."
