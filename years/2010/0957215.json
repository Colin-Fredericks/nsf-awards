 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports the efforts of Professor Thomas J. Meyer of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the investigation of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and concerted electron-proton transfer (EPT) in two areas.  The first project focuses on the role of PCET and EPT in electrochemical reactions and electrocatalysis.  The group's results document a significant role for PCET and EPT in electrode reactions with potentially important implications for electrocatalysis by solution and surface-bound catalysts.  The second research area focuses on excited state, light-driven EPT reactions that produce highly reactive intermediates for carrying out solar fuel and green chemical reactions.  \r\n\r\nProton coupled electron transfer reactions, reactions in which both electrons and protons are transferred, are of considerable interest in both chemistry and biology.  These reactions are at the core of biological systems and artificial photosynthesis and are utilized in both water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.  This research examines the mechanistic details of these reactions and may lead to the development of alternative energy systems.  Graduate and postdoctoral students participate in the supervision of undergraduate research, in demonstrations and presentations at UNC and at local schools, in a summer programs developed to broaden participation.",
