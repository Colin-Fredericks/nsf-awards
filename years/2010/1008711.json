However, interaction among investigators from the different countries in this half of the world is rare. The goal of the workshop is to increase awareness of the state-of-the-art research on computational approaches to languages of the Americas by bringing together young investigators from across the Americas doing research on these languages.\r\nThe workshop program and activities allow the attendees to explore the possibilities for international collaborations. In addition, this workshop also includes an open discussion session for proposing mechanisms to promote a more interactive community in the Americas.\r\n\r\nThis event contributes to the advancement of science by: (1) helping participants to extend their network of collaboration across international borders, and (2) promoting cross pollination of research ideas by raising awareness of the research done in different countries in the Americas, as well as (3) disseminating information on funding opportunities for international collaborations.",
