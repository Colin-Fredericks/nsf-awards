 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lehigh University ADVANCE IT project focuses on institutional transformation at a medium-sized private research university with interdisciplinary collaboration at its core.  It is expected that the focus on interdisciplinarity, highly characteristic of institutions of this size, will serve to provide a means for implementing evaluation, mentoring and networking policies and programs.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  The LU ADVANCE IT project is novel in that it links ADVANCE activities with interdisciplinary collaboration, a widely used practice at this institution.  Thus this project will answer important questions including the role of promotion criteria and procedures when interdisciplinarity is emphasized.  The LU ADVANCE program is firmly rooted in the social science literature, which contributes to understanding how culture, policy and practice are interrelated.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact.  The Lehigh University ADVANCE IT project will focus on regional workshops and networking opportunities.  As such, this project has the potential to impact institutions beyond the funded campus.  It is expected that dissemination of project findings will occur broadly through traditional means.  Also, as a result of regional networks, it is expected that this ADVANCE project will serve as a model for other institutions of similar type and size.",
