The technology audit service is designed to; continually test the user environment and capabilities provided by XD to ensure delivery of the highest possible quality of service, to provide internal quality assurance and quality control for XD, measuring quantitative and qualitative metrics of quality of service and to periodically report to the coordinating body for the XD. The award provides the objective metrics of XD quality of service that will be reviewed and revised by the XD in consultation with NSF as the technology evolves.  The technology audit service will have user-level access to all XD computational, storage and visualization services and will use these for testing advanced software in partnership with the relevant service providers.",
