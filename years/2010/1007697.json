 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the publication of the NSF landmark report \"Visualization in\r\nScientific Computing\" in 1987, computer-aided visualization has been\r\nrecognized as one of the most potent tool sets for scientific\r\ndiscovery. However, discoveries based on data displays are often\r\ncriticized because they are not secured by statistical inference. The\r\nteam of researchers from Iowa State University, Rice University and\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania is addressing exactly this issue by\r\nbringing the rigors of statistical inference to visual data\r\nexploration. Statistical inference for plots are cast as comparison of\r\na plot of the actual data with plots of null data simulated under a\r\nnull hypothesis. If the actual plot stands out from a background of\r\n\"null plots\", it amounts to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\r\nExecuting this idea leads to rigorous protocols that can confer proper\r\nstatistical significance to visual discoveries. Tools of mathematical\r\nstatistics are employed to reduce composite null hypotheses to single\r\nreference distributions: conditioning on a minimal sufficient\r\nstatistic, bootstrap plug-ins, and posterior predictive sampling. The\r\nprotocols also have the potential to shift the perception of\r\nexploration-based findings in the scientific communities and\r\ndramatically increase the impact that these findings are allowed to\r\nhave. The testing protocols will be made accessible with\r\nimplementation in the open-source R language.\r\n\r\nData graphics are an essential part of communicating information. But\r\nhow reliable is the information that we gather from them? The\r\ninvestigators will develop a rigorous framework for visual inference\r\nmodeled after formal statistical testing. This framework allows the \r\nreader of a graphic to determine whether structure is real or spurious \r\n(is that a man in the moon, or just some rocks?). These protocols have \r\nthe potential to shift the perception of exploration-based findings in \r\nthe scientific community and dramatically increase the impact of \r\nexploratory work. Some aspects of the protocols are so intuitive that \r\nthey can be used for general audiences and integrated in the teaching \r\nof introductory statistics at from grade school to college.",
