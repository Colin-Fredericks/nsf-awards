 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a  two-day workshop that will gather a select group of experts from the academic, private and government sectors in global change sciences, including the physical and biological sciences: Physics and Dynamics of Climate Variability and Change, Land Cover and Land Use Change, Ecological and Biogeochemical Change, Biodiversity and Global Change; and the human dimensions of global change: Economics of Climate Change, Environmental Law, Policy and Governance, Education, Communication and Public Engagement, and Decision-Making and Other Stakeholders? Issues. The workshop goals are to explore options for how to structure the national research program on global change to (1) be more effectively organized around integrated scientific-societal issues to facilitate crosscutting research focused on understanding the interactions among the climate, human, and environmental systems and on supporting societal responses to climate change; and (2) balance activities in fundamental, use-inspired research that contributes to both improved understanding and more effective decision-making, climate services, climate change assessment, and adaptation research. The program structure must facilitate meeting the end-to-end needs of the nation to face the challenges of profound environmental change ? from basic research and integrated observations through multi-disciplinary applications to socioeconomic and ecosystem adaptation and mitigation actions. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will explore the challenges of both continuing progress in addressing fundamental research questions and providing information that is increasingly useful and relevant to decision-making on matters complicated by considerations of climate and global change. The workshop also will explore ways to map the interdisciplinary findings and tools that global change research currently has available and can be expected to develop over the next decade onto the societal needs for coping with the difficulties and/or taking best advantage of the opportunities that global change inevitably will create. Underpinning this mapping are the social sciences that can provide the context of economics, governance, and communication that helps translate research results to the general public and decision-makers. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Bringing together the basic research community and the community of stakeholders who have some risk exposure to climate and global change has been a challenge for the past 20 years of global change research in the U.S. This workshop will consider structural architectures for a national program that can support intellectual inquiry in the areas of climate science, adaptation research, and technology development for the mitigation of negative impacts of climate change. The workshop has the potential to define new ways of integration and collaboration among the diverse research disciplines, thereby transforming the conduct of climate change research in the nation. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The workshop discussion can inform the Federal government as it prepares for a new era of global change research, and state and local governments seeking answers to pressing questions about how global change affects their regions. The greater integration of basic research, applied research, climate services and decision-support has the potential to open new pathways of communication between the academic world and the private and government sectors as they all prepare for a changing planet.",
