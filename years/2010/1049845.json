 "awd_abstract_narration": "New wireless technologies promise mobile users easy access to real-time data and the ability to stay connected with business partners, colleagues and friends any where, any time. While emerging mobile applications are designed to be data-centric, existing IP-oriented communication paradigms are not flexible enough to support these new functionalities. Additionally, serious security and privacy concerns have been raised. To fully support emerging mobile applications, we are developing a next-generation mobile network, SECON, that supports mobile content centric networking features.\r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate new mobile internet features via prototyping and large scale experimentations using GENI testbeds. Key features include (i) intra and inter-domain intentional-named message dissemination, (ii) efficient mobile content centric networking protocol design, and (iii) data-centric security with search capability. The proposed educational component will equip both graduate and undergraduate students with both design and implementation experience of innovative mobile Internet features. The PI also plans to organize outreach activities for minority students.",
