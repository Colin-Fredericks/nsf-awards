 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most volcanism occurs along plate boundaries, along mid-ocean ridges and volcanic arcs. Broadly speaking, the causes of volcanism in these setting is understood, while the causes of the lee voluminous volcanism that occurs in plate interiors remain obscure. This project will test the novel hypothesis that intraplate volcanism along the Hawaiian Arch and along some continental margins is caused by interactions between rising plumes of mantle material and the overlying lithosphere by a combination of numerical and analog (physical) modeling. The results will shed light on the interaction of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. This project will lead to better understanding of Hawaiian volcanism, in which there is broad public interest. Broader impacts public lectures on this topic and training of students in numerical methods and geodynamic numerical  modeling.",
