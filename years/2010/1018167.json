 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid mechanical systems arise in many applications, including hopping, walking, and climbing robots where contact with the ground changes; skid-steering vehicles where Coulomb friction introduces stick/slip behavior; and prosthetic devices that interact with objects.  All of these applications are influenced by nonlinearity, nonsmooth transitions, and uncertainty, and these systems demand new tools in motion planning and control.\r\n\r\nThis work takes advantage of the specific structure of mechanical systems to bound the propagation of uncertainty and to develop feedback controllers that maximize robustness of execution.  The work builds on state-of-the-art techniques in motion planning and estimation, including sample-based and optimization-based planning, leading to tools for uncertain hybrid mechanical systems that are analogous to control and estimation tools used for linear systems.\r\n\r\nExample systems are used to drive algorithm development as well as to verify performance.  These include 1) the Monkeybot, a robot that uses electromagnets and a single motor to locomote along a vertical wall;\r\n2) a parkour robot that uses mechanical contact and jumping to climb narrow passages; and 3) a skid-steered vehicle that experiences discontinuous dynamics due to stick/slip friction effects.  All phases of this work include participation of undergraduates and minority students.  In addition to dissemination in conferences and journals, results are disseminated on a publicly viewable wiki.",

All these types of uncertainties need to be incorporated into a robot\u00c6s decision making, and this project has analyzed planning and control for robots (and examples such as vehicles) that experience impacts and other forms of discrete changes in uncertain environments.   \n\nThis work has had high public visibility.  As part of this project, the PI and the students involved created an introductory systems analysis course on the Coursera platform.  Over 30,000 students signed up for the two offerings of the free class in autumn, 2013 and spring, 2014.  This class is at https://www.coursera.org/course/modelsystems.  Moreover, the PIs\u00c6 laboratory created a display at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago during National Robotics Week (2012-2014).  Thousands of elementary and secondary school children interacted with the PIs\u00c6 robots and learned about the role of control and software in embedded systems. \n\nOne of the major developments in this project was the development of a new robot.  The Gibbot is a bio-inspired climbing robot that swings from one handhold to the next. The robot serves as a model system in our work on planning and state estimation of hybrid mechanical systems.  In addition to serving as a research platform, the Gibbot will be included in the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago.  This world class science museum is launching a permanent robotics exhibit and our robot has been invited to be a part of the permanent display.

The result of this part of the effort was that many things we learn when driving, such as releasing the brakes momentarily when hitting a patch of ice, are optimal responses to uncertainty about traction.  A major result of this work includes illustrating how to design algorithms that automatically respond to uncertainty, providing a prototype for how advanced software assistance in vehicles can be designed. \n\n Papers from both projects can be found at http://nxr.northwestern.edu. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd D Murphey"
