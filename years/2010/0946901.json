 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nWith this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Robert Hamers, Clark R. Landis and Shannan S. Stahl of the University of Wisconsin Department of Chemistry will acquire equipment to study solution-phase chemical reactions and catalytic processes performed at high pressures (50-3000 psig). The equipment includes reactors which allow monitoring reaction kinetics by infrared spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance suitable for screening of reactions at high pressure. The equipment will be used to investigate at high pressures reactions with air-sensitive reagents or under anaerobic conditions including catalytic hydroformylation, polymerization and carbonylation reactions, and the study of oxidative reactions, high temperature chemistry and nitrous oxide chemistry. \r\n\r\nHigh-pressure reactions have widespread significance in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and include some of the most important large scale chemical processes: aerobic oxidation, hydrogenation and alkene polymerization. New reactions of this type and fundamental insights into existing reactions are critical to advance the field; however, such studies are complicated by the need to use specialized equipment that ensures safety. The equipment requested in this proposal will enable the discovery and mechanistic investigation of a wide range of chemical reactions under high-pressure. Students will be trained in the proper use of this equipment in their research and in course work improving their preparation for jobs in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries\r\n\r\n",
