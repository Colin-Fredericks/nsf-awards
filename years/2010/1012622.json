 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Brodbelt and her students will develop photodissociation in conjunction with chemical derivatization methods that add chromophores and/or charge sites to molecules in order to modify ion fragmentation patterns. Mass spectrometry has become one of the most versatile methods for structural characterization of biological molecules, and enhancing the selectivity of mass spectrometric strategies remains a priority. This work will follow a theme aimed at the structural characterization of biological molecules by using ion activation methods that incorporate targeted selectivity, while also building a framework for understanding the impact of site-specific chromophores on ion activation. The primary goals include the evaluation of charge state on dissociation efficiency, the attachment of chromophores to enhance dissociation efficiencies, the incorporation of selectively cleavable bonds into molecules, and the development of photodissociation for high throughput analysis of proteins. In addition to the important scientific goals of this proposal, the education of future scientists is an equally significant outcome with long-term impact. \r\n\r\nThe development of better analytical tools, including the mass spectrometric strategies pursued in the proposed work, is needed to elucidate the structures of molecules responsible for many biological functions, such as antibodies that fight viruses and muscle contraction in the heart. The anticipated benefits arising from the proposed work include: 1) the training and education of future scientists in the area of analytical chemistry and biological mass spectrometry, and 2) the development of innovative laser-based strategies for structural characterization of biological molecules such as peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.",
