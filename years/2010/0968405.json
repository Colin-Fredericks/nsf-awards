 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PIRE renewal award supports the expansion of a unique interdisciplinary U.S.-Japan research and education partnership focused on terahertz (THz) dynamics in nanostructures.  The 0.1 to 10 THz frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum is where electrical transport and optical transitions merge, thus offering exciting opportunities to study a variety of novel physical phenomena.  By combining THz technology and nanotechnology, we can advance our understanding of THz physics while improving and developing THz devices.  Nanotechnology is the study of nanostructures (between 1 to 100 nanometers long) and how they can be controlled, fabricated, or manipulated.  New discoveries provide insight into the possibilities for novel electronic, photonic, mechanical, and magnetic devices that have huge potential for future technological applications including medicine, computation, and communications.\r\n\r\nThis PIRE project will (a) advance our quantitative understanding of THz dynamics in nanostructures, (b) fabricate novel nanostructures for THz study and applications, (c) advance cutting-edge experimental techniques in THz spectroscopy and imaging, and (d) provide new knowledge useful for developing novel THz devices.  The projects explore THz dynamics in carbon nanomaterials, namely, nanotubes and graphene.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. and Japan are global leaders in both THz research and nanotechnology, and stimulating cooperation is critical to further advance THz science and develop commercial products from new ideas in the lab.  However, obstacles exist for international collaboration - primarily linguistic and cultural barriers - and this PIRE project aims to continue breaking down these barriers.  The project will also leverage large investments by both countries to achieve long-term scientific and societal impact by providing future generations of researchers with a better understanding of both the culture and the state-of-the-art technology in each country.\r\n\r\nThe strong educational portfolio of this project focuses on cultivating interest in nanotechnology among young U.S. undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and encouraging such students to pursue graduate study and academic research in the physical sciences.  This renewed funding will expand and strengthen the award-winning international research experience program for undergraduates called the NanoJapan Program.  Recognized as a model for international education programs for science and engineering students, this program will provide U.S. undergraduates with structured research opportunities in Japanese university laboratories with Japanese mentors.  This program includes a three-week orientation program with language and culture training as well as extensive use of information technologies as learning and community-building tools.  U.S. graduate students, early career scientists, researchers and alumni will benefit from direct involvement in the PIRE research as well as from related follow-on educational projects at home institutions and in local communities.  Other programs such as undergraduate and graduate research assistantships and the NanoAsia Graduate International Research Experience (IRE) are additional venues for international collaboration for U.S. students.  The original PIRE had particular success with recruitment of females and African-American students; these recruitment efforts will continue and will be expanded to include first-generation college-attending students.  This broad portfolio of PIRE educational activities should produce a diverse cadre of students with rich skill sets that span nanoscience specialties, international cultural awareness, and the intersection of culture, language, science, and technology.\r\n\r\nInstitutional impacts of this award include strengthening Rice University's leadership position in international research and education in THz science, materials science, and nanoscience.  It places Rice at the hub of an exciting domestic and international collaborative network of researchers and educators, while leveraging the University of Tulsa's exceptional strength in international education, especially its expertise in developing international education programs for science and engineering students.  An Introduction to Nanotechnology & Nanoscience Online Seminar will be developed within this PIRE and will be webcast live and archived online, enabling live or asynchronous participation of all U.S. and Japanese participants, thus enhancing the international curriculum at all institutions.  In addition, the project will further strengthen and internationalize connections within and among campuses established through the original PIRE award, including those with international offices, IT units, and curriculum and assessment specialists.  The project is also an innovative model that enables the participating universities to foster multi-disciplinary international collaboration among scholars in engineering, the sciences, and the humanities.  Furthermore, by bringing undergraduates into international research, the project builds on the success of the original PIRE in strengthening the pool of potential globally-engaged graduate students for the PIRE institutions and the nation.\r\n\r\nU.S. project partners include Rice University (TX), University of Florida, University of Tulsa (OK), State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and Texas A&M University.  Japanese partners include Osaka University, Chiba University, Shinshu University, Tohoku University, University of Tokyo, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS), Hokkaido University, RIKEN, and University of Aizu.\r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems, and the Division of Materials Research.",

One shared, \"...my NanoJapan lab gave me a realistic      taste of graduate school life (the good and the bad) that many students      lack when they apply for graduate school.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: This U.S.-Japanese partnership explored terahertz (THz or 1012 Hz) dynamics in nanostructures. The electromagnetic spectrum from 0.1 to 10 THz offers many opportunities to study physical phenomena, with potential payoff in numerous technologies, such as security, communications, imaging, and spectroscopy. However, this regime is poorly developed compared to those of electronics (&lt;100 GHz) and photonics (&gt;10 THz). By a judicious combination of THz technology and nanotechnology (\"TeraNano\"), we significantly advanced our understanding of THz physics in nanomaterials and nanostructures, while improving existing, and developing new, THz devices. PI Kono has led and managed this international team of researchers and education experts, who, together, have published over 80 papers. Specifically, our successes include a demonstration of nearly perfect performance of carbon nanotube THz polarizers [1], the generation, detection, and analysis of coherent THz phonons in SWCNTs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], modulation of THz-wave transmission through gated graphene [8, 9], imaging molecular adsorption and desorption dynamics on graphene using THz emission microscopy [10], and detection of THz radiation using an in-plane p-n junction of aligned SWCNTs through the photothermoelectric effect [11]. These breakthroughs will lead to real-world applications, including airport and customs screening technology, next-generation wireless communication networks with ultrahigh data rates, and rapid and safe cancer detection methods. For more representative papers see http://nanojapan.rice.edu/research_teranano_publications.shtml.\n\nBroader Impact: The key educational program of this PIRE grant was the NanoJapan: International Research Experience for Undergraduates Program [12, 13, 14]. Recognized as a model program for the expansion of international opportunities for engineering &amp; science students by both the National Academy of Engineering [15] and the Institute of International Education [16], NanoJapan was a twelve-week summer program through which twelve freshman and sophomore physics &amp; engineering students from U.S. universities complete research internships in Japanese laboratories in nanoscience, photonics, and condensed matter physics. By involving students with cutting-edge nanotechnology research projects, NanoJapan tightly integrated the international experience with students' academic program. NanoJapan aimed to increase the number of U.S. students who pursue graduate study in nanoscience and cultivate a generation of globally aware students who are prepared for international research collaboration [17, 18, 19, 20].\n\nFrom 2006 to 2015, 144 students participated in the program, representing 49 different U.S. institutions, including two Historically Black Colleges and Universities, five community colleges, liberal arts colleges, and a wide range of public and private research institutions. The program was particularly successful in recruiting underrepresented STEM students, particularly women. Female students represented 35.4% of NanoJapan participants overall, and 16.8% represented diverse ethnic groups in STEM fields. The representation of women is particularly impressive given that NSF data shows that, in 2010, the year our program began, female undergraduate students earned just 16.98% of engineering and 20.41% of conferred physics bachelors? degrees [21]. As a further testament to the impact on students? career development as science &amp; engineering researchers, to date, twelve NanoJapan students have been listed as co-authors in peer-reviewed journal articles published in prestigious journals including Applied Physics Letters, Carbon, the Journal of Nanomaterials, the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, Physical Review B, NanoResearch, Nanoscale Research Letters, and Scientific Reports [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33].       \n\nIn assessment of program outcomes [19], alumni identified three major impacts of participation in the NanoJapan: IREU Program:\n\nEnhanced      confidence: Students report the experience      conducting nanoscience research and living independently in Japan simply      made them more confident in general. One student shared, \"Relocating      to a different lab in the U.S. will always pale in comparison to      relocating to a lab on the other side of the world.\"\nTraining for      graduate school: Many students report that the      NanoJapan experience provided a first exposure to the realities of      graduate school. One shared, \"...my NanoJapan lab gave me a realistic      taste of graduate school life (the good and the bad) that many students      lack when they apply for graduate school. I know more than a few people      that have left their graduate programs because research was not what they      expected.\"\nProfessional      network: Many alumni report remaining in contact with their      Japanese research hosts. They also say that NanoJapan provided them with a      network of motivated peers in their field to discuss graduate school and      career options.\n\n\nOur experience with the development and implementation of the TeraNano PIRE project and the related NanoJapan: IREU Program has shown that both graduate and undergraduate students see this program as combining the best aspects of intensive, cutting education research in an emerging field with integrated international experiences that build upon the best of a traditional study abroad program. This suggests that IREUs can be an important model for engaging STEM students in meaningful programs abroad and preparing them with the technical and research skills necessary to become future leaders in American?s science &amp; engineering workforce.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Junichiro Kono"
