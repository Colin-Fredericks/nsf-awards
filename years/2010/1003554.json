 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central Florida is experiencing a shortage of well-prepared software developers.  A waive of retirements and a significant drop in enrollment in computing degrees has created a call to action for local community colleges and universities.  A partnership has been formed between four community colleges and the University of Central Florida.\r\n\r\nThe partnership is creating a new Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Development degree to explicitly articulate with Associate of Science degrees in Computer Programming and Analysis.  Project goals include curriculum alignment, faculty development, student retention activities and online instruction best practices.  The applied curriculum is being developed in consultation with local industry.  Community college graduates will be better prepared to enter the workforce as well as articulate to a bachelor's program.  The AS to BAS transition will be published as a model curriculum and available to all state colleges and universities in Florida.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Software Development Education Pathway (SDEP) was created to establish a pathway for A.S. students in Computer Programming to advance their programming skills without having to pursue a degree in computer science or similar.  The grant had multiple objectives, all of which were successfully met.\n\nGoal 1 was to create a Bachelor of Applied Science in Software Development.  This goal was completed and the program at the University of Central Florida has already graduates several cohorts.  There are over 50 declared majors in the program and it is growing every year.\n\nGoal 2 was to align curriculum among the partner colleges and the university.  This was done over the life of the grant and the following courses were aligned: Intro to Programming, Java, Adv. Java, Database, Web Authoring, Web Programming, C#, Adv C#, C++ and Adv C++.\n\nGoal 3 was to provide faculty development opportunities for faculty in the region.  Faculty workshops were offered in Java, Advanced Java, Database Management, Mobile App Development, C# Development, Web Programming, and Data Driven Websites.  Approximately 100 faculty were trained.\n\nGoal 4 was to create an intercollegiate programming competition.  This has been a huge success and has been held 4 times, once per year, and will continue to be held each year.  The project moved from a centralized location, to a distrubted model to permit more colleges to participate.\n\nGoal 5 was to create online communities that include online supplemental instructiion.  The entire BAS degree is offered online, and includes supplemental instruction through UCF.   A Facebook page was created to help distribute information about the program and courses.  Advisors from UCF participate in the Facebook page to advise students as needed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig L Tidwell"
