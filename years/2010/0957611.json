 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Ralf Warmuth of Rutgers University New Brunswick conducts research to construct \"dynamic nanocapsules\" in water for entrapping proteins and studying the effects of encapsulation on protein activity.  Specifically, the Warmuth group is developing methodologies for the one-pot multi-component synthesis of different nanometer-sized molecular capsules using reversible acylhydrazone chemistry.   Kinetic and mechanistic investigations will be performed to gain insights into the dynamic features and stability of these capsules.  The role of solvents for the formation of these capsules will be examined.  In addition, this research group will explore methodologies for the encapsulation of insulin inside a water-soluble rhombicuboctahedral nanocapsule.  \r\n\r\nThe development of thermodynamically controlled synthesis of nanocapsules and the studies of these capsules will advance knowledge in supramolecular chemistry and have impacts on nanoscience and nanotechnology.  The investigation of the potential of these nanocapsules to entrap and influence the properties of the encapsulated proteins (especially insulin) would provide insights into methods for controlling protein activities and would broadly impact biological and medical fields.  Furthermore, this project will provide multidisciplinary research training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.",
