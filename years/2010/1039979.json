 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a long-read sequencing instrument employing a novel single molecule synthesis data acquisition system to dramatically accelerate genomic sciences at the University of Delaware (UD).  A diverse cross section of research disciplines benefit from the acquisition of the sequencer, including: microbiology, soil science, oceanography, plant biology and genomics, animal science and genomics, cell biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics.  The sequencer aids joint research and multiple-investigator projects in several UD research centers and institutes including: the Delaware Environmental Institute, the Center for Environmental Genomics, the Avian Biosciences Center, a new Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, and the Delaware Biotechnology Institute.  Thus, the new sequencer directly supports faculty research across four colleges at UD and serves as an available resource for collaborators and researchers at regional institutions, thereby benefitting UD partners in EPSCoR and other programs.  In addition, the sequencer is used to advance both graduate and undergraduate education and research, especially student training in genomics and metagenomics.  The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through a dedicated WWW-site, abstracts, and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.",
