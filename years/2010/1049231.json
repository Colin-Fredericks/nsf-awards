 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a one-hour television documentary based on the material contained in the recent National Research Council (NRC) publication, \"Origin and Evolution of Earth: Research Questions for a Changing Planet\".  The NRC publication provides a broad overview of the state of knowledge of major topics in the earth sciences, organized into a set of ten grand research questions that most concern earth scientists at the beginning of the 21st century. The publication is a compelling, rich source of fascinating, timely information from which to craft this proposed documentary. Questions about the origin of the Earth and other planets, the evolution of life, the structure and processes of the planet?s interior, the dynamic nature of Earth?s surface and its climate, and the interaction of Earth?s non-living and living elements, with emphasis on improving the understanding of human interactions with the physical environment, will be adapted from the NRC publication for exploration within the documentary. The documentary?s intended primary audience are PBS viewers watching prime-time programming, and its secondary audience are young students in high school and undergraduate general science and introductory earth science classes. The filmmakers are Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, award-winning producers of Earth Science documentaries for PBS broadcast and a range of educational uses. The chief scientific advisor is geologist Donald DePaolo, University of California, Berkeley, who also chaired the NRC committee that produced the report. The project advisory committee will comprise a diverse, multidisciplinary group of leading earth scientists, PBS production and outreach staff, educators, and staff from multicultural science education and professional organizations.  Formative evaluation to enhance the success of project objectives will be conducted by science educator Diana Curiel.\r\n\r\nThe earth science research highlighted by this media project is cutting edge, multidisciplinary, and aimed at exploring deep fundamental questions that are at the root of modern science. The documentary, by adapting the important information contained in an authoritative, prestigious NRC publication into a non-technical television story for a mass audience, will provide a credible, inspiring, widely accessible source of information that raises the public?s awareness about the latest research into the origin and evolution of the Earth, and its relevance to people. This product will be timely in that the public?s attention and concern over the hazards posed by powerful Earth processes are high as a result of disastrous social impacts and intense media coverage of recent earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. The documentary will provide an authoritative context for understanding the causes of these events, and the vital role that earth science research has played in characterizing, predicting, and greatly lessening their potential threats. The broader impact will be to strengthen public support for earth science research and increase informed public participation in civic matters of resource stewardship and risk management of natural hazards, further contributing to public safety. The documentary?s depiction of a diverse group of scientists doing interesting field work in inspiring locations will generate greater interest in earth science careers among young people of diverse backgrounds, with the effect of increasing enrollments and diversity in undergraduate earth science programs and ultimately addressing the shortage of new recruits in the profession.",
