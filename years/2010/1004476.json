 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to Rice University that will provide cutting-edge research training and professional development activities for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. This award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Engineering (ENG). The specific focus of the NSF REU program is cellular engineering, a field with enormous potential to make truly significant contributions to mankind in both medical and non-medical fields over the next decades.  The goal of the program is to expose students to cutting-edge technologies and approaches in metabolic and tissue engineering.  The summer NSF REU features:  research training in cellular engineering; weekly research seminars; training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research; leadership and  mentorship retreats; safety training; special seminars and career development workshops; stipend and travel support; on-campus housing; participation in the \"Advances in Tissue Engineering\" short course; and a capstone research poster symposium.  Students should expect an enriching and rigorous summer where they may nurture their professional and scientific development. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities. Students will be selected based on the faculty steering committee's evaluation of each applicant's transcript, personal statement regarding interest and motivation for research, and letters of recommendation.  Each year, a \"Class Notes\" newsletter of the NSF REU alumni will be published that features news on alumni's current academic or professional status and accomplishments. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the REU common assessment tool.  More information on this NSF REU in cellular engineering is available at http://nsfreu.rice.edu, or by contacting Dr. Jennifer West (Principal Investigator) at 713-348-5955 or jwest@rice.edu.",
