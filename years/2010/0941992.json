 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student interest in computing as a discipline and a career has been on the decline for several years. The use of digital media to introduce fundamental computer science concepts shows promise to rejuvenate the interest of millennial students.  This project builds on previous success to introduce the creation and sharing of artistic works into Computer Science II.  It centers on the activity of converting raw data (text) into useful information (art).  This requires students to think at multiple levels of abstraction.  The project combines active, problem-based and service learning activities.  One example of service learning is that college students volunteer as mentors at a local elementary after-school program.  Elementary school students are introduced to simple and engaging computer programs to create art.  Curricular materials are designed to be reused and easily adapted by other instructors.  The approach draws upon the literature for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups through its emphases on the creation of artistic works, collaboration, social context and reflection.",
