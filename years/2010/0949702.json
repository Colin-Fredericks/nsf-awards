 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term data on the abundance of arthropod vectors that transmit important human diseases are necessary to predict risk.  Risk of human exposure to Lyme disease is related to the abundance of blacklegged ticks (the vector) that are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the pathogen).  The objective of this research is to understand the causes of dramatic variation in risk at representative sites in the northeastern U.S.A.  Prior research suggests that Lyme disease risk is correlated with prior abundance of white-footed mice (a critical host for ticks and pathogens), and that mouse abundance is correlated with prior abundance of acorns (a crucial food for mice).  Tick and mouse populations, and acorn production, are potentially influenced by changing climatic conditions.  The proposed research will establish which climatic variables influence tick survival, mouse abundance, and acorn production.  It will clarify the nature of the relationships between acorns and mice, and between mice and ticks.  The results will facilitate the integration of climate change with forest health to predict risk.  \r\n\r\nResults of this long-term project are used for K-12 classroom teaching (including a PBS NOVA unit), undergraduate education (independent research projects and material for textbooks in ecology, conservation biology, and mammalogy), and public education (local and regional presentations about Lyme disease risk factors, media coverage in newspapers and magazines). The proposed research has strong practical implications because it allows prediction of times and places of high disease risk.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLyme disease afflicts hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.  Nevertheless, there is no vaccine and both diagnostic methods and treatments remain problematic.  Consequently, avoidance of exposure to disease-bearing ticks is the primary means of protecting the public.  Avoidance of exposure requires knowledge of what regulates the abundance of blacklegged ticks and the proportion of ticks that carry the disease agent.  This project was aimed at providing detailed knowledge about when and where people are most at risk of exposure to Lyme disease so that high risk can either be avoided or managed.  Results of this research program revealed that risk of human exposure to Lyme-disease is predictable two years in advance based on acorn production, which stimulates population growth of white-footed mice, resulting in high mouse density the following summer. White-footed mice are a critically important host for immature stages of the blacklegged tick and are also the host most responsible for infecting these ticks with the Lyme disease bacterium.  Abundant mice cause populations of infected ticks to grow, reaching a peak two summers following acorn production.  The abundance of non-mouse hosts and climatic factors can also affect risk.  This research involved long-term monitoring of acorns, ticks, mice, other hosts, and climate in one of the most heavily affected portions of the United States.  Results are expected to facilitate reduced burden of disease though avoidance and management of high risk places and times.\n\nDespite the predictability of Lyme-disease risk from past acorn production, new patterns and mechanisms emerged from this research.  For example: (1) the density of infected nymphal ticks was not correlated with the total snow accumulation during the preceding winter, which contradicts prior findings from shorter data sets; (2) shapes of relationships between acorns and mice and between mice and infected nymphs have changed through time; (3) unusually warm, dry spring weather can cause excess mortality of ticks and reduce Lyme disease risk; and (4) there is no evidence for an effect of prior abundance of white-tailed deer on density of infected nymphs.   \n\nAcorn production, which is fairly easily estimated, can be seen as a valuable early-warning system for risk of exposure to Lyme disease and possibly also other tick-borne diseases.  However, there is considerable variability in this ecological system that remains to be explained.  Acorn availability affects numerous species of wildlife, some of which positively correlate with Lyme disease risk, but others of which can reduce risk.  The exact pathways by which acorns indirectly affect ticks and tick-borne pathogens remain to be determined.\n\nThe research was instrumental in training undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers.  The results have been used in various forums at regional and national levels to inform the public and health-care providers about Lyme disease risk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard S Ostfeld"
