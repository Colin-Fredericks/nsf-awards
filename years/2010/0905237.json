 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA recent trend in the commercial, high-technology sector has been to make large-scale, proprietary computing and storage infrastructure available to the public.  Companies such as Amazon, Google, and many others, enable access to these vast resource collections via the Internet, and provide a wide range of services for accessing them (tools, APIs, resource scheduling and accounting, etc.).  Users are encouraged to think of the infrastructure as a an opaque computing ``cloud'' that delivers compute and storage capabilities in the same way that the network ``cloud'' delivers network connectivity: through a client-provider relationship governed by well-defined interfaces.\r\nUnfortunately, at present, cloud computing technologies provide support for only a limited set of applications from the web service domain.  As a result, remotely managed web hosting is, by far, the most prevalent usage model for cloud systems.\r\n\r\nWith this research, the PIs propose to design, implement, and evaluate the extensions to the services offered by the two most prevalent cloud purveyors (Amazon.com and Google) to facilitate usage by a more broad developer base (e.g., scientists and students) who require support for general compute-intensive applications.  The basis of this work will be two novel research projects that are able to implement commercial cloud computing functionality in academic settings: AppScale and Eucalyptus.\r\nThe PIs will employ these infrastructures to investigate and contribute the three fundamental technologies that are missing from extant cloud technologies but that are necessary to enable support of high-performance, compute intensive applications within cloud-based\r\nclusters:  efficient support of shared-memory inter-process communication, high-performance file system support, and system-wide, adaptive performance monitoring and analysis.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has advanced knowledge in the field of cloud computing.  Cloud Computing is a term coined for a recent trend toward service-oriented computing on cluster-based distributed systems.  From a user perspective, it is an attractive utility-computing paradigm based on Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), which is experiencing rapid uptake in the commercial sector.  Following the lead of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a number of information technology vendors have since developed ``utility,'' ``cloud,'' or ``elastic'' product and/or service offerings in the form of public and private systems.  Specific feature sets differ, but all cloud computing infrastructures share two common characteristics:  they rely on operating system virtualization for functionality and/or performance isolation and they support per-user or per-application customization via a service interface typically implemented using high-level language technologies, APIs, and web services.  This project has resulted in new techniques and software tools for\n\nManaging big data workloads in resource constrained private clouds;\nEnabling federation via spot instances between multiple private cloud systems, for offloading work and increasing utilization;\nUsing intermittently generated wind power that would otherwise be curtailed to power a large-scale cloud computing facility (zero-carbon clouds);\nManaging and governing cloud services via their APIs and novel service level agreements;\nSimplifying and automating cloud use for computationally intensive workloads by non-experts;\nand providing formal contracts and approaches for describing the functionality and behavior of cloud and web-based services.\n\n\nThe project has enabled the PIs to produce significant new results in these areas, to mentor and train students, to enage high-school and other students from diverse groups with computer science, and to peform technology transfer of their advances to successful startup companies.  The PIs have made their software advances available as open source and have published and presented their work in a wide variety of top venues.
