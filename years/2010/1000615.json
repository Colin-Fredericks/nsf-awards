 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to advance a new concept in micro-/nano-resonator development that involves the substitution of a geometric nonlinearity in an otherwise linear resonant system to realize an intrinsically nonlinear broadband resonator.  Such a resonator has no preferential resonant frequency and is nonlinear at any oscillation amplitude and across the whole frequency spectrum.  The reduced size, down to micro-/nano-scale, significantly reduces the overall system energy; this in turn makes the system sensitive to even the slightest amount of energy transfer.  Advanced tools and nanomaterials will be used to fabricate the nonlinear nanoresonator, and an integrated experimental and theoretical approach will be implemented to study the nonlinear dynamics and system instability.  Particular focus will be placed onto the characterization and analysis of the sensitivity of this nonlinear nanoresonator to energy transfers in hope to translate this new concept into development of ultrahigh sensitivity nano-sensors that can be operated in practical environments.\r\n\r\nThis research thus broadens the current research on nanoscale mechanical resonance, which is mostly in the linear dynamics regime, to the strongly nonlinear dynamics regime.  Therefore, the research will not only provide new fundamental understanding of a scientifically highly interesting topic, but also lead to the development of a new class of nano-devices for sensing applications.  The educational projects included will further broaden the impact of this project by providing appealing materials for the education of students and the public and by offering hands-on training opportunities for students, especially minority undergraduate and graduate students.",
