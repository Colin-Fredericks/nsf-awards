Participants will work together to optimize strategies for improved modeling and testable predictions. There will be three days of talks focusing on simulations of past earthquakes, fault zone structure and rheology, laboratory data on friction, energy budget for seismic activity, scaling laws and other earthquake parameters. \r\n\r\nThis is the only workshop in the past three years to concentrate on the combination of numerical modeling and observational data related to earthquake physics.",
