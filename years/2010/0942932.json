The content and stages of the new courses, Robotics I and Robotics II, are aligned with the IEEE Region 5 student robotics competition such that teaching of relevant material and building of a robot, as required by the criteria set by IEEE Region 5, are carried out simultaneously. Students in the robotics courses also engage in mentoring activities for South Texas area high school students who participate in the annual TAMUK robotics competition. The course is offered as an elective to any student enrolled at TAMUK.",
