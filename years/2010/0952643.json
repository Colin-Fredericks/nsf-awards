 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are the catalysts of life.  For such a catalyst to work, substantial reorganization of the atomic structure of the catalyst itself is required. It would be ideal to follow the catalytic reaction directly from the beginning to the end by looking at all the structures on the atomic length scale and in real time. Time-resolved crystallography is designed to achieve this. This technique is able to record up to 10 billion X-ray structures per second. Time-resolved crystallography is a true kinetic method. It investigates an ensemble of molecules in four dimensions, 3 space dimensions and the time. In order to determine a comprehensive kinetic mechanism, an additional parameter, the temperature, will be varied. Crystallography becomes five-dimensional. This project implements five-dimensional crystallography and uses it to investigate two important biological reactions: the photo-cycle in photoactive yellow protein and the photo-optical switching reaction in a biliprotein. Amongst other things, these investigations will pave the way for example for a rational design of optical switches with new colors that can be used for many applications in biophysical research.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding biological catalysis is one of the most important fields in the life sciences. Time-resolved crystallography unifies kinetic with structure determination. With the advent of the world's strongest X-ray sources, the free electron lasers for hard X-rays, five-dimensional crystallography can be brought to utmost perfection in terms of speed and smallness of specimen. This will open new research opportunities. To attract young academics, the PI will introduce macromolecular crystallography to Milwaukee's high schools by training science teachers who work as mentees in the PI's lab. A broad educational program in biophysics at the UW-Milwaukee will attract bright undergraduate and graduate students to be included in ongoing projects. Numerous trips to the world's strongest X-ray sources will give plenty of hands-on opportunities. Results will be distributed through the PI's web page so that anyone can experience the fifth dimension in crystallography.",

Reactions in protein crystals are conveniently initiated by short optical laser flashes. The progress of the reaction is probed by short X-ray pulses at various time delays after reaction initiation. For each time delay a complete data set of reflection intensities must be collected to high resolution to visualize the molecules reacting in the crystal. The entire reaction is probed from the beginning to the end by a number of successive time delays. Hence, a time-series of X-ray data is collected. Time-resolved X-ray data cover four dimensions, space and time. However, a chemical, kinetic mechanism that describes a reaction is not unique if only one time-series of X-ray data is available. Multiple time series of difference maps can now be effectively collected at specialized beamlines such as BioCARS 14-IDB at the Advanced Photon Source. For our experiments we used the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) that forms stable, well ordered crystals. When activated by a short pulse of blue laser light, PYP enters a photocycle with multiple intermediates that are populated on various time-scales from picoseconds to seconds. We established that an entire time series, about 25 complete Laue datasets from nanoseconds to seconds, can be collected from a single PYP crystal. To address damage by the ionizing X-rays and the intense optical laser pulses, we measured a short time series multiple times, and determined the number of full datasets that can be collected without changing the kinetics. We established a new dose limit, the kinetic dose limit. Furthermore, we could show why the PYP photocycle is dependent on the pH. At low pH a water molecule enters the protein and prolongs the photocycle. At high pH, the longest-lived intermediate is not populated and the protein short-cuts back to the dark state.
