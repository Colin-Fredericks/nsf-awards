 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vibratory roller-based measurement of soil properties (namely soil stiffness) during and after compaction (often referred to as intelligent compaction) offers an exceptionally promising tool to improve the construction and thus performance of earth structures (e.g., embankments, earth dams, levees, pavement & railway foundations). This grant provides funding for the creation, calibration, and validation of finite element models to interpret of vibratory roller-measured data generated in intelligent earthwork compaction procedures. The research approach will involve experimental and numerical modeling programs to quantify the relationships between real-time vibratory roller measurements and the dynamic material properties of layered compacted soil foundations. The experimental program will utilize instrumented vibratory rollers to collect force-deflection measurements on 12 configurations of layered soils; in-situ triaxial accelerometers will be used to measure subsurface dynamic response. A resonant column device will also be used to quantify the stress and strain-dependent elastic moduli and viscous damping ratios of the component soils in a controlled laboratory environment. The numerical modeling program will involve dynamic finite element simulations of the 12 field configurations, using the soils' dynamic properties, the measured roller/soil contact area, and roller loading as input and the field accelerations and force-deflection measurements as output for calibration and validation. \r\n\tThe research aims to advance efforts in intelligent construction by relating real-time construction monitoring to constitutive, performance-related soil parameters. The estimation of a soil?s elastic stiffness through vibratory roller-measured data can be directly related to designed-for properties of earth structures; performance criteria may then be tested using these data in conjunction with a quantitative mechanistic framework as opposed to empirical guidelines. To this end, the finite element models that will be created and calibrated in conjunction with experimentally gathered vibratory roller measurements can be used to close the design-construction gap and contribute to improved lifecycle performance of earth structures. The anticipated findings will be valuable to a variety of areas beyond roller-based measurement of soil properties, advance the understanding of the behavior of nonlinear, layered soils subjected to complex dynamic loading scenarios. In addition, a web-based module will be created to integrate recent advances and current research in soil compaction into geotechnical education. The web environment will take advantage of animations, videos, and interaction to convey roller based measurement principles, summarize modulus based measurement techniques, review enabling technologies, and explain modulus-moisture-density fundamentals.",
