 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) first detected dark energy, a fundamentally weird component of the Universe that carries enormous implications for both cosmology and particle physics.  This project will produce a better measurement of the properties of dark energy, including its equation of state and constraints on how much it could have changed over cosmic time.  The PanSTARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) project will use an unprecedented combination of a 3.3 degree field of view and a 1.8 m collection aperture to increase some 30-fold the current sample of about 300 objects that crudely map out the history of cosmic expansion and the parameters of the dark energy.  These new observations will have much higher quality, homogeneity, and freedom from systematic effects than has been heretofore possible.\r\n\r\nBut because it will not be possible to obtain spectra for the tens of thousands of SNIa that PanSTARRS will detect, Dr. Tonry's group has created a new powerful classifier with explicit freedom from assumptions about the nature of SNIa (such as the homogeneity of explosion, properties of enshrouding dust, or evolution with redshift).  These automatic methods use precision light curves to measure both luminosity distance and redshift for each SNIa, and can determine whether a light curve is that of a SNIa or something else.  The current project will use these techniques to classify the transient detections from PanSTARRS, estimate SNIa redshift and distance, and measure the time history of the expansion of the Universe to determine the properties of dark energy.  It will also investigate exceptionally over- or under-luminous SNIa, and critically examine SNIa metallicity effects and the properties of dust extinction.  Finally, this work will establish SNIa rates as a function of host galaxy star formation to search for SNIa subclasses arising from prompt or delayed white dwarf explosions.\r\n\r\nDark energy is apparently the main source of gravitation in the Universe, causing it to expand exponentially, and profoundly affecting galaxy formation and the creation of stars, planets, and people.  A better measurement of dark energy will constrain particle physics theories, and affect our understanding of how galaxies and stars grew in the Universe.  It is critical to carry out the most basic tests of isotropy and homogeneity, because it is certainly possible that we are being fooled by an even stranger Universe than we have dared to guess.",

Over its lifetime Pan-STARRS assembled an unprecedented view of 3/4 of the sky, and also observed a small area frequently to learn about the variable sources in the sky.  This NSF project was specifically to use the Type Ia supernovae in this variable survey to verify the existence of Dark Energy and to characterize it.  We were able to improve our understanding of the central mystery of Dark Energy: it appears to be constant and a property of space-time rather than an observtional mistake or an exotic property of the quantum vacuum.  \n\nBecause this was a newer and deeper view of the variable universe than ever had been attempted, there was a component of search and discovery in this work.  We looked for quasars at record-breaking distance, but only found them at redshifts lower than 7, which puts constraints on how old the Universe was when the first galaxies formed.  We looked for objects with very high motion on the sky, for example \"Planet X\" in the solar system or very faint, nearby stars, and we found none.  The size of the survey region was so small that this did not place very strong constraints.  We found some extremely red, low mass stars that were characterized by our collaborators.  It has been suggested that white dwarf stars could conceivably host Earth-like planets with life, and we searched for eclipses without success.  This failure demonstrates that white dwarf stars are far less likely to host planets than normal stars and therefore the chances of a habitable planet are small.\n\nThis project laid the scientific groundwork and rationale for the next generation sky survey for variable, moving, and transient sources.  The ATLAS project, funded by NASA to find hazardous objects, is a direct outgrowth from this program.  ATLAS is a pair of 0.5m telescopes that are just coming online, designed and built to maximize sky coverage and depth at a rapid cadence.  They can survey the entire visible sky three times per night to a depth of m=20.  This choice of m=20 translates to warning time for dangerous asteroids: 1 day for a Chelyabinsk size explosion, 1 week for a Tunguska-like impact, and 1 month for the largest plausible impact that would devastate a country.\n\nOutside of the solar system, ATLAS will observe a billion stars and a million quasars a thousand times a year.  All variable stars in our galaxy will be in view, and their light curves will be used to chart the distribution of matter in our galaxy: spiral arms, old bulge, ancient halo.  The quasar variability informs us of the ingest of material into the central black holes of distant galaxies, and provides information on how these black holes grow, live, and die.\n\nATLAS will be a prodigious discoverer of nearby Type Ia supernovae, and a key project will be to find 5,000 per year, determine their distances, and measure the deviation of their recession velocity compared to the normal expansion of the universe at that distance.  These \"peculiar velocities\" arise from the tug of the other mysterious component of the universe, dark matter.  There have been suggestions that this distribution is more extended than the normal, consensus view of cosmology, which would have profound implications for our understanding.  ATLAS should settle this question.  In addition, the Hubble constant is now highly constrained by this consensus cosmology, and if ATLAS measures a local deficit of dark matter it would again force us to rethink cosmology.\nLastly, ATLAS will continue the spirit of discovery that motivated this NSF program in the first place.  The LIGO/Virgo gravity wave antennas are just resuming operations and will almost certainly detect gravity wave events.  What are electro-magnetic effects of two coalescing neutron stars or black holes?  No one knows, but ATLAS will be well poised to find out.
