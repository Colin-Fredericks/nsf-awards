 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike batteries with a limited capacity of pre-stored energy, fuel cells continuously produce electricity through an electrochemical reaction. Fuel cells, specifically proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), are highly useful for automotive and small domestic applications. Ideally, these fuel cells can be relatively compact due to their high power density and could presumably replace rechargeable batteries. In addition, they could be operated at a relatively low temperature enabling rapid cold start up. However, current PEMFC technologies have not yielded a thermally stable, efficient proton exchange membrane. The main objective of this proposal is to synthesize a novel polymer-composite membrane using low-cost ceramic nanofibers. To achieve these goals, the PI will collaborate with Mona Abdel Rehim from the National Research Center in Giza, Egypt. The proposed work aims to produce highly tolerant and multifunctional PEM for advancing future PEMFC by integrating the expertise of the two research teams with a continuous collaboration in the field of applied nanomaterial-polymer composites.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. This work addresses the development of a successful and efficient proton exchange membrane, which is one of the biggest barriers to widespread commercial use of fuel cells for automotive applications. In the recent past, limited success of developing this membrane was achieved using hyperbranched polymers.  This work employs an innovative approach using nanofibers to increase the strength and stability of the membrane, which may produce successful results.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed work builds on several years of interactions and research collaboration between US and Egyptian scientists on the development of nanocomposite materials. This project will provide an opportunity to further this collaboration and to develop new materials that may be effective in improving the efficiency of fuel cells. Early career Egyptian scientists and students will be trained at the University of Arkansas with support from the Egyptian side. For US junior scientists and students, this project will provide opportunities for scientific and cultural exchange, as well as a chance to obtain an international research experience. Project results will be disseminated by publications and presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, this project will provide the US and Egyptian junior scientists an opportunity to engage in education outreach by developing hands-on activities for K-12 science classes. \r\n\r\nThe project is funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research.",
