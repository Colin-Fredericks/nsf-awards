 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chitinases are a group of plant proteins that can deter herbivory and pathogens by hydrolyzing chitin in insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. During the evolution of plant carnivory, chitinase genes may have duplicated and diverged, giving rise to some that now function in carnivory. This project will advance understanding of the evolution of chitinase genes and carnivory in the Caryophyllales, one of the major plant groups that has evolved carnivory. This study will reconstruct an evolutionary history of carnivorous taxa, study divergence of chitinase genes, determine evolutionary selection among types of chitinases, and document their patterns of gene expression. \r\n\t\r\nThis study is the first to analyze the evolution of the chitinase gene family and it relationship with plant carnivory. In addition to improving understanding of the process of adaptive diversification of chitinase function, the results will provide scientific infrastructure in the form of increased understanding of relationships between taxa of Caryophyllales. The project also will provide mentoring and research-based training for undergraduates and will transmit information on carnivorous plants and their evolutionary biology to the general public.",

Members of these chitinase subclasses, depending on the presence or absence of a C-terminal extension, can be secreted from specialized digestive glands found within the traps of carnivorous plants. We investigated the sequence homology among carnivorous plant class I chitinases and the method by which these enzymes have been adapted for the carnivorous habit. Novel class I chitinase homologs were recovered from <em>Ancistrocladus</em>, <em>Dionaea</em>, <em>Drosera</em>, <em>Nepenthes</em>, and <em>Triphyophyllum</em>, in addition to class I chitinases available from sequenced angiosperm genomes.
