 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Autonomic Computing (CAC) studies conducted by the University of Florida site (lead) and the University of Arizona site. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\t\r\nThis project proposal focuses on autonomic computing and systems, applicable to the important areas of security, fault management, and data centers. Planned are the prototypes to be deployed on test bed environments driven by the requirements from industry. The most interesting part of the proposal are applications to SCADA environments, which integrate monitoring, multi-level behavior analysis, decision fusion and risk analysis relative to security of SCADA environments. Other areas include autonomic peer-to-peer systems, as well as study related to the data centers, both at the application layer and data center hardware, where focus is on robustness.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this project will represent a significant step toward the design and deployment of highly secure SCADA systems and networks. In addition to security, the autonomic detection of anomalies in applications or subsystems of a datacenter addresses inefficiencies in data center design by eliminating the dependence on over-provisioning, which is a resource-inefficient strategy for ensuring quality of service by trying to offset any sub-system failures and malfunctions. The project has also potential for broader impact on data-intensive applications that leverage the availability of ad-hoc desktop grids for high-throughput computing.",
