This program represents a highly coordinated and interdisciplinary effort to educate Ph.D. students across the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of California at Merced, North Carolina Central University, and partner institutions to tackle the important problems in bionanotechnology spanning the molecular-cellular-tissue scale. \r\n\r\nHow living cells transduce mechanical signals to functionalities at different length scales, from inside cells to their communication with the extra cellular matrix, presents a scientific grand challenge of our times. Recent advancements in micro/nanotechnology, molecular scale imaging, and computational methodologies will catalyze this quantitative biological revolution at a cellular and molecular scale. Students who have been trained at the intersection of these domains have the potential to revolutionize tissue and regenerative engineering, biological energy harvesting, sensing and actuation, cells-as-a-machine, and synthetic biology, to name a few. Unique training efforts in this program include a two-track educational program to educate engineering and biology students to develop depth and breadth in their area of research, new experimental modules and a summer workshop introducing the IGERT trainees to state-of-the-art equipment and laboratory procedures, an exciting iWORLD program with collaborators around the world that will provide IGERT trainees with international research experiences, and a student leader council that participates in the leadership and drives the management of the IGERT.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF IGERT:  Training the Next Generation of Researchers in Cellular &amp; Molecular Mechanics and BioNanotechnology (CMMB)\n\nPI:  R. Bashir, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)\n\nOur primary goal in this training grant was to produce the next generation of intellectual leaders who will define the new frontiers of Cellular &amp; Molecular Mechanics and BioNanotechnology.  We were able to create a highly interdisciplinary environment at UIUC that educated the trainees through specific coursework designed for CMMB and empowered them to take leadership roles to address the challenges at the crossroads of mechanobiology and bionanotechnology, specifically, and across biological, physical, and quantitative sciences, more generally.\n\nThe living cell is the most fundamental building-block of all biological systems.  Recent discoveries provide evidence that mechanical signals play a critical role in cell functionality.  How living cells transduce mechanical signals to functionalities at different length scales presents a scientific grand challenge of our time and was the focus of our IGERT.  The trainees learned to use advanced tools in nanotechnology and applied them to explore basic scientific questions across the scales -- from intra cellular to cellular to cells and the extra cellular matrix and other cells.  The findings have advanced many areas such as tissue and regenerative engineering, mechanobiology, biological energy harvesting, sensing and actuation, cells-as-a-machine, and synthetic biology, just to name a few.\n\nIncoming trainees were immersed in content knowledge and technical skills in disciplines outside their own while attending the BioNanotechnology Summer Institute (offered each year 2011-2015).  Second year trainees gained leadership skills and teaching experience by leading lab activities in subsequent years.  Trainees were provided with cross-disciplinary educational opportunities through specific courses taught by participating faculty from multiple departments.  A graduate concentration in Biomechanics was developed and institutionalized in 2015.\n\nWe provided many leadership opportunities to the trainees, e.g. through membership on the Student Leadership Council, organization of seminar series, annual symposium and technical outreach to K-12 and the general public.  Our ability to challenge students to participate in lab rotations in order to experience multiple research projects with faculty involved in this program, across UIUC and UC Merced, inspired trainees to seek collaborations that may not have been apparent.\n\nTrainees had preparation in technical writing and grant proposals through workshops specifically designed for them.  IGERT trainees had numerous avenues in which to present their research:  BioNanotechnology Seminar Series in which trainees gave a 30 minute research presentation to a broad audience; the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology's Annual Symposium held a judged poster session for IGERT trainees; and several outreach activities where trainees demonstrated research capabilities to a general audience (Engineering Open House, Science at the Market, Booker T. Washington STEM Academy after school program).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rashid Bashir"
