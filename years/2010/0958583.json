Clyde, Lead PI, University of New Hampshire\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThe Bighorn Basin Coring Project will collect ~200 meters of core from each of three sites (Polecat Bench, Gilmore Hill, Basin Substation) in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming to better constrain the causes and effects of Paleogene hyperthermal events. Hyperthermals are abrupt, large-magnitude global warming events associated with extreme perturbations to the Earth's carbon cycle. Two events in particular will be targeted - the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ETM1) and the Elmo (ETM2) event. The PETM is the best documented hyperthermal and involved the release of 2,000-6,800 gigatons (Gt) of carbon from an unknown reservoir over less than 10 thousand years (ky) causing the earth to warm by 5-9\u00baC for a period of 100-200 ky. For comparison, the entire fossil fuel resource base on earth today is estimated to be ~5,000 Gt. Elmo is a smaller amplitude event that occurs after the PETM and just below the Chron C24N/C24R polarity reversal in marine records but remains poorly documented in continental sections. By applying a variety of sedimentological, geochemical, and palynological methods to the proposed cores we hope to better understand what caused these events, study the biogeochemical and ecological feedbacks that operated during them, and reveal precisely how they impacted continental environments. The Bighorn Basin preserves the most expanded stratigraphic records of the PETM and Elmo yet known, so these cores will provide an opportunity to study hyperthermals at unprecedented resolution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGlobal warming and its impact on hydrologic systems and biotas are topics of significant interest in today\u00c6s world. This project generated a high resolution record of past climate change &ndash; particularly, changes in the paleohydrologic record &ndash; and compared stratigraphic sections to the climate records to understand the impact of hyperthermal events on ancient river systems and their deposits.  Untangling the effects of short-lived, but dramatic, global warming events in the Paleogene time has improved knowledge of how the hydrologic system responds to warming and how ancient river systems respond to those changes. The results help inform our understanding of current climate change and its impacts on hydrologic systems. \n\nChanges in climate, especially paleo-precipitation, and associated changes in ancient river systems were analyzed for two episodes of global warming (hyperthermals) during Paleogene time.  In particular, the study focused on how the paleohydrologic and fluvial responses differed between the two hyperthermals because ETM2 was a shorter-lived, smaller magnitude event (compare isotope curves in Figs 2 and 4).  This project was part of the Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP).  Sedimentary rock cores from two locations (Polecat Bench and Gilmore Hill) in the Bighorn Basin, WY were collected in summer 2011 to provide the data for the study (Fig. 1).  Each core is ~200m thick and includes fluvial strata associated with either the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) or Eocene thermal maximum 2 (ETM2).  The sedimentary sections in the cores consist of: channel sandstones, heterogeneous rocks that represent channel avulsion or switching, and fine-grained strata on which paleosols developed (Fig. 2).  Geochemical analysis (following Nordt and Driese, Geology, v. 38, p. 407-410) and morphologic properties of the paleosols provide a record of paleo-precipitation through time.  Changes in mean annual precipitation (MAP) for the two hyperthermals are shown in Figs. 3 (PETM) and 4 (ETM2).\n\nAt Polecat Bench, MAP decreases and soils are drier during the main body of the PETM when global temperatures rose.  The stratigraphic section shows that changing climate impacted river behavior.  Strata deposited during warmer, drier times are characterized by closely spaced paleosols and thin avulsion deposits indicating slower aggradation (Fig. 3).  Stratigraphic intervals deposited during wetter times before and after global warming are dominated by thin paleosols and thick avulsion deposits, indicating more rapid aggradation.  Reduced aggradation during the PETM indicates that sediment supply from mountain ranges around the basin (Fig. 1) diminished in response to drier climates.  Drier episodes caused reduced vegetation cover in source areas and, thus, promoted erosion and sediment yield.  But, because precipitation was reduced, much of that sediment was stored in upstream reaches of the river system rather than moving to the basin.  With a return to wetter conditions after the PETM, upstream water flux increased, stored sediment was flushed to downstream areas, and higher rates of accretion resulted in more widely spaced paleosols, thicker avulsion deposits, and thus, higher magnitude avulsion events.\n\nThe smaller ETM2 event yields a MAP record that shows less change than for the PETM (Fig. 4C). The Gilmore Hill core shows insignificant changes in paleosol spacing and avulsion thickness.  The apparent lack of fluvial response to the climate change associated with ETM2 may imply that the magnitude of the climate change, either temperature or precipitation, was too small to affect the rivers systems.\n\n This study emphasizes that floodplain paleosols are important for constraining interpretations of how climate change impacts ancient river systems. By comparing the response of hyperthermals of different magnitudes, the study also improves our understanding of the degree of climate change needed to produce discernable cha..."
