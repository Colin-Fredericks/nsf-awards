 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project aims at developing, evaluating and refining Krey\u00f2l-based and technology-enabled learning environments for elementary schools in post-earthquake Haiti, and to initiate research on the effects of native (vs. non-native) language and student-centered technology in reading, writing, math and science. Such a study will provide crucial data toward improving education in Haiti, especially future implementation of policies on the respective roles of Krey\u00f2l vs. French in Haitian schools.  The main hypothesis of the project is that Krey\u00f2l-based and technology-enhanced education will help create more progressive, collaborative, student-centered, and inquiry-based materials and methods. These resources can constructively enlist Haitian children's cognitive, linguistic and cultural assets to help them achieve academic levels that have been lacking so far. \r\n\r\nThis project will undertake an empirical study on the impact of Krey\u00f2l-based and technology-enhanced pedagogical materials and methods on the academic performance of Krey\u00f2l-speaking students. The project will use various methods such as informal pilot programs for comparison, initial development and refinement of Krey\u00f2l-based and technology-enhanced learning environments, and qualitative assessments. The results of such an evaluation will help inform curriculum reforms and teacher training during reconstruction of post-earthquake Haiti. Furthermore, the results of this research may also shed light on issues in U.S. education related to immigrant and minority populations with native languages or dialects that are distinct from mainstream varieties of English. More generally, the findings from this project will bear on all educational contexts where students are taught in an \"official\" language that is distinct from their native \"vernacular\" language. This project further aims to plant additional seeds for research and teaching partnerships that will benefit society at large, including schools in Haiti and elsewhere.",

LKM 3<sup>rd</sup> graders read an average of 60 words/minute whereas their counterparts&rsquo; average is 23 words/minute.&nbsp; Unlike non-LKM schools, LKM teaches exclusively in Krey&ograve;l when children <em>start </em>school.</p>\n<p>LKM was awarded an <em>All Children Reading: Grand Challenge </em>grant from USAid, World Vision and Australian Aid (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph\">http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph</a>) to spread LKM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mother-Tongue Books&rdquo; (MTB) model to 5 other schools (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1reddWz\">http://bit.ly/1reddWz</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1QZB2O5\">http://bit.ly/1QZB2O5</a>). See MTB sample at <a href=\"http://apple.co/1HvbuPm\">http://apple.co/1HvbuPm</a></p>\n<p>An EGRA-based evaluation of LKM vs. 5 non-LKM schools in 2011&ndash;2013 showed that the non-LKM schools, thanks to MTB, substantially narrowed the literacy-proficiency gap with LKM within one and a half year.</p>\n<p><strong>Key outcomes in mathematics:</strong></p>\n<p>Computer- and Krey&ograve;l-based interactive pedagogy made learning joyful and deepened interest in mathematics, which interest was also expressed through song and dance: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CU4NuFcK8D0\">https://youtu.be/CU4NuFcK8D0</a></p>\n<p>Exit interviews with students and teachers suggest that the intervention contributed self-pride and a more positive attitude toward mathematics.&nbsp; Teachers reported improvement in their understanding of difficult concepts.&nbsp; They also reported friendlier teacher-student relationships through collaborative play&mdash;all too rare in Haitian schools whose <em>modus operandi </em>is usually authoritative, test-driven and rote-based.</p>\n<p>Of note, the activities introduced through the 2010&ndash;2011 pilot are still in use, even in Summer Camps: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XPNnpIePYa8\">https://youtu.be/XPNnpIePYa8</a></p>\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>This project is the first empirical study of Krey&ograve;l-based and technology-enhanced interactive pedagogy, suggesting that Krey&ograve;l can improve education in Haiti.</p>\n<p>One oft-heard criticism is that Krey&ograve;l will &ldquo;isolate&rdquo; Haiti.&nbsp; But what has isolated Haiti is ignorance, poverty and underdevelopment&mdash;not Krey&ograve;l.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well documented that the native language helps build strong academic foundations that enhance the learning of (e.g.) second languages (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1IipCLs\">http://bit.ly/1IipCLs</a>). LKM children succeed through Krey&ograve;l and good pedagogy.&nbsp; They also learn French, as second language. In 2014&ndash;2015, all 25 6<sup>th</sup>-graders passed the official &ldquo;Certificat&rdquo; exam (the national success rate was 71%; <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1fKmuBB\">http://bit.ly/1fKmuBB</a>).</p>\n<p>Our results have highlighted some of the necessary conditions for success in literacy and mathematics&mdash;key skills to acquire in early grades, toward national development.&nbsp; These results may also bear on U.S. education, especially among non-English immigrant populations.</p>\n<p>Our current NSF project (&ldquo;Krey&ograve;l-Based Cyberlearning for a New Perspective on the Teaching of STEM<strong>,&rdquo;</strong><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://1.usa.gov/1vvu75s\">http://1.usa.gov/1vvu75s</a>) targets university and high-school teachers.&nbsp; It is such faculty who can enlist other teachers, at all levels of the school system, into a nation-wide paradigm shift toward active-learning in Krey&ograve;l.</p>\n<p>Joining this paradigm shift, Haitian leaders have included our results in pleas for Krey&ograve;l as language of instruction: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/tWGw1gsGXg4\">http://youtu.be/tWGw1gsGXg4</a> , <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YBiPT-6N3eU\">https://youtu.be/YBiPT-6N3eU</a> , <a href=\"http://youtu.be/EC5Gxg06Rpw\">http://youtu.be/EC5Gxg06Rpw</a> , <a href=\"http://videohall.com/p/519\">http://videohall.com/p/519</a> , <a href=\"http://youtu.be/PSqUnOwmYH0\">http://youtu.be/PSqUnOwmYH0</a></p>\n<p>Another impactful development is the production, in collaboration with Mandaly Louis-Charles, of the first Krey&ograve;l alphabet songs: <a href=\"http://prn.to/1IvEBls\">http://prn.to/1IvEBls</a></p>\n<p>On July 8, 2015, Haiti&rsquo;s Ministry of National Education and the Haitian Creole Academy, of which I am a founding member, signed a historic agreement to generalize the use of Krey&ograve;l at all levels of education: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NaIxOv\">http://bit.ly/1NaIxOv</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1V4Ivet\">http://bit.ly/1V4Ivet</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1fKq7aR\">http://bit.ly/1fKq7aR</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1I41Re0\">http://bit.ly/1I41Re0</a></p>\n<p>We now have proofs of concepts that local languages are viable as tools to improve education on a global scale. Haiti can become a model for the use of local languages in educational technology, alongside countries like Finland which now has one of the best school systems in the world. Digital-learning tools should incorporate local languages so that technology-enabled education can have truly global reach.&nbsp; Ultimately this is a human-rights issue (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Ht9CZx\">http://bit.ly/1Ht9CZx</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1f1bFdi\">http://bit.ly/1f1bFdi</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Dissemination of results:</strong></p>\n<p>As Nesmy Manigat (Haiti&rsquo;s Minister of Education) recently explained, Krey&ograve;l is indispensable for creating schools where all children have equal opportunity to succeed.&nbsp; Eventually it is students, parents and their communities who will most forcefully promote &nbsp;Krey&ograve;l in schools and beyond.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile here are some links for more information:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mit.du/degraff\">http://mit.du/degraff</a><br /> <a href=\"http://haiti.mit.edu\">http://haiti.mit.edu</a><br /> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph\">http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph</a><br /> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1reddWz\">http://bit.ly/1reddWz</a> <br /> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1Al4TSI\">http://bit.ly/1Al4TSI</a><br /> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1EiXiYZ\">http://bit.ly/1EiXiYZ</a><br /> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1HezJEL\">http://bit.ly/1HezJEL</a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br /> </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1NEXZAY\">http://bit.ly/1NEXZAY</a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br /> </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1GW4Ike\">http://bit.ly/1GW4Ike</a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/17/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Degraff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1049718/1049718_10020974_1435980712163_chrisla_and_dieuricarme--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1049718/1049718_10020974_1435980712163_chrisla_and_dieuricarme--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A joyful mathematics song-and-dance duet by Chrisla Fleurant &amp; Dieuricarme Rivi&egrave;re at Lek&ograve;l Kominot&egrave; Mat&egrave;nwa (LKM)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1049718/1049718_10020974_1435980712163_chrisla_and_dieuricarme--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A joyful mathematics song-and-dance duet by Chrisla Fleurant &amp; Dieuricarme Rivi&egrave;re at Lek&ograve;l Kominot&egrave; Mat&egrave;nwa (LKM)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two 4th graders at Lek\u00f2l Kominot\u00e8 Mat\u00e8nwa (LKM) singing while learning mathematics in Krey?l with computer games at their 3rd session playing Krey?l-based computer games for the active learning of place value.

Krey&ograve;l, though spoken by all, is most often excluded from books, exams, official documents, etc.\n\nTo put Haiti upside up, schools must ensure proficiency in literacy, mathematics, science, etc. This concern underlies our research on Krey&ograve;l-based and technology-enhanced interactive pedagogy.\n\nObjectives:\n\nHypothesis: Active learning in Krey&ograve;l improves education, especially for students who speak Krey&ograve;l only (~95% in Haiti).\n\nParticipatory pedagogy in Krey&ograve;l that promotes critical thinking and problem solving must replace rote-memorization of French texts that most students barely understand.\n\nActivities:\n\nEvaluation      of literacy at the Lek&ograve;l Kominot&egrave; Mat&egrave;nwa (LKM) in La Gon&acirc;ve, Haiti;\nDevelopment      and evaluation of Krey&ograve;l-based and technology-enhanced tools for active learning      of mathematics at LKM.\n\n\nKey outcomes in literacy:\n\nIn 2010&ndash;2011, LKM students in 1st&ndash;3rd grades were evaluated with the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) tool (http://bit.ly/1HBYNFW).\n\nResults: Early graders at LKM are much better readers than counterparts in a World Bank / USAid study, including students in World Bank-funded schools (http://bit.ly/1ObiUf4). LKM 3rd graders read an average of 60 words/minute whereas their counterparts? average is 23 words/minute.  Unlike non-LKM schools, LKM teaches exclusively in Krey&ograve;l when children start school.\n\nLKM was awarded an All Children Reading: Grand Challenge grant from USAid, World Vision and Australian Aid (http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph) to spread LKM?s \"Mother-Tongue Books\" (MTB) model to 5 other schools (http://bit.ly/1reddWz, http://bit.ly/1QZB2O5). See MTB sample at http://apple.co/1HvbuPm\n\nAn EGRA-based evaluation of LKM vs. 5 non-LKM schools in 2011&ndash;2013 showed that the non-LKM schools, thanks to MTB, substantially narrowed the literacy-proficiency gap with LKM within one and a half year.\n\nKey outcomes in mathematics:\n\nComputer- and Krey&ograve;l-based interactive pedagogy made learning joyful and deepened interest in mathematics, which interest was also expressed through song and dance: https://youtu.be/CU4NuFcK8D0\n\nExit interviews with students and teachers suggest that the intervention contributed self-pride and a more positive attitude toward mathematics.  Teachers reported improvement in their understanding of difficult concepts.  They also reported friendlier teacher-student relationships through collaborative play&mdash;all too rare in Haitian schools whose modus operandi is usually authoritative, test-driven and rote-based.\n\nOf note, the activities introduced through the 2010&ndash;2011 pilot are still in use, even in Summer Camps: https://youtu.be/XPNnpIePYa8\n\nImpact:\n\nThis project is the first empirical study of Krey&ograve;l-based and technology-enhanced interactive pedagogy, suggesting that Krey&ograve;l can improve education in Haiti.\n\nOne oft-heard criticism is that Krey&ograve;l will \"isolate\" Haiti.  But what has isolated Haiti is ignorance, poverty and underdevelopment&mdash;not Krey&ograve;l.  It?s well documented that the native language helps build strong academic foundations that enhance the learning of (e.g.) second languages (http://bit.ly/1IipCLs). LKM children succeed through Krey&ograve;l and good pedagogy.  They also learn French, as second language. In 2014&ndash;2015, all 25 6th-graders passed the official \"Certificat\" exam (the national success rate was 71%; http://bit.ly/1fKmuBB).\n\nOur results have highlighted some of the necessary conditions for success in literacy and mathematics&mdash;key skills to acquire in early grades, toward national development.  These results may also bear on U.S. education, especially among non-English immigrant populations.\n\nOur current NSF project (\"Krey&ograve;l-Based Cyberlearning for a New Perspective on the Teaching of STEM,\" http://1.usa.gov/1vvu75s) targets university and high-school teachers.  It is such faculty who can enlist other teachers, at all levels of the school system, into a nation-wide paradigm shift toward active-learning in Krey&ograve;l.\n\nJoining this paradigm shift, Haitian leaders have included our results in pleas for Krey&ograve;l as language of instruction: http://youtu.be/tWGw1gsGXg4 , https://youtu.be/YBiPT-6N3eU , http://youtu.be/EC5Gxg06Rpw , http://videohall.com/p/519 , http://youtu.be/PSqUnOwmYH0\n\nAnother impactful development is the production, in collaboration with Mandaly Louis-Charles, of the first Krey&ograve;l alphabet songs: http://prn.to/1IvEBls\n\nOn July 8, 2015, Haiti?s Ministry of National Education and the Haitian Creole Academy, of which I am a founding member, signed a historic agreement to generalize the use of Krey&ograve;l at all levels of education: http://bit.ly/1NaIxOv, http://bit.ly/1V4Ivet, http://bit.ly/1fKq7aR, http://bit.ly/1I41Re0\n\nWe now have proofs of concepts that local languages are viable as tools to improve education on a global scale. Haiti can become a model for the use of local languages in educational technology, alongside countries like Finland which now has one of the best school systems in the world. Digital-learning tools should incorporate local languages so that technology-enabled education can have truly global reach.  Ultimately this is a human-rights issue (http://bit.ly/1Ht9CZx, http://bit.ly/1f1bFdi).\n\nDissemination of results:\n\nAs Nesmy Manigat (Haiti?s Minister of Education) recently explained, Krey&ograve;l is indispensable for creating schools where all children have equal opportunity to succeed.  Eventually it is students, parents and their communities who will most forcefully promote  Krey&ograve;l in schools and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile here are some links for more information:\n\nhttp://mit.du/degraff\n http://haiti.mit.edu\n http://bit.ly/1LBS2ph\n http://bit.ly/1reddWz \n http://bit.ly/1Al4TSI\n http://bit.ly/1EiXiYZ\n http://bit.ly/1HezJEL\n http://bit.ly/1NEXZAY\n http://bit.ly/1GW4Ike \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michel A Degraff"
