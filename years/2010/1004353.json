 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arizona's Biosphere 2 has been granted an NSF award to establish an REU Site. The award is supported by the Directorates for Geosciences (GEO) and Biological Sciences (BIO). The program will offer a 10-week summer REU experience in environmental and Earth Systems Research for 10 undergraduate students in biological and physical sciences.  Biosphere 2 is a unique large-scale laboratory for controlled scientific studies that study the interaction between biological and physical systems and the response of ecosystems to global environmental change.  The specific objectives students participating in the program are to: (1) develop research skills in laboratories, observations and/or computer modeling; (2) achieve a broad understanding of Earth system science; (3) experience the cross-disciplinary collaborations that characterize work in Earth system science; (4) network within the scientific field that will aid in their further education and research; and (5) develop an understanding of practical aspects of pursuing a career in science, including the nature of graduate school.  Each student will pursue an individual research project under the guidance of a faculty member associated with Biosphere 2, and also participate in parallel \"tracks\" that (1) give them experience with the context for how their project fits into a broader understanding of the Earth system, (2) contribute to their own professional development as young researchers, and (3) make use of the outreach programs at Biosphere 2 for understanding the responsibilities and skills required for the translation of science to the public.  The program will primarily serve students who are undergraduates at institutions without significant research opportunities, and will also make efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the Earth and environmental sciences. An important component of this program will be training students in both the practice of interdisciplinary research, and also in the ethical implications and approaches to translating science for the public and for policy.  Thus, this REU program will make important steps in training the next generation of diverse and interdisciplinary scientists for environmental and Earth system sciences.",
