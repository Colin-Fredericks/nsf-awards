 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the general question of how evolutionary changes in preferences for species-specific calls track changes in the characteristics of those calls. The question is addressed through studies of artificially produced polyploid treefrogs in a complex in which a tetraploid (two extra sets of chromosomes) species has evolved multiple times. The main aim is to determine if the preferences of artificially produced autotriploids (one extra set of chromosomes) and autotetraploids shift in parallel with changes in call characteristics in male polyploids. Parallel change would facilitate rapid speciation and indicate that such coordinated changes in communication systems may occur in all animals experiencing polyploid speciation, including all vertebrates, for which there is evidence of two ancient chromosome-duplication events. Furthermore, a significant consequence of polyploidy is an increase in cell size. A shift in the preferences of artificially produced polyploids would have important implications for studies of the mechanisms of hearing in all vertebrates, including humans, in which some pathologies are correlated with cell-size changes. This research affords educational opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students (including currently enrolled minorities and women) working on this project. This laboratory has a strong record of publishing results in scientific journals and lay publications.",
