 "awd_abstract_narration": "From their first discovery in the late 1970's, seafloor hydrothermal vent systems have been an intensive area of study in terms of characterizing the chemistry of their fluids, the biology that thrives around them, and the unique chimney structures that grow from the minerals precipitating from the fluids coming out of the seafloor.  Predicting sub-seafloor fluid flow pathways and the dynamics of how these systems operate and evolve in the subsurface, however, still remains elusive due the paucity of holistic mathematical models of the chemical and physical processes that drive these systems.  This research develops 2-D and 3-D mathematical models of fluid flow and reactive transport in high temperature mid-ocean ridge seafloor hydrothermal systems.  Resulting models take into account mineral dissolution and precipitation and how these change basement permeability, fluid flow, and flow pathways.  Goals are to test various hypotheses about what controls the distribution of focused and diffuse flow in high temperature seafloor hydrothermal systems, the extent of mineral precipitation, and the thermal/chemical conditions in the subsurface.  The RST2D software package and modifications to it will be used to model the systems.  The codes will permit fully-coupled reactive-flow investigations to be carried out which can examine the sensitivity of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems to crustal structure, permeability, thermal conductivity, chemical dispersivity, and other geologic variables. Broader impacts of the work include integration of research and education and training graduate students in computational geoscience.  Software that will be created during the course of the project builds infrastructure for science and has crossover potential to other fields, such as geothermal energy production and ore deposits.  It will be made publicly available over the web. Results of the project will be presented to the public via lectures by participating faculty.  The project will also support a PI from a gender under-represented in the sciences.",

Areas of vent fluid outflow include both high temperature \"black smoker\" chimneys that vent extremely hot (up to ~400C or 750F) focused flow, and areas of warm more diffuse fluids.  The vent fluids carry reduced metals, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide and, when mixed with metal-poor oxygen- and sulfate-rich seawater, form metal-rich deposits that are analogs of some types of base metal ore deposits.  Outflow areas also provide habitats for unusual organisms that use the resulting chemical disequilibria (sulfide vs sulfate, Fe2+ vs Fe3+, hydrogen vs oxygen) as energy sources that fuel the base of the food chain, creating oases for life in the deep-sea.

Results confirm that the mineral that most significantly affects fluid flow is anhydrite (calcium sulfate), which is unusual in being more saturated (and thus precipitates) at high temperatures (greater than ~150C) and under-saturated (and thus dissolves) at lower temperatures.  Anhydrite forms when seawater, rich in sulfate, is heated above ~150C, either by mixing with vent fluid or by being heated through contact with very hot rock.\n\nResults of this project include a best-fit model simulation to conditions of the TAG active mound.  This simulation considers convection of seawater into the ocean crust where the maximum temperature beneath the vent at a depth of 300 meters is 450C.
