In fact, in spite of their remarkable properties,\r\nwavelets are not very efficient in capturing the intrinsic\r\ngeometry of multidimensional phenomena.  In recent years,\r\ndirectional multiscale methods such as the shearlet\r\nrepresentation, introduced by the investigators and their\r\ncollaborators, have emerged as the most effective extension of\r\nthe wavelet framework to the multidimensional setting.  Indeed,\r\nthe shearlet representation encompasses the mathematical theory\r\nof affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to\r\ncombine optimal sparsity and fast transforms through the power of\r\nmultiresolution analysis.  The proposed research focuses on\r\napplications of the shearlet approach to a number of challenging\r\nproblems of analysis and processing of multidimensional data. \r\nFirst, the shearlet representation is applied to provide a\r\nprecise geometric characterization of the discontinuities of\r\nmultivariate functions and distributions.  Combining techniques\r\nfrom harmonic analysis and differential geometry, this provides\r\nthe groundwork for the development of improved algorithms for\r\nedge detection and feature extraction.  Second, the shearlet\r\nframework is applied to develop a new generation of methods for\r\nthe regularized inversion of ill-posed problems.  Building on the\r\nability of shearlets to provide sparse representations of Fourier\r\nintegral operators, efficient decompositions for the Radon and\r\nRay transforms are computed.  These are used to develop\r\nalgorithms for the Radon inversion from local and incomplete data\r\nand for image deconvolution.  Third, a novel mathematical and\r\ncomputational approach for viewpoint-invariant texture retrieval\r\nis introduced.  This is achieved by jointly designing a framework\r\nfor feature extraction and similarity measurement in an\r\nappropriate statistical setting, and relies on the unique ability\r\nof shearlets to capture local geometric information. \r\n\r\n     Over the past several years, there has been a continuously\r\nincreasing pressure to handle more efficiently the ever larger\r\nand higher dimensional data sets generated from a wide range\r\napplications such as electronic surveillance, remote sensing, and\r\nmedical imaging.  The challenge is to rapidly, accurately and\r\nreliably extract the relevant information, so that it can be\r\nefficiently processed, transmitted and stored.  The project\r\nfocuses on the applications of the shearlet representation -- a\r\nmethod introduced by the investigators and their collaborators\r\nthat provides a unique combination of optimal sparsity and\r\ncomputational efficiency, within an innovative mathematical and\r\ncomputational framework.  The notion of optimal sparsity, in\r\nparticular, implies that this approach has the ability to very\r\neffectively and reliably identify the most relevant features\r\ncontained in the data.  Specifically, this project leads to\r\nadvanced techniques for edge detection, feature extraction, and\r\ntexture retrieval from medical, industrial and satellite imagery. \r\nThis results in innovative and improved computational algorithms\r\nfor the analysis and processing of high-dimensional data and\r\nfacilitates technological advances in sensitive applications such\r\nas remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data classification and\r\nelectronic surveillance.",
