This short course aims\r\nto introduce the device physics community attending DRC to the new science and potential\r\napplications of spin electronics and optoelectronics. It will bring together world experts in spin\r\nscience and technology and it will foster student participation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The proposed short course on spin transport and devices will provide student\r\nparticipants with an opportunity to gain exposure the basic physics and potential engineering\r\napplications of spin devices. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this generation of\r\nstudents to learn how the new science and technology of spin devices is developing. These\r\nlessons will be useful beyond spin electronics, as these students will be able to apply them to\r\nfuture new materials and technologies that they will encounter during their career. Special effort\r\nwill be made to involve female and minority students in the short course by advertisement and\r\nactive recruitment. In addition, the conference proceedings will be available online through the\r\nIEEE IEEExplore which will make them accessible world-wide.",
