 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Kim Dunbar of the Texas A&M University will seek to understand the structural and composition parameters that lead to the coexistence of molecular magnetism and conductivity in the same extended framework material.  The approach is to create binary extended solids of transition metal and lanthanide cations or complexes with radical anions of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and its perfluoro(TCNQF4), TCNQCl2 and TCNQBr2 analogs.  The structures of the resulting compounds will be determined and correlated with their magnetic and conductive properties.  The broader impacts involve multidisciplinary training of students, exposure of the students to international collaboration, judging local science fair competitions, setting up hands-on exhibits at the Brazos Valley Children's Museum, and launching the magnetism website from the prior review period.\r\n\r\nThis work will expand the repertoire of chemistry that can be used to create magnetic and conducting materials starting with molecular components.  The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on a variety of applications in which magnetic materials are important, including non-volatile memory and spintronics.",
