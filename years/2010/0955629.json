 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use a variety of simulation and assimilative codes to investigate the accuracy of the energy inputs to the magnetosphere and the resulting response of the ionosphere and thermosphere.  In particular the project will assess the significance of non-hydrostatic processes in the thermosphere/ionosphere response to magnetospheric forcing.  The data sources that will be used will include neutral wind data from Fabry-Perot interferometers, satellite data from CHAMP, DMSP and NOAA/POES.   Scientific questions that will be addressed are (1) how can the uncertainty in the Joule heating in the thermosphere and ionosphere be reduced, (2) what are the global ramifications of non-hydrostatic processes caused by sudden energy inputs and how significant are the processes on thermospheric winds and density, and (3) what are the mechanisms that lead to the enhanced neutral density in the cusp regions.\r\n\r\nThe educational goals of the project include research activities to be carried out by both graduate students and undergraduate students.",
