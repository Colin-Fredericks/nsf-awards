Experimental efforts will be carried out in the following areas: (i) fluorine chemistry at the limits of oxidation and coordination; (ii) synthesis of novel cyano compounds for use as electrophilic cyanating agents and energetic fuels; and (iii) synthesis of new energetic fluorine substituted nitramines.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will have a major impact on science and technology and result in important contributions to fields such as more efficient and greener energetic materials and synthesis at the limits of oxidation and coordination.",
