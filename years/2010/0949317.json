 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient Co-limitation in Young and Mature Northern Hardwood Forests\r\n\r\nTemperate forests have long been thought to be nitrogen (N) limited, but chronic N deposition from air pollution should reduce N limitation over time, and theory suggests that ecosystem productivity should be co-limited by multiple nutrients. Experimental tests of N vs. phosphorus (P) limitation in temperate forest systems are lacking.  This study will combine modeling and field studies to explore processes mediating nutrient colimitation in relation to successional change in managed hardwood forest ecosystems.  An improved understanding of ecosystem optimization of resource use, including the maintenance of co-limitation, is important to forest management, environmental protection, and basic scientific knowledge. Balanced nutrient cycling is essential to maintaining forest sustainability, and scientists and managers at the White Mountain National Forest will evaluate silvicultural practices in light of results from the proposed research.  For example, their forest management plans require justifying intensive harvest removals in terms of the ability of forests to acquire nutrients for regrowth.  Feedbacks such as the biological enhancement of mineral weathering when nutrients are limiting are clearly relevant to this appraisal.\r\nThe Multi-Element Limitation (MEL) model represents co-limitation from the perspective of resource optimization theory and ecosystem biogeochemistry. We have extended the model to include P as well as N, carbon, light, and water, and applied it to simulate primary and secondary succession in northern hardwood forests. Using nutrient additions of N alone in some forest stands, P alone in some forest stands, N+P in some forest stands,  in replicated stands of three ages (~20, 30, and > 100 years) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, we will test the patterns of resource limitation predicted by the model and multiple mechanisms of allocation of effort to acquire N and P.  Specifically, the model predicts a greater response of aboveground productivity to N+P than N or P alone. In older stands, it predicts a greater response to N than to P addition, but in younger stands, the model suggests that the supply of N from detritus should be sufficient to create P limitation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Adequate availability of nutrients is essential for the growth of forest trees.  Historically, attention has focused on limitation of growth by single nutrients.  Nitrogen (N) has been the nutrient of primary interest in northern forests of the United States, largely because other essential nutrients are thought to be relatively abundant in the soils of these ecosystems.  However, organisms require balanced nutrition, and plants and the decomposer organisms that recycle essential plant nutrients have physiological and morphological mechanisms for achieving balanced ratios of key nutrients like N and phosphorus (P).  As one example, the production by soil organisms of enzymes that release N and P to plant-available forms is thought to adjust in a direction that increases the availability of the more limiting nutrient relative to that of the other.  It is therefore possible that the interactions between organisms and their environment maintain a condition in which forest growth is limited simultaneously by the availability of multiple nutrients.  Clarifying this distinction between single- and multiple-nutrient limitation is needed to better understand forest responses to management practices across heterogeneous landscapes and in changing environments.\n\n            In this research we examined the effects of the availability of N and P, separately and together, on forest growth and on the activities of soil microorganisms that recycle plant nutrients.  We tested whether forest growth responds more to elevated availability of N or P alone (single-nutrient limitation), or more to elevated availability of N+P together than to either nutrient alone (co-limitation).  We also tested the hypothesis that nutrient recycling processes contribute to the condition of co-limitation by promoting balance in the availability of N and P.\n\n            We tested co-limitation and nutrient recycling feedbacks in an N and P fertilization experiment in 13 northern hardwood forest stands in central New Hampshire, USA. Our stands included successional and mature forests, and were distributed across 3 sites with soil differences related to underlying rock types (granite, granodiorite, and amphibolite).  Plots in each stand were fertilized with 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 10 kg P ha-1yr-1, N+P together, or neither nutrient (control) for four growing seasons. We quantified the growth of tree stems, production and nutrient contents of leaf litter, soil enzyme activities, and the availability of soil N and P.  Somewhat surprisingly, we did not find evidence of widespread N limitation or N and P co-limitation.  Instead, we found that tree growth responded to elevated P availability in most of our forest stands.  At the same time, tree growth did respond to N in some stands, suggesting heterogeneity of soil conditions.  The variation across stands suggests that these forests are close to the threshold between P and N limitation, especially in mature forests, raising the question of why we did not find more obvious evidence of N and P co-limitation of forest growth.  Our measurements of soil N and P availability provide some insight by suggesting that nutrient recycling processes perpetuate single nutrient limitation.  For example, we found that elevated availability of P suppressed the availability of N, and other evidence from our study suggests that N uptake by soil microorganisms contributes to that suppression.  Rather than supporting our hypothesis that nutrient recycling processes interact to minimize differences in availability of N and P, our results suggest the opposite. \n\n            The findings of this study contribute in several ways to our understanding of forest growth in the northern hardwood landscape.  Tree growth appears to experience mostly single nutrient limitation, P is unexpectedly important relative to N in these northern systems, and P limitation suggests that the legacy of N deposition from air pollution has altered the controls of forest growth in this region. The spatial variation in P vs N limitation that is evident across the broad extent of our study also cautions against generalizing about regional nutrient limitation.  Finally, nutrient recycling feedbacks to the availability of nutrients in soil highlight the need to further examine microbial controls of the potential for forest stands on different sites to shift toward N vs P limitation under changing conditions. \n\n            The outcomes of this work also include societal benefits through education and science training.  Two Research Experience for Teachers participants have translated their experiences in our project into engaging field and classroom experiences for K-12 students.  Multiple undergraduate students have broadened the scope of their science training by participating in our research.  Three undergraduates conducted independent research projects under the Research Experience for Undergraduates program.  Two undergraduates working on our project gained successful grantwriting experience through Miami University competitive scholarship programs.  Three of these students presented their work as first authors on posters at Miami University's Undergraduate Research symposium, and four students have been co-authors on posters at national meetings.  Finally, two PhD and two Masters students have received training in all aspects of the scientific process, including substantive mentoring opportunities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melany C Fisk"
