 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the physical processes the couple Earth's magnetosphere to the solar wind.  The project will specifically address the processes in the foreshock region, the bow shock itself, and the magnetosheath region that lies between the bow shock and the magnetopause.  The objective is to understand these processes as a function of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation. The direction of IMF determines the position of the foreshock, properties and the nature of ULF turbulence in the dayside magnetosheath and the nature of transport processes at the magnetopause such as locations of magnetic reconnection or presence or absence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. Another important factor will be to understand how solar wind discontinuities interact with the foreshock and bow shock and how the discontinuities propagate through the magnetosheath and impact the magnetopause.\r\n\r\nThe project will primarily use global hybrid simulations (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) to examine the details of the physical processes involved.  Results from the simulations will be compared with  spacecraft data from missions such as Cluster and THEMIS as well as ground-based observations from all-sky imagers and magnetometers. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work includes participation of undergraduate and graduate students in space physics at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University and the National Autonomous University of Mexico who will learn about theory and modeling and will work on comparing simulation and spacecraft data. The results of the proposed studies will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed scientific literature. All the spacecraft data processed for this study will be made available to the community.",

Like all planetary bow shocks and those in astrophysical settings the Earth&rsquo;s bow shock is collisionless and the dissipation processes responsible for decelerating and heating of the solar wind are mediated through electromagnetic fields. Thus, our objective was to (1) improve our understanding of the dissipation processes for the bow shock and (2) how these processes impact the magnetosphere. In regards to objective (1), we have made significant progress and identified a number of new phenomena through model prediction and their verification through the use of multi-spacecraft measurements, as well as, ground based observations. As an example, Figure 1 (selected as the cover of December 2014 Journal of Geophysical Research- Space Physics) shows the plasma density (normalized to solar wind density) from our simulations with letters S1-S14 representing simulated spacecraft located near the bow shock. Upstream of the bow shock (called foreshock) large (nearly an Earth radii) density structures called cavitons are formed due to the nonlinear interaction of ULF waves generated in the foreshock. These structures are carried by the solar wind towards the bow shock resulting in the formation of new structures called spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFAs). SHFAs have a core with plasma density and magnetic field strength below solar wind values but also contain high energy particles accelerated by cavitons and the bow shock. At their rim, density and magnetic field is larger than solar wind. Our simulations and spacecraft observations have established that formation of SHFAs occurs over a wide range of solar wind conditions and that they are an inherent part of the shock dissipation processes. This represents a new and fundamental change in our understanding of dissipation processes at the bow shock. In regards to objective (2) we have demonstrated that SHFAs have significant impacts on the magnetosphere including expansion and contraction which in turn result in a chain of processes occurring inside the magnetosphere involving wave-particle interactions and precipitation of energetic ions into the ionosphere. The results demonstrate that even at times of steady solar wind conditions, the bow shock results in a time dependent magnetosphere. In general, the solar wind is typically time dependent and contains discontinuities that change the plasma parameters rapidly. Our research has shown that the presence of discontinuities leads to a host of other phenomena associated with the bow shock with significant magnetospheric impacts. As an example we mention foreshock bubbles that are formed as a result of the interaction of solar wind discontinuities with the beam of ions present in the foreshock. Foreshock bubbles are 10 or more times larger than the Earth and their interaction with the magnetosphere is global in nature with the resulting disturbances propagating all the way to the ground level. The existence of foreshock bubbles was predicted using our simulation model and verified by the THEMIS spacecraft including the ground based measurements associated with this mission. In short, our research has clearly established the significance of the bow shock in magnetospheric dynamics and has dramatically increased our understanding of collisionless shocks in general.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nojan&nbsp;Omidi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</d...",
