 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially fund the ASU secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) laboratories as an NSF national, multi-user facility. The laboratories support researchers by facilitating SIMS microanalyses for trace elements and isotope ratios. Examples of commonly requested analyses include: 1) the measurement of H2O, CO2, and trace element contents of glassy melt inclusions trapped in crystals recovered from explosive volcanic eruptions, 2) boron and lithium amounts and isotopic ratios in clay minerals, 3) a wide range of trace element microanalyses on minerals from low- and high-temperature environments, and 4) depth profile analyses of experimentally-derived samples to determine trace element diffusion coefficients. This support also takes the form of training visitors to use the SIMS technique and development of new analytical protocols in response to the needs of researchers. Visitors include undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and faculty from a wide range of Earth Science institutions.\r\n\r\nThis facility support award will make the Arizona State University secondary ion mass spectrometry instrumentation, the extensive expertise of the ASU personnel and novel analytical techniques developed at ASU available to researchers from across the US in areas including high and low-temperature geochemistry, geobiology, archaeology, climate science, and the early history of the solar system.\r\n",
