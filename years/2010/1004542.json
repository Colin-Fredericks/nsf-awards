 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, made to Harvard University, is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program and the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences. Harvard will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students each year, for the summers of 2010-2012. The scientific focus of the program is cellular and molecular biology, and students conduct research in cell and developmental biology, microbiology, neurobiology, biochemistry, genetics, and virology.  The objectives of this REU are to: (a) increase knowledge of basic biological research; (b) develop students' interest in pursuing research careers; (c) enhance related skills necessary for success; and (d) provide post-program advising and networking. In addition to their research projects, students participate in weekly student-faculty research, and in a weekly career development series, which covers such topics as choosing graduate programs, completing successful applications, and interviewing.  Special skills sessions on critical reading of the literature and strategies for preparing for GRE exams are also included.  Ethics and the responsible conduct of research topics cover rigorous experimental documentation, research fraud and misconduct, and ethical issues related to lab life.  Students participate in a peer advising/mentoring program with current graduate students and are provided additional opportunities to meet other research faculty and graduate students in both academic and social settings. Participants are recruited from a nation-wide pool, with particular emphasis on recruiting students who are interested in careers in research, members of under-represented minority groups, and those with limited research opportunities on their home campuses.  Selection is based on statements of interest, recent academic achievement and preparation in science courses, recommendations, and some previous research experience. Several mechanisms of formative and summative evaluation are employed, and will include an assessment tool common to REU programs.  Program alumni receive twice-yearly newsletters, contact information about each other, and open access to continued advising and counseling by the REU program director, their individual research advisors, and their peer mentors. These follow-up activities facilitate effective tracking.  Information about the program can be found at www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/diversity/Summer.html, or by contacting Jocelyn Spragg (PI); Sheila Thomas (co-PI); or Deborah Milstein (Program Coordinator) at 617-432-4980.",
