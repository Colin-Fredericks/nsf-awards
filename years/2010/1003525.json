 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this multi-year project Delaware Technical & Community College (Delaware Tech) is endeavoring to teach its students and the community about the concepts of a sustainable society and how to incorporate renewable energy technologies (i.e., wind, solar, and biofuel) into their lifestyles. The college is achieving this goal by incorporating renewable energy topics into existing Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology, Chemistry Technology, Biotechnology and Chemical Process Operator Technology programs and by providing outreach activities to the College and local community in the form of workshops, camps, middle and high school student enrichment activities and teacher internships. In Delaware--which has mandated that by 2020, 20% of the energy sold in the state must come from renewable sources--there is a strong identifiable need for programs like these that address sustainability and renewable energy topics as they train a workforce ready for new green industries.",
