 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on developing and validating innovative technologies for  next-generation composite aircrafts and other large structures, with intrinsic sensing properties to provide complete structural damage awareness. The work is aimed at creating a paradigm shift in damage sensing through the development of the novel Triboluminescence and Photocatalysis (TriP) system that utilizes embedded triboluminescent (TL) sensors to provide real-time ubiquitous detection of crack initiation and growth at the material level. TL crystals will be used to manufacture \"pain responsive\" composite components containing a novel \"nervous system\" of embedded nano-optoelectronic (CTiN) rods.  When stressed, triboluminescent crystals emit light, giving an indication of the location and extent of damage. The emitted light is absorbed by nano-electronic cells, which consists of nano-sized photocatalyst material in conjunction with carbon nanotubes to conduct as sensory pathways disseminating information to sensing stations.  The underlying issues to be investigated are the placement of TL crystals, light conversion, and the subsequent transmission of electrical signals using the novel CTiN rods.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop confidence in aircraft structural health monitoring through systematic investigations of material systems for embedded sensing, embedded data transfer and utilization of sensory information, without compromising structural properties.",
