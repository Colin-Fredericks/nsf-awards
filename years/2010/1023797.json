 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Chicago doctoral student, Claudia Gastrow, supervised by Dr. Jean Comaroff, will investigate the role of property relations in the emergence of new forms of citizenship. This research takes place against the rising number of disputes over urban land throughout the world. This has been particularly acute in cities of the Global South, where rapid urbanization has been accompanied by growing socio-economic inequality. The researcher will track urban residents' responses to contemporary policy interventions to understand how the lines of citizenship and sovereignty are being redrawn through the reconstitution of the urban environment and concepts of ownership. \r\n\r\nThe researcher will carry out twelve months of fieldwork in Luanda, Angola, where  housing and property have become one of the preeminent sites of dispute between the city's residents and the state since of the end of the Angolan civil war (1975-2002). As the Angolan state seeks to create a new urban centre to reflect the country's recently established peace and growing economic prosperity, urban residents are faced with the twin processes of urban destruction and construction, as well as changes in property law that have rendered illegal many forms of wartime ownership. The researcher will use a mix of social science research methods to collect both qualitative and quantitative data, including sustained observations, semi-structured interviews, archival research, and the recording of life histories. Focal research areas are: how and why conflicing understandings of citizenship are produced, 2) which processes contribute to the politicization of the built environment, and 3) how new forms of ownership and understandings of property affect political relationships. \r\n\r\nThrough reassessing the contemporary significance of property relations and housing, this research will make an original contribution to social science theory of the relationship between property rights and political inclusion. The findings from this research also will be useful to policy makers concerned with politically and environmentally sustainable urban development. Funding this research also supports the education of a social scientist.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThis project, based on field research conducted between March 2011 and September 2012 explores the role of home-ownership in the historical constitution of citizenship in Luanda, Angola. Since the end of the Angolan civil war in 2002, Luanda, Angola's capital has become the site of multiple state-led and privately driven urban redevelopment and real estate projects. After many years of relatively little construction and maintenance, urban residents suddenly found themselves surrounded by construction. This has reconfigured both the everyday experience of the city and residents' understandings of the state's urban presence. During the war period, Luanda\u00c6s residents would often complain that the state was failing in its duties as infrastructure crumbled and informal settlements grew. While these tendencies have not necessarily been reversed in contemporary Angola, what residents have become witness to is the performance of state presence via the construction of new infrastructure and the increasing use of state institutions, and at times state violence, to reshape urban geography and space. These interventions have often taken the form of forced removals and housing demolitions. In this context of growing conflicts over access to housing, this project asked how home-ownership and housing policy have been sites where Luanda\u00c6s residents have historically formed their understandings about state capacities, and the rights and meanings of citizenship. \n\n\nIn order to address the abovementioned issues, the researchers associated with the project conducted eighteen months of fieldwork in Luanda. During this time victims of urban demolitions, state representatives, architects, urban planners, members of civil society and non-governmental organizations were interviewed about their understandings of urban redevelopment, thoughts about the impact urban redevelopment was having on the geography and sociality of the city, and the relationships between housing policies, human rights, and attitudes towards the state. Participant observations were undertaken focusing on community meetings about urban poverty, local governance, land claims, and community organizing around the question of compensation and rehousing. Finally, oral histories were recorded and archival research performed to track the history of housing policy and residents\u00c6 understandings of its shaping of state-citizen relations in the post-independence era (1975 to the present).\n\n\nThe primary outcomes of the project were threefold. Firstly, it brought to light the importance of the built environment in the production of senses of urban belonging and citizenship. For example, many respondents were concerned that being rehoused would lead to the loss of their yards from which many of them ran businesses. The yard, a common feature of urban informal housing, was not accounted for in some of the rehousing projects, causing fears that residents would not be able to continue to sustain themselves. Secondly, the project tracked the emergence of a reconfigured Angolan state apparatus that emerged out of the privatizations of the 1990s. While many urban services did not improve during the 1990s, there was a significant rise in state-led urban redevelopment projects, brought about, the research suggests, by the new opportunities for private ownership that neoliberal reforms created. The research therefore suggests a strong correlation between neoliberal market reforms and increased state urban interventions both in the form of redevelopment projects, and in the form of forced removals. Finally, the research tracked the role of contests over housing in the reformation of residents\u00c6 understandings of citizenship. As demolition victims increasingly mobilized a language of rights to argue for compensation, the research found that these rights discourses intersected with the popularization of human rights discourse across organizations and groups critical of current government policies and act..."
