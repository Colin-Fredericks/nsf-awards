 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI-R2) award is to acquire an anechoic chamber for the purpose of testing devices/antennas mounted on full-scale components of construction equipment. An anechoic chamber is a specialized shielded room designed to attenuate electromagnetic energy, providing a shielded environment for characterizing the transmission patterns of antennas within the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. This unique research facility will support innovations in locating, characterizing and health monitoring of buried pipes and structures. Sample applications include the development of: a) miniature sensory systems mounted excavation equipment that will notify operators of the presence of nearby utilities, preventing inadvertent utility strikes; b) a rugged antenna array mounted on a robotic platform capable of detecting the presence of sinkholes under roadways and sidewalks; c) a new generation of health monitoring sensors for monitoring the structural condition of transportation tunnels. With the capability to test entire assemblies in a highly controlled laboratory environment, advancements are expected in areas such as rugged antenna design, the utilization of metamaterials to miniaturize an antenna's structure as well as to gain a more rigorous understanding of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in complex machine-soil-pipe environments. \r\n\r\nOnce acquired, the scientific discoveries made and new technologies developed in this facility will provide America's cities with new tools to address the increasing rate of pipelines failures associated with aging of their underground utility infrastructure, as well as the growing demands to accommodate new services in an already congested underground space. The facility will facilitate truly interdisciplinary research involving graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of civil, electrical and mechanical engineering and applied physics.",
