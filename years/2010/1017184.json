 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AfterBurner project looks at improving single-thread performance on\r\nboth simple and high-performance out-of-order cores in an energy efficient way.  Aside from explicit parallelism, this is the primary challenge of multi-core architectures going forward. The most energy-efficient way to improve single-thread performance is to accelerate low-performing program regions.  This approach yields the greatest benefit.  It also has a low cost because it doesnot require high-bandwidth execution, making it applicable to both simple\r\nand high-performance cores.  Low single-thread performance is caused by squashes due to control and data mis-speculations and by long latency loads and stores which clog the pipeline.  AfterBurner unifies two recently proposed techniques---speculative retirement which can efficiently buffer large numbers of completed instructions and selective re-execution which can re-execute dynamically generated program subgraphs to back-patch program state---and uses them to tolerate all four classes of low-performance events. AfterBurner's multi-purpose infrastructure approach to performance reduces cost, simplifies design, and expands applicability to code that suffers from different low-performance events simulatenously.\r\n\r\nIn addition to education and student tarining, the AfterBurner project marks the beginning of a systems research collaboration between Uniersity of Pennsylvania and Drexel computer science departments.",
