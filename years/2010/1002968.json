 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is continuing a successful IT apprenticeship program that provides students the opportunity to receive industry-based technical experiences while earning an associate's degree. This activity helps meet the urgent need of local employers for the emerging digital economy.  The program includes an online course for employment readiness, communication skills and job search skills.  A key component of the program is a full-time apprenticeship coach whose responsibility is to prepare students for work, monitor student progress and to encourage local employers to hire displaced workers.  \r\n\r\nGoals of the project include partnering with local industry to increase the number of available positions and to place an increasing number of students with a particular emphasis on women, minorities and displaced workers.  Mentoring and marketing strategies are being assessed and results will be disseminated to allow other organizations to implement a similar program.",
