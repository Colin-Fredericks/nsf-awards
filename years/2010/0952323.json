 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nAlgae play a major role in two areas of global concern, climate change and renewable biofuels, are emerging as prime topics on the world stage. Algae of all types account for approximately one-half of carbon dioxide (CO2) recycled from the atmosphere and 'fixed' via photosynthesis into sugars, proteins, and organic substances needed by all living organisms on earth, including humans. Thus, algae are critical to maintaining low levels of atmospheric CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. The fact that many fast growing, easy to culture algae also are oil-rich has recently drawn the attention of scientists and engineers around the globe to the possibility of using algae as an abundant, potentially inexpensive, source of renewable and sustainable biofuels that will lessen the needs for highly polluting, expensive and environmentally nonfriendly fossil fuels. Research to be conducted collaboratively between the laboratories of Dr. Don Weeks at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Dr. Martin Spalding at Iowa State University is aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying the ability of algae to serve as ?super sponges? of CO2 from the environment. The Spalding/Weeks laboratories recently discovered two proteins, HLA3 and LCIA, which provide the algal cell, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, with the ability to scavenge very low levels of inorganic carbon (CO2 and bicarbonate) from their aquatic environment. Ongoing research sponsored by NSF will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which these inorganic carbon transporters work, where in the cell they are located and how these molecules interact with other components of the cell to allow efficient CO2 uptake and utilization for photosynthesis. In addition, the use of the newly discovered inorganic carbon transporters to augment CO2 uptake and photosynthetic efficiency in algal cells involved in biofuel production will be explored.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThis research will contribute significantly to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates participating in the project at both Iowa State University and at the University of Nebraska. It also will contribute to broadening the education of high school and undergraduate students and of high school biology teachers that will participate during summer internships and camps. Because members of underrepresented groups (e.g., African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans) are specifically recruited for the high school and undergraduate internships, this research also will provide opportunities for broadening educational experiences for these groups. Postdoctoral associates and students trained in our projects will find ample opportunities in academic and industrial positions focused on algal biology and biotechnology and its application to critical societal needs.",
