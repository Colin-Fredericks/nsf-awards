 "awd_abstract_narration": "1033354\r\n\r\nKeblinski\r\n\r\nNanoscale objects, such as metal nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes, are prone to highly efficient absorption of electromagnetic radiation. When high intensity electromagnetic radiation is delivered to such objects, such as by a focused laser beam, the absorbed energy can lead to extreme local heating of and very large temperature increases in both the nanoscale objects and the surrounding medium. These highly localized thermal excursions correspond to heat fluxes that can be orders of magnitude larger than those sustained at the macroscale. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research builds upon advances in (a) laser-based ultrafast optical techniques capable of capturing relevant phenomena at pico- to nanosecond time scales and (b) computational power and modeling techniques allowing simultaneous examination of such systems experimentally and theoretically at the same temporal and special scales. In particular, molecular dynamics simulations and time resolved pump-probe experiments will advance the understanding of heat transfer, phase transformation, and phase equilibria arising at the interface between the nanoscale solids and a surrounding liquid.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The research focuses on the exchange of thermal energy between an intensely heated solid nanoparticles and a surrounding liquid. This has important implications for biomedical applications such as highly selective thermal therapy for cancer treatment.  Graduate students engaged in the research will make contributions in heat transfer, materials science, soft-hard matter interactions, and phase equilibria. Undergraduate students will also be engaged in the research. Pertinent visual-learning and web-based tools will be developed to integrate the research and education activities.",
