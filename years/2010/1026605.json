 "awd_abstract_narration": "Land conversion and climate change are rapidly changing the provision, use, and value of ecosystem services on the rural-urban fringe landscapes. Most previous ecosystem service studies addressed the effects of either land conversion or climate change, but not both, on individual ecosystem services. Additionally most ecosystem services models have yet to be well-validated with plot-level data and observed dynamic effects. As a result, methodologies for measuring the changes in the magnitude and the spatial patterns of ecosystem services and tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services are still being developed and tested. An interdisciplinary team of scientists, including geographers, environmental economists, ecologists, and policy analysts engaged with community partners, will use two ecosystem service assessment models (InVEST and Counting on the Environment metrics) and modern spatial analysis to quantify expected changes in ecosystem service provision, use, and value on a rapidly changing rural-urban fringe landscape in the Northern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. The researchers will first analyze the biophysical provision, use, and economic value of ecosystem services on the current landscape at various scales, from farm to landscape. They will assess how these levels and values of ecosystem services are expected to change in the study region due to land use/land cover and climate change, separately and jointly, at multiple spatial scales. The investigators will determine what areas, if used less intensively or conserved, would most cost-effectively prevent any expected declines in the value of ecosystem services on the landscape where cost-effectiveness is measured as ecosystem service value generated per economic opportunity cost of conservation. This project will compare the outputs of two ecosystem service models and recommend improvements when possible. The investigators will engage policy stakeholders in the analysis to explore the interaction of ecosystem service science, scale, and complex policy negotiations. In all stages of analysis this project will assess the provision and pattern of species habitat in the study area and its ability to sustain native species, such as anadromous fish.\r\n\r\nThis project will improve the ecosystem service provision and value analytical methodologies as well as advance the theory of ecosystem service modeling by testing two models with field data. This research will thus illuminate the unexplored area of tradeoffs and complementarities among multiple ecosystem services shifts and spatial targeting for land conservation to sustain ecosystem services in a rapidly growing metropolitan fringe. The integrated, spatial approach will provide an excellent model for spatial ecosystem services studies, offering opportunities for transforming the studies of integrated environmental sciences and management. This project will support provisions of the 2008 farm bill that mandates the development of tools for assessing the influence of land management on ecosystem services by guiding regional planning and site-specific assessment tools that help on-the ground implementation. The project will produce a rich collection of data and analytic tools that will directly assist the ongoing development of comprehensive ecosystem service marketplaces. An information clearinghouse will provide the range of stakeholders collaborating on the creation of the marketplace (researchers, state and federal agencies, policy makers, and NGO?s) direct access to project results and datasets for evaluating policy options. The research will provide educational opportunities for several graduate and undergraduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLike many parts of the world, the northwestern Willamette Valley is likely to be affected by climate change and by increasing urbanization.  This project was part of a larger inter-disciplinary collaboration that explored how these two perturbations are likely to alter the provisioning of ecosystem services in the northwestern Willamette Valley.  This part of that larger collaboration focused on stream temperature.  Temperature is an important habitat component for a number of aquatic animals, notably salmon.  Streams throughout the region regularly experience temperatures that are too warm for salmon, and as a consequence temperature has become the focus of regulation and mitigation efforts.  We suspected that anticipated climate and landuse changes will exacerbate these issues and hinder the effectiveness of mitigation efforts.  We tested this hypothesis by first creating maps of future climate and landcover for our study area into the middle of this century (e.g. Fig. 1). These scenarios of future change were based on established climate and economic models, and were informed by collaboration with local stakeholders.  We then modeled stream temperature under the different climate and landuse scenarios using a process-based hydrological model called SWAT-Temp.\n\nResults from our model indicate that overall stream temperatures throughout the study region will increase as a result of predicted climate change (Fig. 2).  Under these scenarios, streams throughout the study region are expected to exceed temperatures that negatively affect the survival and growth of salmon over much of the summer.  Only the highest and most heavily forested watersheds will be minimally impacted.  In our modeling, landuse changes driven by urbanization had only a minor influence on stream temperatures.  However, this result might reflect the limitations of the SWAT-Temp model to account for solar insolation changes associated with landuse change.  Still, the hydrological factors associated with landuse such as stream and groundwater flows seem to have a relatively minor influence on stream temperature in our study area compared to the influence of climate drivers. \n\nThese results indicate that climate change will have a significant negative impact on the thermal habitat of streams in the study area.  Strategies such as riparian restoration that are designed to improve thermal conditions can still potentially be effective.  However, climate change will likely cause an overall degradation of thermal conditions in streams and significantly complicate local scale mitigation and adaptation efforts. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John G Lambrinos"
