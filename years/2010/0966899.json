 "awd_abstract_narration": "The redox state controls many important chemical reactions in natural systems, including the reactions in the deep interior of the Earth.  The oxidation state of iron has been extensively used to infer the redox state.  It has been well understood that the upper mantle has reducing redox conditions and thermodynamic studies have predicted even more reducing conditions in the lower mantle.  However, recent studies at pressure-temperature conditions related to the topmost lower mantle have shown that about 60% of iron in the dominant lower-mantle mineral, magnesium silicate perovskite, is ferric.  This is very surprising because only 2% of iron is ferric in upper-mantle minerals.  If this result is extrapolated to the deep lower mantle, it would imply that the lower mantle is chemically distinct from the upper mantle, which may conflict with recent seismic tomography evidence of mixing between the upper and lower mantle.  \r\n\r\nOur preliminary work showed that the oxidation state of iron in mantle silicate perovskite is strongly coupled with the electronic configuration of iron at high pressure.  As recent studies have shown that the electronic configuration of iron in mantle minerals changes with depth, our preliminary work implies that the oxidation state of iron may change with depth as well.  In addition, aluminum in silicate perovskite can influence the oxidation state of iron.  In this project, we will combine experiment (Shim) and theory (Morgan) to measure how the oxidation state of iron in lower-mantle silicate perovskite changes with depth and composition.  In the experimental effort, we will measure the oxidation state of iron by controlling the redox state of the sample chamber to that of the lower mantle at high pressure-temperature. We use ab-initio based techniques, which solve the fundamental quantum mechanical equations for the material, to predict reaction energies and volumes as a function of composition, pressure, and temperature.  This joint effort will provide graduate students and postdocs with new opportunities to combine experimental and theoretical approaches.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIron is the most abundant element with variable oxidation states in the mantle, volumetrically the largest layer.  The variable oxidation state has important effects on the redox conditions, volatile storage, and physical properties of the lower mantle.  Supported by this grant, we have studied how electron configuration of iron in mantle minerals changes a range of different properties of the lower mantle by combining high-pressure experiments and ab initio computations.  Earlier studies have suggested that the lower mantle may be extremely reducing because of the precipitation of metallic iron from the dominant lower mineral, bridgmanite, through internal oxidation of ferrous iron. However, the internal oxidation process under realistic redox conditions for the lower mantle have been studied only at very shallow depth conditions.  By developing new experimental techniques, we have been able to explore the internal oxidation for the entire pressure range of the lower mantle under reducing conditions for the first time.  Our new experiment shows that the internal oxidation stops occurring at 1100-1700 km depths and therefore does not produce metallic iron at the depth range.  Possible absence of major reductant, metallic iron, may change the redox conditions at the depth range.  For example, the redox conditions of the layer may be favorable for storage of carbon as diamond.  The behavior would also result in higher viscosity at the depth range, providing a possible explanation for the impediment of mantle flow near the depths suggested by recent high-resolution seismic images.  Computer simulations supported by this grant have both helped interpret experiments and enabled numerous properties of Fe in the deep earth to be predicted that were otherwise difficult or impossible to assess experimentally due to the high pressures and temperatures involved.   We have combined ab initio techniques, which solve the fundamental quantum mechanical equations that describe atoms, with thermodynamic and kinetic modeling to explore Fe spin, valence, phase stability, and diffusion.  We have been able to build a model to predict the speciation of Fe, which describes its tendency to form different charge states, spin states, and partition to different phases, as well as modeled its diffusion in the deep Earth.  Combined with our experimental results, this modeling provides a complete integrated picture that incorporates laws of thermodynamics and kinetics as well as state of the art experiments and ab initio energetics from this and other published work.
