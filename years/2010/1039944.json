 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Chemistry Division, Alexandra C. Stenson and colleagues Norris W. Hoffman, James  H. Davis and Scott A.  Miller from University of South Alabama will acquire an ion trap mass spectrometer.  The instrument will enhance research efforts: a) to make in-roads in the structural characterization of natural compounds of geo and marine chemical importance, b) to improve and enhance CO2  capture by ionic liquids, c) to develop expanded passenger- and cargo-screening capabilities for explosives, d) to determine the original use for ancient pottery through analysis of organic residues left behind, e) to improve current synthetic catalysts and develop new ones, f) to develop/lay the groundwork for new pharmaceutical scaffolds, g) to aid the regulation of insect lures and traps for agricultural use, and, h) to improve selectivity in common HPLC columns and/or enhance the predictability of this selectivity.\r\n\r\nMass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. The ion trap is a particular design for the mass analyzer that separates the ions for subsequent identification at the detector.  Undergraduates in several departments at the University will be trained in this widely employed analysis technique as they use it in their research projects and in laboratory courses.",
