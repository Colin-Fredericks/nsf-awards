 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will examine the nature of plasma fluctuations in various regions of the magnetosphere using a new analytical method called rank-ordered multifractal analysis (ROMA).  The goal is to understand the nonlinear stochastic behavior of space plasmas and in particular the phenomenon known as intermittent turbulence.  In parallel with the analytical analysis, the project will use a combination of numerical and theoretical modeling called the Direct Simulation Renormalization Group (DSRG), which is a dynamical invariant theory appropriate for the quantitative study of crossover behavior of multifractals.  Results from the theoretical and numerical analyses will be compared with observations obtained from satellite missions.\r\n\r\nThe analytical and numerical techniques that will be further developed by this project have the potential to not only provide a transformative view of plasma phenomena in Earth's magnetosphere, but have the potential to be widely used in the analysis of a wide array of phenomena beyond plasma physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRecent observations in space indicated that the dynamical behavior of the space medium of charged and neutral particles commonly exhibited random, intermittent, and anisotropic fluctuations at all spatiotemporal scales while interacting with the electromagnetic environment.  Such observations have led theoreticians and experimentalists alike to regard the random dynamic processes (intermittent turbulence) of the space medium as prime candidates of naturally occurring examples of \"dynamical complexity\".\n\nComplexity can arise from an interacting system composed of many individual elements.  If the rules of engagement are nonlinear, quite often large scale structures are generated -- each composed of many individual elements behaving more-or-less coherently together.  Such \"coherent structures\" can have varied sizes.  In the stock market, examples of the coherent structures are the hedge funds, investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, wealthy individuals and investment clubs.  The ensuing behavior resulting from the diversified interactions of these structures may become very complicated and sometimes almost incomprehensible.\n\nSimilar situations may occur in space.  When large numbers of electrons and ions interact nonlinearly in an electromagnetic environment (called a \"plasma\" by Langmuir in 1928 because of the likeness between the electrons and ions in an ionized medium and the red and white corpuscles in a blood plasma), coherent structures of assorted types and sizes are usually generated.  These structures may be in the form of drifting vortices, tubes of magnetic fluxes, current filaments, regions of depleted ions or electrons, potential drops, and other kinds of stationary and convecting structures.  Figure 1 depicts such an ensemble of interacting structures generated from a large scale numerical simulation.\n\nThe main purpose of this collaborative research (between MIT and UCLA) was to demonstrate the prevalence of intermittent turbulence in space plasmas and to develop new statistical methods as well as theoretical and numerical techniques to analyze this kind of dynamical processes.\n\nPerhaps the most important contribution of this basic research to the science of complexity is the invention of an entirely new method of understanding the phenomenon of intermittent fluctuations. The method, Rank-Ordered Multifractal Analysis (ROMA), is briefly described below.\n\nWe begin the discussion with a conceptual description of \"fractals\" by visualizing the fluctuations of the space medium as individual geometrical objects such as little spheres.  It is clear that most of the time these geometrical objects cannot be stuffed into a three-dimensional box without any voids among them.  In other words, the volume that the fluctuations can occupy is generally a fraction of the available three-dimensional space of the box, or a \"fractal. \n\nFor intermittent turbulence, one may visualize the fluctuations to be composed of many types, each being characterized by a particular \"fractal\". Two questions then naturally arise: (i) What are the different types of fractals? and (ii) How are these fractals distributed in the turbulent medium?  The new method \"ROMA\" is developed specifically to address these questions\n\nROMA describes the full intermittent turbulent behavior of a medium in terms of a set of definitive functions of rank-ordered scaling variables.  For example, the fluctuating behavior of the interacting current filaments of Fig. 1 can be shown to be characterized by only two continuous functions of a single rank-ordered scaling variable.  The ability of representing complexity behavior in terms of simple functions of rank-ordered variables is truly remarkable, a possibility totally unimaginable only a few years ago. \n\nSince the introduction of ROMA, this technique of analysis of intermittent fluctuations has been applied by researchers in space plasmas to nearly all regimes of the solar-terrestrial environment.
