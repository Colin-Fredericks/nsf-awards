 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to acquire a Gas Chromatograph coupled to a Mass Spectrometer detector (GC-MS) and an Accelerated Separation Extraction (ASE) system. The instruments will be used to extract and characterize the organic composition of sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) samples impacted by the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Particular attention will be given to petroleum biomarkers (e.g., hopanes, steranes, terpanes) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are predominant components of oils and are expected to be found at increased quantities in the area affected by the spill. GC-MS analysis of a several month-long time series of sediment and POC samples will be used to identify and quantify transformations of the oil-derived organic matter with time and distance from the spill site. The PI will compare the composition and degradation products of oil-impacted samples throughout the water column, from the surface to the subsurface plumes observed in the Gulf.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe analyses proposed here will benefit the Gulf oil spill efforts by rapidly characterizing the oil degradation products in the spill region, quantifying their differences throughout the water column as a function of different degradation process, and identifying their assimilation by the bacteria community. This will provide new insights in the biogeochemical response to a massive oil spill that will aid to informed decision making in the current response effort in the Gulf of Mexico. In the long term, the acquisition of an GC-MS and extraction system will complement courses offered by the Marine Science department through the implementation of laboratory sessions by the PI. Instruments will be made available for use by other researchers at UGA. A graduate student will work in collaboration with the PI on the analyses of Gulf of Mexico samples using both instruments.",
