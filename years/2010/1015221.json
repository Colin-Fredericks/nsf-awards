 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent observations of episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events in multiple subduction zones constitute a new deformation mode at active plate boundaries. ETS consists of low-frequency non-impulsive seismic radiation (``tremor\"), coupled with geodetically observed slow slip events (SSE) with durations of order weeks. The occurrence of ETS events poses significant questions as to their origin, and also relative to existing concepts of interseismic loading of the locked seismogenic regions. For example, what are the physical causes of ETS? What controls the observed features such as the recurrence period and migration pattern? What are the seismic consequences of imposing steps in the otherwise steady stress accumulation on the updip seismogenic zone?\r\n\r\nPrevious numerical studies in the framework of rate and state-dependent friction can produce slow slip events with features, such as the slip velocity, recurrence period and slip propagation speed, that are qualitatively similar to those inferred for natural events. However, slip is assumed to take place on a planar fault embedded in a half space with uniform elastic moduli, under time-independent fluid pressure. Such model simplifications have prevented us from using the increasingly rich SSE geodetic data to constrain the downdip fault zone rheology and to investigate its effects on the strength of the seismogenic zone. The goal of this study is to construct a more realistic subduction fault model that encapsulates the essential physics of SSEs and tremors as well as constraints from laboratory and field observations, and to study their relation to megathrust earthquakes. The PI will develop a more complete physical description of fluid transport, pore dilation and pressurization, specifically, to incorporate the dilatancy-strengthening and shear heating induced fluid pressurization into the rate and state modeling. This will allow the researchers to investigate how the occurrence of SSEs could affect the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes and the spatial extent of earthquake ruptures. Second, to constrain the assumed rheology of the fault zone, they will apply frictional properties from lab measurements of different types of rocks, and investigate the fitting of 3D model results to geodetic data on SSEs in the Cascadia margin. They will use finite element method (FEM) in the construction of a non-planar fault model that more realistically represents the Cascadia subduction interface. Finally, they will study the relation between slow slip events and tremors (including low-frequency earthquakes) by identifying the favorable conditions for tremor excitation due to tidal or teleseismic stress triggering.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of ETS events in subduction zones poses significant puzzles and changes the way we think about the interseismic loading and overall mechanical budget on active plate boundaries. Improved understanding of their physical basis and their implications for the updip and downdip limits of megathrust ruptures may increase our knowledge for earthquake forecast and seismic hazard assessment. The development of a 3D Cascadia subduction fault model with rate and state friction will help interpret EarthScope geodetic data sets. The FEM approach will allow general applicability of this model to simulate SSEs and earthquakes rupture processes in other subduction zones and continental faults. The area as it will be addressed is rich, involving inputs from several disciplines, including laboratory rock physics, geodesy, petrology, seismology, and mechanical and hydraulic modeling concepts. This proposed project also contributes to the education of a WHOI/MIT Joint Program graduate student.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award was focused on developing numerical models of earthquake rupture and fault failure for the Cascadia subuction zone in the Pacific Northwest.  One key feature of this plate boundary fault is the existence of Episodic Tremor and Slip events which occur every 14 months and allow the deeper part of the fault to slip slowly without radiating seismic waves or causing damage.  Understanding the physics that controls these events is very important for estimating what the shaking will look like in next great M9 Cascadia earthquake.   Most of the uncertainty in what that event will look like comes from our lack of ability to predict how far onshore rupture will propagate.   Will it stop at the coast or make it all the way to Puget Sound and cause much greater damage.    To understand this ahead of time requires being able to model the fault physics in the ETS region and just shallower than it.\n\n   Many key results of this project were published in Geophysical Research Letters in 2013 by Yajing Liu.   The numerical model developed for this work allowed for the consideration of the temporal evolution of both fault friction and fluid pressure and porosity over the ETS and great earthquake cycle.  The models showed how the downdip extent of the large earthquakes is controlled by the material properties of the fault zone.  In particular, the parameters which desribe how the fault dilates as a response to increases in slip speed within the ETS zone directly control the downdip extent of large earthquakes.  The models also demonstrate how the duration and magnitude of ETS events may be related to the dilateancy parameters.  As numerical models become ever more realistic and the physical parameters of the fault-zone are better constrained, models of the type developed here can help inform seismic hazard estimates in subduction zones.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey J Mcguire"
