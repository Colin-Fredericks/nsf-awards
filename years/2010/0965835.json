 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is recruiting, retaining, supporting, and placing students pursuing Associate, Baccalaureate, and Graduate degrees in General Science, Computer Science, Math, Natural Resources, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, and other eligible STEM fields. A minimum of 30 total scholarships are being awarded over the lifetime of the project. S-STEM scholars are provided an array of support services to improve chances of success, and successful participants are placed in jobs or provided opportunities for further education. Scholar support is offered through natural cohorts, an American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) chapter, and by providing Elder Mentors for the scholars for cultural relevance and to improve student retention rates. Other student support elements include: student tracking, internal evaluation, dissemination, cohorts, research and internship opportunities, mentorships, strong faculty support, and a commitment to infrastructure improvements. This project is expected to serve as a model for other similar projects, especially at other Tribal Colleges and Universities.",
