 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why did America vote as it did on Election Day?  The core mission of the American National Election Study (ANES) is to inform explanations of election outcomes by providing data that support rich hypothesis testing, maximize methodological excellence, measure many variables, and promote comparisons across people, contexts and time.  The ANES serves this mission by providing researchers with a view of the political world through the eyex of ordinary citizens.  Such data are critical, because these citizens' actions determine election outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis research continues the ANES mission for the next four years, but in new and better ways than before.  It builds on an ANES history that has mde the project a valuable resource to generations of social scientists.  As has been true for past presidential election in the ANES times series, a presidential year pre- and post-election study will be conducted using face-to-face interviewing of a nationally representative sample of adults.  This study will include questions specific to the election of 2012 and also questions that augment the ANES time series, which is now in its sixth decade.  In addition, scholars will be able to add questions onto the instrument through competitions in the Online Commons, which was an innovation of the previous ANES award.\r\n\r\nLike previous ANES awards, this project continues to provide innovations in the data collection process as well as the study of substantive subjects.  With regards to the former, a parallel internet based survey will done in conjunction with the face-to-face time series.  This will allow for a mode comparison between the two methods.  With regards to the latter, project will conduct additional phone and internet based surveys during the midterm election period and the primary season leading up to the presidential election.  The specifics of these studies will be determined by an array of scholars.\r\n\r\nBy generating large multifaceted datasets of high quality, the ANES will equip researchers to learn new and important lessons about the world of politics.  These data will be distributed widely and quickly to serve thousands of scholars and to be used in classrooms around the world to enrich research and education.  The ANES will help to inform the nation about itself, exploring the causes and consequences of voting behavior andelectoral outcomes.  With such knowledge, the policy will be better equipped to nurture and refine its system of government.",
