By mapping these differences, the project will help bridge the gap between what is taught in college and what students need to know to become effective civil engineers.   Using the results of this research, educators understand  be able to develop curricular materials that allow students to more rapidly enter the professional practice of engineering.  A key aspect of this project is sharing the teaching tools widely among other universities.",
