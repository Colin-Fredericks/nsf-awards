 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will investigate the impact of non-magnetohydrodynamic (non-MHD) effects on the dynamics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and shocks in the inner heliosphere, and in particular, on the CME acceleration profile, shock strength, and geometry. The Principal Investigator (PI) also plans to study the role of magnetic reconnection in the initiation and liftoff of a CME and its subsequent propagation in the heliosphere, using a global MHD code developed by her collaborators at the University of Michigan. \r\n\r\nGlobal heliospheric simulations usually include non-ideal processes in terms of numerical dissipation and anomalous resistivity. To bridge the gap between small-scale kinetic modeling and global simulations, this team will use a simulation code and \"Space Weather Modeling Framework\" developed at the University of Michigan to quantify the interaction between large-scale global magnetospheric dynamics and microphysical processes in diffusion regions near magnetic reconnection sites.  This code will incorporate a new mechanism for controlling dissipation in the vicinity of reconnection sites, in terms of non-gyrotropic corrections to the magnetic induction equation. Such non-gyrotropic effects have been demonstrated to significantly alter the global evolution of the Earth's magnetosphere, and their inclusion in heliospheric MHD simulations is a very promising new approach. \r\n\r\nThe PI is very active in mentoring female students and postdocs. The team enhances diversity in the solar physics community by including several female researchers who will be role models for young women interested in the physical sciences and engineering. This research program will include the training and participation of a female PhD student at George Mason University, as well as a collaboration with a female scientist at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This study is directly relevant to space weather forecasting, since it will enhance the capabilities of the Space Weather Modeling Framework now in wide community use.",
