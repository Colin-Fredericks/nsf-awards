The US principal investigator is Patrick Rousche from the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The foreign collaborators are Michael Coey in Ireland, James McLaughlin in Northern Ireland and Thomas Stieglitz in Germany. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of these visits is to form an international multi-disciplinary team to create, implement, and foster a novel field of study the researchers call ?nanoneuronics.? They define nanoneuronics as a new discipline with the goal of harnessing the collaborative power and knowledge of nanotechnology, neuroscience, electrical engineering, neural engineering and ethics for the design and development of advanced medical interventions with the nervous system. The primary research goal of this effort will be the incorporation of nanotechnology towards the improvement of implanted medical devices in the nervous. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts include the international cooperation; training of U.S. graduate students by providing an early career introduction to collaborative international work in advanced areas in two leading industrial countries; and promotion of a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship.\r\n\r\n",
