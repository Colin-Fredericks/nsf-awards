 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cynthia M. Friend of Harvard University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore the role of the interface in hybrid Au/TiO2 on the catalytic oxidative transformations of organic species on these hybrid catalysts.  Oxygenates will specifically be investigated because of their prevalence in important chemical processes, including production and processing of alternative fuels.  The experimental plan is designed to test the hypothesis that the transfer of active oxygen across the metal oxide-metal interface may be an important step in this process.  Molecular-scale imaging using STM will be employed to characterize the surface, and product distributions and reaction temperatures will be used as a probe for the migration of active oxygen across the Au/TiO2 interface.  The electronic structure of sites near the Au-TiO2 interface will be probed with theoretical DFT methods. \r\n \r\nThe project will tackle a key fundamental issue in heterogeneous catalysis: the effect of metal-metal oxide interfaces in determining the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes of significance to alternative energy research.  The educational activities include a renewed commitment to recruit future generation of scientists from members of traditionally underrepresented groups into the research program, and a renewed focus on educating the public on energy-related issues.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSome of the most pressing technological issues facing the world today revolve around energy and the environment.  There is a desire to shift to the production of chemicals and fuels to renewable resources to reduce dependence on oil; additionally, removal of noxious molecules from the atmosphere is important for improving air quality.  Solutions for both of these problems require efficient transformations of organic molecules and the use of solid materials to harness the energy of sunlight provides one avenue for driving these key processes.\n\nTo do so, we need solid materials that can absorb light in the solar spectrum and use that light to drive chemical reactions.  Materials that can use light to drive chemical reactions again and again are called \"photocatalysts\".  Currently, there are challenges to using photo-catalysts that can be met through understanding how they work.  This is a major challenge that calls for creative solutions!\n\nFirst, we need to understand how to manipulate the composition of photocatalysts so they absorb light in the solar spectrum, which spans ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation. Different materials absorb light of different colors (energies).  Titania, the material studied in our project is white to the eye and absorbs ultraviolet light that accounts for ~3% of the solar spectrum.\n\nFor the light energy to be used productively for a chemical reaction, it must create separated charges&mdash;negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions, called holes.  These separated charges are only temporarily created. They attract each other and will combine and lose their ability to promote chemical reactions.  One of the key features of a good photo-catalyst is to keep the positive and negative charges separated as long as possible so they have a chance to drive chemical reactions, like decomposition of polluting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). \n\nThe energies of the electrons and holes are also important in determining what chemical reactions can be driven.  There needs to be a way that the electron or hole can be transferred to a molecule in order for the energy that came originally from the light to be used for chemistry.   The chemicals that we want to change must be bound to the surface in order to receive the charge&mdash;in other words, the molecules must be close to either the electrons or holes.  There also must be a matching of the energy levels of molecules bound to the surface of a photo-catalyst and the electrons or holes.  You could think of this like one person (the solid catalyst) handing a \"hot potato\" (the electron or hole) to another person (the molecule).  If your hands are not aligned, the hand off will not be successful!\n\nIn order to understand the \"hand off\" of charge to reacting molecule, we have studied how different molecules react on titania, a common photocatalyst.  We have studied how to use light to decompose various pollutants; for example, formaldehyde, a common indoor pollutant derived from decomposition of plastics and synthetic materials.  We have also studied how to synthesize important chemicals that are used in flavors and fragrances using light. Our fundamental studies of surface chemistry under idealized conditions and associated computer-generated models establish guiding principles for photocatalysis in this project. Our work has established the roles of changing composition in charge carrier (electron-hole pair) recombination and bonding of molecular intermediates to the surface that affect the \"hand off\".  We used titania is used to illustrate these effects, but similar factors are probably also important in photocatalysts.\n\nWe have learned a lot, but there is still a great need to explore and understand how to design efficient photo-catalysts to solve important problems in energy and the environment.  Exploring the vast array of materials that can absorb light while using the paradigms developed through basic studies has great potential.\n\n \n\n \n\n..."
