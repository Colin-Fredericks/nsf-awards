This research will expand on the Misra-Budig-B\u00f6eckmann Family Policy Database to determine how policies affect the risk of and the depth of impoverishment among women across twenty-two countries and five time periods by combining the policy data with the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). This will allow stronger claims about the relationships between work-family policies and poverty.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nBy examining the impact of a variety of work-family policies across twenty-two nations and five time periods on poverty, this research will provide important answers about the relationship between particular policies and poverty outcomes.",
