 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the Plant Bioscience Technician (PBT) program at Leeward Community College (LCC), which serves as a model program for technicians in the diversified agriculture industry. The project contributes to a well-educated workforce for the emerging diversified agriculture and natural resource management sectors in Hawaii. In order to revitalize and make the learning experience more relevant, more links to industry are made in the classroom, and a Living Laboratory supports various courses within the program. The Living Laboratory supports the Introduction to Plant Sciences, Introduction to Horticulture and Plant Propagation, and Integrated Pest Management courses. Online courses are being developed as part of the PBT program, and will be available to all who are interested in this model program for educating technicians in diversified agriculture and natural resources. In addition, a public outreach campaign informs the general public, high school teachers and students, and adults searching for a career change, about the growing agriculture industries and related career opportunities in Hawaii.",
