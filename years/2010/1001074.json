Specifically, the project will: (1) observe ionospheric perturbations using digital high-frequency Doppler sounders (TIDDBIT) from two North American locations; (2) use a numerical wave propagation model to infer the underlying atmospheric perturbations that cause the observed ionospheric variations and to characterize the energy and momentum flux into the ionosphere; and (3) use group velocity and raytracing models to examine sources of acoustic waves.",
