 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mapping the seafloor is a basic first step for much oceanographic research. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) equipped with multibeam sonar systems have launched a revolution in ocean science and exploration because these platforms a both stable and efficient; they have been used for a host of applications from mapping sand ripples and seamounts to sea ice. However, producing accurate large scale maps from the AUV data is still a highly expert labor intensive activity. The objective of this project is to develop computer program to enable rapis and efficient production of bathymetric maps from AUV data. The chief broader impact of this work is that it will provide dramatically improved tools for mapping the seafloor using AUVs for the entire oceanographic community.",
