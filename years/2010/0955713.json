 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are altering the global cycling of carbon (C) on Earth.  The addition of billions of tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is changing its heat-trapping capacity, which in turn is changing the Earth's climate.  Large amounts of carbon are stored within the soils of terrestrial ecosystems. Recently, attention has been drawn to the thawing of permafrost (permanently frozen ground) as a mechanism that could move significant quantities of stored C from land to atmosphere in response to a changing climate.  Because of the size and nature of the permafrost C pool, decomposition of previously frozen, old organic carbon is one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in a warmer world.  \r\n\r\nWhile ground temperature increases in permafrost regions are well documented with data from permafrost borehole networks, as well as from surface temperature observations, there is a knowledge gap surrounding the response of permafrost carbon to climate change.  This Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon research coordination network (RCN) project will bring together biological and physical carbon cycle researchers.  Through a series of meetings, working groups will be established that will address key questions about carbon cycling and vulnerability in permafrost regions and synthesize data and literature.  An interactive website will be developed for non-scientists and the media that will synthesize the state of knowledge about permafrost.  This RCN will strengthen the interconnection between biological and physical scientists, between early and later career-stage scientists, and will produce new knowledge through synthesis that can be used to quantify the role of permafrost carbon in affecting climate change in the 21st century and beyond.",

The northern circumpolar permafrost zone stores about twice as much carbon as currently contained in the atmosphere and small changes in the size of this carbon pool can have large impacts on the global carbon cycle. Permafrost thaw, and carbon released via microbial decomposition of previously frozen soil organic matter, is considered one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. Yet, the rate and form (carbon dioxide or methane) of carbon release from permafrost is highly uncertain but crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon cycle feedback during this century and beyond. The Permafrost Carbon Network (<a href=\"http://www.permafrostcarbon.org\">www.permafrostcarbon.org</a>) is a grass-roots network of scientists working to synthesize research around the overall question: What is the magnitude, timing, and form of the permafrost carbon release to the atmosphere in a warmer world? The network is structured into five working groups that focus on improving our understanding of <strong>1)</strong> the size of permafrost carbon pools, <strong>2)</strong> the decomposability of thawed permafrost organic matter, <strong>3)</strong> the fate of permafrost and carbon from abrupt thaw processes, <strong>4)</strong> aerobic and anaerobic controls over carbon mineralization, and <strong>5)</strong> upscaling and modeling the fate of permafrost carbon at regional to global scales. Together these working groups couple information to develop more reliable projections of permafrost carbon dynamics, and to reduce uncertainty about this important feedback to the climate system. This network has organized a series of meetings and workshops to bring together leading network participants spanning various stages of career levels. Those meetings were used to design and present progress of individual synthesis products, to link findings of products from individual working groups into cross-group synthesis activities, and to discuss missing gaps and future opportunities. Most recently, findings across working groups were synthesized in a Nature review article that outlined the current state of knowledge about the impact of thawing permafrost carbon on climate in a future warmer world. Carbon pool stored in the permafrost region were confirmed by additional data to store tremendous quantities of organic carbon, including that accumulated deep in permafrost soils. Long-term laboratory incubations of permafrost soils showed that a substantial fraction can be mineralized by microbes and converted to carbon dioxide and methane on timescales of years to decades. Abrupt thaw processes are common features in northern landscapes that expose large quantities of organic matter to decomposition, however, these processes are entirely absent from large-scale models used to predict the rate of climate change. The main conclusion of this review paper is that greenhouse gas emissions from warming permafrost are likely to occur at a magnitude similar to other historically important biospheric carbon sources such as land-use. Further, we concluded that it is likely to be a gradual, long-lasting release of greenhouse gases over many decades rather than an abrupt pulse, with between 5-15% of the permafrost zone soil carbon vulnerable to release during this century.
