 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calderer\r\nDMS-1009181\r\n\r\n     This GOALI project supports a collaboration between\r\ninvestigators at the University of Minnesota and at Medtronic,\r\nInc.  To improve the design of implantable medical devices, the\r\ninvestigator and her colleagues develop fundamental understanding\r\nof, and modeling tools for, polymer and solvent interactions that\r\nresult in swelling of the polymer.  Many implantable devices\r\nconsist of plastic and metal components that are affixed to each\r\nother by adhesives.  When such a device is placed in the human\r\nbody, the plastic parts, made from polymer, interact with the\r\nsurrounding fluid and swell, while the metal parts are not\r\naffected by the fluid.  The consequent swelling mismatch causes a\r\nhigh stress at the interface, which can lead to deformation of\r\nthe components and, if interfacial shear stresses exceed critical\r\nvalues guaranteed by the adhesive manufacturer, to interface\r\ndelamination.  Deformation and delamination can cause devices to\r\nfail.  The ability to model the behavior of the components is\r\ncritical in the design of implantable medical devices, such as\r\ndefibrillators, pacemakers, and neurological devices.  This\r\nproject addresses the questions:\r\n (1) How does polymer swelling proceed without polymer chain\r\nrelaxation?  (Only elasticity is accounted for, and viscous\r\neffects are neglected.) \r\n (2) How does swelling proceed when polymer chains relax within\r\nthe same time frame?\r\n (3) How does swelling proceed if there is mechanical strain\r\napplied to the sample?\r\n (4) How does swelling proceed if two samples made of the same\r\npolymer but with different initial swelling are bonded together?\r\n\r\n     Many polymers can absorb an amount of water equivalent to\r\nabout 1 percent of their own weights; hydrogel can absorb water\r\nmany times its own volume.  Swelling of polymers occurs in many\r\napplications, particularly in implantable biomedical devices,\r\nmade of metal and plastic polymer components, that typically are\r\nburied in wet tissue.  Polymers can relax mechanical loading and\r\ndeformation over time due to viscoelastic properties. \r\nSwelling-induced stress or size changes can relax as well.  The\r\nactual stress and geometric changes in polymers are determined by\r\nthe combined relaxation and swelling process.  Each of these\r\nprocesses is related to water diffusion, polymer chain motion,\r\nand water-polymer interactions.  Estimation of these processes\r\nand interactions is critical for understanding swelling-induced\r\ndeformation, delamination, and stability, key factors in the\r\ndesign and quality control of medical devices.  Building on an\r\nexisting collaboration between Medtronic Inc and the University\r\nof Minnesota, the investigator and her colleagues develop\r\nmathematical models, analysis, and computational and\r\nvisualization tools to improve fundamental understanding of\r\npolymer and solvent interactions; the tools can be used to\r\nidentify unsuitable polymers and so reduce the number of\r\nlaboratory experiments performed by polymer scientists at\r\nMedtronic by more than half.  Students and postdocs are part of\r\nthe project, which also includes seminars, workshops, and\r\noutreach activities sponsored jointly with Medtronic.",
