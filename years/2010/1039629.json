 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this MRI acquisition for thin film processing and characterization equipment is to enhance the present capability of the Microelectronics Laboratory at Tuskegee University, and to support undergraduate and graduate teaching and research.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe equipment requested will meet current research needs for processing test structures and devices including, but not limited to, the study of thin film solar cell materials and devices, growth and characterization of ZnO for device applications, Si/Ge MOS device studies for integrated photonic device processing, study of devices on organic semiconductor films, grayscale lithography by polymer photomask for micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) and carbon nanotube film patterning for flexible microelectronics.  The proposed equipment will result in a fundamental understanding of basic physical, chemical and metallurgical mechanisms involved in the various processes employed in the fabrication of multi-junction solar cells.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nAcquiring the requested equipment will permit training of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas in the advanced technology sector. These well-trained graduates will bring much-needed diversity to the nation's technological workforce involved in research and manufacturing.  Outreach activities are planned that will bring local high school students and teachers to participate in some of the laboratory activities thus motivating high school students from an under-represented community to pursue a college degrees in science and engineering.  It is anticipated that the fundamental studies delineated in this proposal will eventually result in design and manufacturing methodologies that will help the nation to become more competitive in the global market.",
