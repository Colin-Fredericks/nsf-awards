 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past twenty years, scientists, land managers and the public have come to recognize the dramatic consequences of species invasions. Despite this recognition, few studies have documented long-term ecosystem consequences of invasions when those invasions go unchecked. The proposed research evaluates long-term impacts of fire-promoting grasses in seasonally dry woodlands in Hawai'i. These grasses, originally introduced as pasture forage, escaped into wildlands where they promote the spread of fire. Native species in these sites are not fire-adapted resulting in a dramatic loss of native species and strongly altered nutrient cycling including losses of nitrogen, a critical resource for plant growth.  The proposed research uses observations and experimentation to evaluate how invader-induced changes in ecosystem nitrogen cycling that were well documented in the 1990s, have changed over time since invasion and what the consequences of current growth conditions are for native species. Experiments will evaluate nitrogen loss rates over time, changes in soil carbon pools and the consequences of these changes for native and non-native species. \r\n\r\nFire-promoting non-native grasses are a significant management concern in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The results of this research will provide greater understanding of the long-term consequences of not managing these invasions both in terms of fuel loads and soil nutrient conditions and in terms of whether native species will eventually recover in burned invaded sites under fire suppression. Lastly, results will provide site specific information regarding which native species and restoration treatments can be used in sites degraded by fire and grass invasion.",
