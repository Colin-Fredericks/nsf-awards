The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as replication of how carbohydrate code cells communicate, to develop chemical tools to solve problems in biology and medicine and to discover atmospheric intermediates of organic photochemistry, support of synthetic efforts, polymers and fabrication of nano building blocks.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, biochemistry and the environment. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
