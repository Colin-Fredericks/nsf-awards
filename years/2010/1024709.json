 "awd_abstract_narration": "Repeated measurements taken on the same person are usually highly correlated and also influenced by changes in that individual's mental or physical state over time.  Accurate conclusions about why a person's performance changes over time, as well as accurate hypotheses about how tasks are performed, require non-Gaussian time series models that can separate changes in performance due to changes in task conditions from changes in a person's mental or physical state.  At present, techniques available for the analysis of human performance data are limited.  In particular, models for repeated response time measurements usually fail to consider that the measurements are correlated and that overall speed may naturally fluctuate over time, even when all other task conditions remain the same.  This project will address this problem by developing realistic models for response time series that provide a basis for simultaneously explaining the generating mechanism as well as describing trends due to changes in a person's state over time.  An important component of this project will be the development of new computational methods for effectively fitting these statistical models as well as evaluating the model fits.\r\n\r\nResponse time measurements are important because how well people perform tasks is often measured, at least in part, by how quickly they can accomplish those tasks.  In many situations, tasks are repetitive, requiring decisions and actions that recur many times within a fixed period of time.  Such tasks, while commonly performed in psychological laboratories, are also used in a number of real-world settings such as assembly line work, during standardized testing, and in athletics.  This project will result not only in better techniques of analysis for these kinds of measurements, but also in the development of more accurate and realistic models of how people perform repetitive tasks.  A diverse cross-section of students (psychological and statistical) will be mentored in methods that both bridge and strengthen their two disciplines.  All data collected and general-purpose software developed under this award will be made available (via the World Wide Web) to the research community.",

Measurements of performance are used in settings as diverse as medical diagnoses, military exercises, ergonomic design, and education, as well as many others.  The problem that we dealt with in this project has to do with the fact that human performance data is never \"clean.\"  When someone performs a simple task repeatedly (such as the kind of work that might be done on an assembly line), the way a person executes that task changes over time.  It changes in the short term, from one execution to the next, and in the long term, over the course of an hour or an eight-hour shift.  \n\nTo evaluate theories and improve our understanding of the brain and behavior, we need statistical tools for analyzing human performance data that can work around the fact that the person doing the task doesn't always do it in exactly the same way.  In this project, we considered the kinds of statistical tools that were originally developed for analyzing time series data (from, for example, daily stock market fluctuations or yearly ocean temperatures), and adapted them to a system with three components.  These components were: 1) a theoretically-motivated structure of simple choice that is widely used in psychology and neuroscience to describe human behavior; 2) a random component that produces fast responses such as those that might be produced by guessing; and 3) another random component that slows down the choice component and produces slow responses such as those that might be produced by distractions.  Using this three-component framework, we can explain how sometimes people do the task badly, and we can also explain (with the time series analysis applied to the theoretical or cognitive component) how people change their task strategies over time.  \n\nThe funds provided by this grant allowed us to collect several different data sets that we then analyzed using our three-component model and related alternative models.  The most important outcome involved data from a recognition memory experiment, in which people were asked to distinguish pictures of geometric objects that they had seen before from those they had not.  This simple task is thought to form the foundation of much of everyday human behavior, and has received a lot of attention from psychologists over the past century.  Because it is so well studied, we knew what the cognitive component of the framework had to be.  After adding the other two components, we were able to show that when people do poorly at this task they do so for different reasons.  Some people don't pay attention at all, preferring to just guess for every object they see.  Others have trouble when they first encounter an object, so their later memories for that object are poor.  And still others seem to be able to remember objects, but when asked to say whether or not they have seen them before they have difficulty extracting information from their memories.\n\nAlthough the point of our project was not to study memory per se, our work has demonstrated that more complex modeling structures can be brought to bear on a range of different kinds of human performance data to not only explain how people perform well, but more importantly to explore how people fail.

In addition, the modeling framework that we have developed is very general and can be applied to \"messy\" data across a range of disciplines.\n\nFunds provided by this award were used to support training of seven graduate students who have received or will receive master\u00c6s and PhD degrees in statistics and psychology and are now poised to make interdisciplinary contributions to statistical modeling and behavioral research.
