 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site program at the University of Houston will engage 10 undergraduates for 10 summer weeks each year in hands-on research in the field of nanotechnology.  Faculty mentors from the Cullen College of Engineering and one graduate student mentor per participant will work with the undergraduate students to develop his or her research skills.  In addition to cultivating participants' laboratory research expertise, the program will emphasize the development of additional skills necessary for success in research, such as written and oral communication, navigating scientific literature, laboratory documentation, resume development, research ethics, and engineering professionalism. This REU Site program will create well-rounded future researches through weekly professional development seminars and strong mentoring in the laboratory. In order to foster a sense of community and camaraderie among participants the program will also include weekend social activities.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\r\nThe PI will recruit REU students from underrepresented groups and from non-research institutions.  The participants will publish a journal article or conference paper to disseminate their research results.  The students who participant in this REU program will be encouraged to pursue graduate education to further their interests in research.",
