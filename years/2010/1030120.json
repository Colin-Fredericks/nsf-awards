 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide funding to establish a novel metal composite manufacturing process that can create a hierarchical structure bio-inspired by an abalone seashell.  The hierarchical organization of soft and hard layers in a \"brick-and-mortar\" configuration of the abalone seashell is known to significantly improve the composite toughness (100- to 1000-fold) and compressive strength (5-fold).  The proposed semisolid forming-joining (SFJ) technique uniquely exploits a material condition where both solid and liquid phases coexist.  The designed structure is created by consolidating patterned aluminum sheets filled with hard silicon carbide particles.  The composite synthesis mechanism will be analyzed by understanding the liquid phase infiltration and resultant interface microstructures between the soft and hard phases.  A numerical model of the SFJ process will be developed to predict and analyze the dimensions of structures created from experiments.  The strengthening and toughening effects of the bio-inspired composite will be measured by impact and fracture tests.\r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this research will enable development of a simple, low-cost and easily scalable metal composite manufacturing technology capable of realizing complex material designs.  Moreover, the novel SFJ process is expected to serve as a platform for developing next-generation, advanced metal composites.  Understanding the toughening and strengthening mechanism of the abalone seashell applied in metal composites may lead to development of ultrahard, lightweight, tough materials for various applications such as making energy efficient vehicles, strong armors, lightweight aircrafts, etc.  The proposed educational and outreach activities will promote recruiting and retaining of women and under-represented students in engineering disciplines, and help academia to connect with local industries.  The knowledge learned will be disseminated through premier journals and at professional society meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough this project, a new manufacturing technology that employs patterned sheets and particles as building elements has been successfully established to create complex architectures in metal composites.  The research is motivated by exceptional properties achieved by composites found in nature, which are often complex and involve multi-level structures.  Unfortunately, existing metal matrix composite manufacturing processes, such as powder sintering and melt-based routes, lack in the ability to replicate and create designed microstructural architectures of complex shapes.  The adaptive design paradigms inherent in the natural evolutionary systems and structures can inspire innovative pathways in developing manufacturing methods that can achieve enhanced composite functionalities and properties.\n\nThe novel manufacturing technique, as illustrated in Figure 1, uniquely exploits mushy state behavior of metallic materials at elevated temperatures to control and consolidate various patterns created in the sheet material.  The viscous nature of materials in the mushy state can be controlled to retain the spatial arrangements during consolidation by preventing floatation or sedimentation of the patterned structures.  For this project, the process has been applied to mimic the \"brick-and-mortar\" structure of a nacre (see Figure 2), the pearly internal layer of many mollusc shells.  The multilayer organization of hard and soft layers in \"brick-and-mortar\" construction has been known to dramatically improve the strength and toughness.\n\nThe intellectual and broader impacts of this project are the following:\n\n1.  The novel fabrication method enables design and engineering of advanced composites with custom architectures, and therefore, overcomes the limits of existing metal composite fabrication processes, which are limited to producing uniform and graded structures with reinforcing particles and fibers.  Various spatial arrangements of different shapes can be designed and created with the new approach.\n\n2.  The compaction mechanism of a binary powder system involving soft and hard phase particles in the mushy state with high liquid phase content has been understood.  The study far extends existing processing window for powder metallurgy processes limited to only small amounts of liquid phase typically below 10%.\n\n3.  A metal composite material inspired by the multilayer, \"brick-and-mortar\" structure of a nacre has been successfully fabricated.  The composite with patterned structure displayed 50% increase in the flexural strength compared with the composite with simple alternating layers (see Figure 3).\n\n4.  The project leveraged well-established programs at Iowa State University to offer research experience for undergraduates and to promote recruiting and retaining of women and under-represented students.  A hands-on activity kit using Velcro fabric as shown in Figure 4 was devised to demonstrate bioinspired engineering of composite materials to attract prospect students visiting campus and nearby local schools.\n\n5.  The knowledge learned has been disseminated through 9 journal publications, 10 conference proceedings, a patent application, and numerous presentations at professional society meetings.  The information learned has also been incorporated into undergraduate and graduate teaching.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gap-Yong Kim"
