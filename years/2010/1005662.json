The Symposium focuses on various aspects of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the NASA / European Space Agency space-based gravitational wave detection and observation project, expected to complement the NSF-funded ground-based gravitational wave observatory, LIGO, and other ground-based gravitational wave detectors. The Conference will include LISA Technology and Design, Astronomy/Astrophysics with LISA, Cosmology/Fundamental Physics with LISA, Data Analysis and simulations, LISA PathFinder, and ground-based and other space-based detectors. Plenary talks, contributed talks organized in two parallel sessions, and posters will be presented during the Symposium. The presentations will be collected in the Conference Proceedings to be published in a reviewed journal.",
