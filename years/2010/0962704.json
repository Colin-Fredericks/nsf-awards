 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Research Instrumentation System (IRIS) is a proposal to provide a software framework to simplify the task of end-to-end network performance monitoring and diagnostics and thereby improve support for international science and engineering collaborations. IRIS will deliver a comprehensive monitoring package that will benefit each IRNC awardee as well as the entire project as a whole by delivering instant access to information that will reveal the status and health of any participating network.\r\n\r\nIRIS facilitates a broader deployment of perfSONAR enabled resources significantly increasing the likelihood diagnostic resources will be available along the end-to-end paths needed by researchers relying on high-performance international network connections. As a result, NSF-funded science efforts, such as those within Very Long Baseline Interferometry (eVLBI), the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), are more likely to be able to exploit available network resources by improving their network performance.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will have significant impact on the broad international science and engineering network user community by providing key measurement tools with global applicability. IRIS will advance the state of network measurement and monitoring by working with IRNC projects to research and implement solutions to challenging network measurement problems. This to have a broad impact among multiple scientific disciplines involving global collaboration and exchange of large data sets.",
