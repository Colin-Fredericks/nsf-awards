 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Vincent Remcho and colleagues Chih-hung Chang, Jamie Kruzic, Mas Subramanian and John Conley from Oregon State University will acquire a high resolution field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM).  The proposal will impact materials research in a large number of areas, including studies of ultra-high temperature alloys, advanced ceramics, steels, bulk metallic glasses, solar energy materials, thin film transistors, dielectrics, nonlinear optical materials, microfluidic devices for applications in chemical analysis, the effect of nanocrystals on polymer matrices, the composition of atmospheric aerosol particles, and the structures of novel marine organisms.\r\n\r\nA transmission electron microscope is one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of materials. A beam of electrons penetrates a thin layer of sample resulting in an image of the sample. The electron microscope can provide higher resolution and maginfication than a microscope using light to probe the material. It can provide useful details of the material down to near atomic size levels. This instrumentation will provide microscopy training and research opportunities to large numbers of students across many fields including chemistry, biology, physics, materials and engineering.",
