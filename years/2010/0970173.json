 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and uncovering the particle-physics origins of dark matter and dark energy are some of the most fundamental questions in our quest to understand the Universe at both microscopic and cosmological scales. The PI's on this project will investigate a wide range of innovative ideas in particle physics and cosmology: theoretical descriptions of the mechanisms of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions; collider phenomenology; grand unified theories and quantum gravity; dark matter and particle cosmology. Much of this research will be of direct relevance for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which recently started its operations et the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), as well as for several other upcoming landmark experiments.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  The HEP Theory group at UC Irvine plans to play an essential role in UC Irvine's QuarkNet program, where high school teachers and their students are introduced to current research in high energy physics. These efforts will be complemented by additional public outreach activities, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and professional service.",
