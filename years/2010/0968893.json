 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for a study of the use of cadmium-based quantum dots suspended in scintillator oil as an active target for neutron detection. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that are highly efficient fluorophores. The emission wavelengths are tunable by the size of the dot and have widths of about 25 nm. Most dots are constructed of cadmium, with CdS and CdSe dots the most common. Cd has a high cross section for neutron absorption, second only to gadolinium. The goal is to study how a Cd-based quantum dot target will respond when neutrons are captured. At present, a large scale detector doped with quantum dots is far too expensive to construct; however, the expanding market for quantum dots, especially in the biological and medical industries, is expected to drive the cost down significantly. This project aims at building the first small quantum-dot-based neutron detector.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this award arises largely from the opportunity it affords minority students to obtain hands-on hardware experience. This project also involves students from the MIT Summer Research Program for minorities who will create webpages, so that the interest and excitement of the R&D can be shared with the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the study of quantum-dot-doped liquid scintillator.   Quantum dots are 2 to 10 nm semiconducting nanocrystals.  The dots absorb UV light and  and re-emit at longer wavelength.  The specific frequency of the emission, which is a narrow resonance, is tuned by the dot size.   Quantum dots are suspended in organic solvents, allowing them to be suspended in oil.     This led us to consider introducing quantum dots into liquid scintillator.    \n\nLiquid scintillator produces light when a charged particle passes through it. Organic solvents, such as toluene, are good scintillants.  These materials have substantial emission in the UV, and so, often, a wavelength shifter, such as PPO, is added to shift the light to the visible range for observation by photomultiplier tubes.  Quantum dots also shift light from UV to visible.    In this study we use the quantum dots in combination with the PPO to shift the light.\n\nOur interest in introducing quantum dots into scintillator arises from the material of which the dots are manuractured: CdS, CdSe, CdTe, and ZnS.   A Cd-based scintillator could have two potential uses. First, 113Cd has a high thermal neutron capture cross-section, and produces substantial energy upon capture --  with a gamma cascade totaling 9 MeV.   Second, 116Cd suffers double beta decay and so of interest to neutrinoless double beta decay searches that searches for evidence that neutrinos are their own antiparticle.  Se, Te, and Zn are also double beta decay candidates.\n\nWhile the research described here examined small batches of  scintillator, the long term goal is to show that multi-ton scale  quantum-dot-doped scintillator  detectors are scientifically feasible.    For this new scintillator to be practically feasible, then the price of  quantum dots will have to frop by an order of magnitude.   Presently,  quantum dots are quite expensive, and multi-ton detectors would be  cost-prohibitive.  However,  as more uses for quantum dots are  developed, the price will become lower and we are preparing for this  opportunity.\n\nThe activities supported by this grant were:\n\n* Developing a pre-conceptual design for a neutrinoless double beta decay detector using quantum-dot doped scintillator.\n\n* Studying the response of the quantum-dot-doped scintillator to UV as a function  of wavelength of dots compared to the standard toluene and PPO scintillator.  \n\n* Measuring comparative response of quantum-dot-doped liquid scintillator mixtures when exposed to a  90Sr Source (that is, response to charged particles)\n\nThe results of our study were published in a paper by the post doc (Winslow) and undergradaute (Simpson):\n\nL. Winslow and R. Simpson,  ``Characterizing Quantum-Dot-Doped Liquid Scintillator for Applications to   Neutrino Detectors,''  arXiv:1202.4733 [physics.ins-det],    Journal of Instrumentation, volume 7, page  P07010 (2012).\n\nWe have developed a design for a neutrinoless double beta decay detector that would use 1 liter of quantum-dot doped scintillator.  The detector will make use of large area picosecond timing detectors that are now under development.  The picosecond timing would allow separation of prompt Cerenkov light (produced when a charged particle travels faster than the speed of light in the medium) from the scintillation and quantum-dot emitted light,   In principle, the photocathode on the detectors can be tuned so that some pixels could give response only to the quantum-dot wavelength, isolating that light.\n\nWe then focused on choosing the optimal quantum-dot wavelength by exposing the dot-mixtures to UV light. We apporached this by comparing the response of dots of a wide range of sizes to the standard toluene and PPO scintillator. The sample spectra were  obtained from a 5-minute data sample taken in 30~ms exposures and were background subtracted.   This study showed that the emission spectrum of the doped scintillator is dominated by the  quantum dots.  In fact, the longer wavelength pho..."
