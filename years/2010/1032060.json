 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT) studies conducted by the Polytechnic Institute of New York site (lead), the University of Virginia site and the site at Auburn University. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507.  The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n\t\r\nThis proposal is a comprehensive research project for significantly improving the capacity of wireless networks. In past decades, there has been an exponential growth of wireless devices and wireless networks. While wireless networks have brought us the convenience of mobility and new applications, they are limited by bandwidth bottlenecks. The industry and spectrum regulators are trying to allocate more bandwidth, but they still fall behind the bandwidth increases in wireless networks. Thus it is critically important to use spectrum resources more efficiently. The proposed work aims to decrease interference, including cooperative and cognitive networking. This research will not only make significant contributions to the research community, but also be very valuable for the wireless industry and spectrum regulators.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to eliminate wireless system bottlenecks using cooperative and cognitive technologies, with the potential of enabling a broad spectrum of new wireless applications. The PIs will exploit existing programs, such as NSF REUs and the collaboration with Tuskegee and Northern New Mexico College, which focus on including students from underrepresented groups in the research. The student body at NYU-Poly is quite diverse. Most of the requested funding is going toward student support. The Pisa lo intend to incorporate this work into the new graduate course at NYU-Poly and the new ABET-accredited program at Auburn. Dissemination is clearly outlined: reports to NSF, reports to their IAB, journal and conference papers and making the resulting software packages open source.",
