This device will provide a building block for future computation. The project employs multiphysics device simulation, material preparation, fabrication and electrical characterization of prototype devices and aims to enhance understanding of both the physical principle and practical limits of these nanodevices as well as to integrate these results into rigorous educational activities in the broad community.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe proposed program is motivated by Gordon Moore?s iconic prediction and will focus on continuing building computer logic and memory elements with even more speed and low power. Conventional silicon-based transistors already face limitations in continued reduced dimensions in order to make electrons move faster. Meanwhile thermodynamics are dictating the amount of power consumed at the off state - by limiting the subthreshold slope of conventional transistors to be at least 60 mV/dec. This program will explore high mobility one dimensional nanowire platform as potential to achieve a subthreshold slope of zero. This is only made possible with the recent development of nanoscale electromechanical systems, particularly in nanowires where the frequency of mechanical motion has become comparable to modern radio frequency electronics. The focus of the research activities in this program will be transformative in terms of shifting from traditional electronic circuits and models into utilizing the mechanical degree of freedom in conjunction with nanoelectronics components. The project will consist of the following research activities: (1) 3-D modeling of coupled nanomechanics-electrostatics-carrier transport to understand device design space and performance; (2)  Controlled nanomaterial preparation via chemical vapor deposition and wet chemical etching methods; (3) Fabrication of suspended nanowire transistor structures and  (4) DC and RF characterization of the device arrays to verify their performance metrics as logic and novel non-volatile elements for future nanoelectronics. The knowledge acquired through this program will have substantial technological impact in a broad range of application areas of computation.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nA strong educational component is envisioned, including the enhancement of graduate and undergraduate courses aimed at a diverse student audience, interaction with high school students as well as designing an online portal for the general public. The objective is to incorporate results of the fundamental device physics and nanotechnology research into 21st century Engineering education in order to expose people of diverse ages and backgrounds to the state-of-the-art in nanoscience and to raise their awareness about nanoelectronics as tomorrow's technology.",
