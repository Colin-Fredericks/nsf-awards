New modules are developed which are closely tied to classroom concepts with mathematics used in industry. The team of investigators includes leaders in the mathematical research and educational communities, and mathematicians with years of industry experience. The overarching goal of this team is to show undergraduate students that strong mathematical skills leads to more employment options and greater chances of success.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan has three main components. The project impacts students and faculty members nationwide through distribution of effective teaching materials. A key part of the dissemination starts with 12 faculty members at 7 additional institutions beta testing the developed modules. After beta-testing, the modules are made available on the project website. Finally presentations about the modules and their effect on student learning are given at conferences, and articles about the modules are submitted to educational and research journals.",
