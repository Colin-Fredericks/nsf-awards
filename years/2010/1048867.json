 "awd_abstract_narration": "In light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Science Foundation (NSF) highlighted the Rapid Response Research (RAPID) mechanism (Dear Colleague Letter NSF 10-060) as quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events. In this RAPID project, the PIs will study the role of salt marsh plants and nitrogen inputs in the decomposition of simple vs. recalcitrant forms of carbon in association with the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Recent studies have demonstrated that, contrary to expectations, nitrogen (N) inputs will not stimulate decomposition of recalcitrant carbon stored in salt marsh peat soil, and they may actually reduce it.  However, the same is not true for sugars and other more simple forms of carbon.  Given the potential input of a significant amount of complex hydrocarbons from the oil-spill into coastal salt marsh habitat in the Gulf,  it will be important to be able to predict the effects of plants and of N inputs on rates of oil hydrocarbon decomposition and ecosystem function in these fragile habitats.  Given the urgent situation facing Gulf area wetlands and the capacity to increase marsh exposure to nutrient-rich waters, results of this study could be critical for exploring oil spill mitigation options expeditiously. If nitrogen amendments to coastal wetlands increase the processing of crude oil, such management techniques may be implemented more rapidly and with greater precision.  To disseminate findings among scientists and managers, the PIs will organize a workshop at the Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS) annual meeting, as well as make data available on the SWS website. Further, the PIs will involve undergraduate researchers and students in the greenhouse study at Villanova University through research funds and an existing Global Change Ecology course.",
