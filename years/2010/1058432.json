 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California San Diego (UCSD) proposes a planning grant to\r\nbuild the Partnership for Expanding \"Exploring Computer Science\" (PEECS)\r\nwith the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minority and\r\nfemale students from San Diego County that graduate from high school\r\ninterested in and prepared to pursue college majors in computer science and\r\nrelated fields. PEECS was inspired by the BPC Alliance, \"Into the Loop,\" which\r\nintroduced a new course, \"Exploring Computer Science\" (ECS), in the Los Angeles\r\nUnified School District. ECS is an introductory course that could be a\r\nsteppingstone to Computer Science Principles, the proposed new Advanced\r\nPlacement (AP) course. These two courses have the potential to transform\r\nhigh school education in computing.\r\n\r\nThe CS Principles course is being piloted at UC San Diego this year. Together\r\nwith the facts that \"Into the Loop\" personnel live in the San Diego region,\r\nthere are close ties between the UCLA and UCSD campuses, UCSD Computer Science\r\nis already involved in revamping their freshman curriculum, and UCSD's San Diego\r\nSupercomputer Center (SDSC) has a well-established technology and computational\r\nscience professional development program for pre-college teachers (SDSC\r\nTeacherTECH), this puts San Diego at the right time and place for a major\r\noverhaul of its high school computer science programs.\r\n\r\nPEECS proposes to pave the way for a successful expansion and adaptation of\r\nECS into a new region, San Diego County. There, multiple school districting\r\nstructures, policies, processes, and academic community cultures present their\r\nown new challenges to change. Experiences gained in adapting the ECS program\r\nto the diverse needs of the San Diego region will provide valuable lessons as\r\nthe wider dissemination of ECS and CS Principles goes forward. This planning\r\ngrant will bring together the important stakeholders to develop the necessary\r\npartnerships and directions for this effort.",
