 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator and his collaborators will address several problems in interfacial fluid dynamics and dispersive partial differential equations.\r\nThe following are the specific activities to be undertaken: (A) Time-periodic interfacial fluid flows, such as water waves and vortex sheets with surface tension, will be investigated, both computationally and analytically.  (B) Breakdown of smooth solutions for interfacial flows will be investigated, specifically addressing the question of whether a Moore singularity can occur for flows with surface tension.  (C) Well-posedness of rotational interfacial Hele-Shaw flows will be proved.  (D) Rigorous studies of the well-posedness or ill-posedness of equations with degenerate dispersion, such as the Rosenau-Hyman equations, will be performed.\r\n\r\nThere are many practical situations in science and engineering which involve interfaces between moving fluids, such as the mixing of fluids in the ocean, or the motion of contaminants in groundwater.  The research to be undertaken in this project will provide insight into the predictability of such motions, as well as phenomena such as wave breaking and fluid mixing.  The investigator will use methods of both mathematical analysis and scientific computing as appropriate in carrying out the research.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWavelike phenomena occur in many contexts; examples include waves in fluids and electromagnetic waves.  This work considers the equations which describe wave motion in various cases.  Two focuses of the work are existence theory and computation.  Problems in existence theory include demonstrating if the equations have solutions in general, and also if the equations have solutions with particular features.  This can give information as to whether enough physics has been taken into account when designing the equations, or whether better mathematical models are instead necessary.  Problems in computation include generalizing previous computational methods to be more widely applicable.\n\n \n\nMuch of this work deals with theory and computation for two kinds of coherent structures, traveling waves and time-periodic waves.  These are special waves which repeat in particular ways as time progresses.  These coherent structures are important for the dynamics of wave motion, as they frequently can be used to describe very general behaviors of the systems under consideration.  The work developed includes new ways of writing equations which describe these waves, and then solving the new equations computationally.  Specific applications include computing solutions for the water wave problem, in which the upper surface of a fluid is free to move.  A new method has also been developed to determine when no such time-periodic waves exist.\n\n \n\nDuring this award, two PhD students were supported.  One completed his degree, and the other is expected to finish in June 2015.  Two undergraduate students were supported and gained valuable experience performing computational research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Ambrose"
