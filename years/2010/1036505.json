 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chondrichthyans, or sharks, rays and chimaeras, are some of the best known marine animals in popular culture but poorly known in terms of their evolution. Despite being an ancient group, we know surprisingly little about the patterns and processes that gave rise to their current diversity - a diversity that is increasingly under threat through environmental and fishing pressures. This project will catalog the diversity of sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras, provide a genealogy of relationships based on DNA sequence comparisons, and provide a data base of 3-D virtual skeletons based on CT scan data to document all of the physical variations that characterize the major lineages.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve the development of technologies that will impact the way DNA sequences are collected for the purpose of comparison across organisms. This could have far reaching benefits for disciplines such as comparative biochemistry, physiology and medicine that are based on comparative approaches. The outreach component of the project will exploit the popular appeal of sharks to show how modern molecular biology and computer visualization techniques are being applied to better understand the evolution of the world's increasingly threatened biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project was focused on understanding the evolution of all cartilaginous (= Chondrichthyan) fishes.  These include the sharks, skates, stingrays, and ratfishes.  My specific focus was on understanding the evolution and relationship of ratfishes to their close relatives the sharks, skates, and stingrays.  Using anatomical information I worked with other scientists and a graduate student to describe new species of ratfishes as well as publishing descriptions of ratfishes in a book entitled \"Fishes of New Zealand\" which is the authoritative guide for all fishes found in New Zealand's waters.\n\nAnother aspect of this research was to examine fossil condrichthyans to look at anatomical features that might provide clues as to how they are related to living chondrichthyan fishes.  Understanding the relationships among the fossil and living chondrichthyans can give us a picture of how these organisms evolved during their 350 million year evolutionary history.  My colleagues and I focused on a particularly unusual fossil known as Helicoprion.  This fossil is known only from unusual spiral-shaped whorls of )teeth.  Many scientists have researched these strange tooth whorls and speculated as to what this fossil \"shark\" might have looked like, but without any information on the skull or other body parts it was impossible to develop any realistic model of how these teeth might have been seated in the head.  Using CT scanning technology (the same technology doctors use for CT, or 'cat', scans of a human body) we were able to obtain images from inside a fossilized tooth whorl.  This particularlyl large tooth whorl was chosen because it likely contained other body parts besides just the teeth.  Using digital reconstruction software the team was able to reconstruct a three dimensional picture of the fossilized skull parts that surrounded the tooth whorl.  This information was used to reconstruct the anatomy of the head, and position of the teeth, in this unusual species. \n\nThe most exciting finding from this reconstructed shark known as Helicoprion was that it was not actually an ancestor to sharks!  In fact, based on the anatomical features of the jaws it was clear that this ancient fossil is more closely related to the ratfishes.  This is interesting not only because it challenged our previous understanding of shark evolution, but also clarifies our understanding of the ancestry of the ratfishes and their relationship to the other chondrichthyans, the sharks, skates and rays.\n\nThis research has been published in several scientific papers, but more importantly we have worked with the Alaskan artist, Ray Troll, on a museum exhibit.  Presenting this research in the format of a museum exhibit brings the details of science and the process of scientific discovery to the general public in a fun, informative, and approachable way.  Additionally, Ms. Susan Ewing has published a non-fiction book entitled \"Resurrecting the Shark\".  This book traces the discovery of Helicoprion from the earliest studies done over 100 years ago to the groundbreaking work that our team completed which finally answered the question of the evolutionary relationships of this unique ancient chondrichthyan fish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dominique A Didier"
