 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allegheny College proposes, with NSF S-STEM support, to graduate two cohorts of 8 students.  Preference is to be given to students of color, in line with the mission of the college to increase the number of underrepresented students in the natural sciences.  Students are to receive a scholarship throughout all 4 years of college.  The college is to support an additional 10 students with private funding and is to assume the cost of supporting a second cohort of students, who will continue their studies after NSF funding ceases.  Twenty-six students are to graduate in the natural sciences because of this scholarship support.  \r\nThe College will provide enhanced support programs such as common first year seminars, retreats and regular lunch meetings.  Close mentoring by faculty advisors is designed to ensure high retention and assistance is to be provided with graduate school and job placement.  In their first year all S-STEM students will be housed in the College's newest residential complex.  \r\nAllegheny College is a private liberal arts college with a student body of approximately 2,000 and a student faculty ratio of 13:1.  Sixty-eight percent of incoming students rank in the top 20% of their high school classes with a median SAT score of 1220. Ninety four percent of majors in the natural sciences receive their degrees in four years or less.",
