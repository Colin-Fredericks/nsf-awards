 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of this project is to develop new strategies for the discovery and implementation of transition metal-catalyzed couplings and cycloadditions.  The focus will be the development of new approaches for transition metal catalyzed processes that proceed by either net two-electron reduction, or by redox-mediated pathways.  While many classes of reductive coupling processes have been developed in recent years, this project aims to develop processes that complement existing methods while improving practicality, cost, and green considerations.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor John Montgomery of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Professor Montgomery's research efforts revolve around the discovery of new transition metal-catalyzed chemical transformations, the study of their mechanisms, and their application in the synthesis of complex molecules. The research being studied in this program seeks to provide efficient and environmentally friendly synthetic procedures that allow the rapid synthesis of complex structures from simple precursors.  Successes in these areas stand to benefit a variety of important research areas, especially in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agricultural industries.",
