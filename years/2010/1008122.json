This is the 6th conference in a series focused on the areas of function algebras, spaces and algebras of analytic functions, Lp-spaces, geometry of Banach spaces and related topics. Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not have their own support. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the conference is to foster awareness and enable interaction on current activity in the broad area of function spaces. This is a conference on an active area of research in analysis. The conference will also provide an opportunity for junior researchers to learn and interact with established researchers.",
