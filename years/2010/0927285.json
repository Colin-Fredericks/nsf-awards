 "awd_abstract_narration": "GEOTRACES is an international program which aims at identifying processes and quantifying fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and at establishing the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.  Iron (Fe) plays a key role in phytoplankton growth and composition yet our knowledge of the distribution of this element in the ocean and the processes that influence its observed distribution remain poorly quantified. To further our understanding of Fe in the marine environment, a scientist from Old Dominion University plans to analyze water column and surface water samples for dissolved Fe and Fe(II) using high throughput flow injection analysis during the upcoming 2010 GEOTRACES cruise to the North Atlantic Ocean basin.  In addition, following the cruise, the samples will be analyzed again using both the flow injection method and high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to assess the effects of sample storage and to ascertain the accuracy of their shipboard measurements.  Results from this research will facilitate the inclusion of iron in biogeochemical models of the marine ecosystem and improve scientists' ability to predict how the ocean will respond to future climate change.  This study represents a collaborative effort between a scientist at a U.S. institution and the University of Tasmania.  It is anticipated that results from the study would be incorporated into class lecture material for graduate and undergraduate courses at Old Dominion University.  One graduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.",
