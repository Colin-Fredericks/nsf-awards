 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project explores the evolution of film stress, surface morphology and microstructure during the growth of InGaN by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on Ga-polar and N-polar GaN surfaces. A combination of in-situ wafer curvature measurements to probe dynamic changes in biaxial stress during MOCVD growth and post-growth transmission electron microscopy characterization will be emphasized. Initial studies will focus on investigation of compressive stress relaxation in InGaN grown on Ga-polar GaN on (0001) SiC substrates. The effects of N-rich vs group III-rich growth and intentional Si doping on stress relaxation, surface morphology and the structural and optical properties of the material will be studied early in the project. Comparable studies will then be carried out for N-polar InGaN/GaN grown on misoriented SiC. The project aims for identification and understanding of fundamental mechanisms of stress relaxation in InGaN, and the type and spatial distribution of resulting defects along with development of strategies to control stress and reduce defect formation. \r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The results from the proposed study are anticipated to yield new insights into the mechanisms of stress relaxation and microstructure evolution in Ga-polar and N-polar InGaN layers that can be exploited for improvements in photovoltaic and solid state lighting performance. The project forms the basis of Ph.D. thesis work of two graduate students; undergraduate students will also be involved in the research through REU programs at Penn State. The project enables the PI and her graduate students to collaborate with members of the Penn State MRSEC Center for Nanoscale Science and personnel at the Franklin Institute Museum in Philadelphia, PA on the development of a cart-based interactive demonstration kit on energy materials. The PI will assist in the development of module activities that utilize light emitting diodes to convey technical concepts such as light emission from semiconductor materials, color mixing and solid state lighting. The museum show on energy materials will initially be developed for visitors of the Franklin Institute but will also be distributed nationwide to at least twenty other science museums.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nInGaN quantum wells are widely used as the active region in blue/green light-emitting diodes and laser diodes.  There is also interest in developing high efficiency photovoltaics based on InGaN, however, this requires the growth of InGaN layers that are thicker than quantum wells in order to absorb a sufficient portion of the incident solar radiation.  InGaN-based devices are typically grown in the group III-polar direction and there is a propensity for V-shaped pits to form in the surface of group III-polar InGaN and enlarge in size with increasing layer thickness.  The prevalence of V-pits is a limiting factor to the growth of thicker InGaN layers which are needed for solar cell devices and other applications.  While not as common, InGaN can also be grown in the N-polar direction.  It is less energetically favorable for V-pits to form in N-polar InGaN, consequently, it may be possible to produce thicker InGaN layers via N-polar growth.\n\nThis study investigated the growth and characterization of group III-polar and N-polar InGaN layers.  The layers were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using real-time wafer curvature measurements to study film stress and stress relaxation mechanisms.  Initial studies focused on developing techniques to prepare N-polar GaN templates on C-face SiC substrates with smooth surfaces that were suitable for subsequent studies of InGaN growth.  Two techniques were developed to reduce the surface roughness of N-polar GaN including the use of indium surfactants and the development of a two-step temperature process.  It was found that the use of the two-step temperature process significantly reduced compressive stress in the N-polar GaN which resulted in films with the lowest surface roughness.  InGaN layers, approximately 140 nm thick, were then grown using identical conditions on Ga-polar and N-polar GaN templates grown on Si-face and C-face SiC, respectively.  The group III-polar InGaN layers grew under a compressive stress on the Ga-polar GaN template and a high density of V-pits was present on the film surface.  N-polar InGaN initiated growth on the N-polar GaN template in a nearly stress-free state which transitioned to a compressive stress after ~20 nm of growth.  The N-polar InGaN surface roughness was low with negligible V-pits.  Chemical analysis of the InGaN layers revealed non-uniform InGaN composition in the group III-polar InGaN layer with a higher indium fraction present in the vicinity of V-pits.  The indium fraction of the N-polar InGaN films was much more uniform.   Optical characterization of the group III-polar InGaN layers showed non-uniform emission across the sample surface with lower energy emission in the vicinity of V-pits while the emission energy of the N-polar InGaN was uniform.   However, the emission intensity of the N-polar InGaN layers was significantly lower than that of the group III-polar InGaN films likely due to a higher concentration of point defects such as oxygen and carbon impurities which may act to reduce radiative recombination in the material.  \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe results demonstrate the promise of N-polar InGaN for the fabrication of thick V-pit free layers with uniform composition although the point defect density of the films must be further reduced to achieve optical properties sufficient for device applications.\n\nThe project provided financial support for the thesis research of two graduate students pursuing Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering and partial support for a postdoctoral scholar.  Undergraduate students participated in the research through summer internships and as part of their senior thesis projects.  One of the graduate students and two of the undergraduate students were members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  The graduate students presented a hands-on workshop on light emitting diodes to several groups of elementary students as part of the outreach activities of t..."
