 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work focuses on theoretical aspects of tests of fundamental symmetries with atoms and molecules. The project  is driven by searches for new physics, such as supersymmetry, beyond the standard model of elementary particles, with atomic parity violation. Such searches rely on exquisite experimental sensitivity to minute effects of fundamental forces on atomic and molecular structure. High-accuracy calculations are required for revealing (or extracting constraints on) new, yet undiscovered particles. The derived constraints are competitive and, at the same time complementary to the information gained from particle colliders.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work evidently reach beyond AMO physics, into fundamental elementary particle theory. The impacts are broad, as the work may contribute to extensions of the standard model.  In addition, this grant will support research and education of a graduate student. The student will be encouraged to participate at meetings and activities of the American Physical Society. The findings and results will be disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conference presentations, and the Internet.",
