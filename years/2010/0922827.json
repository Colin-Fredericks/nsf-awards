The instrumentation will allow hyperspectral imaging at spatial resolution necessary for various research projects. The instrumentation will enhance existing funded research but will also be used to complete exploratory pilot research aimed at enhancing future proposals. Current and pending research involves mineralogical petrology, cement and coatings effects on remotely sensed infrared spectra, deep-sea vent Fe-S mineral and organic chemistry, sulfide particle-living cell interactions, volatile effects on mineral/melt equilibria, marine sediment early diagenesis and its alteration by bottom-dwelling animals, high-pressure carbonate geophysics and chemistry, pressure-induced polymerization, organic matter distribution in sedimentary carbonate rocks, and investigating Marian aqueous processes. Leveraged NASA funds will be used to purchase vibration-resistant optical benches for the new instruments. The PI will conduct user training for all new users and has committed 10% time to setup, calibration and training. The instrumentation will be used by members of the Geosciences, Marine Sciences and Chemistry Departments. In addition, users will come from the Mineral Physics Institute. Stony Brook will also incorporate these instruments into existing IGERT and CIDER activities. Instruments will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses covering mineralogy, spectroscopy and remote sensing. \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
