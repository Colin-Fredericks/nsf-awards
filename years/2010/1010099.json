 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells as a power source for automobiles and stationary or portable power applications. Currently, the high cost of the PEM fuel cell limits their commercial applications.  A significant cost of a PEM fuel cell comes from the use of Platinum.  This project intends to develop a low cost core shell nanostructured catalyst which has the advantages of high specific catalyst activity as well as controllable shape and size.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project will be reduced use of platinum in PEM fuel cells.  This will lower their cost.  Fuel cells have the potential to revolutionize the power generation methodology and offer cleaner and more efficient power.  This project targets the automobile industry as potential customers. More new jobs could be created by establishing leadership in this emerging technology; and fuel cells also are beneficial to the environment.",
