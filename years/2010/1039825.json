 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) development project is for a new polysonic wind tunnel blowdown facility consisting of a compressed air generation and storage system, test sections, and exhaust system. A wind tunnel is typically characterized by its speed range and the size of its test section. The facility has a 12-in x 12-in x 24-in test section with a Mach number range of 0.2 to 5 with a maximum Reynolds number capability of  roughly 20 million/foot. This facility will be large enough to be useful to industry, ensuring its long-term, efficient use but small enough to be efficiently operated in a university.  It will be used to develop innovative, practical active flow and noise control techniques and advanced diagnostics to study the design of, and fundamental problems in, high-speed flight vehicles. It will incorporate unique design features with low test-section noise and extensive optical access for flow diagnostics. \r\n\r\nThe PolySonic Wind Tunnel will create a unique shared resource to a) produce fundamental advances in gas dynamics, material science and other areas; b) develop transformational flow control technologies; and c) attract, educate, and help retain a diverse pool of engineers and scientists, including underrepresented minorities from our partner institutions. The facility will thus produce critical knowledge while dramatically accelerating transformative research leading to next-generation designs. It will also leverage and augment the resources of the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion, a multi-university, statewide Center of Excellence, led by Florida State University.",
