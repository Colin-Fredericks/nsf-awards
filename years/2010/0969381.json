 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present project will study electron-molecule collision processes in gas phase, on surfaces, in cluster environment and in the presence of strong laser fields. A particular focus will be on biologically-relevant molecules, like simple amino acids, for which basic electron attachment mechanisms will be investigated. The effects of laser fields in electron-molecule interaction will also be studied.\r\n\r\nThis research will create new knowledge in the areas connecting collision physics with chemical control, radiobiology and atmospheric science. The research will involve interdisciplinary efforts and collaborations with scientists from other fields. It will train students in broader areas, including several subdisciplines. Examples demonstrating the role of low-energy electrons in different areas of chemistry, biology and environmental science will be incorporated in teaching.",
