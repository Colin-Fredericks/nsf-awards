 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award investigates how humans integrate a wide variety of  \r\ninformation sources to achieve rapid, accurate natural language  \r\ncomprehension subject to the physical and cognitive constraints under  \r\nwhich it takes place.  The project's primary empirical focus is on  \r\nreading, a mode of information exchange of unexceeded importance in  \r\nliterate societies.  Reading involves a rapid sequence of targeted eye  \r\nmovements throughout a text -- recordable through modern eye-tracking  \r\ntechnology -- from which noisy sensory input are obtained and  \r\nintegrated with prior knowledge to resolve perceptual and linguistic  \r\nuncertainty.  The central goal of this project is thus to develop,  \r\nimplement, and test a computational model of language comprehension  \r\nand eye movement control in reading built on principles of  \r\nprobabilistic inference and rational action, using the tools of  \r\nnatural language processing (NLP) technology, reinforcement learning,  \r\nand behavioral psycholinguistic experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe success of this project is likely to have major impact in the  \r\nfield of human sentence processing, bringing a new level of nuance and  \r\ndetail to both theory and data analysis, and will bear on broad  \r\ncurrent debates in cognitive science regarding rationality in  \r\ncognition. Additionally, the results of this basic research project  \r\nhave a wide range of potential applications ranging from intelligent  \r\ntutoring technology to language-impairment diagnosis to cognitive  \r\nergonomics. Together with this research program, the project involves  \r\nan educational program including a new textbook on probabilistic  \r\nmodels in the study of language, new undergraduate and graduate  \r\ncourses, and tutorials and courses on computational psycholinguistics  \r\nat major conferences and summer institutes.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award is co-funded by two directorates:: CISE/IIS and SBE/BCS.",
