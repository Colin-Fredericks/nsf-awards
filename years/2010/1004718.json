Despite extraordinary advances in computational power, the data produced in such settings continues to pose a number of challenges. Fortunately, in many cases this data is highly structured and actually contains a comparatively small amount of information.\n\nThe research supported by this grant investigated how we can leverage such structure to completely change the way that we acquire and process data in these applications.  This involved a careful study of the underlying mathematical models that can be used to capture this structure as well as the impact of real-world problems such as \"noise\" that might contaminate our data.
