 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multidisciplinary (99)\r\nTo be effectively prepared for the workforce, students need to learn not only science content (facts) but also advanced transferable reasoning skills.  Through development and practice of these skills students will be better prepared to successfully handle real-world tasks in future careers.  Not only does inquiry-based instruction promote scientific reasoning (SR) abilities, but also the SR skills of teachers significantly impact their ability to effectively use inquiry methods. Effective STEM teachers need to be competent in both their own content knowledge as well as advanced reasoning skills. \r\n\r\nMany teacher preparation programs include inquiry-based courses in order to develop both content knowledge and general abilities, such as scientific reasoning, while modeling best teaching practices.  Innovative teacher education programs at many institutions now have many inquiry-based courses designed specifically for pre-service teachers.  However, there is evidence (derived through pre- and post-tests of students' SR abilities and their understanding of the nature of science) that many pre-service teachers are not developing these critical skills.  In response to this need, this project is developing SR-oriented training modules that can be readily transferred to teacher preparation programs at other institutions",
