 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an innovative microwave surface-wave plasma source for low-cost, large-area, high-throughput conformal thin-film growth.  A scalable architecture will be designed to generate high-pressure, low-temperature, narrow-gap, high-density, and damage-free microwave plasmas without the need for external magnetic fields.  This project is expected to demonstrate the high-speed and large-area deposition of high-quality hydrogenated nanocrystalline and amorphous silicon thin films for high-efficiency tandem solar cells.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a new plasma source with high-speed, large-area and high-quality thin film growth for applications in photovoltaic cells and other semiconductor devices.  When scaled to large-areas, current Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) and Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition (PEALD) capacitive systems have limitations due to large transient Radio Frequency (RF) voltages, discharge non-uniformity and generation of arcs and surface defects between two active parallel plates.  In this project, a microwave surface-wave plasma source will be developed to overcome these challenges.  In addition, Starfire Industries will partner with the Center for Plasma-Material Interactions at the University of Illinois to provide educational opportunities to students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigated a new type of plasma source that could be used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices (computer chips) and photovoltaic devices (solar panels).  Plasma is considered the fourth state of matter, beyond solids, liquids and gases.  Plasma chemistry is very useful for making thin-films (fractions of the width of a human-hair) since plasmas have properties that can be electrically-controlled through electric fields, magnetic fields, pressure, temperature, etc.  Very expensive machines are used to generate plasmas for use in the production of computer chips and solar panels.  Consequently, improving the capability of plasma source can pay big dividends in terms of lower cost, higher quality and faster production.\n\nThe standard plasma generator technology, the capacitively-coupled radiofrequency discharge, is good for manufacturing computer chips but has difficulty scaling up to large sizes for making solar panels.  While large solar panels can be made with the current technology, it is expensive and there are limits to the quality of the solar cell product.  Both of these problems drive up the unit cost of the end product&mdash;limiting broad adoption.  The proposed innovation addresses the deficiencies of the standard technology with a radical new approach.\n\nThe Phase I program successfully met its planned milestones, demonstrating microwave surface-wave plasmas in the laboratory and technical feasibility of the proposed technique.  The encouraging findings from this work strongly support continued Phase II development since it may lead to advances in domestic semiconductor and photovoltaic manufacturing (jobs), address important national energy policy goals (solar), and influence broader environmental impacts (global climate change).  This work has also fostered educational and mentorship opportunity for students in a research laboratory setting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/15/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian E Jurczyk"
