The spectrometer will be the first dedicated instrument in the new Molecular Interactions Core Facility. Researchers are using the new spectrometer to investigate functional amyloids in biofilms, metal adsorption and persistence in prions, plant cell receptors for Agrobacterium tumefaciens, protein-protein interactions necessary for biosynthesis of polyketides in Mycobacteria, small molecule binding to DNA, centromere-protein interactions in the mitotic complex, and other topics.  The spectrometer thus enhances research capability, promotes intra- and inter-departmental collaboration, and provides experience with state-of-the-art instruments for a group of highly diverse faculty, post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers.  Results from the studies conducted with the new spectrometer will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation at professional meetings.",
