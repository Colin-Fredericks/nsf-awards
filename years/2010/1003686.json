 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative grant is collecting paleoclimate proxy data from locations in Southern Hemisphere tropical and mid-latitudes and using these data to constrain global circulation model (GCM) simulations of climate change. Through this coordinated effort, the research enhances our knowledge of potential mechanisms which influenced Holocene climate events such as the Little Ice Age. The investigators have three specific aims: 1) developing a continuous record of Holocene climate change near the largest tropical ice mass, Peru's Quelccaya Ice Cap, using multiple paleoclimate proxies, including chironomid and diatom assemblages in lake sediments; 2) tracking Little Ice Age climatic conditions over a broader area of the Andes, from ~13 to 40\u00b0S latitude; and 3) using a GCM to evaluate which mechanistic hypotheses explain the geographical and temporal patterns of reconstructed paleoclimatic fluctuations.\r\nThis research establishes a detailed multi-proxy record of the Holocene paleoclimate and paleoenvironment in the southern tropics near the Quelccaya Ice Cap. Defined by radiocarbon ages and supplemented by surface exposure (10Be) ages, this chronology is comparable with higher-latitude records from both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In addition to the temporally detailed record from Quelccaya, the research provides a spatially resolved reconstruction of climate during the Little Ice Age in the southern tropics and mid-latitudes. The broader pattern of Little Ice Age Andean glacier fluctuations in multiple climatic regimes also provides valuable data for examining the relative influences of temperature and precipitation on such fluctuations. These efforts interface with ongoing NSF-funded research (EAR-0902363) investigating Holocene glacier fluctuations in Patagonia, enhancing both research projects.\r\nThis research provides both paleoclimate proxy data and modeling results to further the understanding of Holocene and recent climate change in the southern tropics and mid-latitudes. The research tests various mechanisms for the Little Ice Age. For example, it examines results from modeling of solar forcing during the Little Ice Age which suggest that there were changes in tropical circulation in addition to Northern Hemisphere climate changes. Since the paleoclimate data from near Quelccaya Ice Cap spans a time period influenced by differing boundary conditions, such as high and low austral summer insolation, it should be possible to examine various mechanisms for rapid climate events. Possible mechanisms include a latitudinal shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the strengthening/weakening of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include (1) applying and evaluating a promising proxy (chironomid assemblages) method in a new area (tropical Andes) and archiving sediment cores; (2) strengthening and establishing new international and interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists including Dr. Pedro Tapia of Peru and Chilean scientists; (3) training graduate and undergraduate students; and (4) ensuring outreach and dissemination to the general public of information regarding climate change.",

Mountain glaciers provide an important window into past climate, which complements other climate proxies.  The record of their advances and retreats is preserved in glacial landforms, which can be dated using modern radiocarbon techniques and modern techniques based on the rate of production of certain substances (specifically isotopes of the element Beryllium) produced by cosmic ray bombardment of exposed rock.\n\nThis project conducted glacial modeling in aid of interpreting glacial geology data collected by our research collaborators doing field work in the Huancane Valley in the subtropical Andes.  The aim of the modeling work was to determine what combinations of temperature and precipitation could give rise to the observed glacial advances.  Dates yielded by the project imply that the times for which we can reconstruct the tropical climate correspond approximately to the Little Ice Age and the Younger Dryas periods.  In both cases, we concluded that substantial cooling would be needed to account for the observed advances, and that the glacial fluctuations cannot be accounted for by natural variabiltiy.\n\nGlacial data in the Tropics is particularly useful because, above the boundary layer, temperature is quite horizontally uniform in the Tropics and Subtropics.
