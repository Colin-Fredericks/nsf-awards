 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate warming has been identified as one of the most important threats to freshwater ecosystems globally. Because temperature is the fundamental driver of nearly all biological processes, climate warming will likely have strong effects on freshwater ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide for humans. Despite recent theoretical advances that provide clear predictions about how organisms should respond to warming, our current understanding is hindered by (a) the short-term and small-scale nature of most previous studies and (b) the non-trivial practical challenges associated with experimental warming of freshwaters at the ecosystem scale. This study will take advantage of a unique geothermally-active watershed in Iceland that contains a steep gradient of stream temperatures and very little difference in solute chemistry. Using a landscape gradient study of \"temperature-acclimated\" streams, streamside manipulations, and an ecosystem-scale experiment, this study will quantify the effects of warming on critical ecosystem processes (ecosystem metabolism and nutrient cycling) and the flow of energy and elements through stream food webs.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed multi-scale design will produce much-needed data concerning the response of stream ecosystems to changes in temperature regime, benefitting society through increased understanding of how climate warming will influence freshwater ecosystems and the critical services they provide to humanity. The project will integrate research and education through training and mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral associate. In addition to communicating results through traditional outlets (publications, national/international meetings), findings will be presented to local grade schools, high schools, and the community at large with presentations, an interactive research blog, and semi-annual meetings with Icelandic colleagues.",
