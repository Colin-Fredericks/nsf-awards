These resources reflect a robust research-based development cycle that has functioned over a number of years through multiple NSF-funded projects. They represent the products of important findings and notable advances in educational technology and pedagogy that have resulted from this accumulated body of work, and as such they amplify the strong intellectual merit of this current Selection Services project. The dissemination of these resources through NSDL represents an important development for the education field and makes the broader impacts of the project felt by fostering practitioners' ability to use and learn from these advances and build on them with additional work of their own.",
