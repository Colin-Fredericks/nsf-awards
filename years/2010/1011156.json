 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental research program extends the idea of quantum simulation to investigations of many-body Fermi systems governed by the Dirac equation. The systems studied will include up to three flavors of fermions and two additional pseudo-spin degrees of freedom. Problems germane to relativistic particle physics and nanoelectronic devices such as graphene and carbon nanotubes will be investigated. To realize a system described by the Dirac equation, fermionic Li-6 atoms will be confined in a three dimensional optical lattice with a honeycomb structure in two-dimensions. For a honeycomb lattice at half-filling (the situation realized in intrinsic graphene), low-energy excitations have a linear dispersion relation and can be formally described by a massless Dirac equation where the speed of light c is replaced by the Fermi velocity vF . The pseudo-spin degree of freedom corresponding to the four-component Dirac spinor is associated with the two interleaving triangular sub-lattices A and B which comprise the honeycomb lattice. A method for adding an adjustable mass term in the Dirac equation by producing an inequality between the A and B sublattices will be implemented. \r\n\r\nThe investigations of transport (including the role that interactions play) and mechanisms for opening a bandgap in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice will aid in the development of nanoelectronic devices based on graphene such as ultra-high speed transistors and novel electron optics devices. Study of Klein tunneling and the opening of a bandgap due to interactions will respectively provide insight into fundamental questions regarding the electrical breakdown of the QED vacuum and chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in QCD. Furthermore, the observation of a color superconducting phase will guide our understanding of the state of high-density nuclear matter. In carrying out this research, undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in the use of modern technology, analytical thinking, scientific writing and giving clear oral presentations. This research program will continue to recruit students from demographic groups underrepresented in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA periodic honeycomb lattice potential in which fermionic atoms can move was realized by interfering three laser beams to form a lattice poential.  The fermionic atoms obey the same quantum statistics as electrons do and the optical honeycomb lattice mimics the crystalline lattice through which electrons move in materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes.  In this way, the neutral fermionic atoms can mimic the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons in certain materials of interest for thier exotic electron transport behavior.  What is remarkable, however, is that the atomic system is both well controlled and extremely flexible which allows for the systematic study of phenomena of interest to the development of these materials.   This includes the study of phenomena such as Klein tunneling, Veselago lensing, the opening of a energy gap at the Dirac points due to interactions, and the effect of interactions and disorder on the mobility of fermions for a lattice at half-filling.  While working toward these long term research goals, however, we discovered we had the opportunity to make two other impactful discoveries. \n\nThe first result will aid in the development and proper characterization of state-of-the-art atomic clocks currently under development.  Frequency shifts which arise from collisions between atoms are a primary limitation to the accuracy of atomic clocks currently used to define the second.  However, it was believed that atomic clocks utilizing fermionic atoms -- atoms with the same quantum statistical properties as electrons  --  would be universally immune to such collisional frequency shifts.  Prior experimental work which made use of fermionic atoms operating as an atomic clock in the radio-frequency domain supported this idea.  Our work, however, demonstrated that a collisional frequency shift still occurs for an ultracold Fermi gas if the excitation field used to interact with the atoms has spatial inhomogeneity.  While spatial inhomogeneities can be made extremely small for atomic clocks operating in the radio-frequency or microwave regimes, next generation atomic clocks which utilize optical frequency transitions are inherently susceptible to spatial inhomogeneity owing to the short length variation scale of the optical wavelength.  The collisional frequency shift characterized in our work can now be properly included in the error budgets for these optical lattice clocks.  Further, our work demonstrates how best to operate the clock in order to minimize such frequency shifts.\n\nA significant current effort in atomic physics is focussed on engineering systems of ultracold atoms to act as dedicated quantum computers -- or quantum simulators -- to simulate the quantum mechanical behavior of more complex physical systems such as high temperature superconductors or nuclear matter.  To this end it is important to learn how to controllably engineer interactions between atoms in an ultracold gas.  Prior work had made use of strongly coupled collisional resonances in an ultracold gas to adjust the sign and strength of interactions between pairs of atoms. However, these interactions were independent of momentum over the scale of collision energies present in ultracold gas experiments.  Our work demonstrated that a weakly coupled collisional resonance could be used to engineer interactions with a momentum dependence.  Interactions with a momentum dependence are important for engineering a proper quantum mechanical model of certain physical systems.  Momentum dependent interactions, for example, are important to include if one wants to realize a quantum many-body system which models the equation of state of neutron matter found in the crust of neutron stars.\n\nOver the course of this three year grant, two undergraduate students and five graduate students in physics received training which was supported, at least in part, by this grant.  The two undergraduate students went on to pursue graduate degrees in electrical e..."
