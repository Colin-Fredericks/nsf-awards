 "awd_abstract_narration": "0967224\r\nWhite\r\n\r\nThis research will aid development of the fundamental understanding necessary to determine how a turbulent flow interacts with an eroding or ablating surface. Specifically, the coherent structures within a turbulent boundary layer, for example, trigger and drive the growth of non-uniform surface topography. In turn, the evolving topography influences the coherent structures within the turbulent flow. The coupling between the flow and solid structures can exist under either isothermal or non-isothermal conditions involving heat transfer. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The research team includes investigators at the University of Vermont and the University of New Hampshire. The computational component of the research is aimed at developing a generalized algorithm to simulate the spatially-varying ablation of an initially-smooth surface under heated conditions. Corresponding experimentation will involve acquisition of detailed data to validate the computational model. The model will be based upon the direct numerical simulation methodology which is capable of predicting the fine detail of the flow field as well as the potentially complex surface shape evolution. Correspondingly, the experimental program will utilize, for example, particle image velocimetry to measure the detail of the flow structure, as well as optical methods to capture the surface shape evolution. Both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions will be considered.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The coupled dynamics of turbulent flow and surface erosion or ablation is important in applications ranging from high speed flight to latent energy storage. Additional applications include erosion and movement of sand or soil around bridge pilings, and beach erosion. The research will involve a diverse cadre of undergraduate students while a special topics graduate course will address the integration of experiment and computation.",
