 "awd_abstract_narration": "U-Pb laser ablation geochronology has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons. Despite the widespread application of this tool to a host of geological problems, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols. The result is inter-laboratory bias and both under- and over-estimation of errors on calculated dates. This limits our ability to compare results from different labs and limits rigorous compilations from databases such as EarthChem. This project will remedy this situation by developing cyber infrastructure tools in support of Laser-Ablation ICP-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The project will develop open-source, free, software in consultation with the international community to treat with statistical rigor all aspects of data reduction, from calculation of ratios to correction for interferences and drift. Our approach will follow that used in developing similar software as part of the EARTHTIME project and requires the integration of the fields of software engineering and geochemistry. The resulting software will eliminate large sources of interlaboratory bias and serve as a teaching tool showing clearly how raw ratios are converted into dates and uncertainties.\r\n\r\nCreating the software for connecting the LA-ICP-MS community with the developing EarthChem database for geochronology and thermochronology will provide the integration of data from this important technique into the larger data structure of geochemistry and geology. These data will play an important role in far-ranging fields such as understanding the growth of continents, chronology of evolutionary changes, timing of early hominid evolution, and linkages between climate and tectonics. During all phases of the planned work, we will involve a broad cross section of the community from undergraduates to post-doctoral scientists to help develop the next generation of analysts and software engineers. In particular, the systematic evolution of the collaboration between software engineers and earth scientists will be advanced as it produces robust and reliable workflow tools.",
