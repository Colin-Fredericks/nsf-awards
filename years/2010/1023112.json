 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on a previously developed scaffolded software environment called ChemProV (Chemical Process Visualizer). ChemProV presents chemical engineering students with dynamically-generated feedback on the syntactic and semantic correctness of their evolving process flow diagrams and sets of equations, guiding them toward correct solutions. Prior evaluations show that ChemProV promotes a statistically significant advantage in problem-solving accuracy, significantly more time on task, and a robust transfer-of-training to an unscaffolded problem-solving situation. In order to expand its impact, this project integrates ChemProV with a studio-based curricular approach in which students use ChemProV to construct solutions to material and energy balance problems, and present their solutions to their peers and instructor for critical review and discussion. The project integrates ChemProV into an online peer review environment, thus enabling the peer reviews to be performed completely online. Chemical engineering instructors at 10 new institutions will adopt ChemProV and the studio-based approach in their gateway material/energy balance courses, and participate in a rigorous quasi-experimental evaluation of their impact on student learning, attitudes, and retention. Through the training, collaboration, and research supported by this project, the project builds a community of chemical engineering educators who are committed to applying, refining, and improving ChemProV and the studio-based approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Studio-based learning (SBL) is an instructional technique used in many disciplines.  It involves four phases (construct, present, critique, respond) and requires the use of the highest levels of learning from the students.  A drawback in using SBL is the time involved in completing the four phases, making it difficult to use in the typical 50-minute college class period.  This project developed a combination of two software programs to overcome this difficulty and make the use of SBL possible in a greater variety of educational settings.\n\n            ChemProV is a software package meant to ease the transition between written problem statements, an appropriate visual representation, and a mathematical representation and solution for typical material and energy balance problems (the create and present phases of SBL) that a student might encounter in chemical engineering.  OSBLE (Online Studio Based Learning Environment) is a software package that allows asynchronous discussions (the critique and respond phases of SBL) amongst students.  Combining these two allows students to create a solution to a problem, present it to other students in a uniform format, have other students assess the strengths and weaknesses of that solution (critique), and be able to respond to those critiques. \n\n            The intellectual merit of doing this is based in the self-efficacy theory of learning.  If a student learns basic materials well, the student will be more successful in subsequent activities, thus leading to increased confidence and a greater willingness to continue learning.  The approach also has broader impacts.  If more students are successful in their basic engineering courses, they are more likely to continue in their chosen engineering discipline.  This will result in a greater retention of engineering students and an increase in the number of engineering graduates.  This greater retention will help address the shortfall in engineers reported within the United States.\n\n            To test whether the combination of ChemProV/OSBLE would have an impact on student learning and/or retention, we employed the following quasi-experimental study design.  During the first year of the study, the material/energy balance class in chemical engineering was taught in its usual fashion.  At the start of the class students solved two different problems.  The first of these was a typical problem for the class.  For the second problem students were given a solution to another problem and asked to critique the strengths (correctness) and weaknesses of the solution, as well as recommend changes.  The students then solved the same two problems at the end of the class.  The difference between the pre-test and post-test scores thus indicate the amount of learning they had achieved during the class.  During the second year of the study, the material/energy balance class was taught using an SBL approach (implemented using ChemProV/OSBLE).  Again pre- and post-test problems were solved and scored.  The difference between the pre/post-test results obtained in the SBL treatment was then compared with the difference between the pre-/post-test results obtained in the traditional treatment in order to determine the effect of SBL on student learning.  To increase the power and generalizability of the study, we recruited seven other institutions to participate in the study. In addition to the problem-solving assessments, students also completed attitudinal surveys, both at the beginning and end of the class, in both years of the study.\n\n            An analysis of this data from all of the participating institutions showed no statistically significant learning differences between the SBL and traditional treatments.  Within the SBL treatment, a significant improvement was seen in the student\u00c6s ability to critique the work of others from the start to the end of a class.  The attitudinal surveys indicated that the SBL activity resulted in an increase the s..."
