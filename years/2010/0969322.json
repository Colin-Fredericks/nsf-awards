 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motion of electrons and atoms during and immediately following their interaction with light fields is one of the important and difficult challenges of quantum physics. The standard methods of quantum calculations that underpin most current understanding of molecular structure are based on simplifying assumptions that break down at critical times when molecules absorb intense light, collide strongly, or are subjected to other strong electric fields. Without these simplifications, the calculations become intractable even for molecules of modest size, and the basic connections between atomic motion and electron motion in molecules are not well understood. The goal of the quantum control research in this project is to use strong fields to direct quantum processes towards desired targets, such as rearranging the bonds in a molecule. Control methods using strong fields can overcome the complexities described above, through the use of powerful techniques such as learning feedback algorithms that automatically reprogram the experimental driving fields to seek to optimize the target yield without guidance from calculations. This project explores three new ways to improve the effectiveness of quantum control. The first is a new conceptual framework called a Quantum Resonance Ring that could help our understanding of many-body quantum problems. The second improvement is to apply the techniques of pattern recognition to the high-dimensional problems in quantum control. The third improvement is to extend laser control investigations to use newly available x-ray laser sources.\r\n \r\nIn a broader context, quantum control research will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the actions of electrons in molecular transformation and chemistry. Electron motion is considered a gateway problem for progress in areas of nano-materials, chemical science, and energy technologies. Insights gained from this work could therefore influence problems such as the energy conversion efficiency of new photovoltaics; the search for a catalyst to efficiently extract hydrogen from water; or the development of sustainable biofuel technologies. Quantum control is also the fundamental technology in the new field of quantum information. Future scalable quantum computers or quantum information transfer systems will rely on quantum control for gate operations and for error correction. Some of the most promising implementations involve the use of electrons as qubits and lasers as control fields, so the knowledge gained about quantum control of electrons in the presence of strong laser fields could be directly applicable.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Control of electrons inside molecules:  The timescale for atoms to vibrate or move in molecules is less than a trillionth of a second, which means that there are as many atomic vibrations in one minute than there are minutes in the history of the universe.  Yet the electrons that glue the atoms together in molecules are far faster still.  They speed between atoms in less than a quadrillionth of a second, before the atoms can even begin to move. \nThis separation of timescales simplifies the task of understanding structure in many chemicals and materials, because we can usually assume that electrons move so fast that their motion is instantaneous compared to the atoms.  This famous assumption is called the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, and much molecular structure theory is based on it.\nHowever, chemicals react and change their structure mostly at special atomic geometries where the electrons slow down and move at the same speed as the atoms and the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation breaks down. This is the regime of the \"conical intersection (CIs).\" \nOur goal has been to study and control CIs using advanced short pulse lasers. In the project we have just completed with NSF support, we have observed for the first time that laser light can form a kind of barrier around CIs.  We call these \"Quantum Resonance Rings.\"  We have found evidence that we can force the chemical change to happen at the Quantum Resonance Ring instead of the CI.  This is an important step toward the larger goal of learning how to control chemistry with coherent light.\nOur research employs some of the most advanced lasers ever developed to probe molecules with ultrashort pulses of light.  Some of these lasers can produce attosecond light pulses, which are so short that even the motion of electrons in molecules is effectively frozen.  We also use the revolutionary new x-ray free electron lasers developed first at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford.  These can interrogate the most deeply bound electrons in atoms.\nInsights gained from this work could influence problems such as the energy conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaics; the search for a catalyst to efficiently extract hydrogen from water; the development of sustainable biofuel technologies; and the role of extreme ultraviolet light in the molecular balance in the upper atmosphere.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip H Bucksbaum"
