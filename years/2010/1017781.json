 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project continues the study of interconnections between group theory and the theory and practice of computation.  The major objectives are (1) the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for computations with finite groups; (2) the development of mathematical tools required for the design and analysis of such algorithms; (3) the study of current bottlenecks in the graph isomorphism problem, a major open problem in the theory of computing; and (4) the computationally motivated study of discrete structures involving the group concept.  The project will build on the PIs recent results of breaking quarter-century old bottlenecks in the areas of matrix group computation and on the graph isomorphism problem.  A principal theme of the project is the synergy between the theoretical and practical, benefitting both the field of symbolic algebra and the theory of computing through the design and implementation of algorithms that are both fast in practice and admit rigorous complexity analysis.  The project methodology in the area of matrix computations will combine elements of the two existing approaches, the geometric and abstract structural (\"black-box\") frameworks.  The project also includes related problems in group theory, combinatorics, and computer science, connected through the algorithmic study of objects involving the group concept.  In particular, a combination of such tools will be required for a renewed study of the bottlenecks that have blocked progress on the graph isomorphism problem and the related coset intersection problem in permutation groups.  The PIs will also study of parameters of Boolean functions subject to symmetry conditions, including the complexity of property testing; and the Abelian Sandpile Model which connects a number of fields, including statistical mechanics, algebraic graph theory, discrete dynamical systems, algorithms, and complexity in the study of a certain commutative monoid and group.\r\n\r\nGroups are the mathematical formulation of symmetry, ubiquitous in mathematics and the sciences.  Algorithms for finite groups and their associated Cayley graphs have a wide range of applications, from group theory to statistics, network design, the graph isomorphism problem (of relevance to computer science and chemical documentation), cryptography, and the construction of objects with high symmetry.  The broader impact of the project is primarily through the implementation of new algorithms in GAP, a leading, open access computer algebra system that provides computing environment for research in group theory, algebra, graph theory, coding theory, and design theory.  GAP development also represents a significant contribution to education as there is an increasing demand to use GAP in undergraduate abstract algebra courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe mathematical concept of \"isomorphism\" describes when two, seemingly different, structures (networks, molecules, experimental designs) are actually the same.  This concept, central to the study of finite models, gives rise to the computational question of testing isomorphism.  The focus of the research was the isomorphism problem for two classes of structures: \"graphs\" and \"groups.\"\n\nGraphs (networks of nodes and links) are universal in the sense that isomorphism among all explicit structures can be efficiently reduced to graph isomorphism  (GI), putting GI at center stage.\n\nWhile program packages exist to solve practical instances of GI efficiently, the worst-case complexity of GI has remained unresolved despite decades of effort.\n\nStructural irregularities give a handle on isomorphisms; therefore the focus of the PI's attack was the hard case of \"strongly regular graphs\" (SRGs) and related structures showing high degrees of regularity where no such handle is available.\n\nThe PI, working with his student John Wilmes, joined forces with another research group, Shang-Hua Teng (USC), Xi Chen (Columbia U.) and Chen's student Xiaorui Sun, working on the same problem.\n\nA widely studied theoretical model for algorithms that are efficient even in the \"worst case\" is the notion of \"polynomial time,\" and algorithms running is \"quasi-polynomial time\" are nearly as efficient.  In contrast, algorithms requiring \"exponential time\" are not feasible beyond very small inputs; algorithms running in \"moderately exponential time\" increase the feasible range, depending on the actual exponent.\n\nWe now state the main results obtained by the PI and his collaborators.\n\n 1. The complexity of isomorphism of so-called Steiner systems was reduced to quasi-polynomial from its previous moderately exponential status, moving the problem from the \"infeasible\" to the \"feasible\" domain, breaking a 17-year-old bottleneck.  Dealing with Steiner systems is a component of the attack on SRGs.\n\n 2. The complexity of isomorphism of SRGs has been significantly reduced.  While still moderately exponential, the exponent went down from third root to fifth root of the number of nodes, significantly increasing the feasible domain.  At least as significant, the research uncovered a host of structural facts about SRGs.  In a certain range of the parameters, the complexity actually went down to quasi-polynomial, the first such result in the area.\n\n3. The PI found structural restrictions of a quasi-polynomial nature on the symmetries of SRGs.  While this result is not algorithmic, it removes a theoretical obstacle from potentially quasi-polynomial algorithms for this class.\n\n 4. The PI's student John Wilmes, together with Columbia Univ. PhD student Xiaorui Sun, whom the PI also mentored in this problem area, achieved significant new results on so-called \"primitive coherent configurations\" (PCCs), breaking a 30-year-old barrier in the study of the general GI problem.  Their paper is also the first to build a structure theory of PCCs.  One of their striking discoveries is that in a certain range of the parameters, PCCs possess a \"clique geometry,\" permitting insights from finite geometries to come into play.\n\nAlgebraic structures called \"groups\" are unbiquitous in mathematics and science, providing mathematical language to describe symmetry. The isomorphism problem of explicit finite groups, while easier than GI, poses its own challenges, representing a major obstacle to \"polynomial-time\" efficiency.  The PI worked with his students Paolo Codenotti, Joshua Grochow, and visiting Tsinghua Univ. student Youming Qiao on this problem.  They confirmed the long-held intuition that the difficulty lies, in essence, with commutativity, by demonstrating that isomorphism of so-called semisimple groups (groups with no commutative normal subgroups) can be tested in polynomial time.\n\nIn summary, the PI and his collaborators have completed this project with a measure of success that went beyond the initial expectations.\n\nIntellectual merits. As described above, the research has produced new structural insights and produced significant and in some cases dramatic improvements over what had previously been known about a classical computational problem.  It has pushed the boundaries of our knowledge and opened new avenues of research.\n\nBroader impacts.  It is significant that five students were involved in the project, and subsequently each of them defended their PhD dissertations that were largely or entirely based on this project.  Two of them received their PhDs at major research universities other than the PI's home institution, demonstrating the reach of the PI's mentorship and the impact of this research in developing the human resources of future research as well as\ndeveloping reserach collaboration nationally and internationally. The results have been published in leading conference venues and are freely accessible on the PI's website.  This activity is in synergy with the PI's work as the founding editor of the free, high quality online journal \"Theory of Computing.\"\n\nThe PI's research also strongly affects his success in teaching undergraduates.  In particular, the PI continued to conduct his highly successful course in the annual UChicago Mathematics summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates), drawing several dozen gifted students each year.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laszlo Babai"
