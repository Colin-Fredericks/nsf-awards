 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of three complementary observational efforts, intended to test the conceptual picture that galaxies may gain mass from their surroundings not by accretion of hot plasma that cools as it settles into the galaxy, but rather by accretion of gas that has already cooled in the intergalactic environment and remains cold as it flows into the galaxy, possibly on orderly streams with preferred directions. This idea has gained theoretical support in recent years through hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; observational tests to be performed by the PI consist of radio observations, primarily in the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line, of (1) the outer parts of the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies, (2) large volumes surrounding  two distinctly different clusters at redshift z=0.2, and (3) galaxies located in extremely under-dense void regions. This work will exploit the newly enhanced capabilities of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) in the US. The new data will be combined with archived data to compare the morphologies, star forming properties, environments, and (where appropriate) locations within the clusters of galaxies with, and without, spatially extended cold gas. The observations will be compared against predictions made by high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed by a collaborator on the project; and the Virgo observations, in particular, will be made available to the research community through a website. The work will involve the participation of undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups, and will be highlighted in public presentations in schools and other venues.",

In the last decade a renaissance has taken place in numerical simulations with a much more sophisticated approach to the physics of the gas than was previously possible. The prediction of the simulations is that the dominant growth mode of galaxies is through accretion  of gas.  The accretion rate depends on redshift, it is much more important at early times in the universe, on galaxy mass and on environment.  In the local universe this process is predicted to still take place in the lowest density environments and in the smallest galaxies. Observations indicate that the star formation rate has declined dramatically since z=1 and a major question is why.\nIn this project we addressed these issues by imaging the gas in\ngalaxies in a wide range of environments and comparing the results to\nhigh quality hydrodynamical simulations.\n\nThe Void Galaxy Survey. Voids represents a unique environment for the study of galaxy evolution. The lower density should result in slower evolution of  galaxies. As accretion of cold gas is thought to still occur in the present in the smallest galaxies and lowest densities, voids may be the ideal place\nto look for this. We did an imaging survey in neutral hydrogen of the deepest \nunderdensities of 60 voids selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. \nInterestingly there are indeed no massive galaxies in the void. Most are \nare small, star forming disk galaxies. The most interesting result is that \nthe neutral gas is generally very extended and many galaxies show signs that the gas has been disturbed recently, which could be evidence for infall.\nWe published two papers on the optical and gaseous properties of the\nvoid galaxies in addition to several papers on detailed studies of selected \nsystems. A comparison with a high resolution hydrodynamic simulation of\nthe evolution of a void shows in general good agreement, except that the \nsimulations overpredict the amount of gas present. \n\nClusters of Galaxies.

We also learned how\nto deal with man made radio frequency interference caused by satellites, which will be a major issue for future surveys.\n\nThe void galaxy survey formed the bulk of the thesis of one graduate\nstudent.
