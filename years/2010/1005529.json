The grant will pay partial travel expenses for 10 young investigators, including at least 5 women and other under-represented groups.  The purpose of the conference is to bring together the diverse international community of investigators in statistics and in other areas who develop and use Bayesian methods to share recent findings and to present new and challenging problems to be addressed by the community.\r\n\r\nThis grant enables 10 young investigators from US institutions to participate in the main international meeting for Bayesian statistics which is held every two years.  The use of Bayesian methods in academia, government and industry has been steadily increasing over the past 20 years, with many US researchers playing a leading role. This grant will help to maintain and strengthen this leading role of US scientists. The project will do so in particular by providing young investigators with important opportunities for networking and dissemination of their research results. The meeting is organized by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA, http://www.bayesian.org).  The mission of ISBA is to promote the development and application of Bayesian statistical theory and methods useful in the solution of theoretical and applied problems in science, industry and government. \r\n",
