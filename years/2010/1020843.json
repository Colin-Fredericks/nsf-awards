Irish\r\nIOS-1020843\r\nEvolution of regulatory pathways controlling stem cell proliferation\r\n\r\nStem cells undergo self-renewal as well as producing daughter cells that go on to differentiate into multiple cell types. Thorns represent a unique and previously unexplored opportunity to examine how stem cell proliferation is controlled in plants. Thorns arise from populations of stem cells that, instead of maintaining a stem cell fate, lose their proliferative capacity and terminally differentiate. This project will examine the underlying basis for the arrest of stem cell proliferation in thorns. The first set of goals focus on analyzing known components of the stem cell identity pathway, and determining if these pathways have been utilized during thorn development in Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) and Ulex europaeus (gorse). The second set of goals focus on using high throughput transcriptome analyses to identify novel genes required for restricting stem cell proliferation in Citrus sinensis thorns. Together, these approaches should identify new genes and processes that are critical in the transition from stem cell proliferation to differentiation. By comparing the processes controlling stem cell arrest in thorns to those regulating stem cell proliferation and arrest in other systems, the conserved, as well as divergent, pathways that control stem cell activity can be elucidated. This information will also be valuable in comparing plant stem cell regulation with the processes controlling mammalian stem cell maintenance and differentiation.  In addition, this project will serve to train minority and disadvantaged undergraduate students in molecular genetics and developmental biology, thus broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific research.",
