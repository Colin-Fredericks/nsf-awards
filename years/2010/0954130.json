The funded project is a systematic investigation of the physicochemical interactions between nanomaterials and the environment.  Its goal is to assess the effectiveness of conventional wastewater treatment processes in trapping and/or removing common human-engineered nanoparticles from domestic water supplies.  The work involves extensive nanoparticle characterization and transport experiments under environmentally relevant conditions.  The behavior and interaction of three categories of nanoparticles will be examined:  metal oxides (hematite, titanium oxide, cerium oxide, zinc oxide), metal (gold), and carbon-based (carbon nanotubes).  The impact of various coating/capping agents such as Dextran, DMSA, and Polyamiline that are commonly used on these particles will also be examined.   Both bare and coated/capped nanoparticles will be tested.  Their stability, reactivity, and the effectiveness of removal will be evaluated at each of the four stages of water treatment: coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration.  Nanomaterial behavior over a wide range of water quality parameters, from simplified electrolytes to complex solution chemistries will be examined. Filtration mechanisms will also be investigated in microscopic and macroscopic flow systems.  The impacts of nanoparticle characteristics such as electrophoretic mobility, hydrophobicity, crystalline structure, concentration, and size and shape on the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes will be examined using transmission electron microscopy, UV/Vis, time-resolved dynamic light scattering, fluorescent labeling, magnetic saturation, and other methods.  Experiments will take place in packed bed columns and micromodel systems.  Broader impacts of the research include improving our knowledge of nanoparticle transport and their trapping and removal from drinking water.  The work supports an early career PI whose gender is underrepresented in the sciences and engineering, will engage Hispanic undergraduates from a local community college, and will be incorporated into undergraduate courses.  The work will also partner K12 teachers and students at the Riverside Unified School District with university students through the preparation of materials on how to develop science faire projects on water quality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinal NSF Career Award Laymen Summary\n\n \n\n \n\nThis research project investigated the fate of engineered nanoparticles as they are transported through conventional water treatment plants.  Previous studies have shown nanoparticles cause adverse environmental and health effects.  Nanoparticles in wastewater may end up in our drinking water supplies.  Understanding the mechanisms and capacity of existing infrastructure to effectively remove them before distribution is important to ensure that society has safe and potable drinking water.  The primary goal was to identify the current infrastructure\u00c6s capacity to remove nanomaterials prior to distribution in domestic water supplies.  Two novel experimental systems were developed for this study. The first was a scaled-down jar test experiments that was designed to simulate primary treatment and removal processes being used in municipal plants:  coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation.  Additionally a special flow cell was developed to study filtration under a microscope.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time engineered nanomaterial filtration has been studied in such a direct, visual way.  Representative nanomaterials were selected for use and were characterized and their removal capacity at these critical stages of treatment was assessed.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual merit: This research project demonstrated successful removal of model nanoparticles from typical drinking source waters (ground and surface water) via scaled-down jar tests.  Filtration studies using the microscope flow cell system have demonstrated the critical importance of nanoparticle size and filtration fluid dynamics on the capacity of the filter to remove these particles. \n\n \n\nBroader impact: Over the course of this project, three PhD students (of which, two are women) were supported financially and trained academically.  Additionally, five undergraduate students were involved in the project (of which, two are women and two are from underrepresented minority groups).  Three of the undergraduate students were community college students, included in an effort to engage students and encourage the pursuit of four year college degrees in STEM fields.  To date, two of the PhD students have graduated and four of the undergraduates have completed their bachelor degrees.  These students were all sent to professional meetings such that they could network, develop communication skills, and develop professional \"soft\" skills. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon L Walker"
