 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EAGER grant is to investigate the feasibility and assess the integrity of the implantable device design through computational simulations and optimizing the design for a specific flow rate and delivery time. This objective will be accomplished by implementing the following tasks: (i) Develop design concepts and conduct computational simulations through nano-channel arrays of varying length, height and width, and simulate the drug release kinetics for several candidate drug molecules; and (ii) Optimize the design for specific flow rate and delivery time. Based on the optimized design, a prototype model will be explored. This approach of using computations and design optimization for drug device design and integrity has never been examined for AMD devices due to challenges in size and extended delivery time.\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThis project is a high-risk and high payoff and will provide a fundamental understanding of the physical and mechanical interactions through nano-channels of the drug delivery design and will provide valuable scientific insights into integration characteristics and implantable drug delivery devices. Investigating the design integrity and integration of implantable devices for AMD such as the one proposed in this EAGER project will help reduce the costs and risks associated with frequent injections and promote delivering the drug in a controlled manner and in the required amounts for treating AMD disease.\r\nBroader impacts\r\nThis project will design and develop a novel implantable drug delivery device incorporating nano-channels with controlled drug kinetics and delivery time for treating AMD, and thereby benefit society at large. This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with multidisciplinary knowledge and training related to drug delivery devices, computational studies and optimization. The research results will be integrated into courses the PI?s teach in the ME and ECE curricula. The VCU School of engineering?s summer enrichment programs will be expanded to include this project related work in outreach activities with high school students.",
