 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) grant provides funding for the characterization of the translational and rotational strong ground motions in the vicinity of the fault and for the investigation of their effects on the dynamic response of building structures. The primary objectives of this research are to (1) investigate the characteristics of the dynamic ground deformation field in the near-fault region, (2) explore the effects of tectonic regime and soil conditions on the amplitude and frequency characteristics of near-fault ground motions, (3) derive damping coefficients for the analysis and design of buildings equipped with base isolation and passive energy dissipation devices subjected to near-fault seismic excitations, and (4) investigate the nonlinear response of symmetric and asymmetric buildings to near-fault translational and torsional ground motions.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will improve the parameterization of the translational and rotational ground motions in the vicinity of the earthquake source and contribute to the evaluation of their effects on the dynamic response of buildings in the context of performance-based earthquake engineering. This research will also assess the effectiveness of damping coefficients and accidental eccentricity levels proposed in design codes for buildings. It is anticipated that the proposed research will advance the knowledge in the fields of earthquake engineering and engineering seismology, and will enhance the safety of communities in areas of high seismicity. An education and outreach plan will follow closely the development of the research activities. This plan includes the involvement of minorities and underrepresented groups at the university level and through K-12 outreach activities with the objective of broadening their participation in math, science and engineering.",
