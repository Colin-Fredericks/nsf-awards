 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the International REU site for Gravitational Physics hosted by the Physics Department at the University of Florida, Gainesville.   Detection of gravitational waves requires extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis; it also involves large facilities, significant manpower and international collaborations. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and NSF supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) projects take advantage of a growing number of research-able faculty at small and minority colleges in support of their research efforts. At this REU site, undergraduate students will have an opportunity to establish contact with, experience the research environment of, and work beside, international collaborators involved in all aspects of gravitational wave detection. They will be encouraged to develop, on their own accord, ongoing projects with their international partners. Exposure to research will help cultivate their independence, while the experience in an international setting will furnish them with contacts within a global network, as they pursue their future research.   Research projects will take place at a variety of locations, including the Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover; APC, Paris; the National Astronomical Observatory, Tokyo; University of Glasgow; University of Birmingham; Cardiff University; University of Adelaide; Australian National University, Canberra; the University of Western Australia, Perth; and INFN laboratories, Italy - all in conjunction with the University of Florida.",
