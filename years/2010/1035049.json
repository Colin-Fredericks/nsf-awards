 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nevada Climate Change High School Science Fair Network will create a collaboration between diverse high school students, their classroom teachers, and Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) faculty to use geosciences data focused on climate change science in the development of Intel International Science and Engineering (ISEF) quality high school science fair research projects. Leveraging a recent large NSF EPSCoR climate change infrastructure award to Nevada, we will work with Gathering Genius, Inc. a STEM non-profit,  and UNLV's Dept. of Environmental Studies to: improve teachers understanding of climate change science; increase the quantity and quality of  high school science fair projects based on climate change science being submitted to Nevada  ISEF-affiliated science fairs; improve students chances of passing the Nevada state high school proficiency exam in science; and expand Nevada's climate change research community into rural schools and schools with large numbers of underrepresented students.  Thirty high school teachers will participate in a statewide video-conference workshop then visit and subsequently have real-time access to data from state of the art environmental monitoring stations designed to monitor effects of climate change on Nevada.  The project will provide a graduate level on-line course in climate change science during their participation. A network of faculty with expertise in climate change research, geosciences and related disciplines will then be provided to these teachers and students to create quality science fair projects.  These teachers, from diverse rural and urban schools around Nevada, will recruit and mentor ~150 students to complete Intel ISEF quality science fair projects with emphasis on climate change science, who will submit science fair projects to one of three regional ISEF-affiliated science fairs in Nevada during the two years of the project. If judged to be of high enough quality, some may be recommended to the Intel ISEF in 2012 and 2013. These high school graduates will be excellent candidates for geoscience courses and degree programs of the NSHE, and their admission will increase the numbers and diversity of undergraduate students in the geosciences in Nevada.",
