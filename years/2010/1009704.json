One central problem to be addressed is the existence\r\nof a critical electric field necessary to induce the fluid/solid\r\ntransition in ER fluids.  They anticipate that this phenomenon\r\ngoes beyond classical phase transitions in statistical mechanics,\r\nrepresenting a new type of transitional mechanism that depends on\r\na competition between geometrical entropy and electrical energy. \r\nThey also study the fluid transport and related microstructural\r\ntransition in sea ice, which plays a key role in Earth's climate\r\nsystem.  Such microstructures can be identified with random\r\nmatrices, and the investigators study the evolution of\r\nmicrostructural features with such techniques. \r\n\r\n     Composite materials arise throughout the physical and\r\nbiological sciences and across most types of engineering.  One of\r\nthe key features of these types of problems is the critical\r\ndependence of the effective material properties on the parameters\r\ncharacterizing the system.  For example, an electrorheological\r\n(ER) fluid is a suspension of particles in a viscous fluid such\r\nas oil.  If an applied electric field exceeds a critical value\r\nthen the particles form chains and the suspension undergoes a\r\nfluid/solid transition within milliseconds.  This electrically\r\ninduced transition has been used in applications including next\r\ngeneration clutches, brakes, micro-fluidic valves, and human\r\nprosthetics.  Another example is sea ice, a composite of pure ice\r\nwith brine inclusions, which plays a key role in Earth's climate\r\nsystem.  If the temperature exceeds a critical value, then fluid\r\ncan flow through the ice.  This transition mediates a broad range\r\nof processes in the polar ice packs that are fundamental to\r\nmaking better predictions of climate change.  The investigator\r\nand colleagues conduct fundamental mathematical and numerical\r\nstudies of these transitions in ER fluids and sea ice.  They\r\nbring to bear sophisticated techniques of theoretical statistical\r\nphysics to better understand the behavior of these types of\r\nmaterials.  Through these studies, the investigator anticipates\r\nthe development of applications to other high-tech composites and\r\nto other areas critical to our understanding of polar climate\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n     The project is cofunded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences\r\nand the Division of Materials Research.",
