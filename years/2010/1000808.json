 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to perform high-resolution sensing of surface charges and ionic currents of living cells. Both these measurements will provide important information about the cell membrane and underlying proteins. Understanding the pivotal role of membrane proteins in clinical diagnostics requires measurement tools with high-resolution and distributed sensing. Thus, this project is motivated by the need to miniaturize bioassays with higher resolution and the present lack of integrated measurement tools for advanced cellular studies. The following research tasks will be undertaken (i) electronic sensors to monitor vesicle trafficking and intercellular communication electronically and at real-time, (ii) electrophysiology sites to simultaneously record ionic currents in parallel, (iii) ultra low-noise amplifier with correlated-double-sampling (CDS) sensitive signal readout to process ionic currents, and (iv) a new hybrid approach to model physiological changes within a single ion-channel, cell or cellular assembly.\r\n\r\nThe integrated system will provide an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution for cellular studies. The  integrated education and out-reach components proposed investigation are expected to greatly improve the representation of female students in electrical engineering and open avenues of biotechnology research for engineers.",
