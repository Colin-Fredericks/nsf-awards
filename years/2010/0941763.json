 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) The impact of climate change and habitat fragmentation on biodiversity in urban forests is being studied in multidisciplinary sophomore laboratory exercises and lectures.  The inquiry based approach builds students' research skills progressively over a three course sequence.  The theme of the interactive effects of global climate change and habitat fragmentation on biological diversity in an urban ecological setting serves as a vehicle for advancing undergraduate learning and interest in the environmental field.  The conceptual framework aligns with current thinking about human-dominated ecosystems.  The twenty-one laboratory exercises and lecture materials utilize strategies that embody how students learn most effectively, including student-active approaches, problem solving activities, exercises that build student skills in research, and visualization activities to promote greater understanding of patterns and systems understanding. Qualitative modeling helps students conceptualize ecological relationships and reflect on their understanding as well as for assessment of student understanding. Quantitative modeling is helping students examine potential ecological impacts under different climate change scenarios, and spatial analysis is being used. The material provides practical experience evaluating environmental management options given the range of projected climatic changes.",
