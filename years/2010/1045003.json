 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for American participation in the Cretaceous-climate corehole drilling project currently underway in China. The goal of the project is to recover an essentially complete terrestrial sedimentary record of the entire Cretaceous period from a major rift basin in northeastern China, which will provide proxies for Cretaceous nonmarine climate, with particular emphasis on greenhouse and anoxic ocean periods. Using domestic funding resources, Chinese scientists have already cored the entire Upper Cretaceous (ca 2.5 km of core, with recovery > 95%). International access to that core has been extremely limited, but the PI and his\r\nAmerican colleagues have been given sufficient access to demonstrate that there are robust C- and O-signals throughout the section. Subsequently, the PI and colleagues have obtained a grant from the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) to core the entire Lower Cretaceous.  \r\n\r\nThe PI and colleagues have organized a 3-day meeting of likely collaborators in Beijing to lay plans for the scientific analysis of the ICDP corehole. ICDP participation guarantees international access to the core. Among those participating are a number of noted American scientists specializing in stable isotopes, radiometric dating, magnetostrat, lacustrine sedimentology, and paleoclimatology. This collaboration provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity with respect to understanding global climate history through the Cretaceous terrestrial signals and can have important implications for current climate-change analyses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major geological drilling project currently underway in Heilongjiang Province of northeastern China seeks to recover a complete record of sediment deposited in a long-lived lake during the Cretaceous Period (about 145-66 million years ago).  This time in Earth history included lengthy periods of greenhouse climate, which are reflected in the chemistry and fossils preserved in extensive cores recovered during the drilling project.   The Chinese sediment cores are of special interest to science because the very long-term record of Cretaceous climate recorded in the cores may serve to inform scientists by analogy about processes of climate change occurring in the modern world.  About half of the cumulatively 5 km-long cores have been obtained from drilling to date.  When drilling and initial analysis are completed in 2012, the results will be published in scientific journals; in the meantime, a description of the project can be found as a News Feature in the journal Nature (issue of 9 September 2010].  Ultimately, the scientific results of the project will aid the public in understanding the long-term implications of global climate change. \n\nThe drilling project receives major funding from a consortium of Chinese agencies, with a contribution from the multi-national International Continental Drilling Program.  An international group of geoscientists are involved in the science plan for analyzing the sediment cores, currently including six American scientists [Brad Sageman (Northwestern University), Alan Carroll (University of Wisconsin), Hailiang Dong (Miami of Ohio), Brad Singer (University of Wisconsin), Judy Parrish (University of Idaho), and Stephan Graham (Stanford University)].  A science planning meeting was convened in Beijing, China, in July 2010, and a travel grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation supported participation of those six scientists in that conference.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephan A Graham"
