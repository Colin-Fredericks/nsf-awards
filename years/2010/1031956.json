The PI involves the intelligent standardization of shipments and coordination of resources to facilitate system-wide efficiency in a networked economy much in the way that the digital Internet is based on transmitting standards packets of information.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the transformative paradigm associated with PI, in general, and the optimization and simulation models formulated to establish the logistics system gain potential, in particular.  These model formulations will be a contribution to the field as mathematically rigorous models, resulting in publications that will appear in leading archival journals.  The studies utilizing the models will be disseminated in applications-based journals.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the PI2 include the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of logistics transactions through intelligent standardization in a consumer sector that demands the efficient delivery of product over a worldwide supply chain.  Such standardization will then unleash economic development capable of growing industries while reducing energy consumption and waste for the nation, as well as providing additional capacity to our nation's logistics system.  Participation by students, including continued recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, will be emphasized and they will benefit from this collaborative research project with industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is an industry and university cooperative research center with the mission of enabling member organizations to achieve logistics and distribution excellence by delivering meaningful, innovative and implementable solutions that provide a return on investment.  The objective of this project was to assess how the Physical Internet would impact freight transportation and to increase the visibility of CELDi.\n\nFreight transportation systems, which drive the prosperity and quality of life in the U.S., epitomize current economic, environmental and social contradictions in our society.  The economic value of logistics enterprises reaches the trillions of dollars annually, but there is significant waste and inefficiency. \n\nIn 2007, road-based freight transportation modes consumed nearly 30 billion (B) gallons of fuel [2].  Further, from 1990-2008, the CO2 emissions associated with road-based freight increased by 14.9% to 517 trillion grams (Tg) [2].  The transportation industry is largely segmented and more than three-quarters of freight is carried using dedicated resources.  When carrying an average load, truck trailers are less than 60% full and 20-30% of all trips are empty [2], resulting in an overall utilization of 43%.  The freight transportation industry provides millions of jobs, but also has one of the highest turnover rates in the country.   Addressing these economic, environmental, and social contradictions is an integral part of the Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge [1].         \n\nFor this project, we ask:   Why not transform our transportation system to allow us to effectively utilize our logistics resources?    Such an evolution has significant economic, environmental, and social implications. \n\nOne vision for this transformation is based on interconnected logistics, where goods are handled, stored, and transported across a shared network.  This vision is enabled by an open, global, intermodal logistics system that utilizes standard, modular, reusable containers, real-time identification, and routing through shared logistics facilities.  This framework is referred to as the Physical Internet.  A simplified mental image of the PI vision for interconnected logistics includes a transportation \"auction\" that handles \"black box\" modular containers through an open and shared network with a vast community that utilizes supplier ratings to drive logistics performance.\n\nTo assess the potential of the Physical Internet, we collaborated closely with representatives (Thought Leaders) from eighteen organizations.  These organizations included consumer product manufacturers, retailers, transportation providers, pallet providers, diverse manufacturers, software system providers, and professional organizations.   Before these partner organizations fully considered such a transformation, a realistic assessment of the logistics system gain potential of the PI was needed.  Throughout the two-year project, we organized technical meetings and held monthly teleconferences with the Thought Leaders to discuss issues, collect input and feedback, and present results. \n\nWe focused on the following questions for various supply chain stakeholders:\n\nHow will the PI change how loads are distributed across the freight distribution network?\nWhat are the preferred container sizes in the PI? \nWhat is the subsequent impact on the performance of the system?\n\n\nAs part of this project, we studied how adoption of the PI will change the average fullness of trailers, the average percentage of empty miles, and the resulting CO2 emissions associated with freight distribution.  We developed new analytical models and solution approaches, and we evaluated data from various sources in the U.S. to represent regional and national transportation systems.  The results suggest average trailer fullness can be increased more than 30% and the average cost per load will be reduced by more than 25%.  \n..."
