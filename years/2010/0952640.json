 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rampant growth of stealthy rootkits poses a serious security \r\nthreat to cyberspace. Specifically, with the capability of directly \r\nsubverting the software root of trust of a computer system, a rootkit \r\ncan surreptitiously take over the control of the system and maintain \r\na hidden presence thereafter.  To effectively defend against them, \r\nresearchers have explored various anti-rootkit solutions. Unfortunately, \r\nto our disadvantage, the state-of-the-art defense is mainly reactive \r\nand cannot meet the challenges in the arms-race against them.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a systematic immunization approach to \r\nproactively prevent and exterminate rootkit attacks. This goal is \r\nbeing achieved in three key steps. First, we are developing a fundamental \r\nimmunization capability  self-nonself discrimination to reliably discern \r\nand prevent malicious rootkit code execution. Second, we are investigating \r\na kernel shepherding technique to enforce kernel control-flow integrity. \r\nThird, we are designing and implementing a high-assurance hypervisor \r\nwith a minimal trusted computing base to establish and sustain the \r\nroot-of-trust of the entire computer system. We expect the results \r\nfrom this research will substantially elevate our defense capability \r\nagainst elusive rootkits as well as more generic malware. We will \r\ndisseminate our results by releasing the tools developed as well as \r\nassociated education materials appropriate for undergraduate and \r\ngraduate courses and IT staff training in industry and government \r\nagencies.",
