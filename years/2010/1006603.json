 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nBeginning when early humans harnessed fire for heat and light, the control of electromagnetic radiation has been central to the development of our species.  The notion of electromagnetic radiation is nearly 150 years old, proposed by Maxwell in 1865 and demonstrated with the discovery of radio waves in 1866.  Radio waves remained largely a laboratory curiosity for nearly 50 years.  It is difficult to imagine modern life without radio waves, microwaves, heat, light, and X-rays, which are now all understood to be manifestations of electromagnetic radiation, listed in order of increasing frequency.  However, lying between the frequencies of microwaves and heat, stretching from 0.1 to 10 trillion cycles per second (0.1-10 terahertz) is the so-called 'terahertz gap.'  Electromagnetic waves exist in this frequency range, but they are extremely difficult to generate and control.  This individual investigator award supports a project that will use the world's brightest pulses of terahertz waves, generated by accelerator-driven 'free-electron lasers', to search for new quantum-mechanical phenomena predicted to occur in nanometers-thick semiconductor devices.  The semiconductor devices under study are similar to those used to modulate light in fiber-optic communications, and as ultrafast transistors in cellular telephones.  This project will support the education of two PhD students, as well as undergraduate and high-school interns.  The students will learn the most advanced techniques to generate and manipulate electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, preparing them for leadership in the nation's scientific and technological workforce, and bringing mankind closer to harnessing terahertz radiation for future technologies.  \r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nStrong oscillating electric fields with frequencies between 1 and 5 THz are increasingly available in laboratories and even inside chip-scale devices like terahertz quantum cascade lasers.  A growing body of theory predicts that fascinating and potentially useful phenomena will occur in semiconductor quantum wells driven by strong THz fields.  For example, calculations based on commonly used approximations for many-electron systems predict that chaotic dynamics can occur in doped quantum wells for experimentally-achievable conditions.  The observation of chaotic dynamics in an experiment on a manifestly quantum system would be very surprising, since chaos arises from nonlinearities while quantum mechanics is a linear theory.   This project will support experimental searches for precursors of chaotic dynamics in doped quantum wells.  The intense terahertz radiation necessary for these experiments will be generated by free-electron lasers at UC Santa Barbara and in Dresden, Germany.  This project will also support studies of how strong terahertz radiation changes the quantum states and band structure of semiconductors and semiconductor quantum wells, as measured by terahertz-induced changes in the near-infrared absorption and emission.  Two PhD students will receive deep and broad training in semiconductor physics, nanofabrication, optics at terahertz, near-IR and visible frequencies, mechanical design, cryogenics, electronics, and computer control of laboratory instrumentation, as well as in international collaboration, preparing them for leadership in the nation's science and technology workforce.  The supported PhD students will also mentor a diverse group of undergraduate researchers and high-school student interns, sparking their interest in pursuing careers in science or engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nColliding electrons and holes one trillion times per second to create a near-infrared frequency comb via high-order sideband generation.\n\nColliders that smash elementary particles together have long been the tool of choice for high-energy physicists to discover the building blocks of matter.  In the most famous recent example, the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva was used to collide protons moving at almost the speed of light to discover the Higgs Boson.  In solid matter, energy, charge, and momentum are transported by particle-like entities called \"quasiparticles.\" For example when a photon from the sun is absorbed in a solar cell, it creates a negatively-charged \"electron quasiparticle,\" and a positively-charged \"hole quasiparticle.\"  These quasiparticles have the same charge as an electron and a positron, respectively, but their masses are lighter because of the crystal through which they move.  In the solar cell, these quasiparticles flow to opposite electrodes, creating a photocurrent and electrical power.\n\nResearchers supported by this grant have used intense electric fields oscillating near 0.5 trillion times per second (0.5 Terahertz) to collide electron and hole quasiparticles 1 trillion times per second.  The electron and hole quasiparticles were generated in a semiconductor quantum well (a thin layer of semiconductor) by a relatively weak table-top laser operating at near-infrared frequencies, which show up as red to the naked eye.  The oscillating Terahertz fields were generated using the UC Santa Barbara Free-Electron Lasers.  The electric fields are sufficiently strong and oscillating sufficiently fast that the electron and hole quasiparticles are ripped apart, accelerated away from each other, and then smashed back together before they can be deflected by a defect or a sound wave in the crystal.  When the electron and hole quasiparticles recollide, they are traveling at over 100 times the speed of sound in the host semiconductor.  For a significant fraction of recollisions, the excess kinetic energy associated with this hypersonic motion is emitted as light with a higher frequency than that of the near-infrared laser.  Because the electron and hole quasiparticles are colliding periodically, exactly twice in each cycle of the oscillating electric field, the emission contains only a discrete set of frequencies, or sidebands, offset from the near-ir laser line by 2, 4, 6, 8, . . 18 times the frequency of the oscillating electric field.  The spectrum of emitted light thus looks like a \"comb.\"\n\nAlthough a building-sized Free-Electron Laser was used to create the strong terahertz fields required to discover  the phenomenon of high-order sideband generation, with careful microwave engineering, such fields can be created on the world's fastest electronic chips.  Thus it is possible to translate this basic scientific discovery into a compact electronic device that can be mass-produced at low cost.  As with most new technologies, it is not exactly clear how such a device would be used most effectively--the inventors of the laser certainly never envisioned that lasers would be found eventually in bar-code scanners and DVD players.  However, there are many applications which require the control of light by electronic signals, and vice-versa.  It is possible, for example, that chip-scale electron-hole colliders could reduce the amount of energy required to transmit and receive the vast quantities of data that flow through today's internet.  \n\nScientifically, the discovery of electron-hole recollisions opens up many new avenues for discovery.  Now, condensed matter physicists can coherently accelerate and collide charged quasiparticles, just as high-energy physicists accelerate and collide elementary particles.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Sherwin"
