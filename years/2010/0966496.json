This research seeks to identify the potential adverse effects of nanoparticle exposure on human health and the environment. These concerns are becoming very important issues in using nanotechnology.  The work addresses the challenge of building a common understanding of how nanoparticles affect biological cells.  Several classes of nanomaterials will be tested with a variety of biological cells and models and with specific dose levels and exposure times.    The research will disentangle cytotoxic consequences, those originating solely from nanoparticulate effects and those originating from molecular scale effects.  It will also identify appropriate metrics to represent the nanoparticulate effects.  The research is critical to understanding and using nanotechnology.",

This study focused on a unique mechanism of cytotoxicity, membrane destabilization, which is principally dependent on the nanoparticulate nature of the material rather than on molecular properties. The intellectual merit of this work is that interactions of 2, 5, 10, and 40 nm-diameter gold NPs with supported lipid bilayers (SLB) of L-&alpha;-phosphatidylcholine were investigated via quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), a novel technique that measures frequency (inverse of mass) and dissipation changes on a surface, at odd-numbered overtones that are multiples of the fundamental frequency, which relate to depth across the system.&nbsp; NPs were tested in their citric acid-stabilized state as well as in the presence of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA), representing an organic coating that could become associated with NPs in the environment. &nbsp;In water, all NP sizes tested resulted in small mass losses from the membrane (1-6 ng), as pores were not large enough to cause destabilization, even though NP adsorption induces stress on lipids causing some lipid removal as a free energy lowering mechanism. However, when the NPs were coated with PMAA, the smaller NPs caused a mass increase on the SLB that was attributed to increased adhesion between the NP and the SLB due to PMAA, which in turn caused enough of an increase in nanoparticle adsorption to overcompensate for the loss of lipids. We observed significant mass loss for 40 nm PMAA-coated NPs (60 ng), which we attribute to the SLB engulfing the NP and causing its removal from the crystal surface.&nbsp; A simple model is proposed to suggest that the competition between the particle-bilayer adhesion energy, the SLB bending energy, and the interfacial energy at bilayer defect edges allows the larger and more adhesive NPs to be engulfed by the SLB and leave the crystal surface, causing mass loss. This large mass change can be associated with membrane disruption, suggesting that even if gold NPs are intrinsically not cytotoxic, they can become cytotoxic in the presence of other organic additives through manipulation of their adhesive interactions with the bilayer.
