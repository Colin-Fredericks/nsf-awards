 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for theoretical modeling of approaches to produce coherent X-rays. A coherent light source has the characteristics of a laser, in which the individual photons are \"in phase\", ie, have their wavelengths all aligned in the same way. This means that absorption or scattering processes are identical for every photon, so that the interpretation of the data is greatly simplified. Coherent sources of photons exist at longer wavelengths, but are only now being pioneered at the 0.1 nm scale. That length scale is an important one, since that is the wavelength range that is characteristic of inter-atomic spacings in materials. Availability of 0.1 nm wavelength radiation sources could lead to major simplifications in atomic scale structural studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nX-rays enable scientists to see the internal structure of materials on all length scales, with profound impact on science, technology, and on the world economy, from Nobel Prize winning science to the everyday dental x-ray.  Future advances depend on understanding structure/function relationships at the nano-scale, where new properties emerge, and designing complex materials to achieve transformative physical, chemical, and biological functionality. \n\nIn spite of the huge importance of x-rays, the technology for producing them lags far behind that for producing ordinary visible light.  First, there are no fully coherent sources of hard x-rays.  Second, the brightest incoherent sources of x-rays are available in only a few large ($billion scale) facilities.  And third, all other x-ray work is done with very poor sources based on technology that is over 100 years old.  These low brightness x-ray tube sources are the only available source that a university laboratory, a hospital, or an industrial laboratory can afford to purchase and operate.\n\nThe goal of this project is to perform first explorations of the physics of a new method of generating intense x-ray radiation.  The method relies on accelerating and manipulating arrays of electron beamlets generated by a nanoengineered cathode, converting a spatial density variation into a current modulation with period equal to x-ray wavelength.  The modulated beam then emits coherent x-rays when interacting with an electromagnetic field such as inverse Compton scattering or undulator radiation.  The activities pursued include studying the physics of field emission from nanocathodes, design of the geometry and electrical properties of the nanocathode tips, modeling of the electron transport from the tips to relativistic energy, and emission of coherent x-rays via inverse Compton scattering.  Analytical estimates of the electron beam and x-ray physics were performed, and numerical studies carried out.  An undergraduate student was employed studying the nanocathode geometry and electric properties. \n\nAfter acceleration to relativistic energy in a small accelerator, the array of beamlets is transformed into a longitudinally modulated electron beam by an emittance-exchange beamline (EEX).  The EEX has the ability to exchange one phase space plane (e.g. transverse size and momentum) with another (e.g. time-energy).  The combination of the nanocathode array emission and EEX line results in an electron beam with current modulation at x-ray wavelength scale.  By colliding the modulated electrons with an intense laser, x-rays are produced by inverse Compton scattering (ICS).  In ICS sources, the size is reduced over a factor of 100 from large synchrotron facilities by virtue of the use of a \"laser undulator\" whose period is effectively about 0.5 microns, compared to the centimeter period of conventional magnetic undulators.  Because the modulation matches the resonance condition of the ICS radiation, the electrons emit x-rays in phase, enhancing the radiation power by up to a factor of the number of electrons per bunch, typically ten million, over the normally incoherent process of ICS.  The output flux and brilliance would rival modern synchrotrons, bringing the most advanced scientific and medical x-ray probe into the university, industrial, and medical laboratory.\n\nThe most significant broader impact for this device would be in the field of medical imaging.  The studied technique is ideal for producing high resolution phase-contrast images of biological tissue because the x-rays are nearly monoenergetic, are produced in a relatively large cone angle, and are continuously tunable in energy.  This would result in much higher resolution x-rays of soft tissues at much lower dose to the patient.  Other applications are in protein crystallography that enables pharmaceutical companies to speed up drug discovery, and in semiconductor fabrication where the powerful beam of short wavelength radiation i..."
