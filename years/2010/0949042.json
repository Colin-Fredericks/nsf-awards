 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid growth of urban concentrations poses major challenges to local and global ecosystems and tests the very limits of governance.  New urban growth can reduce and fragment nonhuman habitats, introduce exotic organisms, and severely modify energy flow and nutrient cycles, while urban development severely affects hydrological cycles and air quality, reducing the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance.  These challenges will require that planners, program designers, and environmental managers keep pace with the concomitant spatial, political, and economic transformations while reducing the adverse ecological impact of urban developments.  In the face of these challenges, new forms of complex social, political and economic decision making systems are evolving.  This interdisciplinary research project is designed to improve understanding of resilience in urban socioecological systems, with the over-arching question: How do human governance and biophysical systems respond interactively to both press and pulse disturbances in urban socio-ecological systems?  The investigators will focus on Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, two cities in a single metropolitan area that have developed over the last 30 years under contrasting policy regimes at the state, regional, and local levels.  The investigators will pursue three major research questions:  (1) How do differences in local and state levels of governance and policy affect the resilience of both social and ecological landscapes?  (2) How do alternative land-use planning strategies affect provision of ecosystem services in response to different disturbance factors?  (3) How effectively do the processes and outcomes of monitoring ecosystem services provide a usable feedback loop in urban socioecological systems?  Their research design will consist of four focused research projects and two project-wide unifying activities.  The first research project will examine governance effects on the spatial pattern and timing of development at the regional scale.  The second project will examine relationships among disturbances resulting from development and urban water quality.  The third project will focus on riparian vegetation changes, and the fourth project will focus on green infrastructure, with both examining the exchange and use of information and interactions among social actors at the city and neighborhood scales.  The two cross-cutting activities will complement the research projects by focusing on how urban residents perceive and manage urban ecosystem resources.  The first activity will examine civic ecology and information for decision making.  The investigators will apply a common framework to all four research projects to study how ecological information feeds back into societal decision making.  The second activity will engage secondary school teachers and their students in the Portland-Vancouver region in urban environmental restoration and research projects.  The project will create and support networks of teachers, youth, and organizations conducting ecological research and will develop and test meaningful measures of how teacher and youth involvement in ecological projects contributes to urban resilience.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project includes micro-level and meso-level foci on the connections among human perceptions, citizen engagement, and ecosystem services in developing urban resilience, which should lead to insights about how human systems adapt to disturbance.  The study area, a metropolitan region containing cities with contrasting governance systems and starkly different land-use policies, is well suited for analysis and comparison of complex interactions between social and ecological systems.  Portland's \"sustainability mystique\" will be scrutinized and assessed both socioeconomically and ecologically.  Inclusion of external forces of population growth and climate change while simultaneously examining internal community adaptations will help identify unanticipated feedback loops or failures.  The broader impacts of this project will include creation of a network of learners in urban areas that cross jurisdictional, disciplinary, institutional, and geographic boundaries.  Research findings will be put in place experimentally and institutionally by cities and metropolitan agencies interested in building on the synergies found in integrative approaches to management.  These results should help break down past divisions between socioeconomic and ecological thinking and help improve understanding and application of factors controlling how human governance affects socioecological resilience in urban areas.  This award was funded as an Urban Long-Term Research Area Exploratory (ULTRA-Ex) award as the result of a special competition jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe over-riding question we set out to answer in the Portland-Vancouver Ultra-Ex Project was \"Does Governance Matter to Urban Ecology?\"  By that we meant: do the ways different municipalities organize and make decisions influence the health and vibrancy of the biophysical environment they share? \n\nPortland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, are part of the same metropolitan area and biophysical system in the lower Columbia River Basin.  This region of more than 2 million people actually spans two different states, seven different counties and multiple cities/towns, and thus multiple governance systems responsible for managing public resources such as water availability, stormwater systems, greenspaces, educational systems, etc.  The fact that these diverse governance systems exist in one large biophysical region presented a unique opportunity to test a range of hypotheses about feedbacks between different governance systems and outcomes for the environment.\n\nWe built a team of natural scientists, political scientists, economists, urban planners and natural resource managers from six major universities, colleges and government agencies, and established multiple working groups to address the overarching question of whether governance matters in the Portland-Vancouver region.  At Washington State University Vancouver, our major involvement was the study of how governance influences water quality in Portland and Vancouver, and how differences in the public educational systems between these cities may influence the overall ecological knowledge and sense of environmental stewardship of K-12 teachers and students.\n\nBy studying the changes in water quality in Vancouver and Portland from the 1970\u00c6s to the present, along with an analysis of the major policy decisions in these two cities over that time period, we found that even though the political climates and trajectories of water policies and regulations were significantly different between the two cities, the overall water quality in both locations was very similar.  We did note that Vancouver has changed much more rapidly over the past 20 years, from predominantly suburban and rural in the 1970\u00c6s to much more densely populated and commercially developed in the present, while Portland experienced most of its urban development mid-century.  The \"green\" ethic that Portland is widely known for has only been a strong influence in the past 2-3 decades, thus even though the city has implemented many innovative approaches to increase sustainability and improved environmental management, there is still a legacy of past environmental degradation that needs to be overcome.\n\nWith regard to differences in educational systems, we observed a similar pattern as noted above.  The schools we studied in Portland and Vancouver take a diverse set of paths to teach students about their local environment, however the differences in teachers\u00c6 and students\u00c6 understanding of and appreciation for their \"place\" related more to the teachers\u00c6 own experience with environmental science than any differences between schools, districts or states. \n\nIn summary, we found that governance does matter, but that the outcomes of policy decisions are very time-dependent, and that having a long-term program to observe these outcomes would be a valuable asset to this community and nation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens"
