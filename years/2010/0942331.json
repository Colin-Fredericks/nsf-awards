This is being done by developing a new classroom pedagogy, called diversity harnessing, in which the direct interests of the student population are folded back into course materials through lecture topics, homework exercises and exam problems.  Diversity harnessing is making extensive use of active and collaborating learning.  The course, ECE 101: Exploring Digital Information Technology, is an engineering course for non-engineering majors that strives to prepare students for a meaningful role in an increasingly technological society.  The goals of this project are to 1) better engage the students in the course topics, 2) quickly integrate diverse student-driven subject matter back into the course, and 3) empower the students to more effectively apply new skills to their lives and careers.  The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an independent evaluator.",
