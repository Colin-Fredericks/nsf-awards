 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on development of evidence-based, computer assisted instruction (CAI) to provide training in life skills that are the underpinnings for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) proficiencies. The outcomes of this research will provide functional STEM skill training in a manner that is more cost-effective, provides more consistent treatment delivery, requires less staff training, and is more accessible to children with special needs. Accessibility to curriculum through CAI allows for better prompting, shaping, reinforcement, data collection and reporting, and individualization of treatment. In addition, CAI has been proven to be more effective than traditional teaching in many situations, and to be extremely motivating for many students.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this product will be a breakthrough in the way schools provide functional life skills teaching to 3 million students with cognitive impairments in grades Pre-K to 12. These skills are the underpinnings of STEM - science, technology, engineering and mathematics that are a greatly under-served yet mandated curriculum area for schools. Current approaches often rely on certified school staff or contract specialists individually to deliver interventions and manually record results. The project if successful will impact evidence-based, standards-based, and computer-assisted intervention so as to improve consistency, quantity, and quality services per dollar spent. The product will motivate students with personalized interactive lessons and game-quality rewards, and will support school districts, teachers, and therapists with automated progress tracking and comprehensive teacher and administrator reports. Additionally, the product will be portable thus enabling home and school use, with on-line shared notes and progress reporting to improve school-home communication.",
