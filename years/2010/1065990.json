 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a mechanistic understanding of marine transmission of the protozoal parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The team will investigate the role of marine aggregates in the transport of T. gondii and other zoonotic pathogens. An oceanography-based transport model will be coupled to epidemiological data to evaluate if T. gondii infection in sea otters can be predicted by the distribution of aggregate-associated and unattached T. gondii oocysts from terrestrial versus marine sources. The scientists will also investigate whether sea lions are definitive hosts capable of releasing infectious oocysts (current literature indicates that only felines can serve as definitive hosts).\r\n\r\nThe project will represent a significant advance towards understanding an important parasite, which infects both terrestrial and marine animals. The research will also improve our comprehension of the role marine aggregates play on disease transmission and explore if sea lions are definitive hosts for T. gondii. The team has extensive experience in the area and this research will build upon their previous findings on the transport of T. gondii from land to sea.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are very strong. The PI has strong record of student training and educational outreach. Three undergraduates, three graduate students and three post-doctoral researchers will be trained and mentored during the conduct of this important project. The study will provide outreach to K-8 students, water resources managers and ocean enthusiasts via public websites, benefiting sea otter recovery and management policies. The scientists will contribute to exhibitions at the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.",

Epidemiological field investigations coupled with laboratory transport experiments showed that the distribution of oocysts in marine habitats is a function of oocyst loading from domestic and wild felids via freshwater run-off (Photo 4: Coastal freshwater run-off) and oocyst transport dynamics that are governed by association with aggregates (marine snow) and sticky polymers.
