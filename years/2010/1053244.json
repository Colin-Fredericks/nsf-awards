 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry, Dorothy Zolandz at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will engage a cross section of the chemistry community, informal science education community, and learning assessment community in a workshop to provide guidance in the planning and design of activities to celebrate the International Year of Chemistry 2011 (IYC 2011) in the US. The workshop will take place in Washington, DC, in late August or early September, 2010.  At the workshop, approximately a dozen experts will provide guidance and input into an appropriate US celebration of the IYC.  Participant expertise will include education, chemistry research, assessment, and communications. Input from representatives from societies that have participated in previous International Years will also be sought. \r\n\r\nIYC 2011 is a worldwide celebration supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). NAS (in cooperation with the American Chemical Society) is seeking ways to increase public awareness of the benefits of chemistry and to excite young people about chemistry by establishing a strong and diverse portfolio of activities related to the United States? celebration of IYC 2011.  The ultimate goal is effective public communication of science through outreach, evaluation of that outreach, and dissemination of lessons learned about outreach effectiveness as a result of IYC activities. The workshop will bring focus and appropriate assessment to IYC planning efforts, and will help identify means of engaging underrepresented groups in the IYC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award enabled the National Academy of Sciences to convene leaders in the chemistry community to identify highest priorities and most effective practices for activities to celebrate the International Year of Chemistry in the United States.\n\n2011 was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization as the International Year of Chemistry (IYC).  Groups of scientists and educators in nations around the globe planned events, activities, and outreach designed to increase the public appreciation of chemistry in meeting world needs, to encourage interest in chemistry among young people, and to generate enthusiasm for the creative future of chemistry.\n\nIn the US, many organizations were interested in playing a role in IYC celebrations.  Coordination was needed among these organizations to assure that programming was well targeted and made efficient use of available resources.  The workshop funded by this award gathered representatives from a cross section of the chemistry community, informal science education community, and learning assessment community to provide guidance in the planning and design of activities to celebrate the International Year of Chemistry.  The workshop included scientists and educators involved in previous International Year celebrations, such as the International Year of Astronomy, to share their experiences and to provide input on most effective outreach activities.  As a result of this workshop, the American Chemical Society, the largest professional association of chemists in the world, was able to design and fund more than a million dollars worth of programming and outreach for the IYC in coordination with partnering organizations.\n\nInformation about all US activities to celebrate the IYC, including the American Chemical Society efforts, can be found at http://www.iyc2011-us.org/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dorothy Zolandz"
