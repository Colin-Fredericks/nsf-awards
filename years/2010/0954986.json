 "awd_abstract_narration": "0954986\r\nPrather\r\nThe proposed work will result in the development of experimental tools to control glucose flux. The Glucose Valve will explore a new paradigm for biochemical production that allows the decoupling of biomass growth and metabolite production in the same way that inducible promoters have done for recombinant protein production. The Valves are intended to facilitate the metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways for the production of a variety of organic compounds in microbial chemical factories.  The proposal incorporates both fundamental research and educational initiatives. Mathematical models to describe and predict the behavior of the Glucose Valves will also be developed, which should facilitate the extension of this experimental device to other metabolites and organisms. Undergraduate students will be educated in both the classroom and the laboratory, with course materials being made available through the OpenCourseWare portal at MIT. Additionally, a proposed \"What-I-Do\" Initiative seeks to introduce school age children to science- and engineering-intensive careers through a series of interviews of professionals working in representative STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: This research project was centered on the development of experimental tools to control the flow of metabolites for engineered biosynthetic pathways.  It was motivated by the limitations of traditional metabolic engineering, in which competing reactions are often completely eliminated to avoid losing metabolites to unwanted by-products.  However, when the competing reactions are essential for growth, this traditional approach is no longer an option.  We thus decided to create \"metabolic valves\" in order to divert substrates from biomass synthesis towards product formation in a controlled manner.  The designed system is analogous to the use of inducible promoters to decouple growth and product formation for recombinant protein synthesis.  The goal was to produce an operational mode in which a \"biomass-generating\" phase is initially favored to boost the biocatalytic potential, but then is subsequently down-regulated in favor of a \"product-generating\" phase.  We first demonstrated this concept with a focus on glucose consumption.  E. coli cells were engineered to alter glucose uptake so that the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate could be used as a control point to construct the valve.  Our results showed that product yields could be increased between 20% and 100%, with high titers achieved of a model compound.  We also explored multiple methods to implement the valve and uncovered important limitations for growth-coupled enzymes.  We next extended this system to a strain in which the native glucose transport system was intact (i.e., coupled to glucose-6-phosphate formation) in order to boost the yield of both an intermediate and the final product in a previously constructed glucaric acid pathway.  A new architecture was employed for these valves, resulting in increases in both product titer and yield of up to 5-fold over the wild-type baseline strain.  This work made significant contributions to the area of \"dynamic metabolic engineering,\"  illustrating core principles and applications of this exciting new approach.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts:  This project partially supported two graduate students, both of whom have completed their doctoral degrees and are now employed in tenure-track faculty positions.  A total of 7 undergraduates also participated in this research project, including students from both within MIT and those external through the MIT Summer Research Program.  Three of these students were underrepresented minorities, and four were women.  As PI, I participated in a workshop for graduate women and post-docs entitled \"Path to Professorship,\" sponsored by MIT\u00c6s Office of the Dean for Graduate Education during each year of this grant.  This workshop is designed to help women understand the process for securing and succeeding in academic positions.  In Year 4, I participated in two events for post-doctoral researchers sponsored by the Chemical Engineering department.  I also served as the faculty advisor to a course offered to high school students on Synthetic Biology through the SEED Academy of the MIT School of Engineering.  I serve on the Advisory Board of the Office of Engineering Outreach Programs (OEOP) which operates both the SEED Academy and the middle-school focused STEM program.   In Year 5, I participated in a completely new outreach activity.  I served as one of three coaches for a FIRST Lego League robotics team.  The team was composed of 14 5th grade girls at Milton Academy, a private K-12 school in the greater Boston area.  Our goal as coaches was to instill confidence and excitement in the girls around STEM education.  During this outreach activity, only two girls were on the middle school robotics team (grades 6-8), one of whom spoke to our team.  This past year, when our team members were now new 6th graders, more than a dozen girls participated in robotics &ndash; far outnumbering the boys!  The principal of the school is currently seeking ways to formalize a 5th grade girls\u00c6 r..."
