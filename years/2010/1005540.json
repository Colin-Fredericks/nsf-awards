 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks.  Research under this grant draws from two QIS questions:  What is the role of quantum entanglement in quantum information processing?  What is the best way to deploy quantum systems, perhaps entangled, to make measurements of classical parameters?  These two questions expand to four specific research projects, which are the focus of work under this grant: (i) super-Heisenberg sensitivity scaling, phase coherence, and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates; (ii) mixed-state quantum computation and measures of nonclassical correlations; (iii) Clifford circuits, stabilizer states, and local-hidden-variable models; and (iv) fundamental limits to high-precision measurements.   These four research projects will be carried out within the environment of the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), a PIF-sponsored center based in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico, with an experimental component at the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona.\r\n\r\nStudents supported by this proposal will work within the CQuIC framework, with its proven track record of training PhD students and involving undergraduates in research.  CQuIC students are exposed to the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks.  CQuIC organizes a visitors program that brings in distinguished scientists for short- and long-term visits, thereby exposing students to additional perspectives and expertise, and provides the opportunity for research exchanges and collaborations with four external partners.  CQuIC is also the administrative home for the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology Network (SQuInT), which is a major community-building activitity in QIS, involving about fifteen institutions based mainly in the US Southwest.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks.  The role of quantum physics from its invention till quite recently was to explain the observed properties and natural behavior of the physical constituents that make up the world around us.  The philosophy of QIS is quite different: QIS asks how to make quantum systems do what we want, thereby performing useful tasks for us, instead of just doing what comes naturally. \n\nWork under this award draws from two QIS questions:  What is the role of quantum entanglement, the counter-intuitive correlations between separate quantum systems, in quantum information processing?  What is the best way to deploy quantum systems, perhaps entangled, to make measurements of classical parameters?\n\nOne of the most important questions in quantum information theory is which of the odd aspects of quantum mechanics enables the information-processing power of quantum systems. With this question in mind, we investigated and categorized various ways of quantifying the properties of correlations between quantum systems.\n\nThis award saw the first derivation of the fundamental quantum-mechanical limitation on estimating a time-dependent signal (waveform).  This fundamental quantum limit has immediate implications for detection of forces that act on linear systems, as in an interferometric gravitational-wave detector or in the new generation of miniaturized opto-mechanical force sensors.  We showed that the fundamental force-estimation limit can be attained by a new force-detection strategy called quantum noise cancellation, and we unified the various techniques for high-precision force detection under the umbrella of what we called a quantum-mechanics-free subsystem.\n\nAmplification is a key physical process in many aspects of daily life, ranging from communications technology to computation, and it lies at the heart of high-precision measurements of physical quantities.  We investigated the quantum-mechanical limits on the noise added to a signal by a phase-preserving linear amplifier.  This work generalizes the hallowed quantum limits on the noise temperature of linear amplifiers, known now for over thirty years, to limits on the entire distribution of added noise, and it suggests a new, more complete way to characterize the performance of amplifiers that are nearly quantum-limited.\n\nIn the last several years, much attention has been focused on nondeterministic linear amplifiers, which work only part of the time, but when they do work, have less added noise than a standard amplifier.  We studied the performance of probabilistic linear amplifiers and showed conclusively that the chance that the amplifier works decreases so rapidly with the gain that such devices are essentially useless as amplifiers.  This work significantly changed the research community\u00c6s perspective on probabilistic amplifiers, making it clear that the very low working probabilities of the devices implemented in experiment are not a consequence of technical imperfections in the experiments, but rather are an unavoidable feature of such devices.\n\nResearch under this award was carried out within the environment of the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), an NSF-PIF-sponsored center based in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico, with an experimental component at the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona.  This award both benefited from and contributed to the exciting research environment within CQuIC.\n\nCQuIC is the administrative home for the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) network, a consortium of research groups at 23 institutions, located mainly in the US Southwest.
