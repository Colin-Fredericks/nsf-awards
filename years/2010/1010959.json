 "awd_abstract_narration": "LOOP is the working title for a multiplatform project to promote environmental and scientific literacy about sustainability for children ages 6-9 and their families.  Unlike most educational materials for this age group, the LOOP approach requires the audience to learn about the interconnectedness of environmental and human systems in a cross-disciplinary manner.  Produced by WGBH, the center piece of the project will be a television series designed for PBS with accompanying digital media on the web and an extensive \"Get to Know Your World\" outreach initiative.  The U.S. Forest Service is one of the project's partners.\r\n\r\nAt this development stage, the project will: \r\n-\tConduct front-end research to obtain a baseline understanding about what kids know about environmental sustainability.\r\n-\tFurther develop and test LOOP's proposed creative style. \r\n-\tProduce an animatic (a simple mock-up) of a full episode and accompanying live-action video, with input from Content Directors.\r\n-\tPerform formative evaluation to assess the learning impact of the animatic and live-action video to inform series production.\r\nConcord Evaluation Group will conduct the front-end research to assess children's knowledge of environmental sustainability and formative evaluation of the animatic pilot.  Global Mechanic is the animation producer.  \r\n\r\nThe project has the potential to (1) inform the field on how to enhance young children's understanding of complex ecological concepts; and (2) \"push the envelope\" by exploring how mass media can support local environmental investigation and promote outdoor family explorations. Introducing children to systems thinking, especially around environmental subjects, could make a significant contribution to their understanding of and approach to STEM.",

To evaluate LOOP\u00c6s impact on kids\u00c6 science learning and to assess its appeal, CEG conducted a summative evaluation of the animatic and live-action video with the target audience. CEG found that kids who viewed the LOOP pilot episode demonstrated significantly better knowledge about specific science concepts than kids who did not. Kids who had watched the animatic were significantly more likely to report that there was water in the desert than kids who had not watched the pilot (75% vs. 34%); were able to describe what an \"oasis\" was (53% vs, 23%); and understand that water can be found undergro..."
