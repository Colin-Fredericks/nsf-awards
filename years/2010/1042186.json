The invited pool of experts will address energy conservation of indoor environments in a unique way - exploiting the recent advances in the behavior of plant and skin tissues on the one hand and stabilized earth construction and sensors on the other.\r\n\r\nThis workshop contributes to sustainable practices of engineering construction by developing a formal basis for using natural materials (earth-based and plant-based) in engineering construction.  It also directly addresses the issue of energy, which remains one of the key socio-economic and political challenges of our times, by attempting to understand energy-efficiency in the naturally-evolved biological systems and adopt that knowledge in engineering.\r\n\r\nThis workshop fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading international (US, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, India, Colombia and Venezuela) experts to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest.",
