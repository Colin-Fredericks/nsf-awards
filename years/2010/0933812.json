 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life sciences and bioengineering students encounter challenging learning, practice, and research environments.  Rapid developments in science and technology make change a constant factor in those environments.  In this changing landscape, graduates entering careers in industry, the professions, or academia are likely to face ethical issues and challenges.  This project is preparing students to recognize and address ethical issues in these careers and environments.  It is building on the VaNTH Engineering Research Center?s research education program by employing a \"How People Learn\" (HPL) approach to develop didactic materials.  The primary strategy being employed is the creation of case-based educational modules and related materials in life science ethics for use by graduate students. Materials are being developed largely for an interdisciplinary audience in bioengineering.  The modules emphasize themes that are aligned to critical components of an effective ethical framework for the responsible conduct of research (RCR) as defined by HHS Office of Research Integrity (ORI).  The project will assess the effects of these modules on students? knowledge of ethical standards and regulations, skills in ethical decision making, and ability to integrate ethical standards and principles in practice.  After they are proven effective, modules will be disseminated for testing and use with the help of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and the Alliance for Engineering and Medicine and Biology (AEMB) student chapters to universities and professionals through a dedicated section of the Biomedical Engineering Society?s website, academic networks, and professional meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\n\nThis report is a summary of the outcomes of the NSF project D-0933812, \"HPL-Based Ethics Education for Life Science and Bioengineering Students\".  \n\n \n\n\nWe had three aims in the project:  (1) develop challenge-based learning modules on key ethical issues in bioengineering and life sciences; (2) evaluate these modules by testing them at a variety of institutions; and (3) disseminate the modules and related didactic material in a variety of ways.\n\n \n\n\nWe have developed a variety of case-study modules, some along the guidelines of key issues in the NSF publication Responsible Conduct of Research, (2nd Ed.), Shamoo and Resnick, Oxford University Press, 2009.  We have attached a list of a total of eighteen case studies and copies of four of those case studies to our final report.  \n\n \n\n\nThe institution to which our award was granted, Alabama A &amp; M University (AAMU), is a historically black college/university (HBCU).  Some of our most meaningful studies, cases, and outcomes were related to that heritage.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIn 2011, five AAMU students prepared and presented a study of dilemmas facing food adequacy, distribution and preservation in the famine-, drought-, and war-ravaged Horn of Africa to a session of the national conference of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)\n\n\nIn 2012, a special session on African-American health care disparities was presented at the national BMES meeting in Atlanta.  Panel members, all African Americans, included:  (1) famed civil rights leader Atty. Fred Gray, counsel for Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and survivors of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study; (2) then-BMES president Dr. Gilda Barabino, expert on sickle-cell research;  and (3) then-American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) president Dr. Raphael Lee, expert in plastic surgery and reconstructive tissue engineering.  This session, the first of its kind in 2012, was widely attended and has become an annual featured plenary session at BMES.\n\n\nWe have escorted more than fifteen students, most of them African Americans, to national professional meetings, and asked them to attend special sessions on ethics.\n\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the national honorary fraternity of biomedical engineering, Alpha Eta Mu Beta (AEMB), initiated a session on ethics at their national meeting.  Several years later, the format of this session evolved into a plenary lecture on a particular topic accompanied by a participatory case study on that topic.  The 2015 topic was Ethics of Genomic Testing; a report on this case study was attached to the Final Report of this project.\n\n\nWe continue to be in discussion with publishers and professional society partners about the best means of presenting a collection of our case studies in printed and/or electronic format.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEthics is an ancient pursuit in both theory and practice.  Aristotle described ethical behavior as doing the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way.  Hippocrates began his description of ethical conduct for the physician as \"First, do no harm.\"  Philosophers such as Kant and Hume have developed theories of ethical behavior.  Jeremy Bentham, proponent of utilitarianism, expressed the need to do \"the greatest good for the greatest number\".  The Belmont Report, developed in response to egregious practices involving human subject of the past, presents three core principles:  respect for persons, justice, and beneficence.  Later, a fourth principle of nonmaleficence (do no harm) has been espoused.   \n\n \n\n\nIt is our hope that the studies presented in this project and the lessons learned from past examples will help the student thrown into the white-hot crucible of her/his ethical dilemma to \"do the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way\".\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerry Collins"
