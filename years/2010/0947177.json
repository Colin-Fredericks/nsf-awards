 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immunity to parasites has historically been understudied in evolutionary ecology. In recent years efforts to understand the causes and consequences of natural variation in immune function in wild animals, termed ecological immunology, has transformed multiple realms of biology.  To foster continued productivity and expansion of this new field, theoretical refinement and methodological consistency will be critical. This grant will help bring together 36 internationally recognized ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and immunologists to i) develop new techniques and concepts, ii) enhance breadth and depth of research questions, iii) establish new interdisciplinary collaborations, and iv) stimulate outreach and training opportunities for schoolteachers and the public (through a routinely updated website). This network will be open to all scientists.  The current network membership is highly diverse, with 50% female members and many individuals who identify themselves as belonging to minorities.  Such a diverse group, in conjunction with meetings held outside the USA (2 out of 5 over a five year period), will foster a sense of international community and expose early-career participants to a multitude of scientific and social cultures. Also, the direct engagement of high school teachers in this program will augment the inclusion of evolutionary thinking in American elementary, middle and high school classrooms. In sum, the network will provide novel perspective to evolutionary biology and immunology, both of which should be insightful for human health.  Pedagogically, this network will provide training for students from underrepresented backgrounds and expose high school teachers, their students, and the interested public to a field of truly integrative, modern science.",
