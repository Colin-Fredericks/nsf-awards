The focus is transient and short-duration voltage instability which will become more prevalent in future distribution systems with high penetration of renewable generation. The approach is to first identify possible forms of voltage instability by experiments on a virtual and a hardware-in-the-loop system test-bed. Typical instability behaviors will be characterized by proper system models to determine their origins and most effective mitigation methods. Distributed voltage control techniques are then developed for representative renewable sources and energy storage devices which function autonomously but collectively support system stability. The developed control techniques will be tested and demonstrated on the hardware-in-the-loop system test-bed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis research explores an interdisciplinary area among power systems, power electronics, and control, and addresses several fundamental modeling and control issues related to renewable energy grid integration, efficient energy utilization, and smart grids. The focus on analytical methods and tools combined with experimental work on system test-beds ensures general applicability of the research while providing practical solutions to real-world problems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe control techniques to be developed in this project will help transform today's largely passive, unidirectional, and protection-centric power distribution network into a smart grid capable of accommodating any amount of renewable energy anywhere and at any time. This will reduce the reliance on fossil fuel, improve national energy security, and enable a more sustainable economy. Close partnership with the industry provides a unique pathway for technology transfer and knowledge dissemination.",
