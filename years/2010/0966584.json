 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breath of Life (BOL) is a two-week workshop with 70 participants (40 Native American researchers and 30 mentors, lecturers and organizers) to take place in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 2011. The purpose of the workshop is to breathe life into endangered languages of the Americas by connecting members of heritage communities with primary source material that documents their languages. BOL has been very successful in the context of indigenous California languages and this model is now being brought to a national level. Central to the workshop is collaboration between researchers (Native American heritage language learners) and mentors (experts in linguistics who guide the researchers' work), supplemented by lectures and workshops on linguistics and related topics. The workshop will be co-hosted by the Smithsonian Institution's National Anthropological Archives and National Museum for the American Indian, and the Library of Congress. The workshop will be the inaugural one in a biennial series that will be hosted at various archives throughout the country.\r\n\r\nBreath of Life benefits three groups: endangered language communities, linguists who study and document endangered languages, and archives that preserve and provide access to documentation. Endangered language communities benefit from the expertise that researchers gain. Based on previous BOL experiences in California, Breath of Life stimulates language learning, teaching and research within heritage communities, sometimes resulting in long-term collaborative research. Linguists benefit by forging new or stronger relationships with endangered language communities, and by learning how documentation can be used effectively within heritage communities. Some linguists find that their approach to documentation and dissemination of data changes significantly after collaborating with endangered language communities. Archives benefit from the relationships developed during Breath of Life and from the associated publicity. Activities that highlight endangered language archives affirm their importance within their institutions and to the general public.",
