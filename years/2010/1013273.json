 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a workshop to be held May 31 thru June 3, 2010 in Jeju, Korea for leading US and Asian-Pacific science and engineering researchers to assess the current research status in the area of smart sensing and actuatiion, to identify future research topics and collaboration opportunities, and to provide input to US and Korean funding agencies on future research directions and effective funding mechanisms. The emergent research field of smart sensing and actuation has attracted significant attention in recent years.  A delegation of 12 researchers from the US, representing a wide range of expertise from engineering to biology will participate in this important workshop.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this workshop has the potential to produce future structures that are capable of self-sensing and monitoring, self-diagnosis and prognosis with intelligence, self-healing and repair, and adaptive response to prevent catastrophe, minimize maintenance, and prolong service life. A report that identifies the most promising plans of actions to advance in this area will be produced. Successful completion of this workshop will facilitate broader international collaboration, technology transfer of research data in smart sensing and actuation, especially in topics of multi-scale mechanics and multi-functional materials.",
