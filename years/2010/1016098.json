Davis, Pedro Ontaneda\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to provide funding for the conference\r\nGeometry, Topology and Dynamics in Negative Curvature to be held\r\nin Bangalore, India, during the week of August 2-7, 2010. The\r\nconference is an official satellite conference to the 2010\r\nInternational Conference of Mathematicians (held in Hyderabad,\r\nIndia). The goal of this conference is to bring together\r\nmathematicians working on different aspects of negatively curved\r\nspaces. It will bring together three distinct communities of\r\nmathematicians: geometers, topologists, and dynamicists. It will\r\nprovide a forum for sharing the most recent developments in the\r\nstudy of spaces of negative (and more generally, non-positive)\r\ncurvature. A selection of topics that will be touched upon in the\r\nconference include: (1) Gromov hyperbolic groups, CAT(0)-groups,\r\nand geometric group theory, (2) spaces of metrics (Teichmuller\r\nspace, moduli space, representation varieties), (3) links with\r\n3-dimensional topology (Geometrization conjecture, mapping class\r\ngroups), (4) links with high-dimensional topology (Novikov\r\nconjecture, Borel conjecture), (5) analysis on boundaries of\r\ngroups and spaces, (6) Anosov flows and dynamics, (7) flows on\r\nhomogeneous spaces and applications to number theory. We expect\r\nthe conference to provide a \"snapshot\" of the current state of\r\nour knowledge in matters related to nonpositively curved spaces,\r\nas well as to provide a roadmap for future research in this\r\ninterdisciplinary field.\r\n\r\nCurvature is a fundamental notion in geometry. Zero curvature is\r\nthe most physically familiar, and corresponds to an ordinary flat\r\nsurface. Positive and negative curvature can be described\r\nrelative to the familiar zero curvature setting as follows: one\r\ntries to \"flatten\" the surface near a point, and looks to see if\r\nthere is too little or too much fabric to achieve the\r\nflattening. For instance, the surface of a cone or of a cylinder\r\ncan be unfolded to lie flat, so these also have zero curvature.\r\nBut if one tries to flatten the surface of a sphere (think of the\r\nskin of an orange), there is not enough fabric to do this\r\n(i.e. the skin of the orange splits), which corresponds to\r\npositive curvature. Alternatively, if one tries to flatten a\r\nsaddle shaped surface, folds appear. There is too much fabric,\r\nwhich corresponds to negative curvature. A space of nonpositive\r\ncurvature can now be described as one having the property that,\r\nnear every point and for every pair of directions, it looks\r\neither flat or like a saddle shaped surface. Surprisingly, such\r\nspaces are much more prevalent than one would initially\r\nguess. Aside from the field of geometry, they naturally appear in\r\nnumerous other fields of mathematics: topology, dynamics, number\r\ntheory, representation theory, etc. Aspects of nonpositive\r\ncurvature have also made an increasing appearance in more applied\r\nfields, wherever there has been an interest in understanding the\r\n\"shape\" of objects (special relativity theory, crystalline\r\nstructures in organic chemistry, configuration spaces in\r\nrobotics, etc). This conference will bring together international\r\nexperts working on various aspects of nonpositively curved\r\nspaces.  The conference web site is http://www.icts.res.in/program/gtdnc.",
