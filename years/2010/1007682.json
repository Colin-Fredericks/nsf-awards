 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research concerns the development of Bayesian regression models that are carefully designed to include specific forms of knowledge common to many data analytic settings.  Researchers who work in specialized fields accumulate quantifiable, problem-specific expert knowledge about model features based on their repeated experience designing experiments and analyzing the resulting data.  The ability to build models that respect such knowledge is a critical component to good data analysis.  In the Bayesian modeling paradigm, such knowledge is incorporated in the analysis through prior distributions on model parameters.  Unfortunately, many standard prior models compete against this knowledge, assigning significant prior probability to events that researchers know are implausible, if not impossible.  A major focus of the research is the identification of the types of information that are available to researchers for specific classes of models and the development of new prior distributions whose structures are driven by this knowledge.  The project considers data-analytic settings ranging from linear regression models to models arising from conjoint choice experiments.  Particular forms of prior knowledge range from information about the coefficient of determination in a linear regression model to more complex information about collinearity and grouped predictor variables. The research places emphasis on understanding how such prior information affects the comparison of competing models, and how properties of the new prior distributions affect the questions of Bayesian model comparison and variable selection.  The research in new classes of prior distributions for regression problems includes investigations of new and emerging ideas about parameter regularization.  Generalizations of new Bayesian regularization priors will be developed that allow empirical knowledge about correlation structures in the predictor variables to be incorporated in the regression models.  Such priors will be useful in high-dimensional problems, where extensive information is not always readily available and where regularization is known to help stabilize inference.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the research comes from the social sciences, in particular Psychology and Marketing.  A key question in Psychology is how the brain perceives, reacts to, and processes stimuli.  Extensive experimentation in this field has led to the development of a large base of knowledge about how manipulation of particular stimuli affects the brain.  Analysis of these experiments provides insight into how the brain works.  A common experiment in Marketing involves assessing the attractiveness of product offerings to different groups of consumers.  These assessments are then used to design products that will be successful in the marketplace.  In order to provide new insights into these processes in Psychology and Marketing, researchers require methods of data analysis that are tailored to incorporate knowledge about these processes that has been accumulated by researchers.  The statistical methodology developed in this research will provide investigators with sophisticated data-analytic tools that will allow them to perform focused data analysis, leading to a more accurate understanding of individual and consumer behavior.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research supported by this project concerned the development of Bayesian regression models that were carefully designed to respect specific forms of knowledge common to many data-analytics settings.  Past research and accumulated experience with the practice of regression modeling have demonstrated that combining expert knowledge with observed data in a statistical model leads to better descriptions of reality and more reliable forecasts than do approaches that ignore such information.  At best, statistical models should integrate all knowledge about a problem in a coherent manner; at worst, models should not obviously contradict reasonable prior knowledge or have properties that are odds with the goals of the analysis.  The research scrutinized existing statistical methodology from this perspective and yielded both theoretical and methodological developments that have expanded and improved available approaches to regression modeling.\n\nThe new statistical theory and methods developed as part of the research constitute the core of the intellectual merit of the work.  From a theoretical perspective, the research has shown that, under typical conditions faced by data analysts (in particular in the era of \"Big Data\"), many standard Bayesian regression methods produce results that are counterintuitive with respect to the aims of the analysis.  These behaviors, which have been mathematically proven to affect standard analysis, are termed \"Essentially Least Squares Estimation\" and a \"Conditional Lindley\u00c6s Paradox\" and degrade the quality of the inferences and predictions that can be made based on the models.  The research produced new methods for Bayesian regression that do not suffer from these maladies and that provide improved inference and prediction.  The new methods are based on new, structured prior distributions called \"block hyper-g/n\" distributions, which allow researchers to use domain-specific knowledge to improve modeling.  Related research resulted in other methodological advances, including new methods for Bayesian regression analysis that allow researchers to incorporate other common prior information into a regression analysis.  The specific methods rely on what are called \"R-prior\" distributions as they are related to the R-squared statistic that is taught in every introductory regression class.  The new methods are flexible in that they allow researchers to include prior information when it is available and yet avoid unintentionally injecting unreasonable prior information into the model when it is not available.  Together, the new theory and methods provide a new perspective on an old problem and result in the potential for improved statistical practice.\n\nThe broader impacts of the results of the research are several-fold.  The new statistical methods that were developed as part of the research were constructed with practitioners in mind.  The prior information that can be included in the new models is expected to be readily available to those using the methods in practice.  The research, therefore, can have a positive impact on not only the statistics community but also the vast community of researchers who use statistical methods.  In addition to impacts on other disciplines, the project led to impacts on STEM training.  The principal investigators supervised several Ph.D. students in statistics over the course of the project; those who have graduated have taken jobs in academia, industry and government.  The project is expected to positively impact each of these sectors due to the specific training provided to the current and former students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Hans"
