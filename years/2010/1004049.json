 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fields Institute in Toronto will host and fund (Canadian $200,000) a Thematic Program on The Mathematics of Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases\", July-August 2010. This application seeks support for junior U.S. researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) to participate in the program.\r\n\r\nDrug resistance by bacteria and virus has been regarded as one of the biggest threats to public health in the new century. The proposed two-month thematic program at the Fields Institute will focus on the Emergence of Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases and will bring together leading researchers in mathematical epidemiology/immunology from around the world in order to stimulate major progress in this area. The program will consist of two main sub-themes that are of fundamental importance to understanding and predicting the emergence of drug resistance: (a) Mathematical Immunology: from In-host to Population Modeling; (b) Transmission Heterogeneity in Infectious Diseases. Each of the above sub-themes represents an important area of current research interest and  importance to public health, and each also provides ample opportunities for the advancement of mathematical theories and techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).",

Feedbacks and Outcomes\n \n\nAll participants, in particular the graduate students and Postdoctoral fellows, said that the Thematic Program and the Workshop were very helpful for their research, gave them opportunities to present their results, to learn the current research in their areas, and to interact with other researchers from all around the worlds. Some collaborations were initiated at the workshops. Many participants were particularly happy with the extent to which mathematical ideas were juxtaposed with pressing, real-world, public health concerns. This aspect of the thematic program was greatly enhanced by our inclusion of a large number of researchers who work in the area of public health, and by the program facilitating productive exchanges between groups that might not otherwise engage one another. Several researchers have also commented on how well the program facilitated new contacts ..."
