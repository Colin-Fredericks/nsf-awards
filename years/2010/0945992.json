 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to dramatically advance 3D position input and motion sensing systems with a MEMS-based optical 3D tracking and 3D position measurements system. This sensing system would enable real time interaction with computers, robots, and other machinery in ways that are more intuitive, precise and natural compared to existing technologies. Using scanning MEMS mirrors, lasers, optics and optical sensors, this tracking system can quickly and precisely determine location, direction, and rate of movement. Real time 3D tracking has many potential applications. The proposed optical sensor will provide X,Y, and Z position information of a small target object down to sub-millimeter precision in large spaces such as a room and at update rates below 0.1ms. These might include controllers for video games, PC interactions, industrial robot controls, crane operations, etc. Having controllers that can follow our hands or fingers and interpret our intentions would make human-machine interaction a more enjoyable, ergonomic, and precise experience. Mirrorcle Technologies has been a technical leader in the area of MEMS mirrors. However, building such a 3D tracking system requires significant innovation in optical design, closed-loop control, embedded computing, and packaging. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable a superior, more economical, and more accurate means of interacting with machines by humans. Human machine interaction is a necessity in our modern world. The number of machines we interact with will continue to increase, and interactions will be increasingly complex. However, human-machine interaction is often not pleasant and intuitive. Ergonomic injuries caused by keyboard, mouse, and poor posture are increasingly common. Developing capabilities for more intuitive interaction will serve a great need for our increasingly electronic world. Adding more knobs and buttons is not the right solution. We believe that input devices based on 3D tracking can be developed into intuitive and natural ways for people to interact with augmented and virtual reality environments. It may enhance our ability to work with objects much bigger or smaller than our range of manual dexterity. Ultimately, it can help us navigate an ever more complex computerized world.",

The device is a complex system with many components (lasers, optics, electronics, and MEMS device,) that must ultimately work together with proper synchronization, and space and power utilization.  The key component of the system is MirrorcleTech\u00c6s proprietary gimbal-less MEMS mirror which achieves high-speed point-to-point optical scanning in two-axes.  These devices consume milliwatts of power and very small volumes while achieving high performance laser-beam scanning required for a variety of laser-based imaging and metrology applications.\n\n \nObtaining real-time 3D coordinates of a moving object has many applications such as gaming, robotics and human-computer interaction applications, and industrial applications such as metrology and factory automation.  Various technologies have been investigated for and used in these applications, including sensing via wire-interfaces, ultrasound, and laser interferometry.  However a simple and low-cost solution that can provide enough precision and flexibility is not yet available. \nIn Phase I we proposed two different beam-steering based schemes or techniques to track an object inside a conic volume.
