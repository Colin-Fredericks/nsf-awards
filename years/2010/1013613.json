Support will go with highest priority to Ph.D. students, then M.S. students, then undergraduate students, and finally PostDocs.  Priority will also be given to those students presenting papers and members of underrepresented groups.  Selection of applicants for support will be made by a committee whose members will consist of members of the conference organizing committee.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity will enable students to participate in the conference with other researchers in their field.  It will provide valuable insights into the research that others are doing and help them better frame their own work.  It will benefit the nation through improved effectiveness of funded research and higher quality graduates.",
