 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this project is to investigate a new reactor design, called a continuous flow microreactor, to deposit materials from water-based solutions.  This design reduces the critical dimension of the reactor from the centimeter-scale used in conventional solution reactors to sub-millimeter scale in order to improve reactant utilization and reduce waste.  The microreactor will be used to synthesize semiconductor and oxide thin films and nanowire arrays that are important to the solar cell industry.  The understanding developed through this project has potential both to reduce the cost of current solar cells and to enable next-generation solar cell designs.  The microreactor will be used to investigate reaction mechanisms and to identify the physical processes that limit deposition rates.  Additionally, it will enable discovery of new materials with optimal functional properties for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nThe continuous flow microreactor will improve process yields and reduce waste by up to a factor of ten, which will reduce manufacturing costs significantly and could have transformative impact on the semiconductor processing industry. As the thin film photovoltaics market continues to grow, low-cost \"green\" deposition methods will become increasingly important, and the advantages in yield, waste reduction, and cost offered by the microreactor will be extremely valuable.  In addition to its industrial impact, this project will also result in the research education and training of a PhD student and several undergraduate students.  High school students and teachers will also participate through summer research experiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProfessor Jason Baxter and his team at Drexel University recently completed research for award CMMI-1000111, studying solution deposition of semiconductor thin films and nanowires with the aid of novel microreactors.  Chemical bath deposition (CBD) has been used to deposit materials from solution for over a century, but controlling the deposition products and understanding the dynamic bath composition is still very challenging.  CBD is typically carried out in batch mode, where the bath composition changes over time as the deposition proceeds, and tracking the evolution of the deposited material and the bath is difficult.  However, in a flow reactor, changes in time are translated into changes in spatial position, enabling rapid characterization of the trajectory of the deposition product on a single substrate, as indicated in the figure.  With complementary measurements of the chemical bath and speciation modeling, the team has gained unprecedented understanding of the reaction chemistry in several materials systems of interest for photovoltaics.  Additionally, operating the reactor in batch mode with a millimeter-scale channel height enables high yield compared to macro-scale reactors because of reduced precipitation in the bulk solution.\n\nThe Baxter group demonstrated increased yield in a batch microreactor compared to a macroscale reactor by depositing ZnO nanowires, a material system of interest for nanostructured solar cells and optoelectronic devices.  They then showed that a flow microreactor can provide a spatially resolved map to correlate deposition rate to growth conditions, and also that new ZnO morphologies can be obtained under conditions of reduced mass transport resistance.  The continuous flow microreactor was further applied to investigate thin film materials used as buffer layers in solar cells.  CdS is the most common buffer layer material, but it absorbs blue light and decreases solar cell efficiency.  The Baxter group investigated CdZnS and Zn(S,O,OH) as wider band gap alternatives for enhanced performance.  In the case of these alloys, the flow microreactor enables growth of materials with graded composition across a single substrate.  New insight into materials chemistry was obtained through spatial characterization of the deposited material and chemical bath, coupled with modeling and advanced spectroscopy of the different species and complexes in the bath.  This work has resulted in both new recipes for depositing high performance materials and improved fundamental understanding of the CBD process.\n\nDetailed research results have been disseminated to the research community and are also accessible to the general public.  This grant resulted in 9 publications in peer-reviewed journals.  Research was also presented at 11 national and international conferences. \n\nThis grant provided the primary support for education and training of one PhD students and partial support for another. One of these students now works in industry on scale-up of photovoltaics manufacturing, and the other is an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Louisiana State University.  Additionally six undergraduate students participated in this project, one of whom has decided to pursue a PhD as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason B Baxter"
