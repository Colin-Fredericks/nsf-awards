 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay of genetic exchange and reproductive isolation is central to the origin and maintenance of adaptation and biodiversity. Ultimately, biological diversification involves speciation, which occurs when reproductive isolation results from development of barriers to interbreeding, such as selective mating or hybrid sterility. Reproductive barriers lead to relatively infrequent interbreeding and hybrid formation, but the production of hybrids still can have important evolutionary implications, particularly when hybrids mate with their parent taxa. Mating between hybrids and their parent taxa can lead to the transfer of important genetically-based adaptations (e.g., traits such as tolerance to flooded conditions) between the parent species through genetic introgression.  This project will apply a new technique that allows very fine-scale analysis of the genome to study speciation that is accompanied by introgression between two species of Louisiana Irises in order to determine how the genes underlying reproductive barriers affect introgression.\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to understanding of mechanisms of biodiversity increase and adaptation and will advance applications of new molecular genetic techniques. This project will provide training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers at two universities and will provide scientific information to the public. This research into the process of introgression is directly applicable to the selective breeding of microorganisms, plants, and animals upon which humans depend for food, clothing, and shelter.",
