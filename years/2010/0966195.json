SRSP is offering sixteen scholarships per year, averaging $5,700 each for four consecutive years to academically talented and economically disadvantaged students. In addition to financial support, SRSP students are assigned a faculty mentor and a peer mentor. Undergraduate research is both encouraged and supported, and SRSP students attend monthly seminars on STEM research and graduate school and career opportunities. SRSP hosts a Career Connection panel composed of local industry leaders and alumni in relevant fields. Recruitment efforts focus on high school seniors planning to major in chemistry, computer science, mathematics or physics; ASU students enrolled in gateway STEM courses; part-time students; students showing interest in or engaged in undergraduate research in the targeted disciplines.",
