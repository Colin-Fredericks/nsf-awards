In this project, the use of modern technology and captivating concepts of current areas of research are being interwoven in the undergraduate curriculum. In a traditional curriculum design, lab experiments in modern physics topics are often reserved for advanced students in the physics major. Also relying solely on independent research with faculty is often neither feasible nor effective in helping undergraduate students develop the types of skills needed for graduate school and industry. \r\n\r\nThis project centers on incorporating a themed laboratory component in nuclear and particle physics into the curriculum at CSU, affecting high school and college students pursuing physics, engineering, and chemistry degrees. The project will take a multi-staged approach to improving the laboratory experience for our students by using modern research in recruitment and outreach programs, in introductory courses and in advanced teaching labs. Through the thoughtful choice of experimental teaching laboratory modules, this project will provide students with comprehensive guided-inquiry experiences: foster their interest in science, train them in the use of technology, introduce them to the methodology of current experimental techniques, and prepare them for successful collaboration in the research areas of the faculty members in our department. In this stage of the project, we are focusing on detector techniques for particle and nuclear physics experiments.",

We also developed activities and assessments and organized two summer workshops for in-service science high school teachers.\n\n High School Module\n\nThe development of this module was based on our experiences from QuarkNet and the discussions we had with teachers during the summer workshops. The idea is to reinforce the concept of velocity to introduce the students to cosmic rays, detectors and data analysis. For the first part of the module the students calculate the velocity of a cart based on measurements of time and displacements at two points of a straight track and emphasizes proportional reasoning.  For the second part of the experiment we first discuss with the students the origin of cosmic rays, atmospheric muons and how the detectors work.  The students then use the detectors to measure the speed of muons by recording the time when a muon hits the detector installed in the ceiling and the time when the same muon hits the a second detector on a table.\n\nMechanics Module\n\nIn this module we focus on the topic of energy, energy conservation, and energy transfer. As particles strike detectors, energy from these collisions is transferred to light, which is then converted into electric pulses.  This is an excellent example of how energy changes forms.  In the class, lab students begin with an activity where they release carts down a track that strike obstacles (to make the analogy to particles striking the detector.) The obstacles are made of material that breaks, giving the chance to measure how the energy is transferred from kinetic to other forms of energy such as deformation, sound, heat.  Students then think about the energy of incoming particles and how this energy is transferred to other forms.\n\nElectrodynamics Module\n\nStudents begin this activity by measuring the induced magnetic field as a function of the current passing through a coil.  They quantify the correlation current due to the induced field. In the second part of the experiment, the students move a magnet through the same coil used in in the first part \"detecting\" changes in the current in the solenoid. In the last part of this module, the students make the connection between magnetic induction and the way that the electrical signal is generated in the detectors that we use. The experiment uses coils and magnets to help students visualize how the mechanical energy of the particles is changed to the electric signals of the detectors.\n\nModern Physics and Advanced Lab Modules.\n\nThe modern physics module will accompany the Nuclear Physics and Nuclear Radiation sections taught in our Physics III course.

We start by using the detectors to measure the flux of cosmic rays and then generate the spectra of energy deposited by the cosmic rays in the detectors. Then we bring the sources and measure the spectra again. From the comparison of the spectra the students realize that the radioactive materials are a source of charged particles similar to the muons.  We are currently developing our Advanced Lab module; in this module we measure the life time of a muon. The experiment is designed for senior or junior physics majors, and..."
