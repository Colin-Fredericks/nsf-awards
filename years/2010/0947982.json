The research questions of the Fellows are linked to local neighborhood issues and larger historical changes in land use patterns. Although the research questions are focused on neighborhood and regional environmental issues, the scientific literacy skills acquired by program participants will enable them to critically and quantitatively address any scientific question or environmentally-related problem, ranging from local to global scales. Fellows and teachers will work in school-based teams on three primary tasks: the development and delivery of inquiry-based lesson plans, greater quality and quantity of differentiated instruction, and the creation of K-12 student teams to teach others science concepts and methods. Fellows will learn to communicate research to a wide variety of audiences, develop lesson plans, develop leadership skills, enhance their teaching capability, and engage in research activities with students. Teachers will integrate new research into their teaching and learning and take part in professional development on inquiry-based science instruction and working with diverse student groups. K-12 students will become engaged in new forms of science learning and research and will be exposed to a variety of STEM careers. \r\n\r\n",

The GK-12 RS experience made our graduate students better teachers and scientists. Their teaching presentations became clearer and more concise over time while still effusing their love of science. Thirty-four graduate students participated in our GK-12 program. &nbsp;These were Masters and Doctoral students in Biology, Chemistry-Biochemistry, and Geography.&nbsp;All but two students found our program to be an incredible experience. The program enhanced their communication skills (oral and written), provided opportunities to interact with diverse audiences, and explore different ways present their science. &nbsp;The relationships that our students formed with their teachers and other K-12 students enriched their graduate experiences. &nbsp;All students that graduated from UNCG are currently employed, some in Higher Education including such places as Indiana University (Bloomington), U of Nebraska, Elon University and other similar institutions. One student is currently a post-doc while another works for the CDC. Two of our RSs are now teaching in high school STEM programs and another is teaching in a Career and Technical HS. &nbsp;A few students are still working on their doctoral studies as expected due to the timing of their participation in GK-12. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our partnering teachers became involved in cutting edge science.

Over 1600 students participated in classrooms that had RSs.

The Middle and High School science clubs took the lead on developing and implementing their activities, consequently they learned to communicate their science to their peers. Their activities were complemented by faculty activities and other hands-on science activities. &nbsp;GK-12 provides an important function of bringing together a diverse community for a common purpose: science. &nbsp;Moving the format to a school day, organized by the science clubs, means that the event will continue after the grant ends.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our evaluation results, both formative and summative, indicate that GK-12 more than met its goals and will have a lasting impact on those that were involved in the program.</p>\n<p>Over the years, RSs and students sampled the creek for chemical and biological data and established a data base.
