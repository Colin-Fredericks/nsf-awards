 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time information is a fundamental emerging issue in the creation\r\nand management of Web content. Increasingly, rather than consulting\r\nrelatively static sources that are indexed on a periodic basis,\r\npeople refer to information on news sites, blogs, social-networking\r\nsites, and Twitter feeds that change dynamically and spread rapidly.\r\nThis project will study how information content varies over time, how\r\nit is transmitted through underlying social networks, and how its\r\nrecipients assemble it into larger units. The project will explore\r\nnew techniques for addressing these issues, based on novel methods\r\nfor tracking, analyzing, and presenting information that evolves and\r\nspreads rapidly over time. The resulting approach aims to transform\r\nimportant aspects of the ways in which real-time information on the\r\nWeb is handled.\r\n\r\nFirst the fundamental units of information that spread through the\r\nunderlying information networks will be identified. From a set of\r\nnearly 1 billion news media articles and blog posts (approx. 6TB of\r\ndata), and a collection of 500 million tweets from Twitter, small\r\n(generally textual) units of information will be identified that\r\nremain relatively stable as they spread through the Web.  The\r\ntemporal variation within these basic units will be analyzed and\r\nmodeled.  This modeling will include connections with biological\r\nmodels of epidemics, as well as new frameworks that exploit the\r\nfundamental differences between biological and social contagion.\r\nFinally, the temporal variation will be related to network-level\r\nmodels for the diffusion of this information. Generally, the actual\r\nnetworks on which real-time information spreads cannot be directly\r\nobserved, nor can the influence of any particular node in the network\r\nbe directly measured.  Therefore, the project will develop machine-\r\nlearning techniques that infer these hidden networks and unobserved\r\nlevels of influence.\r\n\r\nFor more information see the project web site at:\r\nhttp://snap.stanford.edu/proj/mipro",
