Measurements of the transmission coefficients between a large number of points on the input and output of random sample configurations will allow us to determine the matrices for transmission through random samples and to determine their eigenvalues and eigenstates. This will provide the links between the statistics of field, intensity, total transmission, and transmittance and will thereby bridge the gap between optical transmission and electronic conductance. Among the eigenstates of the transmission matrix for opaque media are states with transmission approaching unity. We will find these states and will thereby be able to probe the interior of random systems. We will also be able to determine the eigenvalues of the underlying electromagnetic quasi-normal modes and their speckle patterns in transmission. This will provide a full description of static and dynamic wave properties and will foster advances in imaging and photonics. The success of this work will strengthen the CUNY Photonic Center established to enhance the technological base of the New York City metropolitan area. Students from local high schools and undergraduates as well as graduate students and a postdoc will utilize this equipment to conduct research at the forefront of the field of transport. This will expose a diverse group of students to the excitement and power of research at an early stage of their careers.\r\n\r\nLayman Summary:  \r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nWe explore and control our environment and stay in touch with one another via waves. In addition to light and sound, we rely increasingly on electron waves and microwave radiation for communication. The shared wave character of light and electrons is behind the rapid growth of the photonics industry and the promise it holds for continued device miniaturization and increased speed. At the same time, the transport of multiply scattered quantum and classical waves in disordered systems remains a crucial issue in communications and imaging. Important examples of propagation in random media are electron flow in conductors and insulators, light scattering in paint, the atmosphere and biological tissue, and acoustic scattering in the earth's crust. The use of the proposed advance microwave measurement system will allow us to decompose the measured microwave field into the fundamental modes of oscillation of waves of randomly scattering systems. This will provide a full description of the transmission of steady-state and pulsed radiation. We will also find ways to combine incident fields to achieve high transmission through opaque systems. This work will advance the understanding of wave scattering and find applications in electronics, medical imaging, and geological exploration for oil and gas. The availability of the advanced microwave source and detector will strengthen the Photonic Center of the City University of New York established to enhance the technological base of the New York City metropolitan area. Students from local high schools and undergraduates as well as graduate students and a postdoc will utilize this equipment to conduct research at the forefront of the field of transport. This will expose a diverse group of students to the excitement of research at an early stage of their careers.",
