 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transmission eigenvalue problem has attracted many researchers in the \r\nscattering and inverse scattering communities recently. Although simply \r\nstated, the problem is not covered by any standard theory of partial \r\ndifferential equations. Numerical treatment of transmission eigenvalues is \r\nvery limited to date. Effective numerical methods will enhance the \r\nunderstanding of the problem and provide tools for mathematicians and \r\nengineers to compute transmission eigenvalues. This proposal aims at robust \r\nnumerical methods for transmission eigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and \r\nthe Maxwell's equations. In particular, the following research topics will be \r\ncarried out. 1) Iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. Based on a \r\nfourth order reformulation, an associated generalized eigenvalue problem will \r\nbe solved by the finite element method. Then iterative methods will be applied \r\nto search roots of a related algebraic function which turn out to be the \r\ntransmission eigenvalues. 2) Continuous finite element method for the \r\nMaxwell's equations. The transmission eigenvalue problem of the Maxwell's equations will be written in a suitable weak form first. Then the curl conforming edge elements will be used to compute the transmission eigenvalues. 3) Iterative methods for the anisotropic Maxwell's equations. This approach is again based on a forth order reformulation of the transmission eigenvalue  problem of the anisotropic Maxwell's equations. An associated generalized Maxwell's eigenvalue problem will be used to set up an algebraic equation whose roots are the transmission eigenvalues. Then iterative methods can be applied to search the roots of the algebraic equation. It is an extension of the iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. However, the case for the Maxwell's equations is much more difficult and require additional technical treatment.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be a pioneer numerical study on transmission \r\neigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell's equations. The \r\nresults are important for the development of mathematical theory for \r\ntransmission eigenvalues and can be used to compare various estimates in \r\ninverse scattering theory.  The proposed research will provide mathematicians \r\nand engineers reliable tools to compute transmission eigenvalues. It will lead \r\nto new methods for studying the inverse scattering problems such as inverse \r\nelectromagnetic scattering problem for anisotropic media. Since transmission \r\neigenvalues can be used to estimate material properties of the scattering \r\nobject, the proposed research has potential usage in non-destructive testing, \r\ngeophysical applications, medical imaging, etc. For example, it is possible to \r\ndetect the presence of cavities in the dielectric from the location of the \r\ntransmission eigenvalues. The numerical results will be disseminated to \r\nmathematician for analytical study of transmission eigenvalues and engineers \r\nfor detection and reconstruction of unknown objects. In addition, successful accomplishment of the proposed project will enhance the research capacity of the university and provide graduate students valuable research opportunities.",
