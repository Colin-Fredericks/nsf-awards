Particularly, this new delivery system will be explored by hybridizing monocytes with dendrimer nanoparticles through cell surface engineering, in which the nanoparticles immobilized on the cell surface are intended for anticancer drug loading. Dendrimers have highly branched nanoscale structures with a number of functionalizable surface groups. They are capable of delivering a high drug payload as well as a variety of therapeutics and functional entities through proper chemical modifications, encapsulation, or surface interactions. Monocytes are able to both migrate to and accumulate in hypoxic areas of tumor. However, most anticancer drugs cannot be directly loaded into monocytes because of their inherent toxicity. Drug delivery through the cell surface-immobilized nanoparticles will potentially minimize the toxic effects of anticancer drugs to the monocyte vehicle and represents a transformative way to utilize the best aspects of both cellular and nanostructured carriers. The new treatment modality derived from this project may eventually serve as a complementary means to surgery and/or conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, helping to eradicate metastasis, improve survival rate, and increase quality of life for cancer patients. \r\nTo generate a broader impact, a nanoscience research-based learning platform will be established to educate students of different academic levels, enable them to conduct novel research and increase their knowledge in the emerging scientific area of nanomedicine, and provide new opportunities for women or underrepresented minorities particularly African Americans to pursue careers in engineering and nanoscience. The outreach program will reach K-12 students by establishing a summer research program for local high school students, providing on-site displays to introduce fundamentals of nanotechnology through Science Museum of Virginia, and using 2-D tactile graphics and a portable haptic feedback device to teach the concepts of nanotechnology to those K-12 students who are blind or visually impaired.",
