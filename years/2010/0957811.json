 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the PI will study the mechanisms by which opposite polarity motors communicate and how their function is regulated inside living cells. The standard genetic and biochemical assays will be combined with high speed imaging as well as quantitative optical trap measurement of motor forces in living Drosophila embryos and in purified systems from different genetic backgrounds. This research project is motivated by preliminary data showing that purified cargos carry opposite polarity motors that engage in a stalemate in vitro and do not move long distances in the absence of cyotsolic extracts. The central hypothesis is that regulatory proteins coordinate bidirectional transport and that force generation in opposite directions alone does not account for the observed bidirectionality. The rationale for these studies is that the identification of the mechanisms by which motors of opposite polarity cooperate would lead to a fundamental framework for eventual understanding of how failure of these mechanisms is linked to disease. The principal investigator has, and will continue to disseminate the findings of his research program among the general public through high school student internships in his laboratory and through lectures to the students and their teachers in Austin high schools.",

To position micrometer-sized vesicles and organelles inside the cell at the right place and in a timely fashion the cell shuttles these cargoes along a network of intracellular roads (microtubules and actin filaments) using a set of cellular vehicles: molecular motor proteins (kinesin, dynein and myosin) (see figure 1). Of course, the roads and motors are tiny: you need to put a thousand microtubules in a bundle to get the thickness of one human hair. Moreover, the motors are often tiny compared to the cargo; think of a huge heap of hay carried by a poor donkey that is barely visible beneath it.

Measuring the piconewoton forces (one trillionth of the force you need to carry an apple!) that motors exert in their native cellular environment enabled us to count the number of motors hauling individual cargoes as two motors working in tandem exert twice the force of one motor (see figure 2). Now, the analogy with roads, vehicles, donkeys and fuel sort of drops here: on a road you can typically make a U-turn, in the cell if you want to reverse direction you need to switch &lsquo;vehicles&rsquo;.
