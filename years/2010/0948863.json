Modern computational platforms will immediately serve NSF funded crustal motion geodetic research in South America, Greenland and Antarctica, PI analysis of the global vertical velocity field in support of studies of sea level change, and work in GPS meteorology and kinematic positioning.  Specific equipment to be acquired includes five dual Intel-based quadcore Macintosh compute systems each with 16 Gb RAM and a 640 Gb hard drive.  The compute facility will serve four graduate students and two professional staff scientists in PI Mike Bevis?s research group as well as students in Professor Terry Wilson's research group at OSU.  The PIs have ported the geodetic processing package GAMIT/GLOBK to enable it to run on a Macintosh Xgrid system.  This modified version of GAMIT/GLOBK would be available to any MIT licensed user.",
