 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rose-Hulman's summer REU program in mathematics has served over 150 undergraduates in the past 21 years.  This REU has introduced students to problems in group theory, \"cwatsets\", hyperbolic geometry, number theory, inverse problems, and geometric analysis, and made contributions to each of  these areas.  The program has evolved from a single faculty member to one involving enthusiastic mentors who rotate in and out of the program year-to-year.  The result is a wider range of problems for undergraduates to investigate.  The REU has also gained strong support from the mathematics department as a whole and the Rose-Hulman community.\r\n\r\nThough the mathematical topics we investigate are diverse, we have developed a coherent approach to the research: we initially make use of computational tools to help students understand the problems at hand, by working out specific cases and examples. They can then begin making general conjectures, designing algorithms, and follow up with large scale computational and/or statistical investigations (as appropriate) and eventually rigorous analysis and proofs. The problems we pose can be attacked by students with a fairly modest mathematical background. However, the problems are drawn from active areas of mathematics, and can quickly lead to the frontiers of current research, depending on the student's abilities and drive. Our REU develops the students as \"complete\" mathematicians, capable of independent thinking, making and proving conjectures, and communicating their results. In the process, we hope to give them a basis for future career decisions. Thus, in the selection process we are especially interested in students who, beyond having adequate preparation, express interest in a career involving research, but who may not otherwise have a chance at an undergraduate research opportunity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates program\nis to give undergraduate students the chance to participate in the\ntype of mathematical research that is often not experienced until\ngraduate school.  We hope that the students will use this experience\nto make more informed judgments about their future career paths.\nEleven students per year were introduced to mathematical research in\nthe areas of computational number theory, systems biology, inverse\nproblems, geometric analysis, and delay differential equations.  This\nincludes training in literature search, reading advanced mathematics,\nexperimental mathematics (conjecture and testing of conjecture through\nnumerical experiments), development of mathematical models and\nalgorithms to solve mathematical problems, and both written and oral\nmathematical exposition.  Students in most cases worked\ncollaboratively to gain better understanding of their specific\nproblems and to emphasize the modern form of mathematical research as\na team effort with each individual contributing to the end result.  A\nbrief synopsis of each group's area of research is described below.\n\n \nThe Computational Number Theory group studied mathematics related to\ncertain types of \"digital signatures\" used on the Internet and in many\nother modern computer systems.  These signatures are designed so that\neach one is unique to a specific combination of signer and document,\nand cannot be forged by any other party.  Nevertheless, anyone can use\npublic information to verify the authenticity of the signature without\njeopardizing its security.  This process relies on the existence of\nmathematical transformations which are easy to perform in one\ndirection, but cannot be reversed without secret private information.\nIn most cases, however, it is an unproven conjecture that the\ntransformations are as hard to invert as we think.  We investigated\ncertain of these mathematical transformations and gathered evidence\nwhich suggests that in most cases the conjecture holds.  However, we\nalso uncovered some statistical anomalies that it might be possible to\nexploit in the future.\n\nStudents working on the projects in Systems Biology combined the\nmathematical and computational sciences to model, solve, and analyze\nmodern problems in biology.  One project studied a mathematical model\nto discern if two proteins had similar roles within a cell.  This is\nan increasingly important problem as the number of known protein\nstructures grows. A second project studied and improved a mathematical\nmodel of a cell's metabolism.  The associated computational work\nproved a heightened efficacy of the new model over its predecessor. A\nthird project investigated estimates of the genetic diversity required\nby a previous population so that it could combine to create a current\npopulation.\n\nThe Inverse Problems group focused on the ideas of non-destructive\ntesting and cloaking.  The goal of non-destructive testing is to image\nthe interior of an object without causing damage. A classic example is\nthe use of x-rays, but other methods can be more useful in certain\nsituations.  Two techniques of recent interest employ electrical\nand/or thermal methods, so-called \"impedance\" and \"thermal\" imaging.\nGroups of students mathematically modeled these techniques and\nexplored the theoretical potential of each to produce images of the\ninterior of an object.  An allied area of current interest is that of\n\"cloaking,\" in which one attempts to hide an object from an observer.\nOne student analyzed the possibility of cloaking an object against\nthermal imaging (work that won her a \"best poster\" award at the Joint\nMathematical Meetings in 2012).\n\nIn the Geometric Analysis group, the underlying problem is to model\nusing geometry and analysis (calculus) the optimal configuration\n(shape) of baked goods through developing a mathematical model for the\nphysical processes governing the baking process.   One of the\noverarching questions was to develop a foam model for th..."
