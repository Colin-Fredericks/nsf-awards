Kellogg (University of Missouri - Saint Louis)\r\n\r\nCoPI: Jeffrey Bennetzen (University of Georgia)\r\n\r\nSetaria viridis or green foxtail is a ubiquitous weed that was introduced from Eurasia during the past 500 years.  It is often found in and around cultivated fields and the extensive herbicide pressure imposed by agricultural weed control has led to the development of herbicide resistant genotypes.  Resistance to four different types of herbicides has been identified in S. viridis.  Under continued herbicide application, the genome region that carries the resistance will be under strong selection and this is expected to lead to reduced variation at the herbicide resistance locus and surrounding genome region.  The project aims to compare the genetic variation at the whole genome level with the variation present in and around three herbicide resistance genes.  To achieve this objective, S. viridis accessions will be collected from North America and Canada, where herbicide resistance has previously been observed. S. viridis accessions from around the world will be obtained from national and international germplasm repositories.  The plants will be tested for herbicide resistance.  Cutting edge molecular techniques, including high-throughput sequencing, will be used to analyze the genetic variation.  The project will provide new insights into the diversity of green foxtail worldwide, the history and origin of green foxtail introductions into North America, the nature of the mutations that give rise to herbicide resistance, how the resistance spreads through populations and the effects of intense directional selection on genome evolution. \r\n\r\nThe project provides a vehicle for training students at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level in independent research.  In addition, the project data will be used as hands-on teaching materials in graduate courses taught by the PIs.  The project also aims to provide a link between weed scientists, germplasm curators and geneticists with an interest in green foxtail.  To raise awareness of the research interests of the different groups and to facilitate collaborations, the project will organize a workshop to discuss available green foxtail collections, maintenance of those stocks, genomic tools and common goals.  All sequence data produced by this project will be made publicly available through GenBank.  Germplasm can be obtained from the University of Georgia and the USDA-ARS Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) (www.ars-grin.gov).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSetaria viridis (green foxtail) is an ubiquitous weed that was likely introduced into North America over the past 200 years.  An analysis of the genetic diversity present in S. viridis (green foxtail) accessions collected in the United States and Canada, and their relationship to a world collection using a set of 11 SSR markers, showed that accessions from the Northern US and Canada (north of 44 0N) were likely introduced from Western Europe and accessions from the Mid and Southern US likely originated from Southern Europe and/or the Middle East.   An expansion of this analysis with some 40,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers yielded essentially the same two population groups.  Adaptation to the Northern US/Canada was associated with the presence of a specific allele at an SSR locus on chromosome IV.  A different allele was predominantly present at that locus in the Mid/Southern US accessions. \n\nBecause S. viridis is a weed of disturbed habitats, including agricultural fields, it has acquired resistance to at least four classes of herbicides.  Herbicide resistance can be caused by DNA changes (mutations) in specific genes that are targeted by the herbicide (target gene resistance) or in other, as yet unidentified, genes (non-target gene resistance).  A total of 218 S. viridis accessions were sprayed with herbicides belonging to herbicide classes A, B, H and G.  Sequence information for the corresponding target genes was generated/available for 82 of the 218 accessions. Resistance to herbicide class A was more than 2-fold more frequent in Canadian accessions than in the overall germplasm collection.  This likely reflects the fact that S. viridis is a prevalent weed in crop fields in Canada, and is typically controlled with group A herbicides.  Surprisingly, only a few mutations were found in herbicide target genes, indicating that most resistance was caused by alterations in other genes.  This likely explains why some 19% of herbicide resistant plants were resistant to more than one type of herbicide.  Although sample numbers were small, our data also indicate that target gene resistance may have a negative effect on fitness.  Our study also yielded the first glyphosate and glufosinate resistant S. viridis lines. \n\nThe project led to the training of post-doctoral researchers and undergraduates in genetic and genomic technologies and in bioinformatics.  In part as a result of this project, the First International Setaria Genetics Conference was held in Beijing in March 2014, bringing together Setaria researchers from around the world. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katrien M Devos"
