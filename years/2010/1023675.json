 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to help support travel and meeting costs for students and  early career scientists at U.S. institutions to the 28th International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics ?Modelling Earth Dynamics: Complexity, Uncertainty and Validation? to be held in June 7-11, 2010 in Pisa, Italy. The conference website is http://cmg2010.pi.ingv.it/index.html. \r\n \r\nThis conference brings together Earth scientists from across the disciplines with physicists, applied mathematicians, and computational scientists to discuss advances in mathematical and computational techniques for understanding properties and processes in the Earth. This year?s meeting emphasizes aspects of the mathematical modeling of the Earth dynamics, with particular enphasis on the use and effectiveness of models in predicting environmental phenomena. This meeting provides a single multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and techniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth Sciences. Funds are requested to support travel and lodging costs for 9 students, post-docs, and early career scientists which is approximately one third of the number attending past meetings. \r\n \r\nThis meting is highly interdisciplinary and international in nature and provides an important opportunity for U.S. students and early career scientists from across the earth sciences and applied mathematics to interact with senior scientists in a small informal setting. We will directly contact faculty members in Geophysics in universities and colleges that have a large number of students from under-represented groups, to encourage their students and collegues to apply for a travel and lodging grant to attend the conference. This year there will also be an increased emphasis on  the use and effectiveness of mathematical models in predicting environmental phenomena. This topic is of great interest not only to the scientific community but to the whole humanity, as the outcome of Earth models impacts the decisions of governments regarding the human induced changes on landscapes and climate.",
