 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large relatively high-elevation surfaces with low relief are common on\r\nthe continents. Such uplifts have a significant impact on the geological \r\nrecord by influencing drainage networks and sediment supply, on climate by modifying\r\natmospheric circulation, and on biogeography and the biota. Work in geodynamics has\r\nshown that such uplifts amount to a telling signature of mantle dynamics. Thus, they\r\nprovide a means to discriminate among hypotheses about how the continental lithosphere\r\nand the deeper mantle interact through processes that result in uplift and mass transfer in\r\ncontinental interiors. The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and\r\naccessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which\r\nmantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have\r\nbeen important agents in its uplift. This five-year project proposes to use the Hangay\r\nDome as such a laboratory to coordinate studies of both the structure and state of the\r\nlithosphere and the sublithospheric mantle as well as the history of surface uplift and\r\nlandscape evolution. The project will involve observations and measurements made using\r\nbroadband seismology, basalt and xenolith petrology and geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar\r\ngeochronology, stable-isotope and vesicular-basalt paleoaltimetry, geomorphology and\r\n10Be geochronology, molecular genetics of divergent fish populations, and U-Th/He and\r\n4He/3He thermochronology.  The Hangay Dome?s widespread exposures of basaltic lavas,\r\nwhich were erupted over the past 30 Ma across a broad range of elevations, will be key to\r\nthe integration of all these data.  Dating of the basalts will enable linkage of petrologic data\r\nbearing on basalt genesis and the nature of the Hangay-Dome mantle with studies that\r\nuse the lavas as time markers for documenting landscape evolution and the history of\r\nsurface uplift.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project combined a multidisciplinary approach to understand why the Hangay region of central Mongolia is so geologically active.  The Hangay is in the middle of one of the largest tectonic plates on Earth.  The theory of plate tectonics well explains why most of Earth?s current geologic activity is concentrated along plate boundaries such as the Pacific ring of fire.  We well know the volcanic and earthquake hazards represented by plate boundary activity, and, at least in a general way, understand their causes as one tectonic plate grinds against another.  There are areas in the middle of plates, however, like the Hangay, that are surprisingly active. Plate tectonic theory provides little or no basis for predicting such activity and little information on its potential causes. A couple of relevant examples closer to the U.S. than the Hangay include the 7.5 magnitude New Madrid earthquake that occurred in the mid-continent U.S. in 1811 and the magnitude 5.8 Mineral Virginia earthquake of 2011 that caused substantial damage as far away as Washington D.C..  Both events were well removed from plate boundaries.\n\nThe Hangay region of central Mongolia has elevations over 13,000 feet, has experienced sporadic volcanism for the last 25 million years, and has had large earthquakes in recorded history.  My part of this project involved the study of the chemical composition and age of the recent volcanism in the area, including of rare samples of the lowermost crust and uppermost mantle brought to the surface by the volcanism.  Along with Lehigh PhD student Leonard Ancuta and collaborator Dmitri Ionov, our results show that the young volcanism is relatively small in volume, shows no geographic migration with time, and is of a composition indicating that it derives from very low degrees of melting of the mantle.  All of these features suggest that the volcanism is not triggered by some active process, for example the type of hot plume of material that fuels volcanism at Hawaii, but is instead reflective of a broader, in time and space, process.  An intriguing possibility is suggested by both the composition of the lavas and seismic imaging of the underlying mantle done as a separate part of this project.  The Earth?s interior under this region may be slowly ascending as a result of fluid release from the Pacific slab, that in this area is present at depths of some 500-600 kilometers.  As the Pacific oceanic plate descends into the Earth?s interior, the increasing heat drives off the water it carries, but when that water rises into the overlying mantle, it both lowers the density of the mantle and dramatically lowers its melting point.  The compositional characteristics of the Mongolian lavas are suggestive of relatively low melting temperatures and the presence of small amounts of the sedimentary components that would have been transported into Earth?s interior by the sinking Pacific plate.  If this is indeed the cause of the Hangay volcanism, the cause of this mid-plate activity ultimately can be attributed to the effect of the far distant boundary between the Pacific and Asian plates, with the sinking Pacific plate \"stirring up\" the Earth?s interior to much greater distances than would have been expected prior to this study.\n\nThe data from several efforts in this project allow us to calculate that the Hangay plateau has been eroding very slowly over the last 25 million years.  Its high elevations thus are not being caused by recent uplift.  Coupled with the evidence from our studies of the lower crust and upper mantle samples, and accompanying seismic studies of the area, the high topography of the Hangay region appears to reflect an unusually thick crustal section.  This thick crust likely formed of order 250-300 million years ago when much of central Mongolia was created by the assembly of various continental fragments when China collided with Siberia to form what we now know as the Asian plate.  Good modern examples of thick crust in the process of forming through a similar process are the Himalaya and the Altiplano of western South America.  High topography can significantly influence climate, and hence environmental conditions. Few places on Earth demonstrate this more clearly than the Hangay uplift. On top of the uplift are grasslands and the excellent grazing they allow (during a short season), remnant glacial valleys, and abundant fresh water streams. To the north of the dome are lowland grasslands and high-latitude forests, again with abundant fresh water streams. To the south of the Hangay is the Gobi Desert, a nearly uninhabited terrain of dry saline lakes, no vegetation, and almost no rain. The Hangay uplift is responsible for directing most of the humid atmospheric flow from the North away from the Gobi. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard W Carlson"
