 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry supports the development of the ion optics instrumentation and the analysis tools for a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer (FTICR-MS) which will operate at the unprecedented magnetic field strength of 21 Tesla (T). Dr. Alan Marshall and his team at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will develop advanced technologies for ion sources, ion transmission, ion external accumulation, ICR excitation, detection, and automatic instrument control and data reduction. The design aspects in these areas will be supported by large scale supercomputer simulation (greater than one million ions). This work will not only advance 21 T FTICR-MS technology, but mass spectrometry science in general.\r\n\r\nIn addition to advancing mass spectrometry science, this project will also have direct and groundbreaking implications in the fields of petroleomics, top-down proteomics, and in the characterization of the structure and behavior of macromolecular complexes.",
