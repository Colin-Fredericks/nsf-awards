Preference will be given to participants who are Ph.D. students or are researchers who earned their Ph.D.'s within the last 8-10 years and have limited or no other means of travel support. It is hoped that the Special Session and a possible satellite meeting will provide for extensive interaction between U.S. and South American logicians beyond already well-established research contacts and display the vitality of logic in South America to the broader South American mathematical community. \r\n\r\nThe Association for Symbolic Logic, which will administer the project, is the leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important meetings throughout the world. Increasing the visibility and presence of logic outside North America and Europe, particularly in Latin America and Asia, is one of the Association's highest long-term priorities. The Association, through its activities and publications, also actively seeks to embrace new and emerging fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. Further information on the Association may be found on its web site: http://www.aslonline.org.",
