 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University System of Maryland Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (USM-LSAMP) is a senior alliance (10 or more years of NSF LSAMP funding) consisting of three institutions. UMBC is the lead institution in partnership with the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES.) The distinct characteristics of each institution provide uniquely different environments for students; together, these institutions provide a variety of options for underrepresented minority (URM) students in majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields to choose a campus where their academic, as well as their psychosocial needs are likely to be met, and they can thrive. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the USM LSAMP is to broaden participation in the STEM disciplines by groups that historically have been underrepresented in STEM.   The following objectives support the 5-year goal of the project: \r\n\r\n-\tTo continue the established momentum in increasing the retention and graduation rates of URM STEM undergraduates; \r\n\r\n-\tTo increase the five-year and six-year graduation rates of URM and other students in STEM fields; \r\n\r\n-\tTo increase the number of URM STEM students who go on to graduate programs in STEM fields; \r\n\r\n-\tTo enhance partnerships with community colleges to facilitate smooth transitions and subsequent academic success for URM STEM and other students transferring to LSAMP institutions; \r\n\r\n-\tTo promote and encourage international education, research, and service experiences for increasing numbers of URM STEM students; and \r\n\r\n-\tTo continue efforts to institutionalize successful components of the USM LSAMP. \r\n\r\nThese objectives will be achieved through the activities of the nine well-developed Alliance components that are based on best practices in the areas of increasing the participation, retention, academic performance, graduation rates, and preparation for success in graduate programs of URM students in STEM fields, and will be supported by NSF and other funding sources. The nine components are:  (1) summer bridge programs; (2) academic year research and grduate school preparation; (3) formal structure for collaborations with the broader community in areas of broadening participation in STEM; (4) curriculum review and revision; (5) community college transfer to 4-year STEM programs; (6)international education, research and service; (7) community of scholars social networking; (8) student tracking into the STEM workforce; and,(8) continued institutionalization and dissemination of best practices in attracting and retaining students in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe project includes a rigorous evaluation plan that will provide both formative and summative data to be used for continuous program improvement. \r\n\r\nThe current state of the global economy has increased the need to support more students through completion of graduate programs so they will be prepared to join efforts to resolve many short-term and long-term problems contributing to our economic crisis (e.g., sources and use of energy and information technology.) The USM LSAMP institutions have built a portion of their reputations on being able to recognize that URM students have been an untapped STEM resource for the U.S.  Putting that recognition into action, the USM LSAMP has cultivated URM STEM students and found that their sharp intellectual abilities, honed leadership skills, and polished professional acumen make these students very valuable assets to the science and engineering labor force. The outcomes of the USM LSAMP will be reported at the EHR/HRD Joint Annual Meeting and disseminated via the alliance websites.  In addition, the management team will seek opportunities to present outcomes to the broader academic community through publications and presentations at professional meetings.",

The USM alliance partners are: The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), The University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) and The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES). Since 1995, the USM LSAMP has received NSF funding in four phases: Phase I (1995 &ndash; 2000), Phase II (2000 &ndash;2005), Phase III (2005 &ndash;2010), and Phase IV (2010 &ndash;2015). At UMBC, the LSAMP students are also known as Meyerhoff Scholars. At College Park, the LSAMP students are part of the Center for Minorities in Science and Engineering, and at UMES, the LSAMP students are part of the STEM Scholars program. The programs are successful because of their attention to factors that include academic and social integration, knowledge and skill development, support and motivation, and monitoring and advising. Segments of the LSAMP program via Meyerhoff have been highlighted by popular media, e.g., &ldquo;60 Minutes,&rdquo; The Charlie Rose Show,&rdquo; and through TED talks. Dr. Freeman Hrabowski, PI of the LSAMP for the USM has contributed to the 2011 National Research Council (NRC) report: \"Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads,\" sharing results from the LSAMP/Meyerhoff scholars program at UMBC. Results were presented at the \"Surmounting the Barriers: Ethnic Diversity in Engineering Education\" workshop on September 26-27, 2013 in Washington, D.C., co-sponsored by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE),with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Each of the LSAMP programs within the USM has individual campus programming to provide students with mentoring, advising, preparation for graduate study, and research skills. In 2015, the USM LSAMP community joined LSAMP programs from schools between Virginia and New York to participate in graduate school preparation conference administered through the National GEM Consortium&rsquo;s GRAD Lab program. More than 250 underrepresented STEM students from UMBC, UMES, UM College Park, UVA, Howard University, and other schools participated. The &nbsp;&nbsp;LSAMP students in Maryland also have opportunities to present research nationally and internationally, are recruited by graduate programs all over the nation. In 2016, students and faculty from the LSAMP programs and UMBC, UMCP, and UMES participated in the Latin and Caribbean Consortium for Engineering Institutions in San Jose, Costa Rica. During the conference, students participated in culturally-relevant global discussions about STEM, presented research to a global audience, and participated in collaborative solution-seeking exercises based on the National Academy of Engineering&rsquo;s Grand Challenges. These are just a few of the activities that have shaped the USM&rsquo;s LSAMP program. Results from evaluations and assessments of student participants and control groups indicate that LSAMP students, by the end of their second year, were more likely than non-LSAMP students to persist in STEM majors. We believe that the LSAMP&rsquo;s funding, mentoring, and the students&rsquo; participation in research-based activities contributes to this result.</span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Between 2010 and 2016, the financial scholarship and on-campus research experiences have been the top two most highly rated LSAMP program components, with over 90% of students rating these components as either &ldquo;Very Useful&rdquo; or &ldquo;Useful.&rdquo; In the most recent year (2016), students also provided high ratings of off-campus research opportunities. Taken together, the LSAMP financial supports as well as opportunities to conduct academic research (both on- and off-campus) are program components that students consistently perceive as most beneficial to their success in college. Over the years students have also consistently reported (about 80% of the time) that they either &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; with the statement, &ldquo;I feel like I belong in the field of science.&rdquo; Additionally, about 60% of students have relayed that they are excited about research and are committed to a research career. Students also reported confidence that they will achieve both their academic and career goals, as demonstrated by the finding that more than 60% of students indicate that they &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; with statements about academic and career confidence since 2010. Furthermore, LSAMP students have consistently indicated that they &ldquo;Strongly Agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agree&rdquo; that their undergraduate research experience helped them to develop new knowledge and skills and their research mentors were accessible and provided encouragement and support. </span><span><br class=\"kix-line-break\" /></span><span><span> </span></span></p>\n<span>The USM LSAMP served 301 students in Phase IV, and acknowledges the support of 41 funding entities that have provided more than $4 Million per year to student programs, allowing the alliance to leverage the NSF LSAMP investment to support a wide range of initiatives for broadening participation in STEM on the three campuses. The USM&rsquo;s LSAMP program looks forward to continuing its tradition of training diverse students for advanced STEM careers.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:

Results were presented at the \"Surmounting the Barriers: Ethnic Diversity in Engineering Education\" workshop on September 26-27, 2013 in Washington, D.C., co-sponsored by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) and the National Academy of Engineering (NAE),with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). \nEach of the LSAMP programs within the USM has individual campus programming to provide students with mentoring, advising, preparation for graduate study, and research skills. In 2015, the USM LSAMP community joined LSAMP programs from schools between Virginia and New York to participate in graduate school preparation conference administered through the National GEM Consortium?s GRAD Lab program. More than 250 underrepresented STEM students from UMBC, UMES, UM College Park, UVA, Howard University, and other schools participated. The   LSAMP students in Maryland also have opportunities to present research nationally and internationally, are recruited by graduate programs all over the nation. In 2016, students and faculty from the LSAMP programs and UMBC, UMCP, and UMES participated in the Latin and Caribbean Consortium for Engineering Institutions in San Jose, Costa Rica. During the conference, students participated in culturally-relevant global discussions about STEM, presented research to a global audience, and participated in collaborative solution-seeking exercises based on the National Academy of Engineering?s Grand Challenges. These are just a few of the activities that have shaped the USM?s LSAMP program. Results from evaluations and assessments of student participants and control groups indicate that LSAMP students, by the end of their second year, were more likely than non-LSAMP students to persist in STEM majors. We believe that the LSAMP?s funding, mentoring, and the students? participation in research-based activities contributes to this result.\nBetween 2010 and 2016, the financial scholarship and on-campus research experiences have been the top two most highly rated LSAMP program components, with over 90% of students rating these components as either \"Very Useful\" or \"Useful.\" In the most recent year (2016), students also provided high ratings of off-campus research opportunities. Taken together, the LSAMP financial supports as well as opportunities to conduct academic research (both on- and off-campus) are program components that students consistently perceive as most beneficial to their success in college. Over the years students have also consistently reported (about 80% of the time) that they either \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree\" with the statement, \"I feel like I belong in the field of science.\" Additionally, about 60% of students have relayed that they are excited about research and are committed to a research career. Students also reported confidence that they will achieve both their academic and career goals, as demonstrated by the finding that more than 60% of students indicate that they \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree\" with statements about academic and career confidence since 2010. Furthermore, LSAMP students have consistently indicated that they \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree\" that their undergraduate research experience helped them to develop new knowledge and skills and their research mentors were accessible and provided encouragement and support.  \nThe USM LSAMP served 301 students in Phase IV, and acknowledges the support of 41 funding entities that have provided more than $4 Million per year to student programs, allowing the alliance to leverage the NSF LSAMP investment to support a wide range of initiatives for broadening participation in STEM on the three campuses. The USM?s LSAMP program looks forward to continuing its tradition of training diverse students for advanced STEM careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Renetta G Tull"
