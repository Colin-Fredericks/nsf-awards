Located at the end of chromosomes, the telomere plays a critical role in cancers and senescence via DNA quadruplex structures that contain four DNA strands.  Identification of novel structures other than quadruplexes is instrumental in understanding the fundamental processes of senescence and genesis of cancer.  Single molecular techniques, such as laser tweezers and atomic force microscopy will be used to reveal the presence of the novel structures, to investigate the interaction of these structures with ligands, and to evaluate the effect of these structures on telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the telomere length.  These methods will be complemented by molecular simulation and conventional bulk assays such as native gel electrophoresis, thermal denaturation, circular dichroism, and surface plasma resonance (SPR).  The results from this three-year project, the broader impacts of which include the training of undergraduate and graduate students, can help to identify new therapeutic targets and agents to fight against diseases such as cancer.",

With no-cost extension to 9/30/2014.\n\n(b)  Title of the project: International Collaboration in Chemistry: Investigation of Novel Telomeric Structures and Their Effects on Human Telomerase.\n\n(c)  Summary of the results of the completed project:\n\nThis international collaboration in chemistry (ICC) award supports research by Prof. Hanbin Mao (US) and Prof. Hiroshi Sugiyama (Japan) to identify and characterize novel structures in the human telomere region.  Located at the end of chromosomes, telomeres can host DNA G-quadruplex structures where G-quartets consisting of four Guanine residues linked by Hoogsteen base pairs are stacked into a complex structure.  Telomeric G-quadruplexes have been proposed to play important roles leading to the senescence and genesis of cancers.  This NSF grant aims to identify novel structures, other than regular G-quadruplexes, that could also be involved in the senescence and cancer genesis.  To do this, highly sensitive single molecular techniques, such as laser tweezers and atomic force microscopy, have been proposed to reveal the presence of the novel structures, to investigate the interaction of these structures with ligands, and to evaluate the effect of these structures on telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the telomere length.\n\nDuring this grant period (2010-2014), we have made the following accomplishments.\n\nWe observed the presence of a new species that is consistent with a G triplex conformation in the human telomeric region.\nWe investigated the binding interaction between a G quadruplex and a ligand in a new laser tweezers platform in which a force jump method was introduced.   \nWe designed a click chemistry approach to investigate the folding and unfolding trajectories of telomeric G-quadruplex under different folding or unfolding trajectories. \nWe measured multi-dimensional distances in a G-quadruplex species to reveal specific 3D conformation of the structure at the single molecular level.\nWe identified different species formed in long DNA telomeric sequences and measured transition kinetics between these species.\nWe found the nascent RNA produced by transcription process can facilitate the formation of DNA G-quadruplex.\n\n\n \n\nDuring this period, we have published 13 peer-reviewed papers as listed below,\n\n1.
