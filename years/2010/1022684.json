 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project focuses on \"fundamental\" research on three distinct aspects of number sense: (1) a small exact number system; (2) a large approximate number system; and (3) a system for set-based quantification. Recent exploratory research suggests a strong linkage between number sense (particularly large numerical approximation systems) and student abilities in other domains of mathematics. The investigators will research the links among these three aspects, and the study is designed to further the preliminary findings (cited above). \r\n\r\nThe investigators propose a correlational study in which they test a population of the indigenous Piraha people of Brazil (a small, isolated, monolingual hunter-gatherer group from the Amazonas) and a sample of  Americans (60 in each group) in a battery of cognitively-oriented tasks which measure different core numerical systems as well as other basic cognitive abilities like short-term memory and face perception (as control tasks). The Piraha are an ideal test case for understanding the relationship among core numerical systems because their language is has no words for numbers. In addition, the Piraha do not use exact number in their society and they do not adopt cultural or linguistic conventions from other cultures. A RAPID is justified because their population is threatened by imminent development. \r\n\r\nThis research is important because a deeper understanding of the conceptual/cognitive components of number sense and how they interrelate can lead to perhaps changed understandings of how students learn and teachers teach this area of mathematics. And, because number sense is so foundational to mathematics and because preliminary research results show its potential importance to future mathematics learning, the project may have a transformative impact on the field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nA fundamental general question regarding numeracy is how it is that children learn to count.  In industrialized countries, it is known that children go through a reliable learning progression: first learning the meaning of \"1\", then the meaning of \"2\", then the meaning of \"3\", and sometimes followed by the meaning of \"4\", but then proceeding to understanding the full recursive count list immediately after this (Wynn, 1992).  Following the terminology in the literature, we refer to the knowledge of the recursive count list as knowledge of the cardinal principle (CP).  Critically, there are stages of learning where children are \"1-knowers\", \"2-knowers\", \"3-knowers\", sometimes \"4-knowers\" and then \"CP-knowers\".  But children never seem to be \"5-knowers\", such that they understand the meanings of the numbers 1-5 but not the meaning of any numbers above 5.  Nor are there ever any 6 or 7-knowers in children's number learning in industrialized countries.  This is a fascinating generalization that has been observed in children learning English, Russian and Japanese.  It remains to be known what properties of the child's mind and the input to the child that make this process work the way that it does.  The better that we understand this process, the better we can help children acquire their numbers earlier, and be better at arithmetic earlier in life.  In order to better understand this process, we studied the progression of number learning in Tsimane' children, a population in a non-industrialized culture, where numeracy information is not particularly valued in the culture.\n\nThe Tsimane\u00c6 live in the tropical rain forest of the Department of Beni, Bolivia.
