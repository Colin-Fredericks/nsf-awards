 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the contributions of viruses to the mortality of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Viral lysis has fundamentally different consequences for how carbon is transferred through the marine food web, but the importance of viral mortality is unknown.  The principal investigators will measure viral mortality on samples at different stages of the spring/summer bloom in the vicinity of Palmer Station, Antarctica. Since all of the available methods have their limitations, a suite of approaches will be employed. The project also will examine whether sea ice acts as a seed bank for viruses that contribute to phytoplankton mortality during the bloom. Fieldwork will be conducted primarily in the vicinity of Palmer Station to allow time series measurements during the course of the bloom. Broader impacts include teacher training workshops, summer research projects, and collaboration with Palmer LTER outreach activities.  The project also will contribute to the training of a postdoctoral fellow,  graduate students, and one or more undergraduate students each year.",
