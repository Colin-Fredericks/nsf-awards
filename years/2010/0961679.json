Sumanto, supervised by Dr. Robert Hefner, will undertake research on interreligious violence, citizenship, and post-conflict peace in the Christian-Muslim conflict zone of Maluku, Eastern Indonesia. The project proposes to investigate first, factors underlying interreligious violence, and, second, factors shaping the post-conflict truce and efforts to rebuild an operative structure and public culture for multi-religious citizenship in the region. More specifically, the project aims to examine the role of religious networks, organizations, discourses, and practices before, during, and after the violence, investigating which social resources aggravated local tensions, and, conversely, which contributed or is contributing to the creation of a public culture capable of mediating ethnic and religious divisions. The central focus of the project, then, is to explore the dynamics of Maluku's religious groups and civic organizations in responding to violence and the post-conflict truce, and to examine the implications of religious networks, associations, and discourses for the peace and for local understandings and practices of national citizenship. The research will utilize (1) ethnographic fieldwork, (2) network and associational analysis, and (3) the study of historical and textual materials. \r\n\r\nThis project is important because it will contribute, first, to social science theories of violence, conflict resolution, citizenship, and peacemaking in multi-religious societies. Second, the project will contribute to the growing body of theory and research on the role of religion in deeply divided societies. More generally, this project will also be of direct relevance to the study of violence and reconciliation in those parts of the world that have suffered the ravages of mass violence.",

Moluccan islands (also known the Moluccas or Maluku) are the home for Muslims, Protestants, and Catholics who had once been living in relatively peaceful coexistence for centuries. In 1999, however, the islands turned out otherwise.  Beginning on January 19, 1999 and lasting for a period of more than four years, violent conflicts between local Christians and Muslims broke out on the islands. Against this backdrop, this project proposed to investigate factors underlying the interreligious conflict and violence as well as those shaping the post-conflict truce and citizenship on the Maluku conflict zone.\n\nBased on my research and fieldwork I conducted on Ambon Island in the Moluccas from 2010 to 2011, I found some interesting research findings that need for further examination, as follows:\n\nFirst, unlike common existing scholarships on the social history of Maluku\u00c6s Christian-Muslim relation which portray \"peaceful relations\" between them before the communal conflict broke out on the region (1999-2004), I found that the relations between Christians and Muslims were marked by conflict, competition, and violence since the time of Portuguese colonial era in the sixteenth century until the end of the Dutch colonialism and Japanese occupation in the area. \n\nSecond, the Maluku conflicts from 1999-2004 were not \"homogenous\", but varied, in terms of root causes, actors, motives, interests, and so forth. The acts of violence furthermore occurred in various episodes or stages ranging from religiously motivated riots to the violent conflicts driven by issues of separatism and terrorism.\n\nThird, Maluku\u00c6s local actors were very significant in their role during the conflict. This finding is vital to underline because most analyses on the Maluku conflict emphasize the central role of Jakarta-based military and civilian elites as the \"active actors\" while at the same time portray Maluku\u00c6s people as the victims of the wars. Looking at more deeply to the dynamics of the Maluku conflict, however, one will notice that \"local actors\" played significant role during the wars.
