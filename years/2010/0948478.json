 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical parameter governing the style and vigor of volcanic eruptions is the rate at which magma ascends and degases from the storage region to the surface. The magma ascent rate, in turn, controls the time available for loss of volatile species from the magma, melts and crystals. This project aims to assess directly the volatile loss from magmas over timescales of minutes to months, as measured in volcanic crystals and glass, and from this provide estimates of magma ascent rates critical to a quantitative understanding eruptive processes.  The focus here is on explosive, basaltic to basaltic andesite eruptions, for which very little is yet known about the magma ascent and degassing processes leading to eruption.  The approach is motivated by new developments in analytical techniques that enable measurement of volatile species (including water and carbon dioxide) at fine spatial resolution. \r\n\r\nThree different kinds of measurements will interrogate volcanic systems at different timescales: 1)  volatile concentration profiles in melt embayments within crystals (by nanoSIMS ionmicroprobe), which may reflect diffusive re-equilibration with the exterior, degassing magma over the timescale of minutes (water) to hours (sulfur). 2)  water contents within nominally anhydrous phenocrysts, which may preserve diffusive exchange over the timescale of hours (olivine) to months (clinopyroxene). 3) volatile contents in olivine-hosted melt inclusions, which may reflect timescales and processes intermediate between those that affect melt embayments and crystals, above. \r\n\r\nWell-studied Central American volcanoes (Cerro Negro, Irazu, Arenal) will enable comparisons of volatile loss and ascent rates for different eruptive styles.  The project has implications for the understanding of volcanic hazards associated with explosive volcanism, will support the training and development of two graduate students, and provide lecture and seminar material for a course at Columbia University (Frontiers of Science) that engages 500 freshmen each year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA critical parameter governing the style and intensity of volcanic eruptions is the rate at which magma ascends from the storage region to the surface. The decompression of ascending melts drives the exsolution of dissolved volatile components into a separate vapor phase, which increases the buoyancy of the magma and creates a driving force for further ascent and eruption. The interaction of the rate of ascent with the kinetics of bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence is also an important factor controlling the development of permeability in magmas and therefore how magmas degas and ultimately erupt. Although several factors and feedbacks may affect the style in which magmas erupt, knowledge of the magma ascent rate is essential for a full understanding of the magmatic processes preceding an eruption. However, despite the importance of ascent rate to eruption dynamics it is a parameter that has proved difficult to determine with current estimates limited to a few well-documented eruptions.\n\nMany approaches have been employed to quantify magma ascent rates; in this study we pursue an approach in which we make use of the preservation of volatile element zonation in melt embayments, intrusions of melt into crystals that maintain a physical and chemical connection to the surrounding melt, which loses volatiles during gas bubble formation during magma ascent.  We then apply time-dependent diffusion models to obtain the duration of magma ascent, with the depth of eruption initiation determined by analysis of co-existing fully-enclosed melt inclusions, which have been prevented from degassing. Our study focuses on hydrous mafic arc volcanism, for which little previous work exists, specifically the 1974 eruption of Volcan de Fuego in Guatemala.\n\nThe implementation of the NanoSIMS ion microprobe to multi-volatile diffusion in open melt embayments has offered additional constraints in assessing decompression rate unavailable to previous workers . We observed that H2O, CO2, and S decrease in concentration towards the external magma (in order of decreasing diffusive loss), while Cl and F vary little in concentration throughout the embayment. These observations are consistent with expectations based on volatile solubility and diffusion experiments. This method resulted in overall decompression rates ranging from 0.32 to 0.47 MPa/s (8.0 &ndash; 21 m/s). It is likely the magma ascent followed two stages of decompression from its initial storage depth: an initial slow stage followed by a faster second stage, consistent with theoretical ascent models.  Within the context of the October 17 1974 eruption at Fuego, the ascent rates calculated in this study compare favorably to estimates based on mass eruption rate and melt inclusion re-equilibration theory. In comparison to previous embayment studies, the constant decompression results fall within a fairly limited range that is consistent with the explosivity of this subplinian eruption. These results should encourage the further use of embayments to constrain magma ascent dynamics for a wider range of magma types and eruptive styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erik H Hauri"
