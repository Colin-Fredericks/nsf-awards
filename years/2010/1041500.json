This award also supports two new initiatives in the summer program: a research component in the instruction, and a program for women students that will allow eight young women to represent the United States in a prestigious international mathematics competition.\r\n\r\nThe United States has sent a team to the International Mathematics Olympiad each year since 1974. A founding objective for this global competition is to establish a foundation for future scientific collaboration between promosing students who will form the new generation of researchers in mathematics. The International Mathematics Olympiad is widely regarded as a pinnacle achievement for young mathematicians.",

This training camp has historically provided\nhigh-level enrichment and guidance to these potential future leaders, and\nit is structured as an intensive 3-week training camp in which students\nengage in mathematical activities from day to night.\n\nThis award supported two new initiatives which leverage the existing\nOlympiad infrastructure.  The first used the new female-targeted editions\nof the IMO (the China Girls' Math Olympiad, a multinational competition\norganized by China, and the European Girls' Math Olympiad) as context to\nsubstantially increase the participation of women at the highest levels of\nthe United States Olympiad program.  Over the grant period, 10 girls were\ninvited to the Math Olympiad Summer Program each year, where they developed\ntheir mathematical breadth and depth, and built a strong network.  The\ninternational events further expanded their network to global-scale.\n\nThe second initiative added a research dimension to MOSP by taking\nadvantage of its pool of faculty and alumni, many of whom have moved into\nprofessional research careers.  The MOSP staff roster includes\nrepresentatives from every career stage, from first-year undergraduate to\ntenured professor.  This award effectively broadened the scope of the\nprogram, as instructors made efforts to link instruction with research, and\nto incubate interdisciplinary collaborations within the MOSP faculty\nitself.  An evening seminar was introduced into the MOSP routine, running\nfrom 7-8pm on alternate nights.  The speakers were MOSP instructional staff\nwho had gone on to graduate school and beyond.  The mission was to convey\nthe spirit of each speaker's current area of investigation, in terms which\nwere comprehensible to the high-school students.\n\nThe highlight was a new system, which was piloted for a segment of the\ninstructional staff, loosely based on the successful model of the modern\nresearch university.  In this new approach, the PI and other senior\ninstructional staff had the explicit objective of mentoring the junior\nstaff on research projects, in addition to teaching courses to the\nhigh-school students.  Many of the research collaborations were\nintentionally conducted in public (over a wide variety of hours), in a\nlarge common lounge where students typically congregated to relax.  This\ninspired numerous inquiries from the students, who then learned not only\nabout the problems at hand, but also about the research process.\n\nEach summer had an average of 4 research collaborations involving\nundergraduates, spanning topics as diverse as representation theory,\ncombinatorics, economics, and theoretical computer science.  Many of them\nproduced substantial progress.  In two cases, the results reached the level\nof mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals or conferences, and those\ntwo papers have been accepted for publication.
