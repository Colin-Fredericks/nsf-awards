 "awd_abstract_narration": "The TAIGER (Taiwan Integrated Geodynamics Research) project is a joint USA-Taiwan program that seeks to model the complex collision processes and the tectonic development of Taiwan, based on extensive observation.  Funded by the NSF Continental Dynamics Program and by Taiwan's National Science Council and involving investigators at SUNY/Binghamton, UTIG, USC, Cornell, and Wisconsin, this project  has acquired more than twice as much data as originally proposed due to synergistic contributions by Taiwan scientists and Taiwanese government science funding.  From FY2006-2009, deployments of seismic instruments on land (IRIS) and at ocean-bottom (OBSIP) maximized the recording of local events and teleseisms, as well as artificial sources specially set off for TAIGER, in order to obtain high resolution 3-D images.  To map the areas around Taiwan the PIs were able to use the NSF-supported research ship, the R/V Langseth, to create seismic waves that were recorded by a 6-km long streamer and also ocean-bottom and land recorders.  These seismic and magnetotelluric profiles as well as petrologic lab data are currently being analyzed. TAIGER project data combined with geodynamics methods will be used to test a set of existing tectonic models that range from a thin skinned model, in which subduction of continental Eurasian mantle and lower crust is separated from a deforming crustal wedge by a plate boundary decollement, from a thick skinned model, where deformation of crust and mantle occurs within a vertically contiguous system, with progressive thickening of continental mantle beneath the core of the mountain belt.\r\n\r\nThe current project (TAIGER?s TALE), will expand on thier initial studies to carry out in-depth and advanced studies using the extensive TAIGER data volumes (no new data will be acquired). This work will lead to  significant advances in understanding deformational processes associated with the evolution of Taiwan due to plate collision. Studies will focus primarily on seismological analyses to obtain physical properties and rheological indicators as well as the integrative ties with geodynamical modeling efforts. The over-arching strategy is to take advantage of the unique aspects of the acquired data sets, the tectonic environment, and the diverse and complementary participating/collaborating personnel. They will perform their analyses of various data sets in such a way that higher frequency/higher resolution results are nested in the context of broader scale results. They will make extensive use of ?crossover? seismological data sets recorded during TAIGER (active sources collected by passive-source arrays, and earthquakes collected in active-source arrays).  Also, analysis/interpretation of these data will be closely tied to geodynamic modeling.",

The Taiwan orogeny is young (~2-3 m.y.) and ongoing, thus observations of geodetic changes at the surface and earthquakes at depth are the &ldquo;instantaneous&rdquo; response of the Earth to the stresses. The subsurface seismic velocity and electrical resistivity structures record the cumulative effects of orogeny on a longer time scale. Geological (surface petrology and rock structures) and geochemical evidence provide time varying (from dating rocks) glances of the past. In TAIGER TALE we attempt to integrate TAIGER and all available datasets, new and old, to weave a &ldquo;falsifiable&rdquo; story &ndash; not usually a very easy task in geoscience, but because of Taiwan young and active, in some cases we can test hypotheses against observations.</p>\n<p>A general review was published by invitation in the Journal of Asian Earth Science (Wu et al., 2014) and more analyses have since been carried out. An update is being planned.</p>\n<p>Reconstruction of plate tectonic history of Taiwan requires an east-dipping EUP subducting east of present day location. The west-moving PSP continued to thrust over EUP and PSP eventually met the EUP and the collision began. Three images from a numerical 2-D simulation of this process by Luc Lavier, a member of the TAIGER team at UT Austin, is shown as a movie in the accompanying figure file. This model does describe well the main sequence of events leading to the collision and the structures across central Taiwan. But northern and southern Taiwan orogeny is more 3-D; some key observations and ideas are outlined below.</p>\n<p>As a prerequisite to understand the Taiwan collision we first mapped the plate tectonic structures using TAIGER results. Figure 2a shows the location of Taiwan, the mountainous topography and the plate boundaries. The current plate configuration is based on seismicity, velocity tomography and TAIGER marine seismics (for Manila Trench near Taiwan). Figure 2b shows a 3-D rendition of the plate structures. Notice PSP subducts under northern Taiwan and active EUP subduction extends from the Bashi Strait, between Taiwan and the Philippines to about 22.7 N. The plate structures and the relative motion between EUP and PSP imply that there are three segments in Taiwan. Their main characteristics are as follows:</p>\n<p>a) Northern Taiwan is dominated by the northward subducting with PSP moving westward. No trace is seen here of the volcanic Luzon arc, whether on the surface, in the basin offshore or attached to the subduction slab (in terms of a large low velocity anomaly.) Because PSP is subducting while colliding with EUP the collision occurs at greater depth toward the north. Near the bend of PSP subduction the width of the mountain belt, including the Hsueshan Range and the Central Range, is at its widest (Figure 2a). In NS-oriented profiles we see significant thickening of crust where &nbsp;(Figure 3.) Under the Hsueshan Range the crust-mantle boundary deepens to the east and under the Central Range however, a root has formed under the Central Range, with a very steep rise on the east.</p>\n<p>b) Central Taiwan can be viewed as a &ldquo;typical&rdquo; collision. In this section the Luzon Arc complex, at the front of the PSP plate, has already been compressed to become the eastern Taiwan Coastal Range. It is composed entirely of the volcanic arc and trench deposits. The arc itself marks the edge of the PSP but it is the massive PSP itself that collides with EUP. The engagement of PSP with EUP created the Central Range and the subsurface mountain root. A high velocity rise on the east side of the Central Range underlies the Yuli high pressure/low temperature metamorphic belt with accompanying normal faulting (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>c) The southern tip of Taiwan is traditionally viewed as the point at which collision is just beginning. But as shown in Figure 1a that the arc (or the edge of the oceanic PSP has not engaged the SE Chinese continental shelf. Here the mountains south of 23.7 N were built over an active (eastward-dipping) subduction zone &ndash; the collision between PSP and EUP is yet to begin. How were the mountains built in this segment is one of the topics that will lead to further hypotheses of orogeny.</p>\n<p>Using falsification to sort out hypotheses is generally not easy in geosciences. However, since most of the current hypotheses are founded mainly on surficial observations and structures and processes at depth are implied or explicitly deduced empirical observations of the young and active orogen gathered by TAIGER can be used for the purpose.
