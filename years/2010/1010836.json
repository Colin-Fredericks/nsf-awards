This workshop will bring together 15 dissertation-stage doctoral students from diverse information and informatics subfields for one day of presentations, interaction, and feedback with 5 faculty members selected from among distinguished information researchers. The iConference Doctoral Research Colloquium is designed to assist doctoral students to become stewards of the information and informatics disciplines, by providing an opportunity for interaction with distinguished research faculty and for the development of a global cohort of new researchers. This award provides support for the travel, lodging and registration of students, plus one night lodging for the participating faculty mentors, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the Doctoral Colloquium at the meeting.",
