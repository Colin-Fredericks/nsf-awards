  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch completed in China, 2010\n\n \n\n1.  Synthesis of the magnetic, iron oxide, \"core\" nanoparticles:\n\nThe iron oxide core nanoparticles were created first by producing an iron oleate starting material according to the following chemical equation:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppropriate amounts of this iron oleate starting matereial was added to oleic acid and disolved in octadecene.  This mixture was thermally decomposed under inert conditions, with stirring, and allowed to react under reflux for 30 minutes.  The particles can be precipitated using ethanol.\n\n \n\nTEM images show the successful synthesis of ~8nm iron oxide \"core\" nanoparticles:\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.  TEM image of OA-capped, Iron oxide \"core\" nanoparticles\n\n \n\nXRD data for the above sample confirms its composition and indicates the formation of magnetite (Fe3O4):\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.  X-ray powder diffraction spectrum of iron oxide \"core\" nanoparticles\n\n \n\n \n\n2.  Synthesis of upconverting magnetic nanoparticles:\n\nThe coated particles were created by slowly injecting appropriate types and amounts of lanthanide and sodium Trifluoroacetic acid compounds dissolved in oleic acid and octadecene into a hot mixture of iron oxide core particles under inert conditions.  Following addition of these shell precursors (via slow, hot injection), the mixture was allowed to react under N2 at 320 oC for 1hr.  Particles can be precipitated and washed with ethanol.\n\n \n\nTEM, below, shows the iron oxide nanoparticles coated with the lanthanide containing, upconverting shell:\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.  TEM image of upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles \n\n \n\n \n\nXRD data confirms the identity of the of the shell as NaGdF4; Yb,Er:\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.  XRD pattern of coated, magnetic nanoparticles \n\n \n\n \n\nUpconversion of particles was observed by exciting the above sample with a 980nm laser.  Green light was visible by the naked eye:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.  visible green emission of OA-capped NaGdF4; Yb, Er coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles using 980nm laser excitation source\n\n \n\nThe visible emission spectrum (upon IR excitation) for the above sample was also recorded:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.  Fluorescence spectrum of upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles upon 980nm laser excitation\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMagnetic activity was observed by placing samples in the presence of a magnetic field:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.  OA-capped upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles (brown ppt) in ethanol under the influence of a magnetic field\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.  Silica coating / amine functionalization of upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles:\n\nTwo different methods were attempted for the purpose of coating the above synthesized particles with silica.  Both showed success at this purpose, but both methods also created a significant amount of pure silica particles:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.  Amine functionalized, silica coated upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles using 2 different coating methods\n\n \n\nThe \"Brije\" method involves adding the upconverting, magnetic nanoparticles to concentrated cyclohexane/Brije 56 solution.  Ammonia and water are then added to form the microemulsion; TEOS and APTS are added and used as sources of silica and amine respectively.  The solution is allowed to react at 50oC for 4hr. \n\n \n\nThe \"CO-520\" method is similar to the \"Brije\" method save for a few important details.  In the \"CO-520\" method, the nanoparticles to be coated are added to a dilute cyclohexane/CO-520 solution.  Ammonia and water are also added to form the microemulsion; TEOS and APTS are still added and used as sources of silica and amine respectively.  In this case however, the solution is allowed to react at room temperature for 48 hr.\n\n \n\nThe \"Brije\" method produces similar results to the \"CO-520\" method, and has the advantage of being considerably more efficient &ndash; taking about 10x less time.  This was found to be the preferred method.\n\n \n\nIsolating only the silica coated, upconverting, magnetic particles is the main challenge at this point.  Because the nanoparticles synthesized her..."
