We established three different rural-to-urban gradients on three different latitude lines, including the following cities: 1) Matsumoto, Maebashi, Kumagaya, Utsunomiya, Mito; 2) Iida, Kofu, Choshi, Yokohama, Tokyo; 3) Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Tateyama, Oshima.

Dragonflies are also valued for their links to the satoyama, a traditional Japanese agricultural landscape composed of many different semi-natural habitats, which include ponds and other small waterways, secondary forests and grasslands as well as rice paddy fields.
