The collaborating investigators and their students will study the mechanism of reductive transformations of highly oxidized contaminants on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles. The study will make use for the first time of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) for the analysis of vitrified iron oxide nanoparticles. Results are expected to lead to vastly improved predictions of contaminant fate in both natural and engineered nanoparticle systems. The study will provide excellent opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota to work on a cutting edge research project in environmental chemical sciences.",

Of particular importance is the relationship between reactive surface area and aggregation state.\n\n \n\nRates of organic contaminant degradation were quantified and solid materials characterized using advanced materials characterization methods.  A particularly novel aspect of the proposed work was direct imaging of the particles in the reaction media by way of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM).  This technique enabled quantitative evaluation of aggregation state and semi-quantitative assessment of in situ accessible surface area.\n\n \n\nGenerally speaking, an increase in aggregation is generally associated with a decrease in redox reaction rates.  However, when species that inhibit aggregation but block reactive surface sites are present, reactivity is also inhibited.
