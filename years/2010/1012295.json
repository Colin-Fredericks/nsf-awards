 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry supports the work of Professor Gregory R. Cook at North Dakota State University to develop new synthetic methods for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines and alcohols. In particular the project will investigate novel enantioselective allylation reactions of carbon-nitrogen and carbon-oxygen double bonds mediated by the environmentally friendly metals indium and bismuth. Enantioselective catalytic allylation is a highly desired route for the preparation of chiral building blocks that can be utilized in the preparation of biologically active small molecule pharmaceuticals and tools for biological sciences. This project will develop highly catalytic enantioselective allylation of ketimines mediated by indium. Additionally, allylation of ketones mediated by bismuth metal in the presence of chiral bismuth catalysts will be developed. The purported asymmetric catalysts for both of these processes will be isolated and characterized to provide insight for future directions for the generation of environmentally benign asymmetric methods.\r\n\r\n\tSelective chemical reactions that can be accomplished with minimal waste using non-toxic catalysts and reagents will allow for new greener chemical processes for future environmentally sustainable technologies. This project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the chemical sciences. In particular, undergraduate students early in their college careers (freshmen and sophomores) will benefit from this research experience. Statistics show that students engaged earlier in their college experience have a higher probability of continuing on to a career in science. This project will directly aid the goals of NSF and the Country to increase human resources in sciences.",
