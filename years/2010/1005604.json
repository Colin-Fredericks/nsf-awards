In addition to the student presentations there are scheduled pre-conference workshops, key note speakers, and informal gatherings for networking between students and established scholars. The students from the University of Alaska will benefit greatly from these professional interactions and will contribute substantially to the content of the conference as developing northern scholars from a key institution that supports northern research.",
