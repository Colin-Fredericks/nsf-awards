 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study considers efficiency from the perspective of repeated strategic interaction.  Namely, the study considers several types of games that are simplified representations of more complex real world situations in which interaction occurs at multiple periods over an arbitrarily long time horizon. The researcher will examine how augmentation of the payoff structure in these games can provide incentives for agents to tacitly collude at a more efficient outcome over repeated play.  The issues raised herein are important not only from a mechanism design standpoint, but also have applications in repeated oligopoly interaction.  Primarily, we are concerned with how the relative magnitudes of payoffs may make a particular outcome more attractive for agents to coordinate upon in comparison to other outcomes, which may be socially inferior.\r\nFor each type of strategic situation studied, we assess the relative and absolute efficiencies of experimental subject pairs in terms of average per period payoffs to see whether or not agents can effectively coordinate to extract as high a payoff as possible given the constraints of the game.  Knowledge of how to induce such efficiencies is important to both policy makers, who may determine the strategic parameters of a game, and to agents confined to a particular set of strategic parameters.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Description:\n\nThe project relied on data collection from a series of laboratory experiments using human subjects.  Subjects engaged in playing simultaneous games against one another across a network of computers in the laboratory for an indeterminate number of rounds, simulating an infinite horizon problem.  Subjects were provided a monetary incentive tied to their performance in these games and were remunerated at the end of the experimental trials accordingly.\n\nData related to the subjects' performance was collected along with some survey data related to the subjects' expectations of game length, given the uncertainty to establish whether or not subjects' believed the randomization device used to terminate game play to be credible.  Ultimately, the goal was to relate the efficiency properties (players' collective ability to maximize payoffs) of the payoff structure to subject's beliefs about the probability of game continuation (subjective patience).\n\nThe experiment also examined the role of threshold inefficiency in infinitely repeated prisoners' dilemma games when the payoffs from deviation are sufficiently high, so that it is optimal for players to take turns deviating against one another.\n\nLastly, the experiment considered the role of asymmetries in the payoff structures and how these asymmetries contributed to inefficiencies related to coordination failure.\n\n \n\nResults:\n\n First, the experiment generated data consistent with the hypothesis:  players that tended to understate the probability of game continuation (were less patient than should have been implied by the public randomization device) in the exit survey tended to perform worse on average, despite the number of actual draws (games) the players received (played).  Likewise, players that tended to overstate the probability of game continuation (were more patient...) typically scored above average payoffs, independent of the number of actual draws.  The results were strengthened when looking at joint payoffs when each of these types was matched up against the respective same type.  However, when type matching differed (a patient player is matched with an impatient player), average payoffs were difficult to relate to beliefs of randomization.\n\n Second, this experiment confirms that in non-cooperative games with a static Nash equilibrium that is Pareto inferior to a 'cooperative focal point' (that maximizes joint payoff in the STATIC game), the closer the focal point lies to the boundary of the implied profit frontier in payoff space, the more likely the focal point is to be played in a dynamic setting, despite the fact that alternating between deviation strategies yields higher average per period payoffs (but may be more risky).\n\n Lastly, an analysis of several parameterizations of the prisoners' dilemma and the battle of the sexes game were analyzed to look at how asymmetries in the payoff structures affected players' abilities to coordinate on a joint profit maximizing strategy.  So far, the results are consistent with the literature in that asymmetries, in general, break down collusive arrangements between players and tend to exacerbate coordination failure.  However, this effect was more severe in non-cooperative games than in cooperative coordination games.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven B Levkoff"
