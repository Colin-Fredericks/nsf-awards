 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes plans for the Thirteenth Meeting of New\r\nResearchers in Statistics and Probability to be held in the campus of\r\nBritish Columbia, Vancouver, during July 27--July 30, 2010. Housing, meals,\r\nand conference facilities will be provided on campus. This conference\r\nseries is organized by and held for junior researchers. The primary objective\r\nis to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers.\r\n In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted\r\n in size, with a target of 85-90 participants.  Sessions will be followed\r\n by panel discussions  and breaks to facilitate interactions.\r\n Participants will be statisticians and probabilist who have\r\nreceived their Ph.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive\r\ntheir degree within the next year.  Each participant will present a\r\ntalk or poster.  Topics will range across a variety of areas in statistical\r\nresearch from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will\r\n discuss topics of particular interest to new researchers.\r\nPanel discussions during the conference will cover the topics of journal\r\npublications, opportunities in statistics laboratories and industry,\r\nfunding, mentoring, and teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is based on its human resource\r\ndevelopment. The professional development of new researchers is\r\nstimulated by promoting their interaction, creating networks of\r\ncolleagues (which is usually difficult at a large meeting, such as\r\nthe Joint Statistical Meeting). Participants present their work\r\nin a smaller, more controlled conference environment, maximizing\r\ntheir intellectual interaction and growth. The primary goals of the\r\nconference are professional education of new researchers and to help\r\ncreate a network among these junior researchers, both are vital parts\r\nof professional growth.  Women, minorities, and the disabled are\r\nexplicitly encouraged to attend, and we have an established track\r\nrecord of attracting participants from these categories.\r\n",
