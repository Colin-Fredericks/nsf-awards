 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of dental and skeletal tissue microanatomy in a known population of African apes from the wild, Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), Rwanda, with an emphasis on testing relationships between hard tissue development and specific environmental and life history factors.  Using radiographic and histologic techniques, specific aims include : (1) generating primary data on dental and skeletal growth and development in mountain gorillas, establishing an important comparative foundation on great ape development in the wild, and test hypotheses concerning the influence of socioecological factors on variability in great ape life histories; (2) determining the presence and chronology of microanatomical features in hard tissues that record incidence of developmental stress (i.e., accentuated enamel striae; lines of arrested growth in bone); and (3) comparing these chronologies against climatic, behavioral and veterinary records to determine the manner in which environmental factors and characteristics of individual life histories (e.g., weaning, social status, disease, human disturbance) impact the growth of hard tissues and are recorded in their developing microanatomy.  Given availability of associated life records, hard tissue research on Virunga mountain gorillas can contribute significant and unique insight into the biology and health of these critically-endangered great apes, and establish a framework based on the combined study of dental and skeletal tissues in well-documented natural populations that has significant transformative potential for the study of life history evolution from fossils.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include new international collaborations that foster integration among scientific disciplines; creation of a digital archive of tooth and bone radiographic and microscopy images, available to Rwandan and US students and scientists; and research and training opportunities for US undergraduate and graduate students.  Finally, support for a research assistant and additional training opportunities in Rwanda will build local expertise and capacity to ensure the long-term sustainability of mountain gorilla skeletal preservation and research efforts, and broaden participation of under-represented groups in science.",
