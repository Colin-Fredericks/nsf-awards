 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel programming is notoriously difficult, but essential to the future of computing.  Much of the difficulty stems from the need to guarantee, in advance, that parallel computations will not conflict with one another.\r\nSpeculation provides an attractive alternative.  By monitoring behavior at run time, and retrying computations that conflict, speculation can expose significant amounts of otherwise unexploitable parallelism, while imposing little or no conceptual burden on the programmer.\r\n\r\nThe sponsored research aims to make thread- and process-level speculation a fundamental feature of future programming systems, and to employ it in multiple forms and for multiple purposes: to automatically or semi-automatically parallelize sequential applications; to check, dynamically, the independence of explicitly parallel computations; to isolate the execution of semantically atomic functions; to enable optimizations that are not always safe; to parallelize scripting languages with one-thread-at-a-time semantics; and to profile applications in parallel, for feedback-driven optimization.\r\n\r\nThe project adopts a tiered approach that isolates the users of simpler programming idioms from the need to understand more complex alternatives.\r\nAt the implementation level, it stresses the seamless integration of shared memory and cluster-level distribution, compiler- and binary translator-based software instrumentation, virtual memory, and hardware speculation/transactions where available.  Latter phases of the project place major emphasis on profiling tools to identify potentially independent program regions, which can then safely be executed in parallel (via speculation) in future runs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn computer software, as in the physical world, tasks can execute safely in parallel only if they are mutually independent -- that is, if they do not interfere with one another.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult to tell in advance whether two tasks are truly independent.  Conservative strategies that permit parallelism only when it is known to be safe miss many opportunities to improve computer performance.\n\nSpeculation, in parallel computing, is the strategy of executing tasks in parallel in the hope that they will prove to be independent, while preparing to \"back out\" and retry sequentially if conflicts are encountered.  Work under this grant has demonstrated the value of several different speculative strategies, embodying several different tradeoffs between ease of programming and potential performance improvement.\n\n  - In nonblocking concurrent data structures, carefully crafted algorithms employ hand-orchestrated speculation for maximum performance and fault tolerance.\n\n  - At the opposite extreme, Behavior-Oriented Parallelism (BOP) allows the programmer to provide \"this might be parallel\" hints; these are then used to drive speculation while maintaining the observable behavior of traditional sequential programs.\n\n  - In speculation-based automatic parallelization, a specially designed compiler identifies code regions in a sequential program that are most likely to benefit from parallel execution, and inserts BOP hints automatically.\n\n  - In transactional memory (TM), explicitly parallel programs specify operations that must appear to occur one at a time; automatic speculation arranges to execute such operations in parallel whenever possible.
