 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil charcoal has been shown to play a key role in the dynamics of nutrients in soils [e.g. Liang et al., 2006], but our understanding of the effects of charcoal on soil physical and chemical properties is quite limited.  Particularly absent are both data and a conceptual framework to explain observed charcoal alteration of soil hydrologic properties.  Understanding the effects of charcoal on soil is increasingly important because humans are changing soil charcoal content both unintentionally and intentionally, the first driven by fire management practices and land use change, and the second by intentional amendment of soil with charcoal to improve crop performance and sequester carbon. \r\n  \tWe hypothesize that charcoal affects soil hydrologic properties through alteration of soil grain size, charge density, and hydrophobicity.  We predict that grain size will change mechanical interactions (e.g., pore size, tortuosity), while charge density will change physico-chemical interactions which impact strength, soil water potential, and flow pathways.  Hydrophobicity is a function of both surface chemistry and surface area (controlled partly by grain size and porosity), and will respond with changes in these properties.  Charcoal grain size decreases and surface charge density increases with in situ weathering so the impacts will be vary significantly with time as charcoal is incorporated into the soil clay fraction, which itself can be altered by the release of inorganic materials during charcoal weathering.\r\n\tWe are conducting a series of experiments designed to determine the mechanisms through which charcoal affects hydrologically-relevant physical and chemical properties of soils.  We are performing experiments with natural and laboratory soils mixed with charcoal, measuring (1) soil hydrophobicity, (2) surface and bulk chemistry of soils and charcoals, (3) saturated permeability, (4) soil water potential, and (5) soil tensile strength.  Our ultimate goal is to develop a conceptual model of the soil-charcoal-water system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCharcoal is a natural component of almost all soils, and when it is present in high concentrations it provides important benefits, increasing soils' ability to store water, and sometimes changing soil texture and soil biology in ways that are helpful for both agricultural and natural ecosystems.  Prior to this grant, little was understood about the physical mechanisms that allowed charcoal to provide helpful ecosystem services like soil water storage and soil carbon storage. Even without this information, many businesses and environmental groups were going forward with soil charcoal amendment (called biochar when made commercially and sustainably for intentional soil use).  Businesses, farmers, and environmentalists hope that biochar will improve soil performance and sequester carbon.\n\nPrior to the work done in this grant, very large variations had been observed in soil hydrological properties when charcoal was added, with sometimes opposite results occurring in different soils, or with different charcoals.  The focus of this grant was the development of generalizable models to help better understand how charcoal acts to change soil properties, especially properties associated with water and carbon.\n\nThis research project focused on charcoal physical properties.  We were particularly interested in soil hydraulic conductivity (a measure of the rate at which water drains through soils), because this property plays such an important role in retaining water in soil in environments prone to drought, and conversely in removing water from landscapes prone to flooding.  We showed that charcoal amendment can both increase and decrease soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, with the direction of change dependent on the amending soil, the size of the charcoal particles, and the internal porosity of the charcoal particles.  Separately we characterized how charcoal internal porosity varies with production conditions (biomass source and pyrolysis temperature).  These results suggest that it will be possible for businesses to produce biochar in particle sizes and porosities targeted for specific needs, like helping farms survive drought and helping urban environments reduce flooding.\n\nTwo other physical properties that we studied were charcoal density and porosity, because the density and porosity of charcoal are key controllers of its landscape and hydrologic behavior. Density is important because materials with densities less than 1 g/cm3 are prone to floating and may be lost from soils to rivers after heavy rainfall.  Porosity (the percent of a sample\u00c6s volume that is open space) is important because charcoal's internal pores create space for water and microbes, and can sometimes act to divert and/or slow water flow through soils.  We showed that charcoals made from wood have porosities ranging from 55-85% (Brewer et al., 2014), and that charcoal density varies widely.\n\nIn this grant we accomplished the following:\n\n1.
