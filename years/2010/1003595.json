 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would combine a force-balanced magnetic field model of Earth's magnetosphere and magnetotail with the analysis of data from the THEMIS and Cluster spacecraft.  The goal is to investigate the configuration of the inner magnetosphere during the growth phase of a magnetospheric substorm.  The project will provide a new capability to accurately map magnetic field lines between the ionosphere and the magnetotail.  It is important to accurately map the magnetic field configuration because plasma is free to stream along magnetic field lines without experiencing a force from the magnetic field.  The project is a collaborative effort between scientists at the University of California-Los Angeles and Los Alamos National Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop a statistical model of the magnetic field configurations parameterized by the cross-polar cap electric potential.  This parameterized model will be made available to the space science community and is expected to of use in many areas of magnetospheric physics research.  A significant portion of the research will be conducted by a graduate student.",
