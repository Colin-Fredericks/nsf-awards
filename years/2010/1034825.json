 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, the current situation in Haiti provides an important opportunity to perform a feasibility study of the potential for mobile communications to enhance coordination between stakeholders both during and after the crisis.  It is essential to conduct time sensitive research on the role of telecommunications in the Haitian disaster relief effort.  The research team combines technical expertise with effective ground-level liaison through higher education and community association networks in Haiti.  The goals are to (1) Assess network accessibility during and after the crisis; (2) Assess the level of interagency coordination; (3) Assess current use of mobile communication technology.  The research questions address some of the principal considerations in the implementation of next generation coordination and response systems.  This study is intended to provide a foundation for future research including the creation of collaborative tools, training approaches, and simulation materials for respondents to future extreme events.  A partnership with the University of Fondwa, Haiti is an integral element of the research plan.  The proposing team has made specific arrangements for transportation, housing, food, and water in Haiti.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBruce Hamilton\r\nProgram Director\r\nEnvironmental Sustainability\r\n3/19/10",

With a team comprised interdisciplinary U.S.-based scholars, research experts from the University of Fondwa (UNIF) and the University of Nouvelle Grand\u00c6Anse (UNOGA), and community-based partners in Haiti, we collected information on how mobile phones and computers contributed to relief efforts and impacted on interagency coordination.  As the grant period progressed, we experimented with ways to include mobile communication in a range of rural learning environments.\n\nAn initial round of fieldwork in May 2010 resulted in the collection of 220 structured quantitative surveys, and 49 semi-structured qualitative interviews.  This data set included responses from Port-au-Prince, Leog&acirc;ne, Fondwa, Jacmel, and Jeremie, meaning that we heard from people in rural and urban areas, and from places that experienced earthquake impacts ranging from maximum and moderate devastation to no physical devastation at all.  18 different institutions were represented in our data sample, including 13 community-based organizations (CBOs), 2 rural universities, 1 international NGO, 1 governmental agency, and 1 corporate entity.     \n\nIn part, we looked for information on usability, feasibility and normative practices and gathered the following findings:\n\nMobile service was restored in 2-7 days.\nWhile there was low awareness of disaster relief-related mobile apps, e.g., Ushahidi, there was high interest in learning more, and moderate to high levels of comfort with and confidence in mobile technology.\nPeople used radio and internet for gathering information.\nPeople used cell phones to mobilize formal and informal support networks.\nPeople used cell phones in a Haitian cultural context.  Particularly in rural areas, mobile devices blended with traditional patterns of information flow such as foot travel, and word of mouth/ teledjol; results were less clear how about mobile devices in turn shape those traditional patterns of information flow.\n\n\nWe also sought information on levels of interagency coordination by asking questions about goal alignment, mutual respect, competitiveness, and communication.   We gathered the following findings on interagency dynamics:\n\nAgency goals were relatively non-aligned across agencies and regions.\nSurvey responses on respect and communication varied widely in Port-au-Prince, suggesting snafu conditions in the city, but were more consistent in other regions, suggesting more harmonious dynamics in the countryside.  \n\n\nWe presented these initial findings in a briefing to the U.S. Army Southern Command in July 2010, led by Dr. Tracy St. Benoit, and to the NSF at the Haiti RAPIDS Workshop in September 2010, led by Dr. Kevin Meehan and Mr. Amenold Pierre.  Following these presentations, we organized a second round of fieldwork in October 2010.   The results of this fieldwork can be summarized as follows:\n\nThrough the UCF Mixed Emerging Technologies Integration Lab (METIL), Dr. Metcalf made a teaching technology package available to one of our Haitian research partners, Mr. Waldinde Germaine, an educator located in Jeremie.   The package consisted of an Android phone, a palm-sized projector, portable audio speakers, and resource materials on Information Technology translated into French and was made available through a micro-credit loan agreement.  Mr. Germaine used this system in a French class to project French music videos, then project song lyrics, after which he had students recite the lyrics.   Mr. Germaine thereby blended traditional recitation teaching methods with a mixed-media approach that addressed multiple competencies and learning styles with positive outcomes such as faster language acquisition by Kreyol-speaking students and higher test scores. \nDr. Meehan taught a complete World Literature course as part of UNOGA\u00c6s general education program, also using face-to-face lectures and (after returning to Orlando..."
