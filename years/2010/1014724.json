  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of today's hot topics is carbon nanotubes, and one fo the big challenges is how to grow large amonuts of these CNTs for use.  In this experiment, we used mesoporous silica, which is essentially a porous glass, as a template for the growth of CNTs.\n\nA metallic substrate was dipped into the mesoporous silica solution and allowed to dry into a honeycomb structure on top of the metal.  This sample was then hooked up to a potentiostat and placed in a solution containing metal ions.  A current was run through this sample and the solution, and the metal ions were attracted to the metal substrate that was exposed through silica.  This formed the catalyst for CNT growth.\n\nThe sample was then placed in a tube furnace, a benchtop oven that is connected to gas cylinders and can heat to very high temperatures.  A nonreactive gas filled the tube and pushed the air out while it heated, and then a carbon containing gas was fed into the tube.  The heat decomposed the gas, and the carbon atoms congregated on the catalyst metals that were deposited earlier.  After about twenty minutes, the carbon atoms had collected enough to form nanotubes and the sample was finished.\n\nWe saw that the nantubes did grow very well, but they appeared more like spaghetti on top of the silica and were not perfectly straight or in and order as we had predicted.  However, we were able to make large amounts of them and we believe that the template process will work much better after some more experimentation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katrina A Staggemeier"
