 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific practice has been radically transformed by computation.\r\nMany observers now place computational simulation on an equal footing\r\nwith the two traditional approaches to scientific discovery,\r\nexperimentation and theory.  But while there are long-established and\r\nrigorous criteria for validating experiments and mathematical\r\nreasoning, the same is not true for simulation.  Published reports of\r\nsimulation-based research typically say little or nothing about the\r\nsoftware, its qualities, or what was done to ascertain its\r\ncorrectness.  The software is rarely examined by reviewers or other\r\nresearchers, and in some cases is not even made available to them.\r\nThis situation is particularly troublesome in light of the substantial\r\nevidence that scientific software is, in general, as unreliable as any\r\nother type of software.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on developing a set of integrated techniques for\r\nthe specification and verification of scientific software.  Drawing on\r\nideas from model checking, symbolic execution, and other formal\r\nmethods, these will include: (1) new techniques to efficiently check\r\nfor the presence of deadlocks, race conditions, improper use of\r\nparallel programming libraries, and other generic defects in\r\nscientific programs, (2) techniques to specify and verify the order of\r\naccuracy of numerical programs, such as those used to solve systems of\r\ndifferential equations, and (3) new techniques to verify the\r\nfunctional equivalence of two scientific programs, including programs\r\nwith unbounded loops, and programs with (shared-variable and/or\r\nmessage-passing) parallelism.  These techniques will be realized in a\r\nnew tool suite, the Toolkit for Accurate Scientific Software (TASS),\r\nwhich will be made publicly available under an open source license.",
