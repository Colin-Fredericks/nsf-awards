 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is motivated by the following challenges that arise due to the growth of services and applications that rely on radio technologies: (i) As spatial density of spectrum usage increases more wireless systems need to coexist on common spectrum bands, (ii) The energy footprint of wireless information technologies grows at a remarkable pace that is exacerbated by the increasing density, and (iii) An increasing fraction of applications require tight delay guarantees that are incompatible with classical random access techniques. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the program is to develop a scalable framework for providing delay guarantees in dense spectrum usage scenarios, while eliminating energy consumption in medium access arbitration.  Towards this goal the project studies fundamental properties and implementations of periodic medium access schemes under which conflicting transmissions are separated in time. Inherent properties of periodic spatial systems are studied from both descriptive and prescriptive viewpoints. The scope of the program includes development of decentralized algorithms that are provably robust to propagation delays, hidden nodes, and clock drifts.\r\n\r\nAn energy-efficient framework for wireless access will have favorable impact on the footprint of information technologies due to both operational energy consumption and battery manufacturing.  Successfully completed program will also facilitate dense usage of spectrum with predictable service quality, and thereby will lead to better utilization of an important public resource. The project has educational components at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and potential impact in upcoming networking standards.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWireless communications continue to penetrate in both existing and emerging applications that facilitate our daily lives.  These include not only applications such as cellular telephony and wireless LANs with direct human interface, but also machine to machine (M2M) applications such as industrial and residential automation that involve computers on both ends.\n\nThis large and diverse set of applications share a limited frequency spectrum that is suitable for radio communications. Hence efficient usage of radio spectrum is desirable, and in pursuing this end it is important to know how much communication can be supported by a given spectrum band.\n\nTraditionally, this latter quantity is considered in the so-called \"point-to-point\" fashion.  That is, celebrated results on information transmission characterize fundamental limits on how many bits can be sent per second between two radios, and formalize techniques that achieve such limits.\n\nThese results, however, are valid for isolated communication links that are likely to arise when there are few such links that share the same radio spectrum.  When spectrum usage is dense, such links interfere with each other, and to account for a more comprehensive definition of communication capacity it is appropriate to take a spatial perspective to account for such interactions.\n\nThis project aimed to quantify how much data traffic can be supported by a narrow band of spectrum under dense deployment and subject to tolerable communication delay.  A key observation in this effort is that as spectrum usage gets dense, wireless sessions that are geographically far from each other may become coupled through neighborhood relations.  That is, activity of one session may affect another through a chain of intermediate sessions that are pairwise close in the geographical sense.  Hence one needs to consider an entire system of such sessions rather than a small group of sessions in isolation.\n\nFor random transmission schemes such as those adopted in prevalent wireless LAN standards, the project characterized a set of throughputs (or bit rates) that lead to tolerable delay regardless of the density of spectrum usage. This characterization can be used as a conservative measure of how much delay sensitive traffic can be packed into a spectrum band; and thereby it may be used to predict spectrum shortages.  The project also focused on periodic transmission schemes that have desirable and predictable delay properties, and developed hardware and software platforms to develop, verify, and analyze protocols for such schemes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Murat Alanyali"
