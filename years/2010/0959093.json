The Siwalik record consists of highly fossiliferous Neogene sediments deposited in the Himalayan foreland basin from Pakistan to Myanmar. In the Potwar Plateau of Pakistan, this record provides an unparalleled history of faunal and environmental change in a continuous sequence of strata spanning the last 18 million years. During this time period, mammalian paleocommunities exhibited a changing mixture of cosmopolitan groups, endemic lineages, and relict taxa. Environmental processes that may have driven these faunal changes are known from deep-sea cores and other geological evidence. These processes occurred at different biogeographic scales, ranging from those of the global climate system and sea level to regional (South Asian) tectonism to the local floodbasin and its vegetation and local climate. The proposed analyses will test the relationship between environmental processes and biological responses by (1) evaluating mammalian faunal change under different geodynamic and climatic conditions over the interval between 18.0 and 5.5 million years ago, and (2) integrating multiple indicators of changing paleoclimate from the Siwalik record, including a new geochemical method for estimating soil moisture using iron oxides, information from snail opercula about seasonality of precipitation, stable isotopes from tooth enamel and soil carbonate, and measures of diet and body size for extinct mammals using functional morphology.",
