The ACL's annual conference is the major international conference in this field. This project is to subsidize travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Student Research Workshop, which is part of the ACL conference on July 11-16, 2010 in Uppsala, Sweden. The workshop consists of two tracks: paper presentations and poster presentations. Each paper presentation is followed by a discussion chaired by respected researchers in the field. The poster session provides a further opportunity for extended one-on-one interaction with the members of the CL research community. All selected work has only student authors and the workshop is organized and run by students.\r\n\r\nThe Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of natural language processing researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to take their first important step toward becoming professional computational linguists by receiving critical feedback on their work from external experts, and by making contacts with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students who are involved in running and selecting papers for the workshop also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.",
