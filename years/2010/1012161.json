 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of a Laser Photofragmentation/Laser Induced Fluorescence instrument for measuring tropospheric concentrations of HONO. Ambient air will be expanded into a low-pressure cell and HONO will be fragmented into OH and NO by photolysis at 355 nm. The OH photofragment will be quantified using the Fluorescent Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) approach at 308 nm. It is anticipated that this new instrument will combine the selectivity of spectroscopic techniques and the low detection limit observed for chemical techniques, making it of prime interest for the scientific community. This new instrument will be fully characterized in the laboratory and it is anticipated to perform initial field measurements in an urban atmosphere. HONO will be measured in addition to OH and NO to determine if unknown sources of HONO are occurring in the atmosphere of Bloomington, IN.\r\nAn incomplete description of the major sources of HONO in current models of atmospheric chemistry may have important implications for air quality control strategies as it may lead to an underprediction of the concentrations of photochemical pollutants. For example, ozone and secondary organic aerosols are of particular interest to the society due to detrimental effects on human health. In addition, an accurate description of the main sources of free radicals is important to issues of climate change as atmospheric oxidation processes control the lifetime of greenhouse gases and the alternative chlorofluorocarbons, which have a significant impact on the radiative budget of earth. Future deployments of this instrument during field campaigns as well as its use during laboratory studies will provide additional insights in the HONO chemistry occurring in the atmosphere and will help improve actual models of atmospheric chemistry. Future intercomparisons of this instrument with other measurement techniques will also help in assessing the accuracy of HONO measurements in the atmosphere.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe hydroxyl radical (OH) plays a central role in the chemistry of the atmosphere.  The OH radical controls the atmospheric lifetime of methane, alternative chlorofluorocarbons, carbon monoxide and many other trace gases important to air quality and climate change.  In addition the OH radical initiates the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) can lead to the production of ozone and fine particulates in the atmosphere, two criteria pollutants that have serious health impacts.\n\nKnowledge of the sources of OH radicals in the atmosphere can help with the development of control strategies to reduce the production of these criteria pollutants.  Nitrous acid (HONO) has been shown to be a significant source of OH radicals in many environments.  However, recent measurements of HONO concentrations in various areas using both chemical and spectroscopic techniques have revealed large discrepancies between model predictions and measurements, bringing into question our understanding of the sources of HONO in the atmosphere.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The recent studies indicating higher than expected daytime concentrations of HONO in the atmosphere  suggest that HONO may be an important underestimated source of OH radicals.  As a consequence, current models of atmospheric chemistry may underestimate the capacity of the atmosphere to oxidize trace gases, which in turn may lead to uncertain predictions of the future chemical composition of the atmosphere.  Accurate and precise measurements of HONO concentrations both in the laboratory and in the field are thus needed to better characterize the chemistry of HONO in the atmosphere.\n\nThis project involved the development of a new Laser-Photofragmentation/Laser Induced Fluorescence instrument for measuring atmospheric concentrations of HONO.  In this instrument, ambient air is expanded into a low-pressure cell and HONO is fragmented into OH and NO by a laser. The OH fragment is then quantified using Laser-Induced Fluorescence. This new instrument combines the selectivity of spectroscopic techniques for measuring HONO with the low detection limit observed for chemical techniques.  The new instrument was characterized in the laboratory and initial field measurements were conducted in Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nMeasurements of HONO during August, 2013 at the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve were typically 100-200 pptv for NOx mixing ratios between 3-4 ppbv.  Measurements during July, 2015 at the same site were much lower due to the lower NOx observed during this period.  Average daytime HONO levels were near 10 pptv, with nighttime values approaching 40 pptv for NOx mixing ratios of approximately 1 ppbv.  The daytime values observed in 2015 were in good agreement with a gas-phase photochemical model, suggesting that known chemistry was able to reproduce the measured HONO concentrations at this site during this time. \n\nBroader Impacts: An incomplete description of the major sources of HONO in current models of atmospheric chemistry may have important implications for air quality control strategies as it may lead to an underprediction of the concentrations of OH radicals and photochemical pollutants such as ozone and fine particulates.  In addition, an accurate description of the main sources of OH radicals is important to issues of climate change as OH radicals control the lifetime of greenhouse gases such as methane and the alternative chlorofluorocarbons which have a significant impact on earth\u00c6s radiative budget.  Future deployments of this instrument during field campaigns as well as its use during laboratory studies will provide additional insights into the chemistry of HONO in the atmosphere and will help improve models of atmospheric chemistry and future predictions of the composition of the atmosphere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip S Stevens"
