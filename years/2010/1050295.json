Until now, we have only limited knowledge of the impacts of these experiences.  This workshop should result in parameters for a research agenda that will produce new knowledge about them.  Questions addressed will include:  (1) What are the outcomes of international exchanges?  (2) What do we know about the effectiveness of collaborations and exchange programs? (3) What factors define the types of exchanges and shape the outcomes? (4)What methods and tools exist? Do we need new ones? Included in the workshop will be researchers, practitioners, doctoral students and postdocs from the U.S. and abroad.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help define what types of research questions can be asked and what methodologies can be used to assess the impact of international research experiences for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in science and engineering fields.  The results of research arising from this agenda will help members of the science, engineering, and education communities to design and administer more effective and successful research programs for students and postdoctoral researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInvestigating the International Experiences in STEM Graduate Education and Beyond: \nA Workshop to Develop a Research Agenda \n \nWORKSHOP GOALS AND DESIGN\nDespite the rapid expansion of international campuses and programs, and the increasing acceptance and encouragement of international experiences for graduate students, little comprehensive evaluative work has been done to assess their efficacy on a broad scale and to determine what types and models of international work can be most effective.  The purpose of this workshop was to develop a research agenda to produce the knowledge needed to support effective engagement in international scientific education, research collaboration and exchanges at the graduate and post-doctoral periods of science careers.  Participants were faculty in STEM fields, education researchers, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from around the world (Brazil, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Germany, UK, US) with a balanced mix by gender, ethnicity, and career stage. This workshop was not to come to definite conclusions, but to frame relevant questions. \nThe workshop has been designed to (a) increase mutual understanding of essential topics relevant to investigate the impact of international collaborations at the graduate level and beyond, (b) gather information on what is known and should be known about assessing international experiences and programs, and (c) move the participants collectively towards charting research directions for the next years.  The workshop agenda development took into account the themes identified in a pre-survey by the participants. An interactive format aimed at maximizing conversation and minimizing one-way presentation.  \u00e6Perception lenses\u00c6 --students, faculty, staff, policy makers, administrators, community partners, and international collaborators who all have different, though overlapping, needs and interests-- were introduced to challenge participants to take unfamiliar perspectives. Early career researchers presented skits to open conversations about the uneven aspects of international collaborations and interdisciplinary encounters.\n \nWORKSHOP OUTCOMES\n1.         Research Priorities\nAn important result of the workshop was coming to a consensus over key questions as priorities for further empirical research.\n(1)      Does international collaboration lead to better science/scientists?\n(2)      Do current institutional and funding structures lead to missed opportunities for international collaboration?  If so, how?\n(3)      How can we assess institutional preparedness for international collaborations/ experiences?\n(4)      What are the expected outcomes and goals of international experiences/collaborations?  How are they established?\n(5)       What are the actual impacts, outcomes, and transformation of the international experiences/collaborations?\n \n \n2.         Identification of Key Topics\n Topics relevant for the design of the international collaboration were identified.  These were explored  using the framework of the stages of the international collaboration &mdash;before, during, and after the experiences.\nThinking through Reciprocity and Partnership. \nExamining Length, Timing, and Characteristics of International Experiences\n \nInternational Differences in Approaching Science\nElements of the International Experience\nAssessing Outcomes Following International Experiences\n \n3.         Conceptual Frameworks\nTwo frameworks were developed to divide areas for investigation in a useful way.  The first one addressed the overall design process of the assessment.\n \n \nThe second conceptual framework included intercultural competence, technical skill acquisition, and science-oriented outcomes.\n \n                      An Outcomes-Oriented Logic Model for International Programs and Initiatives\n?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAspects adapted by Brent Jesiek from Deardorff, Darla K. (2005). \"A Matter of Logic?\" International Educator, May-June 2005: 26-31.  \n \n4.         Post-work..."
