 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across many scientific disciplines, the availability of very large\r\namounts of data is creating a paradigm shift. The goal of this project\r\nis to develop Scolopax, a tool for finding interesting patterns in\r\nclassification and prediction models trained on large high-dimensional\r\ndata. These patterns can capture previously unknown relationships\r\nbetween the variables of a complex process, hence are essential for\r\nexploratory analysis and scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThis project explores several research directions to lay the\r\nfoundations for Scolopax: (1) Design of a new query language that can\r\nexpress all common pattern search preferences. (2) Algorithms for\r\nlearning a query so that even non-technical users can formulate\r\nnon-trivial queries through an interactive process. (3) New rewrite\r\nrules and efficient data management approaches to automatically\r\ntransform queries into fast implementations on a cluster or Cloud. (4)\r\nDesign of new semi-parametric data mining techniques that are amenable\r\nto scalable training, evaluation, and pattern confidence computation.\r\n\r\nUser-friendly query writing functionality makes Scolopax accessible to\r\nscientists and citizen scientists alike. Its planned deployment\r\nthrough popular Web sites, e.g., those hosted by the Cornell Lab of\r\nOrnithology, has the potential to enable new scientific\r\ndiscoveries. By letting citizen scientists not only contribute data,\r\nbut also make their own discoveries using the data, Scolopax also\r\nserves as an important enabler and motivator for outreach programs and\r\ngreater involvement of citizen scientists.
