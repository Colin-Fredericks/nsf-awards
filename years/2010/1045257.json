 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and collaborators will utilize high-throughput (next-generation) sequencing technologies to elucidate the genetic components of eyes and vision in multiple, diverse species of invertebrate animals.  The animals to be studied were chosen because their vision and/or eyes are well-studied functionally, but lack extensive genetic data.  Leveraging new sequencing technologies will enable the rapid collection of vast genetic data that will complement existing bodies of knowledge on visual function (especially physiology, development and evolution), and will facilitate an integrative understanding of animal vision from genotype to phenotype to evolution in multiple species. The new genetic data will be made available in public databases (e.g. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). The project will also have multiple broader impacts, including the education and participation of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior and senior faculty, including individuals with a strong record of service in broadening participation of under-represented groups in science.  The research will network vision research labs across the US together and with one international lab (Denmark). Eyes are a fascinating evolutionary innovation, and are, therefore, a persistent topic of debate between scientists and critics of Darwinian evolution. This project will provide additional, key data that will help to promote understanding, and educate the public about eye evolution.",
