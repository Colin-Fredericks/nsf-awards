 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop anisotropic hard magnetic nanoparticles and nanoflakes based on rare-earth transition metal compounds, which can be agglomerated by screen printing and tape casting into micro- or sub-millimeter permanent magnet structures. The excellent magnetic properties, small size and particular morphology of the nanoparticles and nanoflakes will allow for high magnetic performance with dimensions that bridge the current gap between the permanent magnet thin films (about a few microns) and micromachined permanent magnets (typically larger than 500 microns).  This project is expected to (1) synthesize permanent magnet nanoflakes and nanoparticles with magnetic properties comparable to those of the bulk counterparts, (2) prepare monolithic isotropic and anisotropic hard magnetic thick films by screen printing, (3) fabricate solitary isotropic and anisotropic hard magnetic thicker films or structures by tape casting, and (4) develop prototypes of sub-millimeter permanent magnet structures for terahertz (THz) devices and micro-undulators.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide stable permanent magnet particles with submicron dimensions in large amount and with close-to-bulk magnetic properties, which will be an enabling technology for the $3.9 billion magnetic MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems) market.  The applications include micro-sensors, -motors, -generators, -undulators, high frequency (THz) vacuum electronic devices etc.  The permanent magnet nanoflakes can also be used in anisotropic bonded magnets, which have many industrial applications with a market size of $434 million per year worldwide.",
