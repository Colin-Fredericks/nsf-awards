 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Deon Miles and colleague Robert E. Bachman from the University of the South will acquire a high performance, liquid-chromatograph, tandem mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS/MS) capable of handling high molecular mass materials. The instrument will be used to support research activities such as: 1) solution aggregates formed by platinum diimine complexes, 2) separation and identification of water-soluble semiconducting and metallic nanoparticles, 3) isolation and characterization of cardiolipin from skeletal muscle membrane phospholipid fatty acids, and 4) identification of S-nitrosylated proteins and their degree of nitrosylation.\r\n\r\nMass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. High pressure liquid chromatography is an isolation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer. These are widely used analytical techniques to identify and quantify the chemical composition of a sample. It is important for students to be trained using modern instrumentation. The research will have a significant impact in a number of areas, especially chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award from NSF has allowed The University of the South, a highly-ranked liberal arts college, to acquire a state-of-the-art High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS).  This new instrumentation has greatly advanced both teaching and research at the institution and will continue to do so for many years.  \n\nThe field of chemistry is defined by the examination and transformation of matter at the molecular level.  This molecular basis dictates that chemists rely on instrumentation, such as the mass spectral system acquired via this award from NSF, in order to \"see\" the systems under investigation in several research groups in both the Chemistry and Biology Departments.\n\nThe Bachman Research Group has focused much of its research efforts in recent years on the synthesis and characterization of new liquid-crystalline and gel materials containing transition metals.  The mass spectral instrument funded through this grant has been invaluable in guiding the synthetic efforts of Bachman and six undergraduate researchers by providing data needed for the unambiguous identification of both the final metal-containing materials as well as key intermediate products.  The products of this research have shown a variety of novel properties that are of scientific interest and may be of practical use.  For example, one platinum-containing material has been demonstrated to undergo a low-temperature liquid crystalline phase transition that converts the material from highly photoluminescent to non-luminescent.  Uncovering the structural basis of this change in optical behavior will help provide insight into the origin of photoluminescence in this class of materials.  Moreover, such stimulus-switchable behavior might have use in display and/or sensor technology. \n\nIn somewhat related research, the Bachman group has also utilized this instrumentation to examine the solution aggregation of platinum-containing materials.  There are numerous examples in the chemical literature of complexes of this class exhibiting polymorphism (multiple crystal structures), with one polymorph exhibiting luminescent behavior.  These solution studies are aimed at uncovering the factors that play a role in directing crystallization, which determines the polymorph formed and hence the resulting physical properties of the material.\n\nIn collaboration with Prof. Deborah McGrath of the Biology Department, Bachman and student co-workers initiated a project to examine the presence of trace organic compounds (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) in the community wastewater stream.  This work led to the validation of methods for several compounds of interest.  Since this initial work, Prof. Emily White, a specialist in this area, has taken on this work.  The unique characteristics of the Sewanee water system&mdash;pristine source water, controlled distribution and collection network, and small scale&mdash;make this an ideal location to carry out carefully controlled studies of this issue.  The HPLC-MS/MS provided by this grant is essential for this societally-relevant work.\n\nThe Miles Research Group has centered its research efforts on the synthesis and characterization of water-soluble, monolayer-protected quantum dots.  These quantum dots consist of a semiconducting core (e.g., cadmium selenide) surrounded by water-soluble thiol molecules.  These nanomaterials have a wide range of potential applications, including biological sensors, light emitting diodes, photovoltaic devices, and quantum computation.  The primary focus is their potential use as sensors in aqueous environments.  The mass spectrometer funded by this grant has been useful in the characterization efforts of Miles and four undergraduate students.  While the initial goal of determining the mass of intact nanoparticles has not been accomplished to date, the observation of specific nanoparticle fragments is promising for future research study in this field. \n\nThe HPLC-MS/MS system h..."
