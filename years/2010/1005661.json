 "awd_abstract_narration": "In general, Scharlemann's research has centered on the theory of classical knots and of 3-manifolds, in particular on the use of Heegaard splittings and of related notions from classical knot theory.  The focus has been on the behavior of surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds, but with a modern viewpoint:  Add ideas from graph theory to old-fashioned combinatorial arguments on surface intersections; add sutured manifold theory to the classical notion of  hierarchies on 3-manifolds (so parameterizing surfaces and estimates of the Thurston norm help control and understand the topology); and add thin position to the classic tools of Morse theory, so handles of the critical index are added not all at once, but as slowly as possible.  \r\nRecently Scharlemann has applied these and similar new tools towards resolving questions in the topology of 4-manifolds, most prominently the Schoenflies Conjecture, but also long-standing questions about the connection between classical links, their possible slicings in the 4-ball, and how surgery can affect both. For example, recent work with Abby Thompson and Bob Gompf uses sutured manifold and Heegaard theory to search for the easiest possible counterexample to the Generalized Property R Conjecture.  We show that there is a 2-component likely counterexample containing a square knot (or, maybe seen as easier, a genus 1 knot, so far undetermined) as a component.   These and other results may be the first steps towards a useful application of 3-manifold ideas to those intriguing topological questions which are sometimes called 3 + 1-dimensional because they ask how 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are interrelated. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic observations about the world around us is that it has three dimensions.  The broad intent of this proposal is to help us better understand spaces with precisely this property: anyone living in one would see their world as of this sort, namely 3-dimensional.  Beyond modeling the universe around us, these spaces, called \"3-manifolds\", support interesting phenomena such as knotting, in which a simple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA, or, more generally, a chemical molecule) can lie in space in a complicated way.  These 3-manifolds also lie on the edge of spaces with additional deep physical significance, those that locally appear to be 4-dimensional spaces (such as physicists often refer to as space-time).  Our emerging understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds can also help us understand long-standing questions about these 4-dimensional manifolds.   The particular emphasis in this proposal is on questions that sit on the edge between 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory and incorporate knotting phenomena from both.  The dimensions are interesting in part because they model the universe in which we live; knotting within them is a tool to deepen our understanding of how such spaces relate.\r\n",

Five graduate students have been involved.  Four continue in their studies and one has finished his dissertation, received his PhD and now works in industry.\n\nThe mathematical core of the project has been work on several interrelated problems that involve manifolds of dimension 3+1, which is shorthand for saying that the problems have both 3 and 4 dimensional aspects.  My favorite at the moment is the Schoenflies Conjecture: that a smooth 3-sphere imbedded in 4-space bounds a smooth 4-ball.  Replace 3 and 4 with any other n and n+1 and the result is known; it is marvelous that the sole unresolved case (when n = 3) involves the dimensions that are most important to our physical world. \n\nBeyond publishing several papers on this and related problems (e. g. the  generalized Property R Conjecture and the Powell Conjecture) I have given talks on work related to the Schoenflies Conjecture at many venues, my favorite at the moment having been a pair of talks at the University of Chicago (see for example http://lamington.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/scharlemann-on-schoenflies/ for a participant's description).
