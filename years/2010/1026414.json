 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diminishing linguistic diversity is a global problem. As concern over language endangerment has increased, so have calls for preservation and revitalization of threatened languages. Advancing linguistic study of endangered languages is critical, especially for sign languages, which are too often excluded from most discussions of language endangerment.\r\n\t\r\nThis project provides fellowships for six U.S. students to attend the prestigious 3L International Summer School in Language Documentation and Description (3LSS). Specialized courses on sign language documentation and description of endangered sign language varieties are a particular forte of 3LSS. In addition to encouraging better approaches to the study of endangered sign languages, this project also promotes equal opportunity and expands educational access for deaf students, a historically under-served minority, who bring special potential to the study of sign languages. At least half of the fellowships are dedicated to support U.S. deaf students to attend 3LSS, which will be held in the Netherlands (5-17 July 2010) at the University of Leiden.",
