Payne\r\n0650650\r\n\r\nThis activity is in the field of biosensors individually functionalized to allow recognition to be transduced through redundant optical and electrical signals.  The work is broadly applicable, but especially relevant for food analysis where speed, reliability and cost are paramount. The approach, based on the use of chitosan, is original and could lead to important developments with easy transfer to industry, thus covering not only progress in  fundamental science, but also promising applications. In this work, three model analyses will be studied: electrochemical sensing, enzymatic biosensing, and immunosensing. It is expected that this research will result in new fundamental contributions to biotechnology, electrochemistry, and materials science as well as other fields.\r\n\r\nThe PI will integrate the research with outreach activities that target K-12 students and teachers. The students will benefit from hands-on learning modules of natural materials, health and nutrition and food technology. On-site laboratory training will meet the increasing interest of the students in biotechnology and biomaterials. This training will enhance the participation of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n",
