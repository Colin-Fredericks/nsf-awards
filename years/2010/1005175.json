 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this REU Site are to (1) Train students from ecosystem, earth,  engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences in collaborative interdisciplinary research and professional development, (2) Forestall the flight of US citizens from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines by recruiting qualified, diverse students to engage in ecological problems requiring computer, mathematical sciences and engineering input, and (3) Conduct research to develop and apply novel techniques in computer science, engineering, and mathematics to solve natural resource management problems, allowing informatics to enable the science and the science to enable tool development.  We will achieve these objectives through structured research experiences, thematic and professional development seminars, exchanges with other REU sites, immersive field experiences, and mentoring and development of collegial relationships.  Students will be recruited from ecology, geosciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. We will actively recruit Native, Black, and Hispanic Americans and will provide all students with high quality mentoring, graduate school fellowship opportunities, and, and career counseling so they will enter the work force equipped to make key contributions to natural resources management and policy. We intend to provide students with skills for today?s science environment where information technology and models are essential parts of ecosystem management.  \r\n \r\nMentored by teams of interdisciplinary scientists, participants will address three key research themes: (1) regional climate change and vegetation \"landform\" atmosphere interactions using sensor networks, computer visualization, mathematical models, and field studies of climate and vegetation; (2) landscape-scale changes in species distributions using bioacoustics, machine learning, and large datasets of birds and insects; and (3) network-scale river restoration using fiber optic temperature sensors, physical models of channel hydraulics, and mathematical modeling.   Each theme integrates ecological principles, field experiences, novel engineering techniques, new developments in computer science, and mathematical modeling and problem solving.    \r\n\r\nThis REU site will serve as a national model for transforming the education of undergraduates to embrace Ecosystem Informatics (EI) as both a set of tools and a mindset for approaching and solving natural resources problems in an interdisciplinary context.   The activities will advance discovery while promoting training and learning in key social issues including climate change, ecological change, and restoration.  It will recruit and train underrepresented minorities, enhance infrastructure and programs at the Andrews Forest LTER and OSU Wave Lab, link with an IGERT and REUs at OSU, and disseminate management and policy implications to USFS partners.    \r\n",
