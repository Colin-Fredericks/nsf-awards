 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to devise computer vision methods that enable a Portable Blind Navigational Device (PBND) to guide a visually impaired person in unstructured environments. The main research question of this project is to answer if the approach of employing a single perception sensor can solve blind navigation problem, including localization of the PBND and object recognition. A distinctive feature of this work is that it addresses blind navigation problem by simultaneously processing the visual and range information of a 3D imaging sensor. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of four related research endeavors. First, it investigates techniques for accurate and precise pose estimation of the PBND in a GPS-denied environment.  Second, it develops an effective 3D data segmentation method to allow scene recognition for wayfinding. Third, it applies the pose estimation method to register 3D range data and devises methods to reduce registration error. Four, it addresses real-time implementation of the methods in the PBND with limited computing power.    \r\n\r\nThe research will result in new algorithms that can improve the lives of the visually impaired in the near term. They will also enable the autonomy of small robots that have wider applications in military situational awareness, firefighting, and search and rescue. The discoveries will revolutionize small robot autonomy and impact the robotics research community as a whole. Broader impacts also include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and educating the public on robotics through workshops and robot exhibits in science museums and technology showcases.",

The methods include: (1) An new egomotion estimation method, called Visual Range Odometry (VRO), that can accurately determine the PNA&rsquo;s pose (position and orientation) change between two time steps by simultaneously processing the intensity and range data from a 3D camera&frac34;SwissRanger SR4000; (2) A method that integrates the pose changes estimated by the VRO over time into the PNA&rsquo;s pose in the world coordinate system and reduce the integration error; (3) A 3D data segmentation method that can reliably segment the camera&rsquo;s range data into planar segments; and (4) An object recognition method to group the extracted planar segments into structures (e.g., stairways, doorways, etc.) and detect the structures as the waypoints for navigation. A PNA prototype, called smart cane, was built to test the functions of the pose estimation and object detection methods. The smart cane uses a speech interface for human-device interaction, i.e., for the blind traveler to indicate the destination or the object to be located and for the smart cane to notify the traveler the desired motion and the location of the detected object. Seven sighted human subjects were recruited to test the smart cane. They were blind-folded when performing the experiments. In the first test, the smart cane used the pose estimation result and the floor plan of the EIT/ETAS building to locate the subject in the building and guided the subject to the destination using a series of audio commands. The destination was a room number specified by the subject using the speech interface. The experimental results show that the smart cane successfully guided the human subject to the doorway of the room in each of the test cases. In the second test, a human subject walked in the ETAS building with the smart cane. The cane spoke to the subjects about the objects (doorway, stairway, hallway, and flat ground) it detected along the way. The experimental results demonstrate a 90% success rate in object detection. It is noted that a single rage data frame was used for object detection in this test. The success rate can be improved if multiple frames of range data are registered and used for object detection.</p>\n<p>The methods developed through this project have resulted in near term applications that may positively impact the visually impaired community. They also have potential in improving the autonomy of small robots that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue, and therefore have broader scientific impacts to the community of robotics research. Other broader impacts of the project include: (i) improvement of the research infrastructure of the PI&rsquo;s university, (ii) training of graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering disciplines, and (iii) broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
