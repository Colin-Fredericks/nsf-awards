 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Jacob W. Petrich and colleagues from the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The upgraded instrument will enable rapid 2D measurements with pulse field gradients and reliable 1D with increased sensitivity, and will have variable temperature capabilities. The instrument will be used to support research activities such: 1) preparation of organometallic compounds that contain a range of heteroatoms including boron, phosphorus, nitrogen, fluorine, and silicon; 2) synthetic methodologies and applications in combinatorial chemistry; 3) elucidation of the roles of structurally directed electron induction and transannulation in polycyclic Lewis base and acid catalysis; 4) environmentally responsive materials, sensors and catalysis; 5) green catalysis; and 6) custom carbohydrate synthesis.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have a positive impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials, the environment and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
