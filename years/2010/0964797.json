 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a semantic media adaptation scheme for mobile access of information that is perceptually optimized for users to enjoy semantically relevant media content using small display mobile devices. The research team explores seamless integration of multidisciplinary technologies from computer vision, media coding and transmission, wireless networking, mobile device, and human visual perception to tackle the challenges in closing the gap between rich content in high resolution and size limited mobile device access.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the exploration and development of several relevant techniques in (1) Limited user interface media semantic extraction; (2) Capacity and resource constrained media content adaptation; (3) Perceptually optimized delivery and display of adapted media to small sized mobile devices. The research team addresses these issues by seamless integration of technologies from different research fields that traditionally have less interaction. \r\n\r\nThe project bridges both semantic gap and user intention gap in mobile multimedia search and access. First, the innovative scheme of semantic adaptation can be extended for any media search application based on semantically relevant characteristics.  Second, the adaptation of high resolution media content for small sized mobile device plays a key role in media gateway for wireless mobile access. Finally, the investigation of perceptual optimized display on mobile devices shall open up a new research avenue to understand how mobile users perceive rich media content with small displays.",
