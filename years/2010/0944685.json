 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to research and develop a novel, broadband, high-efficiency, high-power elliptic-beam helix traveling-wave-tube amplifier (TWTA). The proposed project addresses the problem and opportunity in satellite communication, i.e. the need of broadband amplifiers that are efficient, high-power, highly reliable, and above all small and lightweight. The Phase I research objective is to determine the scientific, mechanical and manufacturing feasibility of the proposed elliptic-beam helix TWTA. The Phase I research includes:  1. Optimization of the gain and efficiency of the proposed elliptic-beam helix TWTA; 2. Concept design of a suitable elliptic electron beam system; 3. Preliminary electrical design of an elliptic helix rf structure; and 4. Preliminary mechanical design of the proposed elliptic-beam helix TWTA. The proposed elliptic-beam helix TWTA is anticipated to significantly improve the efficiency, power output, reliability, size and weight over the conventional circular-beam helix traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) which are currently the technology of choice for satellite communications.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is as follows. First, the proposed project will enhance the scientific and technological understanding of the mechanism of vacuum electronic amplification in a novel elliptic-beam helix TWTA. Second, the vacuum electronic amplification mechanism supported by the interaction of radio-frequency signals with the elliptic electron beam via an elliptic helix is anticipated to be a significantly improvement over the conventional one, thereby representing a significant advance in vacuum electron device technology. Third, if successful, this project will lead to commercially deployable, space qualified elliptic-beam helix TWTAs that will perform at new levels beyond what has been achievable to date. The initial market focus will be the high margin, high priced, onboard satellite market including ground station deployments. The next market focus will be high-frequency, high-power broadband amplifiers for point-to-point wireless communications. The third market focus will be broadband amplifiers for military radar and communication systems.",
