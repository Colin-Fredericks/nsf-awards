 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual merit \r\nGlobal warming. Overpopulation. Renewable energy. National security. Access to clean water. Targeted therapeutics. The grand global challenges facing the 21st century world are complex and necessitate the creation of new educational models for training undergraduate scientists. To better prepare students to meet these challenges requires educators to radically re-think and restructure the way students experience the process of science in the laboratory. Current models no longer serve students well because they ignore fundamental realities of how science is conducted beyond the campus walls: in collaborative research teams comprised of scientists who bring multiple fields of expertise to the issues at hand. Student learning should no longer be artificially compartmentalized within disciplinary boundaries without providing students an opportunity to experience a more authentic model of the process of science early in their educational careers.  To address this need, an upper-level interdisciplinary laboratory course entitled \"Chemical Analysis in Chemical Ecology\" is being created.  The course is team taught by an analytical chemist from the Chemistry Department and a chemical ecologist from the Biology Department. The course enrolls 24 students per semester (12 registered through the chemistry department and 12 through the biology department) who work together in research teams of six students (3 biologists/3 chemists) each. The teams learn a set of common analytical techniques to investigate four current research questions in chemical ecology, culminating in the application of this knowledge to an original research question utilizing these techniques. \r\nBroader impact \r\nA guiding principle in the development of the course is the recognition that undergraduate scientists need authentic research experiences early in their undergraduate careers to help develop the critical-thinking skills needed to solve the world's most pressing problems. Furthermore, the course is expected to: 1) generate excitement for science and its relevance in students' lives; 2) provide students with realistic research experiences involving collaborative team-based problem solving approaches; 3) help students to develop confidence in the hands-on use of state-of-the-art HPLC instrumentation; 4) provide opportunities to cross disciplinary boundaries in seeking more complete answers to scientific questions; and 5) provide opportunities for students to clearly communicate their results to diverse audiences.  The outcomes of this interdisciplinary course will be presented at two conferences.  One, the annual meeting of the International Society for Chemical Ecology (ISCE), will introduce scientists in the field of chemical ecology to these efforts. The second, the Biennial Conference on Chemical Education, will disseminate the results to chemists familiar with new initiatives in undergraduate education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the development of new appraoches to effective undergraduate science eduaction at US institutions.  Specifically, it supported the development of a problem-based learning course in the area of Chemical Ecology, with associated laboratory modules, training exercises, and practice in the communication of science.  Three versions of the interdisciplinary course, each with similar learning goals but serving different student populations, were developed and offered at Dickinson College.  Multiple assessment tools indicate that the approach resulted in overall improvements in student learning, skill sets, and attitudes.  Upper-level and first-year student learning was different in several regards; this indicates that student experience and maturity impact their learning during PBL-type activities.  Our PBL modules were effective at each level, though 2nd and 3rd year students exhibited the best learning gains.  \n\nThe courses and PBL modules, as well as the lessons learned from their design, have been successfully integrated in to the curriculum at Dickinson and communicated to others via conference presentations and publications.  The project demonstrated the benefits of challenging students to use modern analytical instrumentation beyond the scope of typical college requirements.  A series of rigorous analytical challenges can motivate students, help them to develop their critical thinking skills, and provide furtile ground for the early practice of science communication skills.  It provides evidence that problem-based learning, a form of active learning, helps to produce cohorts of science majors with strong technical and reasonsing skills.  Finally, we highlight strategies for how such approaches can be integated into an existing undergraduate curricula.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Arnold"
