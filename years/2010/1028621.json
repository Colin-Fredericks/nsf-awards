 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes the development of a new type of superconducting electrical machines based on a stationary superconducting field coil and a superconducting dual armature rotor. This configuration, combined with a low heat leak construction and a method for reducing AC losses in the armature enables a fully superconducting machine that can achieve the highest power per unit mass based on well developed, cost effective, currently available superconducting materials. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research is transformative: it proposes (i) A novel design for low speed, high torque electrical machines with unprecedented energy density, (ii) A topology where both field and armature are superconducting, (iii) a coil configuration that enables development of rotating machinery with iron-free core (allowing a several fold increase in field density), (iv) a method of reducing heat leak and AC losses in the armature of the machine, enabling the use of  reliable, inexpensive, low temperature superconductors with reasonable refrigeration requirements. This will enable the design of next-generation electrical machinery with unparalleled power density, quench safety, reliability, and electrical performance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: (i) High torque density electrical machines have the potential to become the next generation power generation systems for applications where optimal power to mass ratio is critical, and lightweight, reliable, efficient electrical machinery is required, such as wind turbine generators, marine propulsion motors, and land vehicle propulsion motors. (ii) Contribution to the state of the art: new coil and machine topologies, and new approaches for design, analysis and simulation of superconducting machines are presented.",
