 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) nanoparticle coating with antibacterial properties that are comparable to those imparted by silver nanoparticles, but with significant lower cost.  The approach is to deposit and optimize MoSi2 nanoparticles coating on substrates such as 316L stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  Antibacterial, wear and erosion performance of the coating will be studied. \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide low-cost solutions to meet the demands in antibacterial applications. Given the problems of bacterial infections in society, the development of cost-effective antibacterial films on metallic and polymeric substrates that are significantly cheaper than current technologies could potentially be disruptive and would have broad applications in health care, food preparation and delivery, residence such as home kitchens and the transportation sectors. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit:\n\nThe main Aims of the SBIR Project were both commercial and scientific:\n\nCommercial:  To provide a safe and durable nanostructure antibacterial coating on product surfaces to inactivate bacterial and bio-film growth and thus minimize related losses from infections and material corrosion.\n\nScientific:  To understand the antibacterial efficacy and continuously refine the nanostructure coating topology in order to enhance and continuously upgrade the technology and its broader impact with the continued scientific understanding of the bactericidal, and materials morphology interactions.\n\n \n\nClear and first time evidence for claiming that less than 150nm durable nanostructure surfaces are able to eliminate various bacterial species, both pathogenic and corrosion causing.  See Figure 1.\nClear and first time evidence of the durability of the new nanostructure coatings on metals and plastics.\nComparisons with nanostructure coatings of titanium, carbon tubes were made.  \nClear and first time evidence that bacterial colonies and bio-films can be eliminated even for low humidity conditions with the special nanostructured surface coatings.  Figure 2.\nRetained the dimensional tolerance established by the original manufacturer for objects such as stainless steel power enclosures, and high temperature devices.\nNot alter the surface look-and-feel in any discernible manner. \nMaking the coating durable i.e. last in efficacy for several years (tests done are for about one year presently). \n\n \nBroader Impacts:  \n\n \n\nThis invention has broad public impact which could impact millions of people and reduce considerable social expenditure.  Hospitals and other medical facilities have a significant need for sterile and uncontaminated surfaces, both in surgical areas as well as in convalescence facilities, where patient exposure may be significant and resistance to such microbes may be lowered.  Much time and effort can be spent, for example, on sterilizing medical instruments, testing devices, and fabrics.  Disposable materials are also commonly used. Such disposable materials involve increased costs and increased waste, as well as potential safety issues associated with their disposal. The food-preparation and delivery industry (including restaurants) is another area in which presence of microbes (e.g., bacteria) can be problematic.  Food preparation facilities, if contaminated with microbes, can lead to contamination of food which may cause health problems when ingested.\n\n \nPROJECT OUTCOMES\n\n \n\n(i)                 The Phase-I findings are very encouraging in terms of efficacy against bacteria, virus and fungus.  A systematic study was carried out to understand best conditions for the nanostructures.   Successful adherent depositions were made on flat surfaces of stainless steel and plastic.\n\n(ii)              Stainless steel tubes of 44.5 mm and 50.8 mm internal diameters and 305 mm long were also coated in order to demonstrate nanostructure formation on internal curved surfaces.\n\n(iii)            The bacterial colonies were counted. Total 100% elimination of bacteria was noted with the nanostructure coated PVC surfaces, while the uncoated PVC promoted flourishing of bacteria significantly. Several tests on uncoated PVC surfaces indicated no bacterial inactivation.\n\n(iv)            Three FDA approved external labs were contacted and samples were sent blinded.   The nanostructured coated stainless steel and uncoated surfaces were tested against the pathogens and other muti-load bacteria.   The nanostructured coating had very high efficacy compared to uncoated surfaces.\n\n(v)               Other tests were conducted including JIS Z 2801: Japanese Standard Test for Antimicrobial Product Activity and Efficacy:\n\nA Standard Test Method for Determining the Activity of Incorporated Antimicrobial Agents in Polymeric or Hydrophobic Materials\nKirby-Bauer : Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) Testing \nMinimum Inhibitory Concentration Test (MIC Test)  \n\n\n..."
