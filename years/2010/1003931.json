 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) at Columbia University.  LDEO is located in Palisades, NY. The program will support ten students/year during a ten week summer research program. The intellectual focus is very broad as Lamont-Doherty has over 100 PhD level scientists, and the students have a wide range of mentors whom they can choose. Interns pursue a summer of research, interspersed with special semi-weekly lectures on topics like scientific writing, science careers, ethics, as well as research practicalities such as computing hardware/software resources, and methods for viewing/analyzing scientific data. The program ends with student-authored research poster presentations, including written abstracts and a final paper. This program is not a field-based program, but students have access to global databases and excellent computer equipment. Students will be encouraged to publish in peer-reviewed journals and participate in national conferences following the summer research program.",

Many are considering scientific research as a career, but all are curious about science and scientific research. \n\n \n\nTable 1.

The question can be one whose answer will contribute to the general progress of the scientific discipline.   It is also a question whose answer has societal relevance (Table 2).\n\n \n\nTable 2.
