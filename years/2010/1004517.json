  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFollowing the loss of stability of a homogeneous steady state a natural question is to understand the emergence of a new stable or meta-stable state.  When the perturbation of the unstable homogeneous state is localized in space this process is mediated by the formation of traveling fronts that propagate into the unstable state and select a secondary state in their wake.  Determining the front profile, its speed and the state selected are all interrelated problems.  The focus of this Postdoctoral Fellowship was to study this problem, which is referred to as wavespeed selection, in the context of systems of reaction-diffusion equations using techniques from dynamical systems theory.  \n\nThis primary outcomes of this research is related to some surprising ways in which this process is different for systems of reaction-diffusion equations as opposed to scalar equations.  For scalar equations, invasion fronts are characterized as pulled or pushed.  Pulled invasion fronts are driven by the instability of the unstable state ahead of the front interface whereas pushed fronts are driven by nonlinear effects.  In this fellowship, a large class of partial differential equations were considered where the mechanisms driving wavespeed selection do not always adhere to this dichotomy.  It was shown that systems for which the linearization about the unstable state has a skew-product structure where some components decouple from others can lead to unique invasion phenomena.  These subtleties are related to the ability of this class of equations to support invasion fronts where different components invade at different speeds.  \n\nThe primary outcome of the fellowship was to identify two different types of linear spreading speeds that occur in systems of parabolic partial differential equations.  Mathematically, these two speeds are distinguished based upon the analyticity of the pointwise Green's function in a neighborhood of its singularities.  When there is no analytic continuation then invasion phenomena is analogous to the scalar case.  When there is an analytic continuation then different phenomena can exist.  For example, the selected invasion speed may be slower than the linear spreading speed in this case -- a phenomena which does not occur in scalar equations.  As another example, the selected spreading speed may not be continuous with respect to system parameters when the linear spreading speed has this form.  \n\nA second major outcome of the fellowship was the characterization of secondary invasion speeds in model problem of partially coupled Fisher-KPP equations.  This model problem possesses a linearization with the same skew-product structure as before.  We discover the existence of accelerated fronts where the secondary invasion speed is advanced due to the influence of the primary front.  The precise invasion speed is determined and the mechanisms leading to the phenomena are identified.\n\nAdditional outcomes include the following.  Related to the discovery above, a characterization of which linear spreading speeds place a lower bound on nonlinear spreading speeds is determined.  The invasion speed in a class of Lotka-Volterra competition models is rigorously derived.  For invasion problems defined on cylinders, we prove that the linear invasion process always favors the formation of roll patterns.  The fellowship also contributed to the study of traveling pulses in a reaction-diffusion-mechanics systems for cardiac activity and a study of logarithmic switchback terms in singularly perturbed systems using the renormalization group method. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matt Holzer"
