 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schistosomes are blood fluke parasites that are significant pathogens of humans as well as domestic and wild vertebrate hosts. The schistosomes that occur in birds represent over 65% of known schistosome species diversity, yet they remain understudied. Bird schistosomes are also responsible for swimmer's itch in humans. In this project, schistosome diversity will be studied by targeted collecting of under sampled and high diversity areas. Identifications will be done using modern approaches to morphological and genetic characterization. The goal is to develop an evolutionary tree of schistosome species, describe the many new species discovered, and produce a monographic treatment for schistosomes. In addition, the resulting evolutionary tree will be used to study the evolution of traits within this clade, with broad implications for evolution within the family Schistosomatidae. This research will greatly increase our understanding of a globally distributed group of parasites and provide the tools necessary for species identification.\r\n\r\nThe project involves faculty from two EPSCoR states and fosters broad international collaboration in Argentina, France, Kenya, and China. The study will improve and build on a natural history museum collection of parasites that is globally accessible. Finally undergraduates and graduate students will be involved with and trained in all aspects of the project. Information generated by this project will be made available to scientists and the medical community, with outreach through K-12 education, and to the general public.",

Avian blood flukes are a relatively diverse and globally distributed group of parasites found in a variety of birds, mostly those associated with aquatic ecosystemas. They are most common in ducks (including domestic ducks) and their relatives such as geese and swans. Avian blood flukes are notorious for causing a condition in humans called cercarial dermatitis commonly known as &ldquo;swimmer&rsquo;s itch&rdquo;. This disease occurs in many countries on all continents outside Antarctica. It results from inflammatory reaction caused by fluke larval stages attempting to penetrate human skin. Despite long history of research on the group the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of avian schistosomatids are understudied. As the result, their systematics has been unstable. This project has done significant steps towards correcting the situation. Specimens were collected in several countries around the world as well as several parts of the United States. Both adult stages from birds and larval stages from intermediate hosts (snails) were collected and processed in laboratory using morphological and molecular approaches. The project had several important scientific outcomes. It provided a solid specimen base for taxonomic and phylogenetic conclusions that was used during the project and will constitute foundation for future research through specimens deposited in museum collections and accessible to all researchers. DNA sequence data are deposited and will be deposited in the GenBank database which is freely available to researchers and general public. The study by the UND team (in addition to the discoveries made by the UNM group) has revealed several new species of avian blood flukes from the United States, South America and Europe as well, in collaboration with the UNM team, &nbsp;interesting forms that parasitize domestic ducks and are responsible for dermatitis in Southeast Asia (China, Vietnam). A detailed survey of adult and larval avian blood flukes was conducted across North Dakota which has become the most comprehensively studied state in this respect. Molecular and morphological data has confirmed that the globally distributed genus <em>Dendritobilharzia</em> contains more than a single species as was thought previously, with at least 2 species distributed in the Unites States. Genera <em>Gigantobilharzia</em> and the most diverse genus <em>Trichobilharzia</em> proved to be non-monophyletic and thus need to be split into independent genera. This is particularly true for <em>Gigantobilharzia</em> which combined an array of morphologically dissimilar forms; molecular data provided a strong evidence that this is indeed an assemblage of not closely related species. Our results and specimens will allow parasitologists to more reliably identify these parasites and possible agents of the &ldquo;swimmer&rsquo;s itch&rdquo;. Our materials also provide a basis for testing hypotheses concerning parasite biogeography and host-parasite co-evolution with both definitive hosts (vertebrates) and intermediate hosts (snails). Improved molecular protocols developed during the project can be used by colleagues around the world.</p>\n<p>The project fostered national and international collaborations between several universities in the United States and research and public health institutions in Ukraine, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Kenya, Laos, Chile, Peru and Brazil. Students were active participants at all stages of this work. At the UND lab, 9 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students (one project entirely on blood flukes, others with overlapping elements) and 6 high school students had the opportunity to participate in mentored research related to the project. All students have been trained in numerous classical and modern parasitological techniques. Several of them presented the results of this work at scientific meetings and/or published in peer reviewed journals. Graduate students were able to participate in international expeditions which promoted their broader view of the world and science in different countries as well as cultural exchange. More importantly, all students (11 of them female students) other than 2 who are still undergraduates, successfully pursued their career goals as graduate students in professional schools, as educators or scientists. During the project, hundreds of UND undergraduate students learned about these parasites and the project in PI Tkach&rsquo;s classes. Eight visiting researchers (postdocs and graduate students) from the United States, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Poland, Brazil visited PI&rsquo;s lab and received training in various parasitological methods. Tkach gave a number of invited seminars and lectures coving the subject of the project to different academic and general audiences in the United States, Ukraine, Brazil, Chile and Peru. Tkach also led parasitological workshops on in the USA (e.g., to the participant of the American Ornithological Union meeting in Chicago), Ukraine and Peru. All these activities were aimed at broadening participation in research among students and understanding of science in general and goals of this project among general public.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/21/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vasyl&nbsp;V&nbsp;Tkach</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033630894_map--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033630894_map--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Distribution od snails infected with avian blood flukes in North Dakota.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033630894_map--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Distribution od snails infected with avian blood flukes in North Dakota.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of North Dakota showing collecting localities and presence/absence of avian schistosomatids (AS) in one of snail genera, Stagnicola, examined in the state.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susana Rios</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vasyl&nbsp;V&nbsp;Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Distribution od snails infected with avian blood flukes in North Dakota.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033388883_Trichobilharzia--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033388883_Trichobilharzia--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SEM of Trichobilharzia querquedulae\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033388883_Trichobilharzia--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SEM of Trichobilharzia querquedulae\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scanning electron microscope images of Trichobilharzia querquedulae, the most widely spread avian blood fluke in the world</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vasyl Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vasyl&nbsp;V&nbsp;Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SEM of Trichobilharzia querquedulae</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485032494766_ducks--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485032494766_ducks--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ducks in Vietnam.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485032494766_ducks--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ducks in Vietnam.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Free range domestic ducks in rice paddy in Vietnam, a situation conducive to spread of cercarial dermatitis (photograph by Vasyl Tkach).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vasyl Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vasyl&nbsp;V&nbsp;Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ducks in Vietnam.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033491297_Dendritobilharzia--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033491297_Dendritobilharzia--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stained mounts of Dendritobilharzia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1021431/1021431_10035842_1485033491297_Dendritobilharzia--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stained mounts of Dendritobilharzia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Light microscope images of stained and mounted specimens of Dendritobilharzia</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vasyl Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vasyl&nbsp;V&nbsp;Tkach</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stained mounts of Dendritobilharzia</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
