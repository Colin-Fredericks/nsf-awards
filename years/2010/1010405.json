 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop a new system for fabrication and manipulation of carbon nanotube (CNT) composites.  The system will use holographic optical trapping (HOT) with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a new form of nano-controlled photo-polymerization. This tool will allow the creation of a new class of carbon-nanotube polymer composite materials with unprecedented control over the material structure, including orientation, distribution, tangling and shape, in a variety of different polymer hosts.  Realization of these new material systems will facilitate systematic exploration of the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties and structure-property relationships in organized carbon-nanotube composites.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates not only the development of a new class of engineered materials but also to improvement of available nanofabrication methods and technology for multi-trap holographic optical trapping (HOT) systems. The new nanofabrication system to be developed will open new avenues for fabricating nanomaterial systems which were previously unsuitable for industrial fabrication.  The development of a system capable of producing moderate volumes of material creates a means for systematic study of the macroscopic properties of carbon-nanotube/polymer composite structures. One potential market for carbon-nanotube composites is as an alternative to Indium Tin Oxide (ITO).  ITO is widely used in the rapidly growing display market and in the infrared optical device market. However, due to the high cost and limited supply of Indium, alternative transparent conductors are highly desirable.  Additionally, there are well over a hundred published research groups pursuing optical trapping, primarily for biological research, who would represent a sizable market for advances in the HOT method.  This market demands continued improvement of technology, and the incorporation of these systems into complex microscope tools has piqued the interest of microscope manufacturers in active wave-front modulation devices as optional product accessories.",

Through nano-controlled photo-polymerization of this material we envision a system to fabricate organized carbon-nanotube polymer composite materials with precise nanotube orientation and distribution.  This new material fabrication technology enables understanding, testing and exploitation of the relationship between CNT composite structure and macroscopic material properties.\n\nThe achievement of this phase I effort has been a demonstration of the basic building blocks required to produce a small sample for simple testing of basic nanocomposite material properties. Compatibility of the optical trapping and photo-polymerization systems is demonstrated through successful optical trapping and manipulation of multiple particles in a solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes. The optical power required to maintain stable trapping of particles in this solution is low relative to the current power handling capability of the BNS spatial light modulator indicating that commercially available spatial light modulator technology is capable of patterning hundreds of particles into test samples without the need for major changes in the immediate future.  \n\nManipulation of multiple particles, trapped in solution, into arbitrary distributions can now be accomplished either manually or automatically through synchronized software and hardware implementation of opticaltrapping at the rate of approximately 285Hz.  These software developments take advantage of improvements in hologram computation speed and demonstrate feasibility of predesigned patterning and reduced production time of complex patterned test samples.\n\nTrapped arrangements of nanoparticles are frozen into a permanent material through photopolymerization of the surrounding liquid solution.  Nano-scale control of this solidification is enabled by the two-laser lithography technique developed by CU.  This technique violates the conventional diffraction limit on lithographic resolution by using a second laser to suppress material response at the periphery of the pattern.  Fundamental materials studies in this period have elucidated the role of polymerizable functionality, diffusion of multi-component initiators and escape of the inhibiting species from the solvent cage.\n\nThe high power microscopeobjectives typically used in trapping and nanolithography would normally limit sample depth to just a few microns, well below the interesting thickness for many materials applications.  This motivates a new form of 3D fabrication developed at CU called liquid deposition photolithography.  To demonstrate complex 3D structure with micron resolution and multi-mm scale, a two-component photopolymer was developed and used to fabricated complex gradient-index material stru..."
