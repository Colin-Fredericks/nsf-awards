The project will conduct interviews with both proponents and critics of the standards and identify theories of action for how these standards might influence the system. The various options for research will be considered by a broader group of mathematics education and policy researchers at a conference that will result in development of priority research agendas, including a description of indicators, existing measures, and measures that will need to be developed to conduct the research.  The project is appropriate for a RAPID because it enables timely collection of baseline data and information about how the standards are being received by key stakeholders both at the national and state levels.",
