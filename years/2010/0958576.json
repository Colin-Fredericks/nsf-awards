 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to obtain funding to acquire computing\r\ninfrastructure to perform cross-disciplinary research in artificial\r\nintelligence, natural language processing, bioinformatics, social\r\nnetworks and related fields. In particular, the projects that will\r\nbe supported by the infrastructure acquired include developing algorithms\r\nand architectures for large-scale ontology alignment, particularly in\r\nthe biomedical domain; mining Wikipedia and similar Web-based sources\r\nfor geographical, temporal and ontological information; performing\r\nnamed entity recognition in biomedical and other domains; performing\r\ncomputational motivational and content analysis of socially generated\r\ncontent such a blogs and micro-blogs; undertaking corpus-based computational\r\nlinguistics research in under-studied and possibly endangered languages from\r\nIndia and other locations; developing better-performing algorithms for gene\r\nexpression analysis; and developing, implementing and comparing algorithms\r\nfor protein structure prediction, particularly proteins that contain\r\ncoiled-coil structures. These projects deal with large amounts of data\r\nand information and processing such data and information requires large\r\namounts of computing power. Our proposal seeks to acquire adequate and\r\nflexible computing hardware to facilitate problem-solving in these and other\r\nareas, so that current and future problems can be solved felicitously. \r\n\r\nThe infrastructure acquired will enable cutting-edge research by Ph.D.,\r\nMasters and undergraduate students, including REU site students, in a\r\nvariety of cross-disciplinary topics that employ ideas and innovations\r\nin artificial intelligence, machine learning and information retrieval.\r\nFor example, the results of our research may enable creations of systems\r\nthat discover overlaps and matches among large medical ontologies so that\r\npainstakingly created domain-specific information can be fused, compared\r\nand utilized better; and may assist in creating programs that assist in\r\nautomatically understanding and/or visualizing content of socially-generated\r\nWebsites such as Wikipedia and Twitter.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL:\r\nhttp://www.cs.uccs.edu/~kalita.",
