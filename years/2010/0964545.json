The primary goals of this work\r\nare to (1) further open access to information people require to\r\neducate themselves and (2) make sharing information easier.\r\nParticular attention is paid to designing protocols that do not rely\r\non centralized control points, which are subject to attack.  The\r\ninfluence of patterns in human behavior on communication system\r\nperformance, energy efficiency, and security are being studied, and\r\nthe findings used to guide the development of better, user-aware,\r\ncommunication protocols.  Design and analysis of communication\r\nprotocols; defenses against side-channel attacks on portable\r\ncommunication devices; distributed system architecture; and\r\nenergy-efficient software systems play central roles in the work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project took two independent paths, one led by the PI and one led by the co-PI.\n\n----\nFrom the PI.\n\nThe Internet was once credited with broadening access to information, and the ability to share it.  However, this consensus has been changing over time.\n\n``The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.''\n  - John Gilmore, 1993.\n\n``I used to believe the Internet offered limitless opportunities for free speech; now I believe it is becoming a smorgasbord of opportunities for authoritarian control.''\n  - Simon Davies, 1998.\n\nThere are now many examples of the Internet being used against free speech.  It is fundamentally an infrastructure-based and largely centralized structure that concentrates communication in a few locations, where it is susceptible to attack.\n\nThis project has focused on developing technology foundations allowing normal people to communicate freely, without being subject to blocking, censorship, or surveillance.  The key idea is using direct and transitive communication among commodity smartphones.  Instead of talking to a cellphone tower or a wireless access point, you talk directly with another phone.  And if you want to get your message across town, it hops from phone to phone until it reaches its destination.  But that approach is challenging, and opens many questions.\n\n- How many people need to use the technology before your messages can reach the people you want to talk with?\n\n- What happens if an attacker tries to trick you into thinking he is someone else?\n\n- How can you stop spam and other network abuse when you don't trust anybody?\n\nIn this project, we pulled together a team of 15 students, most of them volunteers, to answer these questions and figure out whether it is practical to build a community network that will keep working even if someone pulls the plug on the Internet.  We learned a lot.\n\nWhen only 0.2% of the students on a college campus used our research prototype application, messages reached 85% of users, with user motion helping to spread messages.  One of the big challenges to using decentralized wireless networks is that malicious users can pretend to be numerous normal users, something called a Sybil attack.  We developed a defense against Sybil attacks that works even when nobody in the network is trusted.  We also developed a way to use predictable human motion to get messages to users quickly and privately.\n\nThe project continues, thanks to volunteers and an NSF technology commercialization program.  If you are interested in becoming involved, please contact us (http://1am-networks.com/).\n\n----\nFrom the co-PI.\n\nIn this project, we have worked on several aspects to realize the goal\nof WHISPER, including the following.  We developed defense against\neavesdropping attacks, censorship, and privacy leakage on mobile\nplatforms by uncovering a new class of UI State Inference and Novel\nAndroid Attacks and designing defense solutions for it.  We focused on\nthese three aspects to understand eavesdropping, censorship and\nprivacy leakage threats on mobile platforms due to the design of the\nOS platform and applications.

(3) Finally, we\nuncovered a new attack on mobile platforms such as Android that uses\nUI state inference to launch new attacks such as camera peeking, data\n(e.g., password) theft, and UI hijacking.  Finally, we investigated\nhow social network information can benefit the discovery of malicious\nactivities, which can improve the security and integrity of network\nservices.  We propose SocialWatch, to detect attacker-created accounts\nand hijacked acc..."
