 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mississippi State University (MSU) proposes a project to increase the number of students entering and graduating from degree programs in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, and Business Information Systems at four institutions of higher learning in the Mississippi. The project will have four major components:\r\n\r\n(1) A Leadership Experience in Computing program, focusing on the transition from community colleges into 4 year programs. It will provide full summer school scholarships to community college students, enabling them to take two college credit courses, one an iPhone/iPod Touch programming class, designed specifically to show that programming can be interesting and fun, and the other, a service-oriented class that shows how computing fits into a variety of career paths. \r\n\r\n(2) A Career Advisory Council that will engage local employers in order to get commitments to provide internships, interviews, and jobs for project graduates.\r\n\r\n(3) A recruiting campaign that will educate high school, community college, and undergraduate students on the wide range of career options in computing related fields. \r\n\r\n(4) The development of a community college-to-university articulation agreements.\r\n\r\nThe project will leverage existing relationships - between the participating community colleges and Mississippi's secondary schools, and between MSU and existing employers - to develop a seamless pathway between Mississippi's system of fifteen community colleges and MSU.",
