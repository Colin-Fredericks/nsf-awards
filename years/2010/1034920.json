The collective science and education strengths of Rutgers University, the N.J. Marine Sciences Consortium/N.J. Sea Grant College Program, Brookdale Community College, the National Park Service, and the Sandy Hook Foundation -- a nongovernmental organization, constitute the backbone of a partnership that is incorporating real-world geoscience programs into formal and informal science curricula and activities at the Red Bank Middle School. The school is revamping its science curricula to align it with the new state science standards which were just revised to include the Earth sciences.  The partnership is developing educational strategies to incorporate real-world science and technology into the new curricula with an emphasis on inquiry-based learning, integrated science topics, and the inclusion of technology.  Educational strategies also are being developed to enrich after school programs and enhance science content for field programs delivered at the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, National Park Service.",

Through this project, the  school revamped its science curricula which were just revised to include  the earth sciences.  Educational strategies also were developed to enrich after school programs and enhance science content for field experiences.\nThe partnership identified key strategies to  enable a middle school in an urban area to capitalize on active  research investigations underway at a nearby natural area to transform  its science curricula in a collaborative manner with scientists,  environmental managers and science educators.  Such a collaborative  approach helped to create a school culture that fosters cross-discipline  and cross-grade level interaction, forms cross-curricular linkages  between in-school, after school and environmental center programs,  aligns activities with core science standards, and integrates current  scientific content and technology into school programs.

A resource repository  was also created to provide teachers with field equipment (such as the  aquabotz) to support hand-on learning activities and field experiences  they can conduct on their own.\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/08/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Deluca"
