The International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2010) will be held in Toronto, Canada between May 10 and May 14, 2010. The conference provides these students with a platform to present their research results and allows them to participate in valuable discussions that will likely shape the future of this critically important field. The technical program is complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events, as it has in previous years. The wide variety and significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in both the technical program and the workshop program, provides opportunities for students to share, exchange and learn from each other. A Doctoral Mentoring Program is available for Ph.D. students in advanced stages of their research. This program will provide an opportunity for students to interact closely with established researchers, to receive feedback on their work and to get advice on managing their careers.",

It was scheduled before the conference's tutorials and workshops, which took place on May 10 and 11, and the main conference, which took place on May 12-14.  The doctoral mentoring consortium involved students from around the world.  NSF funding was used to cover expenses incurred by 43 US-based students traveling to attend the doctoral mentoring consortium and the main AAMAS conference.  The selection of scholarship recipients and the amounts awarded to recipients were based on the students' participation in the main conference (all scholarship recipients had authored or co-authored a paper in the main conference), as well as need and diversity considerations.\n\nAAMAS is the main international conference dedicated to agent and multiagent systems.  The conference series started in 2002 as a merger of three highly respected individual conferences (ICMAS, AGENTS, and ATAL).  Activities at the 2010 AAMAS Doctoral Mentoring Consortium included the following: (1) two talks on career paths from researchers in academic and industrial research; (2) presentations from 12 student presenters, divided into two parallel tracks; (3) a panel on future directions in multiagent research; (4) a poster session; (5) a group lunch and an informal evening reception; (6) a mentoring program pairing students to established researchers based on their research interests.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent Conitzer"
