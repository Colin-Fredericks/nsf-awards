Through this\r\nexperience, the students will be able to learn about each\r\nother's disciplines, linguistic properties of many interesting\r\nlanguages, tagset design, various supervised/unsupervised\r\napproaches to morphosyntactic tagging as well as acquire\r\nmathematical modeling and algorithmic skills -- all while\r\nworking as part of the research team.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the PI together with her students will\r\nexplore how cross-lingual correspondences can be used for\r\nscientific and technological benefit, and provide a better\r\nunderstanding of what linguistic properties are crucial for\r\nmorphosyntactic transfer.\r\n\r\nThis award will play a central role in expanding inquiry-based\r\nlearning, fostering student collaborations, and providing\r\nvaluable hands-on experience of highly practical work on\r\ndifficult, morphologically rich under-represented languages.\r\nThe impact of this project is expected to translate into\r\nsignificant gains in recruitment of minority students through\r\nresearch training in Computer Science and Linguistics. The\r\nundergraduates who work on this project will collaborate on the\r\nwriting of research publications and present at national\r\nmeetings so that they can contribute to the research culture\r\nwhile enhancing their research awareness.",
