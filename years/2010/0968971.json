CHOT was established in 2008 to \"conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and on-going organizational learning and ccultural change\" in healthcare systems.  \r\n\r\nPSU will serve as a catalyst for transformational change in US healthcare delivery through a focus on quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care processes and the integration of these processes with health information transformation technologies into a modern coordinated system.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed site will develop transformative approaches, demonstrate them in its partner healthcare organizations, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to regional and national healthcare CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. The proposed site will conduct interdisciplinary research with the theme of healthcare process excellence. CIHDS' core faculty have already developed a strong history of working collaboratively across multiple units, engaging healthcare providers as partners in applied research, and working closely with students to address research needs of the relevant industry partners. The wide scope of participation (expected from the potential members of the site) will enhance dissemination of results. Dissemination is also expected to occur via professional and academic associations and conferences, and special symposia. The proposed site plans to engage students and partners from diverse and/or under-represented groups.",
