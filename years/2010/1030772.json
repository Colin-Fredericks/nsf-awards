 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linear stability theory of equatorial currents will be extended to include wave radiation and vertical mixing.  Modal stability analyses of the equatorial current system will be performed using accurate representations of the mean state, including radiation boundary conditions and parameterizations of vertical mixing.  The extended theory and analyses will be used to examine both Rossby and Yanai type tropical instability waves.  Theoretical results will be synthesized with data from satellite altimetry, TAO moorings, and microstructure profiling.\r\n\r\nThe project has the potential to impact our understanding of climate by refining or changing our understanding of an important oceanic feature.  The project will revisit classical linear theory to incorporate effects that can account for radiation and mixing of energy.  While the focus of many studies of tropical instabilities is often to analyze complex circulation models, the proposed work promises to shed light on the fundamental processes that govern the stability of equatorial currents and their subsequent effects on ocean structure and dynamics.  In addition, the results could help to settle long standing questions over the stability of equatorial currents - namely where they obtain their energy and how they manifest.  In addition to the scientific broader impacts, the study will support the training of a graduate student.",

During an equatorial cruise in the Indian Ocean, we were fortunate to observe the passage of a Yanai wave packet, a close cousin of the tropical instability wave, in great detail. We were able to quantify fluxes of heat, mass and energy due to this wave.\n\nA particular focus was the turbulence that the waves cause, which appears to play an important role in El Nino, the Madden-Julian oscillation, and other tropical phenomena that affect the global climate. Besides turbulence in tropical instability waves, the results taught us an important lesson about a much more common phenomenon: stratified shear flows.\n\nStratified shear flows are ubiquitous in the Earth?s atmosphere and oceans.  These are winds and currents in which both velocity and temperature change with height. Because of the velocity change (shear), the flow is likely to be turbulent. Because of the temperature change (stratification), that turbulence is likely to transport heat vertically across the flow. For example, sheared currents near the ocean surface drive turbulence that transports heat from the atmosphere into the deep ocean, potentially mitigating global warming.  \n\nBased on the results of this project, we believe that turbulence in stratified shear flows can remain near a state we call \"marginal instability\", in which energy input from the mean shear balances energy expended in transporting heat.

Graduate student Lin Li has completed the bulk of her Ph.D. in physics studying that mystery as part of this project.\n\nAnother long-standing mystery is (or was) the cause of the so-called \"deep cycle\" of equatorial turbulence, a pulsation in turbulence strength that mimics the 24-hour solar cycle even though it occurs too far below the ocean surface to be affected directly by the sun. It turns out that marginal instability is the key to understanding the deep cycle. The ocean at the equator is marginally unstable, most of the time, down to nearly 100 meters depth.
