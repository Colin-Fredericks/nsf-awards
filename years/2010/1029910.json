The daily flow of inner city life, like social life elsewhere, alternates between online and offline spaces, requiring ethnographers to move accordingly to retrieve essential interactions and representations of self that group members display for one another.  This dissertation on digital lives of youth crews (sometimes called \"gangs\") in Harlem, New York advances data collection and data quality in the field of urban ethnography by capturing, integrating, and interpreting what happens in both the physical city and the digital spaces where people concurrently live.  The methodological objective is to create a new model for urban ethnography that supplements and synthesizes conventional ethnographic data drawn from face-to-face observation and interaction in a physical field site--fieldnotes and audio recordings--with the multimedia content that comprises social media sites (i.e., a profile, network of friends, and comments or conversations) and conversational bits of text from text messages.  The researcher applies these new methodological tools to the substantive and theoretical goal of understanding violence in the digital era.  Members of youth crews in Harlem live vast digital lives, communicating online with peers about music, sex, daily life, and, sometimes, violence.  When crew members make threats or coordinate confrontations on social media sites like Twitter, these exchanges sometimes result in violence.  How violence transpires or is diffused reflects complex processes from the social histories of those involved to how online comments are interpreted by the antagonists as well others watching the interaction, namely monitoring adults like clergy, concerned residents, and police.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  This dissertation research will help us to understand how and why Harlem residents concerned with violence--those perpetrating and responding to violence--engage digital media in the ways they do to find out what is and what is not different about violence in a digital world.  The research presents innovative forms of data and data collection techniques, and integrates online and offline data and observation to understand an offline outcome of primary social importance,interpersonal violence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Digital Street by Jeffrey Lane, Princeton University \n\nThis dissertation furnishes experience-proximate understandings of young people coming of age in a modern ghetto where those loving, fighting, protecting, and avoiding one another do so face to face and online.  This dissertation broadly examines the relationship between Internet and street life.  As it relates to violence, digital technology affords young persons resources to incite, sustain, dodge, and replace face-to-face aggression, as well as to negotiate issues in their neighborhood.  This dissertation considers simultaneously the view of adults interpreting and leveraging these same digital interactions.  How does online access to teenagers embedded in neighborhood violence offer new ways for street workers to intervene and for police and the District Attorney to investigate and prosecute violent crime?  How do these fresh sightlines onto street life interact with existing informal and formal social controls?\n\n            This research draws on three years of participant observation as a resident of Harlem engaged in a variety of neighborhood roles centered on street life as experienced by this generation of teenagers.  These include violence interrupter and outreach worker with a local anti-violence organization; consultant at a public defender office representing youth charged as adults; member of a local juvenile gang task force; counselor at a municipal youth employment program; cofounder and coordinator of a free community computer lab for youth and seniors; and, pick-up basketball player.  These roles have facilitated relationships with young persons involved in social scenes set on streets across Harlem and with adults concerned with these same young persons (parents, outreach workers, police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, etc.)  This fieldwork integrates face-to-face and online observation in the effort to stay where the action is.\n\n            My work allows us to understand several dimensions of youth violence in the inner city&mdash;these are three key sets of findings: \n\nFirst, most neighborhood gun violence is organized along geographic and sexual axes.  When young males shoot at each other, this exchange is locally understood in terms of their neighborhood (rivalry) and (sometimes overlapping) sexual histories with female partners.  Females have bigger and more geographically diffuse face-to-face and online social networks than males.  Young women are positioned at the interstices of males\u00c6 inter-neighborhood conflict.  Whether or not a female plays any part in a shooting, their peers often believe or act as if she has.  This dynamic stifles trust between the sexes beyond the level of any particular individual or event. \n\n            Second, when young people fight with fists, particularly females (who do not shoot each other), these episodes are often recorded and then broadcast widely online.  These \"fight videos\" may be spontaneous or planned&mdash;even staged.  As in criminal cases drawing on closed-circuit video of alleged crimes, fight videos are privileged as the record of \"what really happened\" on the street.  But the same individual(s) record, circulate, and call attention to a given video. This document serves to substantiate one side\u00c6s claim through the inherent \"truth\" of video, masking the skewed interests of \"the home team\" that produced the material.\n\n            Third, whether violence interrupters, mentors, and other \"old heads\" can intervene in young persons\u00c6 social worlds&mdash;preventing a fight or supporting young persons\u00c6 efforts to go to Job Corps or college&mdash;hangs in part on elders\u00c6 access to young people\u00c6s digital lives.  This online access is a function of norms around audience segregation (Goffman 1959) on social media platforms.  For example, when Harlem teenagers used Twitter and Facebook concurrently, channeling distinct conversations to different audiences, community elders missed the trouble teens reserved fo..."
