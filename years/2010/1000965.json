The high--?]level goal of the meeting is to bring the research community together in order to develop new technical approaches and to build research collaborations that will move the current research on a future internet to the next stage, where integrated design proposals are developed and prototyped. The approach, format and scope of the meeting is intended to facilitate an intense and substantial interaction over four days centered on creativity, multi--?]disciplinary collaboration, the building of research teams and the development and evaluation of promising design approaches. \r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit \r\n\r\nThe agenda of this meeting is centered on the generation of new ideas for a future Internet, the convergence and integration of new and existing ideas into coherent design approaches, and the creation of research teams with a suitable mix of skills, interests and commitments. Through this process, we anticipate that the research agenda can be sharpened and focused on important issues, and research teams can improve their vision of transformative research about future global networks. \r\n\r\nBroader impact \r\n\r\nThe meeting will further the objectives of conceiving a future Internet, which is an objective with broad payoff for the nation and the world. In terms of broader impact within the research community, participants with a breadth of skills and disciplines across the broader research communities will meet to expand upon their research ideas toward more overarching future internet architectures. The meeting has been sized to permit about 100 people to attend, so as to make the process available to many parties in the community.   \r\n",
