 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin will acquire a fluorimeter with the capability of measuring fluorescence lifetimes.  This award will provide an instrument to be used by a large group of researchers to investigate the fundamental photochemical properties of a variety of molecular and materials systems.  The areas to be investigated include electroluminescence, the rational design of new photoactive molecules, materials for solar energy conversion and measurements of excited state lifetimes.\r\n \r\nFluorimeters are spectrometers that measure the properties of the light emitted from a sample that has been promoted to an excited state by a light source.  These emission spectra, measured over a wide range of frequencies and time resolutions, allow determination of the nature of photoexcited states and their lifetimes. The configuration of this instrument will make it accessible to a large number of users in a variety of disciplines both inside and outside of chemistry. The instrument will be used in research and undergraduate laboratory classes including the departmental Freshmen Research Initiative.\r\n",
