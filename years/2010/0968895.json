 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific Project and Intellectual Merit: The grant will support theoretical investigations into the ultimate limits to the precision of optical and atomic interferometry. The research will exploit recent advances in the foundations of quantum mechanics and also in quantum information theory, to develop designs and models of quantum interferometers which have the potential to be orders of magnitude more sensitive than current devices. Interferometry is at the heart of much the science of precision measurement, and the work will lead to a new understanding of the limits imposed by quantum mechanics on the sensitivity of such devices. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Precision interferometry is the engine behind many types of sensing and measuring devices, such as atomic clocks used in GPS, optical interferometers used in sensitive magnetic field measurements, such as in medical magnetic imaging. Understanding the limits to the sensitivity of such devices could lead to breakthroughs particularly in such sensor technology and open new scientific and commercial vistas that exploit such sensitivity. The work is also at the interface of quantum information processing, which can lead to exponentially faster quantum computers. Two graduate students will be trained in this field of quantum atomic and optical interferometry, an interdisciplinary activity with synergy to a number of the most exciting and fast moving areas of quantum sciences and technologies.",
