Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and Colorado School of Mines (CSM) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with WPI as the lead institution. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe research efforts at the proposed Center will enable innovative recovery and recycling processing technologies.  The PIs will apply a systems approach to identify best strategies and build optimal recovery and recycling technologies.  The proposed research will include establishing methods to design metallic alloys that meet performance requirements while increasing recyclability; developing sensors to identify metals and separation technologies to sort the waste stream; and establishing materials sensors, processes and controls to achieve greater tolerance of scrap metal input for downstream recycling processes. The Center research projects will be multi-disciplinary and will involve faculty and both graduate and under-graduate students from a spectrum of disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe societal impact of the proposed Center includes the energy savings and emissions reductions that are inherent in increased resource recovery and recycling.   Materials recovery and recycling is practiced by diverse and often fragmented supply chain (scrap yards, municipal waste centers and others).  The proposed IUCRC plans to bring together industrial members from across this spectrum, and provide a forum where all can gain an understanding of the entire supply chain, identify issues, explore and develop innovative, integrated solutions.  Broadening participation is also a top priority for CR3, and will involve underrepresented minorities and women within the Center activities through targeted provision of research and educational opportunities for its graduates at companies that belong to the Center.",
