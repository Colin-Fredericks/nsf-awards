The TCSPC instrument allows measurement of excited fluorescent molecules in systems that contain a mixture of species with different lifetimes, and will be used in studies such as cellular signaling, enzyme catalysis and control, and cellular stress response. The instrument would be used by students in research and in courses, enhancing student recruitment into science and providing them training in advanced technologies. The results of the research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.",
