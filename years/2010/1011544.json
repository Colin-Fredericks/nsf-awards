 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorful pigmentation in animals is important in social signaling, mating behavior, warning coloration and mimicry, but little is known about its genetic basis and evolution. This study examines the evolution of genes and gene expression involved in the coloration of Anolis lizards.  These lizards are an ideal group in which to study the evolution of color because there are nearly 400 species and they show a variety of bright colors, particularly in the reds and oranges. Many species of Anolis have evolved similar colorful pigmentation although they are not close relatives; this means that similar patterns have evolved independently multiple times. This study will identify genes and genetic pathways associated with colorful pigmentation in nine species of Anolis, with an emphasis on genes involved in the production of red and orange pigments which are important components of Anolis color patterns. Because these red and orange pigments are major components of coloration in a wide range of animals, from arthropods to vertebrates, this study will have far-reaching impact on understanding the evolution of morphological diversity.\r\n\r\nAs part of this research undergraduates will be trained in a variety of field and laboratory research methods. Because color variation provides a striking example of evolution, the results of this study could influence public understanding of evolution. The results of this study will be featured in exhibits on evolutionary biology at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, thereby reaching a broad audience of educators, students, and the general public.",
