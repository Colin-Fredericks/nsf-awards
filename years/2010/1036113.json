 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diagrams are very wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, graphs, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, visualizations and animations. Diagrammatic representations significantly impact many aspects of human life and society ranging from art to science, from communication to education. The emerging science of visual analytics, which focuses on interactive use of diagrammatic representations for supporting human problem solving, is just one topical example of the need for studying diagrammatic representations and reasoning. In fact, there is a need for transformative advances in (1) understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, (2)understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication and collaboration among humans, (3) developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and (4) designing interactive environments for use of diagrammatic representations for supporting human reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis project provides support for the Doctoral Student Symposium at the Sixth International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams in Portland Oregon on August 11-14, 2010. The goal of the 1-day Doctoral Symposium is to provide senior doctoral students as well as recent Master's and Doctoral graduates engaged in research with an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field. A group of experts will be present to comment on the young researchers? presentations in an informal and constructive environment.",
