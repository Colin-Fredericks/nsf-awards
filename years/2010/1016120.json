A team of  MSU faculty and students will travel to GASU for workshops  addressing similar interests in science learning in informal settings. The team will also meet with community members of two villages (Ongudai & Kosh-Agach) in critical ecological and ethno-cultural areas of the Altai. \r\nThe MSU principal investigators are Michael Brody (Education), Cliff Montagne (Ecology) and John Fisher (Archaeology). The GASU coordinator of the workshop is Natalia Yurkova (Education & International Programs). In addition, Eleanor Abrams (Education) from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), representing school-based science learning with indigenous Altai people will participate in the workshops.\r\nThe workshops will address informal science learning in an ecological context and focus on issues of culture and diversity as they relate to indigenous populations in contrasting ecological and social systems.  Two separate one and a half day workshops in Ongudaisky Region and Kosh-Agachsky Region, Altai Republic will focus on native people?s understanding, values, interests and concerns related to informal learning settings and how these will influence our future research and education activities. \r\nThese workshops contribute significantly to our emerging understanding of science learning in informal settings. They address a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The inclusion of a school-based perspective merges our understanding of formal and informal science learning in these unique settings. This collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and will unite diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.\r\nThis work is expected to extend our understanding of science learning related to critical natural and cultural resources and their management. An understanding of how, why and where learning takes place will help extend the US and international research and education agendas related to informal and formal science learning, natural and cultural resource management and social and ecological sustainability.",

Our emerging theory of \"ethno-cultual pedagogical content knowledge\" is synthesis of our prior understanding in the USA of pedagogical content (Shulman 1986) and the native Altaian educators understanding of ethno-cultural pedagogy (Ushinsky 1988).  Our result include a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The MSU-GASU-UNH collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and unites diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.\n\nBoth the Yellowstone and Altai mountain systems are of global concern as part of worldwide natural and cultural resources impacted by pervasive development, recreation and tourism activities and climate change. The underlying theoretical foundation of \"ethno-cultural pedagogical content knowledge\" for informal environmental science learning is the basis for effective approaches to enable isol..."
