NSF helps provide the participation of a large and diverse group of burgeoning researchers in order to help foster the interchange of scientific information among young scientists. Broader impacts are the influence on the productivity and awareness of individual students. This conference series is of outstanding importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States. It offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists, especially from the United States and Canada but also including a significant number of outstanding foreign scientists. In addition, a one-day graduate student symposium in conjunction with the conference has been organized to introduce students to cutting-edge topics in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Student travel awards will be in the amount of up to $500; funds for 24 such awards are requested. The support of students through this grant makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.",
