In each case, the thermodynamics of growing these clusters by adding water incrementally is very similar to that of the binary (H2SO4)m(H2O)n system. We plan to compute binary (H2SO4-H2O) and ternary (H2SO4-H2O-NH3/amines) nucleation rates and comparing them with experimental observations by our collaborator.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George C Shields"
