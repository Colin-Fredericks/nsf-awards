 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This project will develop transcriptomics approaches to investigate gene regulation as a function of environmental cycles and in response to experimental manipulation. Currently, there are few tools to establish physiological state of marine zooplankton, in particular for oceanic species. Molecular approaches based on quantifying the transcriptome could serve as powerful tools to obtain a physiological profile for individuals and groups of individuals collected in the field. In combination with laboratory experiments, transcriptome analysis will provide a new approach to understanding organism-environment interactions in the pelagic zone.\r\n\r\nThe PI will focus on a model planktonic crustacean, Calanus finmarchicus, to develop the molecular tools. C. finmarchicus, a calanoid copepod, is highly abundant in the North Atlantic, with populations extending from the Gulf of Maine and Labrador Sea to the North Sea. Pyrosequencing and microarray technologies will be used to develop a diagnostic tool to determine physiological state in C. finmarchicus. The goal of having a measurement of physiological state is to determine if individuals in the population are growing, are synthesizing or catabolizing storage lipids, and are metabolically active and/or experiencing environmental stress. Specific objectives of this project include:\r\n\r\n1. High throughput sequencing of C. finmarchicus transcriptome from pre-adult (copepodid stage V [CV]) individuals representing distinct phases of the annual cycle (late spring-early summer, early fall, diapausing individuals).\r\n\r\n2. Analysis of the sequence data for discovery of seasonally regulated genes for the development of an ecologically relevant microarray. Probes for this microarray will include seasonally regulated genes, genes involved in the environmental stress response and control genes.\r\n\r\n3. Preliminary testing of microarray on existing samples collected from the Gulf of Maine and stored in liquid nitrogen, as well as on experimentally manipulated animals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: 1) Training of graduate and undergraduate students in these techniques will occur. At least two graduate students in Marine Sciences/Biological Oceanography will participate in the project and be trained in transcriptomics at the bench and in bioinformatics. Undergraduate students will participate in the project at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory through the NSF REU-site funding. Undergraduate training will be interdisciplinary and include both biological oceanography and molecular biology techniques. 2) Results and sequences obtained in this study will be contributed to databanks and made available to the general public. Sequences will be analyzed using clustering tools and annotated using gene ontology software, followed by sequence submission to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Gene sequence data for copepods in general are still sparse, and the planned submission will increase information available for calanoid copepods by ten-fold or more.",

However, predicting winners and losers is difficult, because biologists have in depth knowledge of only a few model species.
