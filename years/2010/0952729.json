 "awd_abstract_narration": "The LHC is expected to reveal the origin of particle mass and of electroweak symmetry breaking and provide access to new physics signatures that give insight into the fundamental nature of the universe. The top quark is a key player in this search for new physics, and this important relationship will be addressed in the work supported by this award. The primary purpose of this CAREER award is to enhance, strengthen and broaden Professor Schwienhorst's research program at ATLAS and initiate new activities in dissemination of LHC results to the general public using the Abrams planetarium on the campus of Michigan State University. This award allows for the expansion of the existing ATLAS single top effort at MSU (the Standard model (SM) single top group) to create a new group specifically devoted to new physics which can be addressed with the single top final state (the New Phenomena (NP) single top group). The PI has outlined an analysis plan leading from general searches for new physics in early data to precision measurements and specific searches with large data samples that require advanced analysis techniques. The results of this research will be relevant not only to particle physics but also to cosmology and astrophysics and our general understanding of nature. This work involves both graduate and undergraduate students in important roles in data analysis and communication of physics results. It connects particle physics to astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology through the Abrams Planetarium. The students, together with information graphics experts at MSU and planetarium staff, will build short self-contained modules about particle physics, the LHC, and the ATLAS experiment, initially for the Abrams planetarium, and later to be available for distribution to other planetariums around the country. The modules will be updated and expanded regularly as LHC results start to appear and a concrete picture of new physics emerges. The planetarium show not only will introduce a large general audience to particle physics but also will provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to learn about particle physics as practiced at MSU. This is an innovative contribution which significantly extends the reach of traditional particle physics outreach projects.",
