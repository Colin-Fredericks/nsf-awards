The purpose of the annual Larval Fish Conferences is to communicate basic knowledge about the functional biology and ecology of early life history stages of fishes (egg, larva and juvenile) and their importance to ecosystem processes. This award will be used to support travel by students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty to attend this conference and present their research findings relating to a symposium entitled \"Integrative Developmental Systems: Where developmental biology, physiology and ecology meet\". The symposium speakers represent a diverse group of scientists with respect to their gender, ethnicity, national origin, and career stage and their presentations will bridge of traditional boundaries between scientific fields. This conference will provide the opportunity for scientists from different backgrounds and countries, who normally do not attend the same professional society meetings, to interact, exchange ideas, and generate collaborations. Recipients of the travel awards will be selected based on the scientific quality of their abstract as well as their financial need, and efforts will be made to support female and underrepresented minority applicants.",
