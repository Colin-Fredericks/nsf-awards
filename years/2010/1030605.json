Additionally, this project will study the most marginalized sector of the environmental movement - the Global South. This research will be conducted in South America, Africa, and Asia in order to include Southern perspectives on global mobilization against ecological degradation, particularly from indigenous peoples and landless workers movements.",

The findings from this project are summarized below.\n\n \n\nFindings 1: Cycles of Climate Protest\n\n \n\nIn total, a newspaper-based protest event analysis yielded 86 protest events occurring during the annual UNFCCC climate negotiations from 2006 &ndash; 2010. These events were coded to reflect the event\u00c6s specific details and to classify their discourses and tactics as either contained, transgressive or hybrid. Overwhelmingly, the analysis supports the claim that the climate activist mobilizations at COP15 in Copenhagen were the largest, most diverse and ultimately disruptive mass demonstrations the UNFCCC had ever experienced. Beyond this though, are a number of other unique findings\nwith regard to the ebbing and flowing of transgressive vs. contained discourse\nand action.         \n\nFrom COPs12 to 16, the majority of events involved contained discourses (65%), followed by transgressive (23%) then hybrid (events featuring both contained and transgressive discourses; 9%). Likewise, tactics were primarily contained (63%) versus transgressive (37%). Yet when comparing variations in tactics and discourse over time, two spikes are notable.

They are as follows:\n\n\n-  given differential attribution of opportunity and threat, competition\narises amongst climate activists over access, resources and policy preferences;\n\n- a recognition of  the need to \u00e6radicalize\u00c6 by insider activists is fueled by lack of progress and civil society access within the institutional settings of the UNFCCC;\n\n- this recognition is further spread via diffusion of information and claims\nthrough existing relationships among insider activists and  brokerage of information and claims to new actors such as spillover\nactivists from the alterglobalization movement;\n\n- through diffusion and brokerage, several framing processes, namely frame bridging and frame amplification, develop to align multiple frames such as deep, social, politi..."
