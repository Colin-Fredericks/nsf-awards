 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several modern data mining applications involve predictive modeling on large \r\namounts of multi-relational data with added structures such as product \r\nhierarchies or social networks among customers. The broad goal of this proposal \r\nis to develop a comprehensive framework for predictive modeling on large, \r\nheterogeneous, multi-relational data based on  \"Simultaneous Decomposition and \r\nPrediction\" (SDaP) approaches that iteratively partition the problem into more \r\nhomogeneous and manageable pieces while concurrently building multiple  \r\npredictive models, one for each piece. Such approaches lead to simpler and more \r\naccurate solutions. The proposed algorithmic strategies that determine how many \r\nmodels to learn and where they should apply, which data to discard and which to \r\nkeep, how to learn multiple related tasks defined on  multi-modal data, and how \r\nto scalably implement the solutions on distributed computers,  provide practical \r\nsolutions to certain real-world problems  for which current learning and data \r\nmining techniques are  severely lacking. Application domains of ecology, bio-\r\ninformatics, market research and web mining are specifically identified and \r\ntargeted. \r\n\r\nThere are two broad research impacts of the proposed project: (a) it further \r\nvitalizes the research in data mining towards better algorithms for predictive \r\nmodeling on rich and heterogeneous multi-modal data, and (b) provides and \r\npromotes the SDaP approach as a fundamental data analysis tool across multiple \r\ndisciplines. The PI will organize a workshop and offer a tutorial at major data \r\nmining conferences to foster and promote research on various aspects of SDaP \r\nanalysis. Moreover, the curated complex datasets and software developed under \r\nthis project will be shared with the scientific community via a public web site \r\nas part of the proposed one-of-a-kind multi-relational data benchmarking \r\nfacility. The PI will further develop a novel graduate course on Modeling and \r\nAnalysis of Complex Data. Outreach modules that illustrate data analysis \r\nconcepts and capabilities at levels appropriate for pre-college students will \r\nalso be developed.
