The ultimate education instrument for the blind people is the Braille alphabet. The ability of reading and writing this alphabet is the key to spread literacy among the blind and for the blind to integrate into the workforce of the United States. Among many devices that support the literacy of blind, reading devices are extremely high-tech, but advanced writing devices do not exist. The main objective of this exploratory research is at this critical observation: \r\nDesign and create a portable, low cost and effective mechatronics based device for writing Braille letters on a standard paper. The device will be developed in consultancy with the National Federation of the Blind (NFB, Baltimore) and with the help of National Braille Press (NBP, Boston) and Visually Impaired and Blind User Group (VIBUG, Boston). \r\nThe methods to create the writing device is directly within the expertise of the PI, which is mechanical engineering design and mechatronics. With the support of NFB (see the support letter attached) and VIBUG, the device will develop with those who know the needs of the blind people community. The work undertaken here is a perfect fit for EAGER (Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research) as the project is multi-disciplinary and explatory in nature, and it is at high-risk/high-payoff scale targeted to surface the transformative research components in addressing a major problem of the blind. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n1.\tThe new writing device is a synergy of ergonomy, portability and low costs. The device will be shaped under these constraints. \r\n2.\tThe robust mechatronics based features of the device will accommodate easy writing experience for the blind. \r\n3.\tThe feasibility of the writing device will be thoroughly assessed by the help of subjects who will test the device. These feedback will not only improve the new device, but they will also advance the science in human factors and disability research in revealing the mechanisms as to how blind people read, write and sense the Braille. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n1.\tDissemination of the device in the United States will be explored via numerous companies that offer products to the blind people. The prototyping stage of the device will be supported in parallel by capstone projects at Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department, Northeastern University. These activities will have impacts on both mechanical and industrial engineering graduating class. \r\n2.\tThe availability of the new writing device will be extremely helpful for the blind people to become more successful at all levels of education and workforce. The device will accommodate rapid note taking in class rooms, and it will inspire poetry and literature among the blind people. \r\n3.\tTo inspire writing, PI's team will take part in organizing poetry and literature activities with the help of VIBUG. \r\n4.\tPIs outreach activities including underrepresented middle and high school students will be strengthened via the research progress attained within this project.",
