 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  This is an exploratory study of a potentially transformative technology: to read the base sequence of a single DNA molecule using a graphene nanogap.  Because graphene is a single atom thick, it is proposed that single- base resolution of the conductance can be readily obtained. Theoretical modeling shows that the expected sequencing error rate is 0% up to a nanogap width of 1.6 nm.  The proposed work will demonstrate that the sequencing technology is technically feasible.  It focuses on graphene nanogap fabrication, optimizing the graphene for applications in water, and demonstration of DNA translocating through the graphene nanogap.  Successful completion will open a new research field in graphene-nanogap-based DNA sequencing.  The expected ability to sequence large repeat-rich sections of DNA material (e.g., the Major Histo-compatibility Complex (MHC)), which plays a major role in the immune system), will open up new windows on the study of the human genome.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Scientific broader impacts relate to the possibility of developing a DNA sequencing methodology that works at the single molecule level and gets around the typical sample amplification steps.  The PI has established a significant record of mentoring females and underrepresented students of Hispanic, African American, and Asian/Pacific Islander heritage.  Graduate students from his group have moved on to elementary and community college teaching positions and to Ph.D. programs. The highly diverse student population of his urban university campus ensures that the project will continue to serve the NSF priority of broadening participation.  In outreach to the community, he has established a well-conceived plan for assisting local San Fernando Valley middle schools to implement the introductory physics standards prescribed by the California State Science Standards.",
