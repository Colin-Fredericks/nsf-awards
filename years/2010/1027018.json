 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\nThis project will develop a new type of digital publication for scholarly research, the digital essay. The digital essay is not simply an adaptation of standard printed articles to the technology of the browser with hyperlinks and tabbing. Rather, it is the creation of a fully supplied environment that includes access to primary and secondary sources on the given topic; a bibliographic data base; multiple views of the totality of sources; tutorials on theory, experiment, and historiography; and a collection of modular interpretive articles that are written from a variety of points of view for diverse audiences and that can be traversed via multiple pathways rather than in a fixed linear ordering. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nTwo closely related topics have been chosen for development into digital essays. They are central to the Project in History and Foundations of Quantum Physics, an international cooperation of researchers interested in the history and foundations of quantum physics initiated jointly by the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. The first topic is the birth, development, and transformation of the so-called Correspondence Principle. The second is the transition from dispersion theory in the old quantum theory to matrix mechanics (with special attention to the contributions of American physicists Slater and Van Vleck). From these elements emerge the intellectual merits of this project. It will provide new perspectives on the transition from the old quantum theory to modern quantum mechanics by permitting unlimited depth and breadth of analysis, immediate and complete access to the relevant source materials, and, for the novice, a graded, yet honest and rigorous initiation (because of the heavy use of primary sources) leading all the way up to the current state of the art.\r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nBecause the very idea of the digital essay in the sense outlined above and the attendant digital tools are innovative and versatile, the project can be expected to have a transformative impact not only in providing an unprecedented richness of organized resources but also in terms of encouraging others to begin to explore the possibilities of this new mode of scholarly publication, which is likely to facilitate collaborations between researchers on new and already existing digital projects in a broadly interdisciplinary manner. It may also lead to the development of entirely new methods for conducting scholarly research and transmitting results that will be applicable to a wide diversity of fields of inquiry.",

A digital essay consists of a set of web modules replete with hyperlinks that can be traversed via multiple pathways rather than in a fixed linear order. The genesis of quantum mechanics in the first quarter of the twentieth century provides a fertile testing ground for this new genre. The story of the genesis of general relativity can be told from the point of view of a single protagonist (Einstein) and involves only one clearly delineated area of physics (gravity). Telling the story of the genesis of quantum mechanics requires taking into account the perspectives of multiple protagonists (at a minimum: Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Sommerfeld, Born, Heisenberg, Dirac and Schroedinger) as well as multiple areas of physics (ranging from electrodynamics to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to spectroscopy involving atomic modeling based on celestial mechanics).&nbsp;A concrete example we envisioned for a digital essay in the history of quantum physics was to trace the work of the American theoretical physicist John H. Van Vleck against the backdrop of the transition from the old quantum theory to the new quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s. Before the start of this NSF project, one of us (Janssen) had already written a paper (co-authored with the Pittsburgh physicist Anthony Duncan) focusing on Van Vleck's work on optical dispersion in the context of the old quantum theory. This paper takes up an entire issue of a journal and reconfiguring it as a digital essay would make it much easier for a reader to disentangle its various strands. As part of this NSF project, Janssen and his RA for the project, Charles Midwinter, wrote another lengthy paper on Van Vleck's work on electric susceptibilities in the context of the new quantum mechanics. As demonstrated in this paper, Van Vleck used essentially the same techniques in these two different projects pursued in the context of two different theories. This made the story of the genesis of quantum mechanics as seen from the perspective of Van Vleck, an important but not a leading protagonist, especially amenable to the format of a digital essay. The two main strands, dispersion and susceptibility, would intersect in a module devoted to the technical machinery developed in the old quantum theory and adapted to the new quantum mechanics.&nbsp;As the development of the tools to create digital essays by the Digital Humanities groups we partnered with took much longer than expected, no digital essays were actually produced. Instead, a two-pronged approach was followed. Rynasiewicz continued to develop the technical expertise needed to create digital essays. He taught a computer science course on ontologies and knowledge representation and continued to have extensive exchanges with scholars and staff in the digital humanities. Janssen continued to study other episodes in the genesis of quantum mechanics. The idea of eventually presenting the results of these studies in the form of digital essays greatly influenced the way he wrote them up. This is illustrated by two episodes studied with support of this grant. The first is about work of Russian-American physicist Paul Epstein, in 1916 and in 1926, on the Stark effect, the splitting of spectral lines by electric fields, in the old and the new quantum theory, respectively. The second is about the unified formalisms tying together different formulations of quantum mechanics (mainly matrix and wave mechanics) developed by Pascual Jordan and John von Neumann in 1927. The lengthy papers resulting from these investigations, written by Duncan and Janssen, are built around detailed commentaries on their sources (published papers, primary as well as secondary, plus correspondence and research manuscripts) inviting the reader to study those along with this commentary. In a digital essay such commentaries would naturally be turned into modules that can be traversed as parts of different paths through the source material.
