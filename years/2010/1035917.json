 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the design of innovative routing,\r\nplanning and coordination strategies for robot networks, and their\r\napplication to oceanography.  The approach is organized in three\r\nsynergistic thrusts: (1) the application of queueing theory and\r\ncombinatorial techniques to networked robots performing sequential tasks,\r\n(2) the design of novel distributed optimization and coordination schemes\r\nrelying only on asynchronous and asymmetric communication, (3) the design\r\nof practical routing and coordination algorithms for the USC Networked\r\nAquatic Platforms.  In collaboration with oceanographers and marine\r\nbiologists, the project aims to design motion, communication and\r\ninteraction protocols that maximize the amount of scientific information\r\ncollected by the platforms.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses multi-dimensional problems of relevance in\r\nEngineering and Computer Science by unifying fundamental concepts from\r\nmultiple cyberphysical domains (robotics, autonomy, combinatorics, and\r\nnetwork science).  Our team has expertise in a broad range of scientific\r\ndisciplines, including control theory and theoretical computer science and\r\ntheir applications to multi-agent systems, robotics and sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a positive impact on the emerging\r\ntechnology of autonomous and reliable robotic networks, performing a broad\r\nrange of environmental monitoring and logistic tasks.  Our educational and\r\noutreach objectives are manifold and focus on (1) integrating the proposed\r\nresearch themes into undergraduate education and research, e.g., via the\r\nexisting NSF REU site at the USC Computer Science Department, and (2)\r\nmounting a vigorous program of outreach activities, e.g., via a\r\nwell-developed collaboration with the UCSB Center for Science and\r\nEngineering Partnerships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project investigated algorithms for coverage, spatial detection, optimization, path planning, load balancing, geometric reasoning, and risk-aware stocahstic planning for autonomous underwater vehicle operations. The distributed environment partitioning problem consists of designing control and communication laws for individual robots such that the team divides a space into regions in order to optimize the quality of service provided. Coverage control additionally optimizes the positioning of robots inside of a region. The project investigated a comprehensive set of scenarios with different communication protocols and spatial constraints. In the detection problem, the optimal routing policies are considered for a UAV performing surveillance, which surveys a set of regions, collects the information and sends it to a fusion center. In path planning, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and optimal traveling salesman tours are investuagted, with applications to vehicle routing, robotic path planning or monitoring. One of the novel aspects of the research is to incorporate time-varying or stochastic attributes. In load-balancing, the project investigated the k-balanced partitioning problem, which asks for a partition of the n vertices of a graph into k sets of size at most &lceil;n/k&rceil; each, such that the number of edges connecting vertices in different sets, called the cut size, is minimized. An algorithm with provable guarantee of approximation quality is designed. The project also investigated the complexity of combinatorial geometric structures under data uncertainty, including worst-case size and computational complexity of convex hulls and voronoi diagrams. Finally, the project developed planners that make use of predictive ocean models (e.g., ROMS) to develop plans that minimize the risk at the surface for AUVs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn each of these areas, the project contributed novel technical problem formulations and designed new algorithms solving those problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Subhash Suri"
