 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for Federated Logic Conference\r\n\r\nThe Federated Logic Conference (FLoC)is a back-to-back event of all the major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods. These include: \r\nConference on Computer-Aided Verification (CAV)\t\t\r\nInternational Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP)\r\nInternational Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)\r\nIEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS)\r\nConference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA)\r\nInternational Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)\r\n\r\nWhile the participating conferences are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every three-four years. The number of participants is near one thousand, and a third to one half of the participants are expected to be young researchers. To ensure that US-based students are able to attend, this grant provides travel support.  The Federated Logic Conference brings together the following major events in Formal Methods, ranging from theory to applications in computer science and software engineering. The support is provided through cooperation of CISE directorate's computer science theory and software science/engineering programs, as well as the MPS directorate's mathematical sciences division.  Support for these foundational topics is important to enhance research in many areas, including the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal Methods. It is also an outstanding training opportunity for young researchers, as it offers them a grand view of the whole area.  Support for this grant is provided cooperatively from the NSF directorates of Computer & Information Science and Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
