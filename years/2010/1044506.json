 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support efforts to plan, conduct and evaluate outcomes for a three-day symposium, WEBS: Women Evolving Biological Science, aimed at issues related to the transition of women from early career stages to tenure track positions and leadership roles in academic and research settings.  WEBS targets early career women in the Biological Sciences with a focus on women who have earned their doctoral degrees within the past two to eight years and who do not have tenure.  WEBS participants will be current post-docs, research scientists and assistant professors who face the critical transition period from graduate studies to permanent research and teaching positions.  WEBS includes a component of research and evaluation that addresses what challenges early career women in biological sciences face, how these can be addressed, and how can effective professional development experience be delivered to early career women in the biological sciences in order to improve attrition at this stage.  This symposium represents a new partnership with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), an NSF-funded research center that provides a working environment for fertile interactions among scientists.  This partnership with NESCent will create opportunities to foster professional development as well as research collaborations among both junior and senior female scientists in the disciplines of ecology and evolution.  \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of WEBS is to significantly increase the retention and promotion of women, including women from underrepresented groups, in the biological sciences to create greater diversity in academic and scientific leadership.  Retention of women is critical for fostering diversity and innovation in research and teaching institutions.  Equal representation of women in leadership roles in academic settings will positively influence all aspects of the university community. This symposium targets future leaders and equips them with the information and resources needed to successfully navigate the tenure track and have thriving careers and personal lives.",
