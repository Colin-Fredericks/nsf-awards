This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded conference by obtaining travel support for up to 25 from US-based students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the ISCA conference in June, 2010 in San Malo, France.",
