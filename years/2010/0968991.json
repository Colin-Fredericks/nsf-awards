Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with BYU as the lead institution. \r\n\r\nSince the development of UAS is critical to national security CUAS aims to be the focal point for storing and disseminating information about UAS of all sizes, from micro to large. The proposed Center has identified some of the challenges to overcome in order to establish UAS dominance in the US. The research led by the Center will lead to new concepts, technologies, insights, and tools for UAS. BYU and UCB plan to use the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish the proposed Center?s organizational framework, and to establish research projects of greatest relevance. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the Center include curriculum design, community outreach and training the next generation of UAS researchers. BYU and UCB will work with industry and government sponsors to provide opportunities to students to work on high-impact, cutting-edge research. The Center also plans to attract women and under-represented minority groups as students in the Center.",
