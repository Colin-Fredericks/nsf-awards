 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nThe X-ray Computed Tomography with loading capabilities will be used to study: a) granular material crushing and evolution of granular material fabric during crushing; b) evaluation of deformation of the ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and bonding materials under stress of Magnetostrictive-Piezoelectric Laminates to optimize performance; and c) the performance of Magnetorheological Elastomers (MRE) during compression loading leading to a more fundamental understanding of its performance and thereby facilitating the creation of the next generation of MRE materials. \r\n  \r\nRowan University and Southern New Jersey will be positively impacted by the acquisition of the equipment by providing undergraduate and graduate students with training in use of cutting edge technology and expanding the equipment available for research at the South Jersey Technology Park.  Undergraduate students will be a vital part of the proposed research especially through the Engineering Clinics.  The timely acquisition will also enable various other research projects especially with the addition of the medical school to Rowan University.  Every effort will be made to include minorities and women in the research.  As a result of the equipment acquisition and research that will be enabled, the research team expects some publishable results, which will be widely disseminated.  The acquisition of the apparatus will also enable expanded opportunities for foreign collaborations.  The PI and co-PIs have also been involved with various outreach efforts and the preliminary research will be incorporated into these outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF award allowed Rowan University, a public institution in Southern New Jersey to purchase a specialized X-ray Computed Tomography Apparatus (XCT), which has compression loading capabilities.  The purchase of the equipment including setup of the apparatus was completed in June 2010.  Since then several graduate and undergraduate students have been trained in the use of the equipment including several who were funded by the University.  The students have also been able to further their research skills and have enabled them to pursue graduate studies at Rowan University and other institutions.  This has enabled development of a high technology focused workforce in this area, with critical job skills.  \n\nThe equipment has been used for studying the behavior of sands especially the effect of morphology on its strength properties.  The equipment has provided valuable insight on how sand crushes during loading and is especially useful in characterizing the behavior of sands with softer mineralogy such as calcareous sands.  The equipment has also enabled detailed geometry of sand particles to be obtained so that modeling of these particles can be improved to better understand how these natural materials will behave on slopes, mudslides, and under different loading schemes including extreme events such as earthquakes and hurricanes.  The equipment has also enabled studying how particles pack naturally when deposited and how particle characteristics impact deposition.  This is especially useful in understanding natural deposition characteristics under different environmental conditions and for different particle characteristics.  It enables one to better understand how these materials will behave during different loading conditions and which particle characteristics are critical in obtaining a more stable configuration.  The equipment has also been used to determine changes in how particle arrangement changes during compression loading.  This is especially useful in obtaining a better understanding of the regions of shear that develops especially in sands.\n\nIn addition, a class of smart materials namely Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) have also been studied using the equipment.  MREs are comprised of highly compliant hyperelastic matrix materials combined with magnetic filler particles.  Primary interest in MREs as a class of smart materials lies in their ability to change shear stiffness under the effect of a uniform magnetic fields.  This has led to an understanding of MREs as developing magnetic torques within chains of particles which in turn affect the surrounding matrix even though most works utilize soft-magnetic iron particles which are magnetically isotropic (though various particle geometries impart some preferred orientation).  This work addresses the fundamental difference in behavior between MREs formed from soft-magnetic filler particles, whose behavior is driven by local demagnetizing effects between particles aligned in chains, and those formed with hard-magnetic particles that have a preferred magnetic axis and therefore generate magnetic torques at the individual particle level.  This fundamental difference leads to definitions of several magneto-mechanical symmetries. To better assess the effects of these symmetries on material rheology and to subsequently exploit them in the development of the next generation of MREs it is necessary to quantify particle shape, size, and spatial distributions of sample materials.  XCT characterization has shown that strong particle spatial alignment in MREs, typically thought to occur when subjected to a strong magnetic field during curing, does not occur for hard and soft-magnetic materials tested.  This is in contrast to alignment of magnetization which does occur for MREs with hard-magnetic filler particles.   This is a critical finding in better understanding the behavior of these smart materials and in developing better material models.\n\nInternational collaboration wi..."
