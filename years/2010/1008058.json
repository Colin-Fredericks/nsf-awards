The bodies are composed of\r\nnonlinearly elastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or\r\nmagneto-(visco-)elastic materials.  In each case, properly\r\ninvariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general\r\nnonlinear constitutive equations are used.  The goals of these\r\nstudies are to discover new nonlinear effects and new kinds of\r\ninstabilities, determine thresholds in constitutive equations\r\nseparating qualitatively different responses, determine general\r\nclasses of constitutive equations that are both physically and\r\nmathematically natural, determine how existence, regularity, and\r\nwell-posedness depend on material behavior, contribute to the\r\ntheory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and\r\ndevelop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective\r\ncomputation for problems of solid mechanics. \r\n\r\n     For treating the behavior of both new technological\r\nmaterials and old biological materials, such as living tissue,\r\ntraditional theories, based on such simplifying assumptions as\r\nsmall deformations and linear response, may well fail to capture\r\nimportant physical phenomena and may, in fact, give misleading\r\ninformation.  E.g., the study of a specific problem for a\r\ntraditional theory may indicate that a dangerous instability\r\noccurs in a solid body when an externally applied load or\r\nfrequency exceeds a certain threshold.  An analysis of the same\r\nproblem without the simplifying assumptions may well show that a\r\nlarge class of materials give rise to instabilities at thresholds\r\nmuch lower than those predicted by simplified theories.  Since\r\ncorrectly formulated exact nonlinear problems of solid mechanics\r\nseldom can be directly subsumed under available mathematical\r\ntheories for treating the governing equations, one purpose of\r\nthis project is to develop new mathematical techniques to handle\r\nsuch problems.  These techniques can treat whole ranges of\r\nmaterials at one time.  The results have consequences for\r\nstructures under loads (bridges, buildings, biological\r\nstructures), for control of \"smart\" structures, and for\r\nmicro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMs).",
