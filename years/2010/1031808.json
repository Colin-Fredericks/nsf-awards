 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This proposal is to conduct a number of hydrogeologic experiments in ocean crust on the east flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The aim of the experiments is to study the movement of fluids, chemicals and microbes within the ocean crust between drill holes completed by the Integrative Ocean Drilling Program. The work will be the first to run a long-term cross-drill-hole test in the ocean crust. One and two years following the Integrative Ocean Drilling Program expedition in  2010, the down hole instruments will be serviced and samples collected from multiple depths in the hole.  Three-dimensional numerical modeling will evaluate how flow works within the oceanic crust. Taken together, the proposed work will constrain heat transport, chemical transport, and sub-seafloor microbiology making the results of value to many communities.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will train graduate and undergraduate students and will leverage off of an existing education and outreach program already in place for the Integrative Ocean Drilling Program expedition in 2010.",

Water flowing in and out of the seafloor may travel long-distances within the volcanic ocean crust, rock layers made of basalt (the same rock type that forms the Hawaiian Islands). This project is helping to understand how the water moves through the crust, what drives the flow, how quickly it moves, what impacts this water has on the crust and ocean, and how this water influences vast populations of microbes (bacteria and similar organisms) that live deep below the seafloor. We are accomplishing these goals using subseafloor observatories placed in deep boreholes. These observatories, called \"CORKs,\" include instruments to monitor pressures and temperatures in the crust, and to collect fluid and microbial samples. In addition, we have used these CORKs to run a tracer experiment in the ocean crust, using a dissolved gas to determine the rates and patterns of fluid flow below the seafloor. <br /><br />The tracer experiment shows that water in the crust flows both north and south from the injection hole, but the dominant natural flow direction is to the north. The observed rate of tracer transport was ~2 m/day, which is fast for groundwater flow, in general, and much faster than flow rates estimated from separate thermal and chemical observations. These differences can be explained if most of the fluid flow and tracer transport occurs within a very small fraction of the rock, probably much less than 1%. This is consistent with the upper ocean crust being highly variable in properties, both because of how the crust was built by volcanic eruptions, and because of how the crust has become modified as it ages. Future models that include reactions in the crust will need to include this kind of extreme focusing of fluid flow, and consider how variability influences the microbes that live in the ocean crust. <br /><br />The water flowing through the volcanic ocean crust can't get in and out through thick layers of marine sediments, but instead commonly flows through extinct volcanoes (\"seamounts\") that poke through the sediments. Pairs of seamounts that allow water to flow into the crust (\"recharge\") and flow from the crust (\"discharge\") can be separated by tens of miles. Warming from below the crust drives this fluid flow. We completed the first three-dimensional fluid and heat flow computer models of this process, flowing between seamounts that are ~30 miles apart. Computer simulations shows that the sustainability of a hydrothermal siphon depends on the ease of fluid flow through the crust (permeability, k) and the area over which each seamount is exposed at the seafloor (area, A). Flow between widely spaced seamounts is sustained when there is a big difference (10 to 100 times) between k and/or A of the two seamounts.
