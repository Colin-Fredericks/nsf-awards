 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microfabrication, the process of fabrication of miniature structures with dimensions of 1micrometer or less, is a critical area to many branches of science and engineering. Because of the growing importance of this area, there is a need for engineers and scientists educated in microfabrication. This technology is fundamental to modern engineering and science, and it is important to educate students in this area from the beginning of their undergraduate career. A substantial investment in the physical facilities was made and now the challenge is to integrate this topic into the curriculum. This project introduces microfabrication technology through lectures, demonstrations and even experiments in freshman classes across several disciplines (Engineering, Chemistry and Physics). Junior level courses from several departments integrate a microfabrication module into the curriculum. In the students' senior year there is an opportunity to take a multidisciplinary microfabrication capstone course, including a complete introduction to clean room theory and practice. Assessment is done for each level of the project, and assessment results are used to continuously improve the course over time and gauge success in attracting students into this area. This multidisciplinary approach demonstrates that microfabrication is based on many disciplines and vital to most modern technologies, including many electrical, mechanical, and chemical devices, and others. Ultimately, this will result in graduating engineers and scientists who know about microfabrication and understand how it fits in with modern science, engineering and technology.",
