 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Training Group in logic and dynamics at the University of North Texas seeks to integrate faculty research with the training of postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students in mathematical sciences. The faculty associates (Gao, Jackson, Mauldin, Urbanski) in this project represent a unique blend of research interests in the areas of logic and dynamics, and in particular the exciting interactions between the two fields. The trainees in this project will be exposed to a wide range of research topics from descriptive set theory to ergodic theory, and from definable equivalence relations to infinite iterated function systems. It is expected that they will be attracted by the underlying connections among these topics, and they will make further contributions to the fields through their research. \r\n\r\nThe activities in this project include undergraduate research colloquia, supervised undergraduate research projects, research seminars, annual mini-conferences, biannual research workshops, and teaching workshops. By a thorough mentoring process and other community-building interactions, the participants of the project will experience a full range of training and will be fully supported financially, intellectually, and professionally. It is expected that the activities will produce high-quality research results on all levels. It is also expected that faculty research productivity will be enhanced because of interactions and collaborations in the project. The Research Training Group strives to increase the number of students (both graduate and undergraduate) pursuing a mathematics degree and career, and in particular to increase the number and percentage of members of underrepresented groups pursuing advanced mathematics degrees. The activities and objectives of the project are carefully designed to address the current challenges and opportunities in the North Texas region.",
