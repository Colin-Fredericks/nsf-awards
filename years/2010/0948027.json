STEM career interests, strengthening UW?s collaborations with its partners, utilizing cyber infrastructure in GK-12 programs, and sustaining the project. The innovative approach is to use cyber infrastructure for spread of ee-nanotechnology. \r\n\t The activities to be conducted include involvement of Fellows, teachers and students with ee-nanotechnology projects, seminars, various collaborations; Fellows? service learning from G10-12 teachers and students; participation of teachers in UW?s classes and research works; joint-development of STEM curricula by teachers, Fellows and mentors; integration of the project into UW graduate program; and expansion of cyber infrastructure for GK-12 programs. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\tThe project will enhance GK12 Fellows? understanding of ee-nanotechnology while improving their communication, team building and leadership skills. G10-12 teachers will improve their STEM content knowledge and instructional strategies. G10-12 students will become more interested in STEM careers. UW will benefit from institutionalizing K12 STEM partnerships in its graduate programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These students built Wilson-Cloud chambers to detect radioactive particles, used different colored candies to learn about light absorption and designing materials to absorb light for solar cell applications, became &lsquo;geologists for a day&rsquo; as they explored current issues related to petroleum engineering, and gazed into the future of DNA nanotechnology and DNA origami.
