 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine geographic patterns of variation in DNA sequences to delimit species in a widespread group of eastern North American salamanders (the Plethodon glutinosus group). These salamanders are often the most abundant vertebrates in forested habitats and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. However, due to their overall similarity in appearance and ecology, identifying the number of species in the group has been problematic. The investigators will use a novel combination of genetic, physiological, and microclimatic data to discover species, and to explore the roles that stasis and divergence in the ecological niche play in the origin and maintenance of species lineages.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role that the ecological niche plays in generating and maintaining species boundaries will advance our knowledge of how species will respond to rapid changes in climate. Resolving uncertainty surrounding the species-level taxonomy of the Plethodon glutinosus group will have immediate conservation implications in rapidly developing regions of the southeastern United States. In addition, the proposed research will provide training in evolution, ecology, and conservation biology for a postdoctoral student, two graduate students, and several undergraduate researchers.",
