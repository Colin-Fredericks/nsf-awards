This project will focus on stars that are more massive than the Sun.  The investigators will obtain and analyze images from satellites and from ground-based telescopes to uncover planets of many different types, and will examine whether planet sizes or star/planet separations depend on the temperature or chemical composition of the parent stars.  One major goal of the project is to compare large new data sets with the predictions of theoretical models of planet formation.\r\n\r\nThis project will include undergraduate students, who will receive training in scientific computing, data visualization, and statistical analysis.  Dr. Carson will also continue his activities in public outreach, presentations to K-12 students, and teacher training.",

Among its many achievements, the project resulted in the discovery of the &lsquo;super-Jupiter&rsquo; Kap And b, which changed scientists&rsquo; view of the universe by showing for the first time that larger mass stars (like ~2&times; solar mass) are perfectly capable of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; planet formation (see accompanying figure). The project also produced the most accurate population statistics to date for wide-separation substellar companions to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Additionally, the program resulted in the discovery of myriad new circumstellar disks (see accompanying figure), which has advanced scientists&rsquo; understanding of the dynamical interactions between extrasolar planets and the circumstellar disks in which they reside. Observations of the AU Mic circumstellar disk revealed never-before-seen ripples propagating through the planet-forming disk at speeds up to 40,000 kilometers/hour.
