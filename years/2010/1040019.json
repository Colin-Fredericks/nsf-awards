 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to establish a versatile, designated light source in northern Alabama to support the area?s wide range of research activities encompassing optical frequency metrology, nanophotonics, plasmonics, micro-fabrication, and optical sensing. The approach is to create a service facility by acquiring an optical frequency synthesizer (OFS), along with compatible THz antennas, which will be accessible to the region?s academic, industrial and governmental research programs.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The distinctive capabilities of the OFS will greatly benefit a number of ongoing research programs, including the development of microfluidic catalytic reactors, fiber-based plasmonic sensors and microresonator-based frequency combs. Moreover, a diverse array of new research activities, such as frequency-comb-based atmospheric clock distribution, probing of ozone-layer activities, study of intraband dynamics of semiconductor nanocrystals, and multi-wavelength-range trace gas sensing, will also be enabled by this novel laser system.\r\nBroader Impacts: The new service facility is expected to become a catalyst that strengthens current partnerships between different sectors of the local research community and stimulates further collaborations across departments, research centers, institutions and disciplines. Meanwhile, the research activities enabled by the OFS will substantially enhance the quantity and quality of student research opportunities at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Furthermore, through developing stronger educational programs in science and engineering at UAH, this MRI acquisition will help build a knowledge dissemination ladder that bridges forefront research and K-12 education, and benefit a broad scope of the local community, including those from underrepresented groups.",
