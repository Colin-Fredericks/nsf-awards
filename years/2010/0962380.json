 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Barrett, Steven F.\r\nProposal Number: 0962380\r\n\r\nAs part of the University of Wyoming, College of Engineering and Applied Science (CE&AS) engineering curriculum, students are required to complete a meaningful undergraduate design experience. On the other hand, there are over 73,000 individuals with disabilities in the state of Wyoming with diverse needs. This program will provide a vital link between the University's talented students and individuals with assistive technology (AT) needs. Students will create and provide prototype, custom designed assistive devices which will enhance the quality of life for the individual. Also, this program will educate new design engineers on the special needs of community members with disabilities. Furthermore, we believe this program will continue to attract additional female engineering students.\r\nWe will launch the following new initiatives in the next increment of the program:\r\n- Establish a review panel of assistive technology professionals, engineers, and project users to insure project meets the user?s needs. The panel will meet several times during project development.\r\n-Expand the project base regionally to include project requests from adjoining states.\r\n- Assess engineering students grasp of concepts after the AT instructional module.\r\n- Provide a web-based project submission site to ease the project request process.\r\n- Advertise program via websites, WIND publications, and presentations to appropriate groups.\r\n- Expand project technologies to enhance recipients' independence (e.g. personal area networks, web-based safety monitoring, autonomous wheelchairs, etc.).\r\n- Develop measurable set of program metrics to assess program success annually.\r\nTo accomplish program objectives the College of Engineering and Applied Science has partnered with the Wyoming INstitute for Disabilities (WIND). The PI Dr. Steven Barrett, Ph.D., P.E. will serve as the coordinator for the College of Engineering and Applied Science to identify the appropriate student expertise to accomplish a specific project. WIND has been a part of the University of Wyoming (UW), College of Health Sciences since 1994. As a member of the national network of University Centers of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research and Service (UCEDD), WIND provides teaching, research, information, and community services to both the University and Wyoming at large.  WIND Associate Director, Sandy Root-Elledge, M.A., will serve to identify specific AT projects for undergraduate engineering students to design, build, test, and deliver to individuals with disabilities as well as provide assistive technology and disability awareness training to all engineering students.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity:\r\n- The proposed activities will allow the continued construction of projects for individuals with disabilities in the area of developmental disabilities through the Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities (RAPD) program at the NSF. This project has a dramatic need throughout the state and the region.\r\n- These projects will allow students to complete the required two-semester senior design project in an interdisciplinary team approach. The team includes mechanical and electrical engineering students, assistive technology professionals, caregivers, and the intended users and family members where appropriate. This is highly encouraged by the ABET, Inc. accreditation body.\r\n- The proposed projects will educate new engineers on the special needs of community members with disabilities early in their careers including those not participating in the NSF sponsored projects.\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity:\r\n- The proposed design projects should contribute to the quality of life for disabled individuals. Special emphasis will be placed on independent living technologies.\r\n- Encourage students toward graduate school and employment in AT related fields.\r\n- Encourage more participation by under-represented student groups (e.g. women in engineering).\r\n- Provide engineering students with awareness about disabilities and assistive technology.",
