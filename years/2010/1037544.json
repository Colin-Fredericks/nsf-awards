Thompson\t ORG: Clemson University\r\n\r\nTitle:  Symposium - ACS POLY - Bioactive Polymer and Polymer Surfaces\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL  MERIT:  This proposal seeks to support travel awards for graduate students, post-docs, and younger faculty, including those from underrepresented groups to attend the symposium on ?Bioactive Polymers and Polymer Surfaces? at the 240th American Chemical Society (ACS) National meeting in Boston, MA (August 22-26, 2010) in the Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY).  Bioactive polymers and polymer surfaces have the potential to improve the efficacy of, and establish entirely new, medical therapeutics and devices.  Towards this goal, new bioactive polymer systems are increasingly being studied in an attempt to understand and eventually harness polymeric material-guided cell and tissue behavior. The objectives of the symposium are:  (1) To highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis, and characterization of bioactive polymers and polymer surfaces to understand the interaction between cells, tissues, and polymeric materials and to translate this into practical applications in biomedical engineering.  (2) To promote dialogue among polymer scientists, chemists, bioengineers, pharmaceutical scientists, and biologists, and to establish contacts and exchange ideas among workers in these different areas.  (3) To provide opportunities for young investigators including junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students, to present their most recent research results.  The PI makes a good case for the timeliness of the proposed symposium in the context of other conferences/symposia on related topics.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS:  Two of the three symposium organizers are females, and a number of female and minority scientists are scheduled to make presentations at the symposium.  At least five of the scheduled speakers are younger scientists.  The requested funding of $4000 is scheduled entirely to support the attendance (travel, lodging, meals) of graduate students, postdocs, and younger faculty.  Funding priority will be given to graduate students attending their first national meeting, junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers belonging to underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for student travel will be described in advertisements for the symposium to enhance student interest.",
