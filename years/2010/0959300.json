 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\n\r\nThe project is organizing a workshop for faculty members and other professionals to discuss pedagogical practices and instructional strategies for teaching engineering leadership courses. The workshop is focusing on curriculum content as well as strategies of instruction to enable students to learn the key principles associated with engineering leadership.  Workshop discussions include strategies for: 1) developing inquiry skills on the part of the student; 2) developing ways to ensure self-explanation or self generated elaboration by students; and 3) creating experiences either simulated or real, which will motivate problem solving, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge generation and construction by students; and (4) developing good reasoning and discovery learning on the part of engineering students. Strategies for evaluating and assessing engineering programs are also being addressed in the workshop. Dissemination efforts include publishing online materials that can be posted to various websites (e. g., the NSDL, the Center for Engineering Leadership and Learning site, and the NAE CASEE sites) and presentations and publications at the American Society of Engineering Education and Frontiers in Education Conferences.\r\n",
