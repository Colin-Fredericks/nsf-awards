 "awd_abstract_narration": "The northern Atlantic Ocean, near the seafloor ridge between Greenland and Scotland, is a particularly active part of the global climate system. This project will analyze observations from a recently completed 3-year program of Seaglider deployments in this sub-polar region. It is the first time that robotic gliders have been used to observe the dense overflow waters of the global meridional overturning circulation, and with them the warm northward flowing branch of the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation). 17,800 profiles of hydrography, dissolved oxygen, bio-optical variables and depth-averaged velocity were retrieved in 23 successful deployments during this NSF-sponsored work from November 2006 to November 2009.\r\n\r\nThe primary foci of the proposed work are (i) an analysis of the water masses involved in the deep branch of the AMOC, the polar front and warm branch of the AMOC at this site, (ii), a study of mixing, dense-water transformation, and internal waves inferred from glider profiles of vertical velocity, optical backscatter, temperature and salinity at 1m vertical resolution, and (iii) an analysis of horizontal velocity using glider depth-averaged velocity, geostrophic shear and satellite altimetry, emphasizing dense overflow plume structure, polar front structure, and vertical structure of the strong eddy field.\r\n\r\nThis new observational dataset will be combined with historical hydrographic sections, gridded climatology and with models of the Atlantic circulation. The statistical strength of the new data lies in the multiple occupations of the southern slopes of the Iceland Faroe Ridge over 3 years. Top-to-bottom profiles of horizontal velocity normal to the sections are recovered from the hydrography and glider-measured depth-averaged horizontal velocity. The new measurements of fine-scale vertical velocity by the gliders are particularly exciting. \"Hot-spots\" of turbulent mixing are visible throughout the water column, but particularly intense in the dense overflow water plume near the exit of the Faroe Bank Channel. Complementary observations from moorings and lowered turbulence probes have been made by Norwegian colleagues. Fine structure of temperature and salinity and optical backscatter observed at the 1m scale will be related to the vertical-velocity mixing signature. In parallel laboratory experiments have been investigating mixing induced by flow over seafloor topography. Together, these observations will provide a significant coverage of eddies, water masses, circulation and mixing in an important sector of the global climate system.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Human-induced global climate change is accelerating, and yet the natural variability of climate is strong and difficult to predict. Multi-decadal variability of the AMOC is being advanced as a contributor to the rapid late 20th Century global warming, which is largely thought to be driven by greenhouse gases. While climate models are centerpieces of the global warming/climate change debate, it is widely acknowledged that these models (and indeed higher resolution ocean circulation models) are deficient in representing dynamics in these key high-latitude regions. It is necessary to make direct observations of mixing, sinking, water-mass transformation, topographic control and boundary layers. These need to be targeted, and dense in space and time, which is the virtue of gliders. The motivations for this work go back through many years of research with theoretical dynamics of the ocean, which guide the analysis of observations.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The investigators on this project interact with students through detailed research with graduate students to undergraduate teaching about the global environment. A key argument made to undergraduate students is that scientific technology has reached the point where it can contribute more effectively in assessing environmental problems. This project will foster on-going collaborations with oceanographers in Norway and the Faroe Islands interested in climate issues affecting sustainability of fisheries, dislocation of ecosystems and the precarious nature of human communities at the rim of the Arctic. Seagliders can be applied widely to address such issues as biological productivity and ecosystem change. The links between countries at the rim of the Arctic are strengthened by growing collaborations in climate- and environmental sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project is a contribution to the US AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) project of the CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability) program.",

This 2-year grant provided for the first analysis of the data.  In stunningly sharp detail (Figure 1), we now see the shape of the polar front, which separates cold Arctic waters from warm Atlantic water, and have a better understanding of circulation and turbulent mixing of these waters.

Associated classroom teaching by the PIs covers a wide range of environmental and basic science areas, with this research contributing new science to that process.\n \n   Our glider data between Iceland and Norway consists of 17,000 profiles, separated about 1.5 km horizontally and extending from surface to seafloor.

We now have new estimates of the transformation of water masses by mixing, which we hope to blend with new runs of the HYCOM computer model, whose horizontal resolution is the same as that of the Seaglider. \n \n   Finally, we observed on multiple tracks the important blending of Arctic and Atlantic waters by mixing across the polar front, which turns out to be largely a wintertime phenomenon.  The strong storms at this season cool the ocean surface, driving deep plumes of convection which reach as much as 500 meters downward, impacting the sloping de..."
