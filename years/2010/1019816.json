 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop reviews and discusses the use of quantitative and qualitative data to measure the returns on federal research and development investments. Despite the job-focused mandate of the current ARRA reporting requirements, the impact of S&T funding can be quantified beyond employment.   The workshop is organized to elicit specific suggestions for further analysis including new or modified methodologies and data sources.\r\n\r\nA range of topics is addressed: \r\n-\tExisting quantitative metrics\r\n-\tExisting qualitative metrics\r\n-\tThe use of input-output models \r\n-\tComparison of methodologies\r\n-\tConsideration of international activities\r\n\r\nThe workshop generates a research agenda and data collection efforts to be used by federal research agencies to implement new methodologies and models.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The contribution of this project is to systematically assemble the range of work (by academics, consultants, and research agencies themselves) that has been done in measuring research outcomes (within the boundaries of research and development investments, and not including payoffs to services) and to provide a forum to discuss these methods. This project also considers the different methodologies used across fields of research (e.g. agriculture vs. energy research) to identify which are applicable to a range of federal S&T funding.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The extraordinary increase in research expenditures under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the President's commitment to science and technology (S&T) funding increases going forward have heightened the need for measuring the impacts of research investments. The workshop contributes to a more empirically-based decision making process with respect to the levels of public investment in research and development.",
