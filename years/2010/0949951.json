 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nHorsehair worms are parasites of insects, but are free-living in aquatic environments as adults. They are fascinating from an ecological/behavioral perspective, as these parasites modify host behavior, leading the definitive host to enter water, where the adult worms are released. Since morphological identification of horsehair worms larvae is problematic, a novel molecular approach will be used to identify larvae in hosts. This will facilitate linking the juvenile and adult stages, essential to understanding each species' ecology and life history. The proposed research will also greatly increase our understanding of these parasites by documenting their diversity and evolutionary relationships in the New World using DNA and anatomical characteristics. \r\n\r\nThis project would represent a major advance in the study of a very interesting, phylogenetically key, but poorly known phylum. The results are likely to have an impact on our understanding of the evolution of exoskeleteon-bearing organisms, including model organisms in the phyla Arthropoda and Nematoda. It will involve three early career scientists and foster international scientific collaborations. Graduate and undergraduate students will have large roles in this project from fieldwork to publication and presentation. Information will be made available to scientists and the public through an internet website (www.nematomorpha.net), scholarly publications, and education programs targeting K-12 students and college-level instructors.",

Additionally 16 new insect hosts were discovered for 8 species of Nearctic gordiids and we developed novel culturing and sampling techniques for hairworms across the world. Broader impacts: The project involved 40 people from 4 countries, including, 23 undergraduates, many of who were from underrepresented groups, 9 of which were coauthors or primary authors on 4 publications, and 1 MS graduate student, who was the lead or coauthor on 3 publications. Two additional OSU graduate students (1 PhD; 1 MS) were supported with summer salary working on the project. The project resulted in 66 presentations at national, regional, and local meetings. Of those, 35 were presented by undergraduate students as 1<sup>st</sup> authors resulting in 7 awards for undergraduate presentations, 5 travel grants to national meetings, 1 Journal of Parasitology Editor's Scholarship Award, and 3 research awards from regional and national parasitology societies. Three of the undergraduate students are currently pursuing graduate studies in parasitology and other students are attending Medical, Veterinary, or Pharmacy School. The MS student trained on the project is employed as a biotechnologist at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Boston, MA. In addition, we hosted the 1<sup>st</sup> International Nematomorpha Symposium in conjunction with the 87<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting of the American Society of Parasitologists, Richmond VA. The symposium involved hairworm experts from the USA, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, Argentina, and Georgia. As a result of the symposium, one of the students involved is now pursuing her PhD on hairworms in the US. Data gathered as part of this award was also used to expand and enhance the hairworm website (www.nematomorpha.net), accessed last year by over 16,500 unique visitors, making interactions between Citizen Scientists and scientists possible. Hundreds of Citizen Scientists have encountered and submitted hairworms or reports through the &ldquo;Report-A-Worm&rdquo; feature, leading to a direct interface with scientists, and their research. The website hosts the Global Hairworm Database including the world species list for all described gordiids, a Google Earth Nematomorpha distribution data set providing all known type localities for gordiids and a link to multi-institution and multi-collection museum databases allowing data to be available to the scientific community and the general public. Finally, we have made a point to engage in public outreach. Work directly related to this grant has led to interviews and feature stories in the popular press such as the Discovery Channel, Wired Magazine, National Geographic Magazine, National Geographic Channel, South Korean TV, and many others. We have also given presentations to middle and high school students about science, biology, and parasitology, and in collaboration with education majors at OUS we developed lesson plans using hairworms for high school teachers. Publications resulting from this award include 23 papers or book chapters published or in press.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/10/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;G&nbsp;Bolek</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
