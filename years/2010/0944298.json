 "awd_abstract_narration": "The iron-oxygen (above 100GPa) and iron-carbon binary systems will be explored to determine phase stability and eutectic melting temperatures as a function of pressure. Partial melting, unit cell volumes and other crystallographic information are to be determined using synchrotron x-ray diffraction while the samples are compressed and laser-heated in a diamond anvil cell. Crystal structure is naturally monitored with x-ray diffraction, so subsolidus phase transitions will also be detected and identified during the course of the equation of state measurements. The experimental methodology for these experiments has been proven successful at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data to be collected are critical not only to understand the temperatures in the Earth's core, but also for developing models of chemical evolution of the Earth's core. The phase relations in these systems and temperatures within the Earth's core are critical for understanding the generation of the magnetic field throughout the history of the Earth.\r\n \r\nResults from the proposed study will be disseminated primarily through publication in the scientific literature, by participation at scientific conferences, and when warranted, through wider-reaching news outlets. Additional benefits of the proposed research include the continued development and refinement of experimental high-pressure, high-temperature techniques; continued exposure of university researchers, including student participants, to the facilities and talent at government-funded multi-user sites; and the training of students in the wide range of experimental techniques and scientific protocols associated with performing the proposed work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur goals were to constrain the temperature and composition of Earth?s core.  Temperature of the inner-core outer-core boundary is an important anchor point for the temperature profile of the entire interior of Earth.  At the inner-core (solid) outer-core (liquid), boundary liquid iron plus some lighter element (e.g. H, S, O, C or Si) is in equilibrium with the corresponding solid.  Thus, knowing the melting temperature of pure iron and with some knowledge of the melting point depression due to the presence of lighter elements will yield the temperature at the inner-core outer-core boundary.  We looked at the phase equilibria (and equation of state) of the Fe-Si binary to determine the amount of Si that is possible within Earth?s core, which we found as to be much as 11 wt% in the outer core and 6-8 wt% in the inner core.  We also found that the minimum temperature in the outer core with Si present was 4380K.\n\nWe also reanalyzed the shockwave melting data of pure iron (Bass et. al.:  the CalTech Shockwave Group) using the wavelength dependent emissivity.  The wavelength dependent emissivity is a measure of the deviation from an ideal blackbody.  The corrected melting temperature of iron at 243 GPa is 5700 +/-500 K compared to Bass et al.?s determination of 6700 +/- 400 K.. This is just slightly higher than the estimate (based upon the assumption of the heat capacity being equal to 5R) of Brown and McQueen (1986) of 5000-5700 K, and in good agreement with theoretical calculations of Alfe, 2010. The melting temperature at the inner-outer core boundary is approximately 6400K.\n\nThese results help to constrain the temperature and composition of Earth?s core.  In the process of obtaining these results several graduate students and undergraduate students (not all of whom were directly supported by this grant) have been trained in experimental techniques and data analysis.  The graduate student supported by this grant has gone on to a postdoctoral position at a National Lab and the undergraduate student is now in graduate school studying seismology.\n\nWe have disseminated our results through presentations at national meetings and multiple publications in highly rated journals.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dion L Heinz"
