 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current network-centric Internet service model is prone to\r\nresource exhausting attacks such as Distributed Denial of\r\nServices attacks. Due to the resource sharing nature and\r\nnon-coordinated monitoring capability of the current Internet,\r\nit is difficult to quickly identify attack sources. Second, a\r\nnew trend is to develop a user-centric Internet service model,\r\nin which traditional local network services are outsourced to\r\nremote service providers such as for cloud services. This new\r\ntrend allows end users to fully control remote service nodes,\r\ntheir interconnections and routing, which imposes great threats\r\non network resource allocations. Thus, it is highly desired\r\nthat the future Internet is designed to provide a secure\r\nservice domain that is both network-centric and user-centric.\r\nAs a fundamental core to this goal, a secure and resilient\r\nvirtualized routing architecture in a global inter-networking\r\nenvironment is explored to provide network resource reservation\r\nprotection both at the network-centric and the user-centric\r\nlevel. A novel attribute-based, cryptography-based approach to\r\nconstruct secure virtualization is to be developed.\r\nFurthermore, an architectural solution to address the policy\r\nenforcement and inter-domain trust management is also\r\nconsidered. The end goal is to greatly improve the efficiency\r\nof attack monitoring and intrusion detection and to increase\r\nthe resiliency of the future Internet. This is a collaborative\r\nexploratory project bringing together researchers from the\r\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City, Arizona State University,\r\nand Osaka City University, Japan. All research results will be\r\nmade available to the scientific community.",
