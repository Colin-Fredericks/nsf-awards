 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of low-threshold, high-switching speed, programmable/reconfigurable, single-mode nanolasers. The proposed transformative program will address important problems that pertain to nanolasers including electrical injection and tunability.\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed program are in the fundamental understanding of optical processes in sub-wavelength scale nanocavities, development of material growth techniques, and demonstration of nanolasers with following features: i) physical footprint 20-30 times smaller than state-of-the-art, ii) electrical injection, iii) wide tunability (tens of nanometers). The photonic crystal nanobeam cavities, based on an optical waveguide perforated with 1-D lattice of holes, enable efficient control of spontaneous emission at sub-wavelength-scale. Furthermore, their physical footprint is exactly the same as that of an optical waveguide, and therefore, they represent the smallest possible high-Q cavity geometry. Finally, by taking advantage of their flexibility, dynamical wavelength tunability over a wide wavelength range, with negligible steady-state power consumption, can be achieved.\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed program is the development of techniques and devices for efficient light generation, collection, and localization, with applications ranging from optical and quantum-optical communication to life sciences and bio-chemical sensing. The program represents a unique interdisciplinary research and educational opportunity for students that encompass laser theory and design, epitaxial material growth, nanofabrication, and device characterization. An essential component of the program is outreach: the team members will continue their collaboration with Museum of Science in Boston, their involvement in the development of high-school physics curricula, and participation in Research Experience for Undergraduates program.",
