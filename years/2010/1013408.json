McGovern\r\n\r\nThe proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V KILO MOANA which is operated by the University of Hawaii; namely a portable cable spooler, a light-duty ?hydro? winch, and critical CTD handling system spares.  All of these items will either improve equipment reliability in the field or enhance science support capabilities for science.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:   The University of Hawaii vessels support federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment.  During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University open house events.  All told, the KILO MOANA is scheduled to complete approximately 190 NSF sponsored days in 2010.",
