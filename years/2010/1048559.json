The Association for Machine \r\nTranslation in the Americas (AMTA) is a non-profit professional organization \r\nin the area of Machine Translation (MT) in the US and the American continent. \r\nThe main mission of AMTA is to facilitate and promote the exchange of \r\nknowledge and information between the communities of researchers, developers \r\nand users of Machine Translation and related translation technologies. In its \r\neffort to foster the professional growth of the next generation of MT \r\nresearchers, AMTA-2010 is featuring a Student Research Workshop, embedded \r\nas an integral part of the research program at the conference. Students at \r\nall levels of study (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) are invited to \r\nsubmit papers describing their research work. NSF is providing funding to \r\nsubsidize travel, conference and accommodation expenses for up to 10 students \r\nthat have been selected to present their research work at the workshop. \r\n\r\nThe AMTA-2010 Student Research Workshop will greatly facilitate professional \r\ngrowth for the brightest young researchers in the field of MT, in the early \r\nstages of their professional career. The workshop will contribute to the \r\nprofessional development of a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of \r\nMachine Translation and computational processing of natural language. MT and \r\nother language processing applications are becoming vital technologies in the \r\nglobal information age. Strength in these areas is crucial to American \r\ncompetitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century.",
