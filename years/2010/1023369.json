 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in temperature and precipitation extremes could be especially large in the Arctic, which is projected to have some of the greatest anthropogenic warming.  Consistency of physical causes of extreme temperature and precipitation in observations and in simulations of past and future scenarios can indicate the robustness of projected changes. Consistent simulations of extremes by several models can provide much greater sampling of extreme events, leading to more confident assessment of the changing risk of extreme events.  The PI's will investigate possible changes in extreme temperature and precipitation events in the Arctic using observational records and output from the CORDEX (regional) and CMIP5 (global) climate modeling programs.  The project aims to detect, attribute, and understand changes in extreme temperature or precipitation through an analytical framework that focuses on both the extreme temperature or precipitation events and the physical processes which support them.  The PI's will assess observed and simulated changes in extreme precipitation processes using a pattern-recognition tool, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), that allows construction of a coherent, multivariate view of collections of extreme events.  The methods developed will also have application to studies of extremes in other regions of the planet, extending capacity for assessing changes in extremes and their underlying physical causes.  The project will train a new generation of scientists equipped to perform ensemble analysis of the changes in extremes and the uncertainties in their projection.",

Precipitation extremes were most likely when there was a strong low-pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska.  The low center caused substantial moisture flow from the ocean into Alaska.  When the moisture flow encountered Alaskan mountains, the uplift of air over the mountains cause moisture condensation and substantial precipitation.  In addition, the northward movement of warm air ahead of the low center promoted large moisture transport.\n\nOur focus on the broad-scale atmospheric weather patterns associated with extreme events is motivated by the fact that weather and climate models are most accurate at these larger scales.
