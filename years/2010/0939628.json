 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biogenic sulfur compounds, such as dimethyl sulfide (DMS), its precursors dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and its atmospheric oxidation product, methane sulfonic acid (MSA), are important components of the global sulfur cycle that significantly impact global climate. The roles of DMSP and DMSO within the organisms that produce them, as well as their intracellular concentrations, are poorly understood. DMSO has been speculated to play a role in intracellular osmoregulation, cryoprotection and scavenging of reactive oxygen species, but its intracellular concentration in plankton has only been inferred. Quantitative measurement of the concentration of biogenic sulfur compounds in vivo is necessary to more completely understand their biogeochemistry.  The principal investigator has developed methods for the quantitative analysis of biogenic sulfur compounds using Raman spectroscopy, which have resulted in the detection of DMSO with a sensitivity of <10 mM - far lower than the current estimates of its intracellular concentrations. The research will extend this technique to DMSP. The direct determination of the intracellular DMSP and DMSO, will allow the proposed roles of these compounds in phytoplankton to be investigated. Lastly, using field-collected cores, measurements will be made of the intracellular sulfur compounds as well as the concentration of molecular anions in the sea ice micro-environment. As an RUI project, successful completion of this work will have a substantial impact on undergraduate education in the Chemistry Department at the University of South Alabama, exposing undergraduates and, particularly, under-represented minorities in the sciences to cutting-edge research. It will provide financial support for their education and allow them to present research in journal articles and at technical meetings. Contacts with scientists in the field of Antarctic research at other institutions will give students the opportunity to interact with researchers in related fields, broadening their experience base.",

It has been estimated phytoplankton can contain concentrations between &lt;0.001 to 200 fmol of DMSP/ cell.  The roles of DMSP and DMSO within the organisms that produce them, as well as their intracellular concentrations, are currently poorly understood.  It has been speculated that DMSP and DMSO may play a role in the biochemistry of the organisms that produce them, such as osmo-regulation, cryoprotection and intracellular scavenging of reactive oxygen species.  Current estimates of intracellular concentrations are based on bulk sample analysis, which, beyond analytical uncertainties, provide virtually no information concerning the location (and hence) role of DMSP and DMSO within the cell, as well as variability within a population.  The goal of this project was to provide analysis of biogenic sulfur and other cellular constituents using quantitative molecular spectroscopy at high spatial resolution performed on species of interest to the ecology of the Southern Ocean, such as Phaeocystis antarctica.    \n\nTwo complimentary techniques were used in this study, Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron-based FT-infrared spectroscopy.  Both techniques are based on vibrational information that is both highly compound specific and quantitative, while being at the same time inherently non-destructive.  To probe the stress response of P. antarctica, it was necessary to define a range of environmental conditions that these organisms might be expected to encounter.  This includes variation in available light, salinity and nutrient content.  These conditions, are, in part defined by both open ocean surface water environment as well has the highly saline environment found in sea-ice micro-structure that can trap algae within the liquid vein structure.  Since this  microchemistry is itself ill-defined, as a starting point, liquid veins found in a core of 1st-year sea ice collected in vicinity of Palmer Station sea were analyzed (see Figure 1).  &micro;-Raman analysis found high spatial variability consistent with general observations on glacial ice, and the high molarity of anionic species found implies concentrated salt environment.  Figure 2 shows typical Raman spectra taken at three ice-vein locations.  Molecular species present (SO42-, CO32-, HPO4-) imply basic pH in veins with a salinity ~30% above average seawater  For phosphate, extremely high concentrations (orders of magnitude above bulk seawater concentrations or in melted first-year ice) were found at limited locations in the ice.\n\nIt was found that the presence of carotenoid pigments within cells precluded Raman analysis for biogenic sulfur using visible (488nm) excitation.  It turns out that the concentration of these pigments is particularly sensitive to light availability in both the visible and the ultraviolet.  For the first time, techniques were developed to determine the concentration of these pigments in single, living cells, making it possible to determine both bulk stress response and population variation simultaneously.  In general, concentration variability is much larger than analytical uncertainty.  For P. antarctica, for example, a &gt;40-fold variation was observed among treatments.  With respect the stress response in P. antarctica, the pigment concentration was found to be proportional to both photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the presence of UV light.  With respect to salinity changes, little difference was found between average concentrations for algae grown in seawater at nominal salinity and seawater at 130% nominal salinity.  However, growth in seawater at twice nominal salinity resulted in significantly higher carotenoid concentrations.\n\nThe use of sync..."
