 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical: This project aims for identification and greater understanding of the exciton diffusion mechanism in organic photovoltaic materials. The project approach seeks to correlate investigations of exciton diffusion carried out using steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopies as well as device based results. These studies are expected to be able to identify the most promising and accurate means of characterizing exciton diffusion, and to also elucidate the role of molecular structure and singlet-triplet exciton intersystem crossing on the diffusing species and mechanism. The latter will assist in clarification of the potential role phosphorescent materials can play in OPVs. \r\n\r\nNon-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics--the basic scientific findings of the project are expected to assist significantly with the development of alternative energy sources. Additionally, the PIs have made a priority of the education of elementary, high school, undergraduate and graduate students on issues relating to energy, and the role materials can play in renewable energy systems. Multiple programs will be undertaken including educational outreach for school children in the 3rd through 12th grades, summer research experience for high school students, research opportunities for undergraduate students through programs including the University of Minnesota (UMN) Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and MRSEC REU programs, as well as the integration of research results into undergraduate and graduate classes in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Chemistry will be undertaken. The PIs will also disseminate results of the proposed work to industry through the UMN Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPrime), which provides opportunities for professionals in industry to collaborate with researchers at the UMN. The PIs typically help co-organize and participate in the IPrime annual meeting, which offers students the opportunity to present their research to member companies. The project research and education activities represent an important contribution to the education of students and the wider community both at and beyond the UMN.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has focused on understanding and engineering the nanoscale processes responsible for solar to electrical energy conversion in organic semiconductor materials.  Organic semiconductors are an emerging class of electronic materials currently of interest for application in next generation displays, solid-state lighting sources, and solar cells (among others).  These materials are attractive for their highly tunable optical and electronic properties, as well as their compatibility with high throughput processing on flexible substrates including plastics, foils and fabrics, opening up new applications for electronic materials.\n\n \n\nIn the supported work, the focus was on understanding the bottlenecks to the realization of high efficiency, a deficiency that currently limits application of this technology.  Specifically, for an organic solar cell to work efficiently, energy must be effectively transported from the point of light absorption to an interface within the cell that generates current.  The fundamental processes responsible for energy transport and the materials properties that impact the efficiency of energy transport are poorly understood.  The supported work uncovered new design rules for engineering and enhancing the efficiency of energy transport, leading to the demonstration of new materials and device architectures that overcome deficiencies in this area.  Of particular note is the use of thin film dilution as a means to engineer the spacing between organic molecules, and the surprising result that this dilution can lead to significantly enhanced efficiencies of energy harvesting.  This work has been disseminated in multiple peer-reviewed scientific publications, two patent filings, and a variety of presentations by the involved faculty and graduate student researchers.\n\n \n\nThe funded work has had broad impact, as support has helped five graduate students complete their Ph.D. studies, while also creating valuable academic year and summer research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students.  The two undergraduates working on the project are listed as co-authors on two of the papers published, indicating their significant contributions to research activities.  High school students were mentored for summer research, later going on to compete in a variety of science competitions.  Further outreach efforts were made to K-12 students through the \"Energy and U\" show that brings 10,000 elementary school students to campus for an exciting and entertaining show that also teaches important concepts relating to energy.  Finally, the results of the funded work have been disseminated to industry through activities between the involved faculty, graduate students and industrial partners with the University of Minnesota Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell J Holmes"
