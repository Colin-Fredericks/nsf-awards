 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first objective of the project is to improve the upper-division retention rates of academically talented engineering students who show the highest risk of not completing their degrees. The highest risk students in engineering are the underrepresented women and minorities.  The second objective is to improve the recruitment of women and minorities to graduate school in engineering.  Each year thirty-five junior and senior engineering students who are at-risk for attrition and five first-year graduate engineering students are receiving scholarship support. Financially needy, academically talented women and minorities are targeted for recruitment.   Undergraduate student scholars are selected based on a combination of academic merit and attrition risk factors (financial need, minority status, first generation college student, pre-college preparation, off-campus work, and campus connectivity). Graduate student scholars will be selected based on academic merit, financial need, and underrepresentation in engineering.\r\nStudent support services include a number of specially designed activities, several of which expand on existing programs. Activities include a one-credit Career Foundations course, mentorship opportunities and training, professional development seminars, undergraduate research opportunities, and service projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA review of Michigan Tech retention data prior to the SSEED program showed that many students reaching the third year of their engineering programs were failing to graduate.  The reasons seemed to be a combination of financial need and lack of connection to the engineering profession, often due to significant work responsibilities.   In response, one of the primary SSEED objectives was to improve upper-division retention and graduation rates of at-risk academically talented undergraduate engineering students.   SSEED also aimed to address the under-representation of women and minorities in engineering with a strategy of increasing the number of role models with graduate degrees.  Thus, the second primary objective was to increase the recruitment of women and minorities to graduate school in engineering. \n\nFor the undergraduate application process, \"risk\" was evaluated based on the following factors: race/ethnicity, first generation college student, high school quality, the number of employment hours per week, community college attendance.  We set a minimum GPA of 2.5/4.0 to ensure applicants had the potential to succeed academically. Because of outside demands, many students did not have the time to participate in high impact activities such as undergraduate research or engineering project teams.  Applicants who did have time for those things did not rise to the top of the applicant pool, which is opposite to the normal scholarship selection process!  In addition to financial assistance, the program provided monthly professional development events (how to apply to graduate school, how to deal with difficult people, etc.), a career planning course, faculty mentoring, and service projects.  All SSEED undergraduate recipients had at least junior status.  Scholarship awards were for one year and could be renewed for a second year. The awards ranged from $500 to $2500 per semester.\n\nWe restricted the graduate application process to women and racial/ethnic minorities. In addition, we considered the same sorts of risk factors as in the undergraduate process. Graduate student scholarships were only awarded to first semester students in an amount of $4000.  The awards were intended as recruitment scholarships with the intention that students would receive other types of support (fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships) during their graduate programs.\n\nIn total, SSEED supported 91 junior and senior undergraduate engineering students with $364,000 in scholarships. Of the 91 undergraduates, by SSEED?s end, 80 had completed their degrees (77 engineering and 3 in other STEM programs), 8 were still enrolled in engineering, and 3 had withdrawn from school.  Most graduates are now either employed in engineering roles or pursuing an advanced STEM degree.  Of the 30 women undergraduate recipients, 28 had completed their engineering degree, and two were still enrolled.  Of the 24 racial/ethnic minority students, 18 had completed their degree (15 in engineering), 4 were still enrolled, and 2 had withdrawn.\n\nSSEED supported 21 1st-year engineering graduate students with $160,000 in scholarships. Of those 21, 12 have completed their engineering graduate degrees, 5 were still enrolled, and 4 had withdrawn. For the eighteen women in the program, the comparable numbers were 11, 5, and 2.  For the ten racial or ethnic minorities in the program, the comparable numbers were 5, 3, and 2.\n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, the project successfully piloted an applicant selection process that considered multiple risk factors.
