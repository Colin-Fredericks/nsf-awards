The main objectives are to increase the number of students entering the CIS program and to recruit students from underrepresented groups for careers in computer science. The scholars are selected by a committee of professors and specialists in financial aid, admissions, advising, and mentoring. The university has in place numerous proactive student support services such as REACH (REsources for academic ACHievement), Reinhardt Academic Center, Ulmer Career Management Center, and Disability Resource Center. The program also offers a one-week pre-college summer workshop highlighting the CIS program content, including hands on lab activities.",
