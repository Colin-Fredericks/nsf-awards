 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to explore novel control strategies for minimizing power consumption of autonomous microsystems.  Microsystems are engineered devices with sub-millimeter dimensions; at this scale, many phenomena become important that are ignored in larger devices, including many energy losses in circuitry. New control strategies will dramatically reduce total energy usage by coordinating motion control with active regulation of power electronics and sensor circuitry.  These strategies will be based on switching control theory, where the various components of a microsystem are regulated through proper timing of a finite number of commands.  These switching commands can be implemented especially efficiently in miniaturized systems.  Switching control theory will be enhanced to provide robust performance in the presence of variation in the behavior of underlying physical components, and to adapt to changing conditions over time.   Deliverables will include comprehensive controller design and optimization procedures, micro-scale component modeling tools, documentation of innovations in switching control theory, experimental verification on micro-robotic testbeds, engineering student education, and interactive on-line learning tools for secondary students. \r\n\r\nSuccessful realization of this research will increase understanding of fundamental trade-offs between power consumption and performance of interconnected micro-scale dynamic systems.  The primary application is the control of insect-like terrestrial micro-robots, where small size dramatically limits power availability.   Minimal-power control and optimization algorithms will be a major enabling step towards the creation of micro-robotic tools for emergency, health, and maintenance workers, and will have wider application to other microsystems such as unattended sensor nodes and implantable medical devices, where resource or energy conservation is critical.  In the process, micro-robotics will be used as a theme for developing interactive in-class lessons and online programs teaching concepts such as work and energy to secondary students, with interactive online activities refined for broad dissemination over the Internet.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award has supported development of ultra-low power control strategies for highly-mobile terrestrial micro-robots, accompanied by ongoing development of micro-robot design, prototyping, and modeling capailities.   The primary project goal was to develop methods for systematically managing energy use during motion control of appendages of very small (&lt;10 mm) autonomous robots.  This includes energy use for sensing, actuation, and interface circuitry during various robotic walking gaits. \n\nSpecific strategies developed include methods for inferring and improving the effectiveness of voltage input patterns applied to micro-robotic leg actuators to to produce desired motions.   Many of these algorithms can be implemented even when only a small number of sensor measurements are available for regulating motion during each leg motion, well below conventional sensor sampling rates in feedback control systems.   The selection of voltage inputs can then be adapted from step-to-step or within individual steps of prototype robot leg motions.  Suitable voltage inputs have also been optimized to account for energy losses in circuitry used to interface power sources with actuators operating at very low electrical currents, where circuit efficiency is typically extremely low.  Efficient switching drive circuits and charge recovery circuitry have been integrated with micro-robotic leg actuators.\n\nWith regards to intellectual merit, in addition to control system research described above this award has supported development of novel micro-fabrication techniques for constructing complex micro-scale robotic leg structures, and scientific studies of contact interactions between robotic feet and a variety of surfaces.   These studies have provided insight into design and modeling of thin-film piezoelectric materials for providing compact, high-force actuation to micro-scale systems.\n\nThis project has had broader impact by enabling both new applications of underlying actuation and control technology, and opportunities for education.   Autonomous micro-robots may one day provide revolutionary new means for working in constrained areas where access is hazardous or extremely size-limited, such as during disaster relief or infrastructure monitoring or maintenance.  In the meantime, the thin-film piezoelectric actuation technology being developed for robot leg actuations has been adapted for use in endomicroscopy instruments, while low-power sensing and control schemes have been applied to micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope calibration.   Meanwhile, a number of undergraduate and graduate student researchers have been supported by this award.  In addition, this award has supported multiple week-long engineering outreach activities in the Ypsilanti School District in Ypsilanti, MI, allowing middle school students to learn about the relationships between forces, simple machines, and walking locomotion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenn Oldham"
