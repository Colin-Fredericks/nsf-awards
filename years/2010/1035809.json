ICDCS is a premier conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing and the attendance will provide an excellent opportunity for students and junior faculty to interact with senior researchers of international standing.  The selection of the grantees will be done via a rigorous application process that considers the expected benefits, interest and social factors (minority, women) of the participants.",
