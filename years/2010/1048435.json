 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) Initiative is to better\r\nunderstand multifaceted climate processes across the land-ocean-atmosphere\r\nsystem.  The Initiative began in response to the last International\r\nConference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARP), which identified the need\r\nfor synthesis activities across Arctic system science.  Subsequently, the\r\nART program was established and has two phases.  The first phase was\r\ncompleted in early 2010 with the drafting of a science plan that was the\r\nproduct of a three day workshop hosted at the International Arctic Research\r\nCenter in Fairbanks, Alaska.  The workshop brought together more than 50\r\nscientists from nine counties to outline the priorities to be considered\r\nwithin the ART Initiative.  The science plan was presented to the Arctic\r\nOcean Science Board (AOSB) and endorsed by the International Arctic Science\r\nCommittee (IASC) during their annual meeting in Nuuk, Greenland. With the\r\nscience plan written, vetted and endorsed by the broader Arctic science\r\ncommunity phase two of the Initiative can now begin.  A workshop will be\r\nheld at the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg Canada from October 18 - 20th\r\nto draft an implementation plan based on the research priorities identified\r\nin the science plan.  The implementation plan will focus on linkages within\r\nthe marine system, including contributions from land-ocean gateways, shelf\r\nseas, and the deep ocean. A range of time scales will also be explored, from\r\nPaleoclimates to the rapid change currently being observed in the Arctic.\r\nAs with the science plan, the implementation effort will be organized and\r\nexecuted almost entirely by early career scientists from five different\r\nnations (U.S., Canada, Norway, Germany, and Sweden) making the ART\r\nInitiative a unique international effort.",
