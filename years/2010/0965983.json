 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program supports the development of an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional graduate training program in radiochemistry. Interdisciplinary fields such as molecular imaging, environmental remediation, nuclear energy, and national security rely increasingly on specialized radiochemical knowledge. But few chemistry graduate programs exist with the capabilities to train radiochemists and few students engage in radiochemical research. The goal of this program is to stimulate a resurgence of interest in radiochemistry among Ph.D. students, producing scientists who can fill this critical need.\r\n \r\nHunter College of CUNY, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, University of Missouri at Columbia, University of Nevada Las Vegas, and several other leading radiochemistry institutions (including national laboratories and industry) will together train future scientists across multiple scientific disciplines to innovate, understand and employ radiochemistry effectively. This model will include a venue for the development of effective communication skills to foster a better-informed public who are more accepting and knowledgeable about the use, benefits and safety of radiochemistry. By drawing upon the collaborative efforts of the partnering institutes as well as Hunter's experience in recruiting and training women and minorities, this IGERT aims to increase the number and diversity of Ph.D. scientists with strong radiochemistry backgrounds.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.",

Radiochemistry is essentially chemistry using radioactive materials and bridges many disciplines.  \n\nOur program firmly established collaborations and research opportunities between Hunter faculty and researchers at IGERT partner institutions (especially at Weill Cornell Medical College, Memorial Sloan Kettering) and the IGERT was the foundation for collaborations and research opportunities at several national laboratories (Brookhaven, Los Alamos, Argonne).

Students had the opportunity to conduct research in interdisciplinary research spanning many fields.  The partnership with research intensive institutions provided the opportunity for students to conduct scholarly research with an application or a clinical focus.  Faculty at Hunter also had the opportunity to employ their considerable talents in new projects that had clear application. \n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Hunter Radiochemistry IGERT is the co-mentorship model where all students had mentors at Hunter College and a partnering institution.

As a result, trainees, Hunter faculty and partnering institution faculty were able to publish in extremely high impact and important journals. Trainees and faculty applied and received patents on their work. Research conducted was interdisciplinary and spanned many applications; these include medical imaging, therapy of cancer, neurogenerative disease, medical isotope production, studies of radioisotopes that are important to nuclear energy, nuclear waste remediation and environmental remediation. \n\nEnhanced radiochemistry infrastructure at Hunter College: Hunter College administration was extremely supportive of the IGERT and understood the importance of Radiochemistry.  As a result, we added two new full-time faculty in Radiochemistry and provided them with competitive start-up packages and laboratory renovations.  Hunter also added a research associate (staff scientist) who facilitates research of Radiochemistry trainees and their collaborations at partnering institutions.  He also is the liaison to Environmental Health and Safety with respect to Radiochemistry.  Hunter is also providing classroom and laboratory space for the present Radiochemistry course and advanced courses. \n\nEnhanced Radiochemistry opportunities at CUNY in general: The interest in Radiochemistry has spawned a radiochemistry program at Lehman College of CUNY.  Over the past five years, three professors with radiochemistry research and passion for radiochemistry education were hired.  These and Hunter professors provide a critical mass for radiochemistry research and education at CUNY.   Undergraduates and graduate students are quite interested in pursuing radiochemistry research following the model that the IGERT espoused.  We are extending and expanding our relationships with partnering institutions in the establishment of named fellowships for predoctoral students. \n\nNational scene:  The Hunter radiochemistry program has become nationally recognized for the caliber of students, the high impact projects, and the successes in winning competitive federal grants and publishing high impact papers of the young new professors both at Hunter and Lehman Colleges of CUNY.  We have graduated 12 students; these have gone on to academia, postdoctoral fellowships, industry, and entered the financial world.  As a result of these successes, the PI has been asked to take over the national directorship of the Department of Energy Nuclear Chemistry Summer Schools (NCSS) from 2019 to 2023.  The NCSS are the primary means to introduce Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry to undergraduates. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lynn C Francesconi"
