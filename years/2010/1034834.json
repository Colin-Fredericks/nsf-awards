 "awd_abstract_narration": "The challenge of screening large inventories of structures is a major obstacle to the rapid recovery from earthquakes and the efficient use of resources to mitigate the effects future earthquakes.  This challenge is especially restrictive in urban areas built without strict regulation and enforcement of building codes. Screening of large inventories cannot rely on full structural analyses, if for no other reason than the structural plans for many existing structures are unavailable.  Instead, screening tools that can be implemented quickly and reliably are needed.  Field data from Haiti will be used to test, calibrate, and improve seismic vulnerability indices. The collected field data will enable the researchers to answer challenging questions that cannot be answered by laboratory or analytical research alone.  The research will answer questions about the versatility of existing vulnerability indices, the identification of additional key structural parameters, and the merits/drawbacks of adding to the complexity of the indices.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research are related to the reduction of seismic risk and will be pursued with particular emphasis on Haiti through collaboration with the State University of Haiti, Habitat for Humanity, Haiti's National Laboratory for Buildings and Construction, Haiti's Bureau of Mines and Energy, and the Association of Haitian Private Constructors.  The findings of the research can be used directly by these institutions to identify vulnerable structures that remain in Haiti as well as to generate effective guidelines for reconstruction. The findings will also be available to help vulnerable societies in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)",
