 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator and collaborators will carry out an observational program to obtain very high resolution imaging of main belt, near-Earth, and Trojan asteroids, using adaptive optics (AO) systems on 8- and 10-meter telescopes. The objectives of this program are to (1) search for binary asteroids and obtain orbits for newly discovered and known binaries; and to (2) obtain sizes, shapes, albedos, and rotation poles (spin axis directions) for roughly 25 large main-belt asteroids through repeated imaging that resolves the objects themselves. They will also coordinate and carry out observations of stellar occultation events, and use software that they have developed to simultaneously fit the imaging, occultation, and available light-curve data. By pushing the current limits of adaptive optics, this work will contribute to improvement of AO technology. The investigators will also endeavor to include non-professional astronomers in their occultation observations, and will conduct outreach activities including public presentations and preparation of exhibit materials for the Onizuka Science Center in Kona, Hawaii.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of our program was to acquire images of asteroids with\nastounding clarity using some of the world's largest telescopes.  The\nuse of large telescopes (larger mirror sizes) benefits us in two ways:\n1) the larger the mirror, the sharper are the pictures that we can \nacquire, and 2) the larger the mirror, the more light can be gathered\nfrom any particular source and this means we can look at fainter\nobjects than with a smaller mirror.\n\nThe goals of our program were 1) to search for moons around\nasteroids, and 2) with the sharp images, we can determine\nthe size and shape of the asteroids themselves.\n\nWe use a relatively new technology on these large telescopes\ncalled \"adaptive optics\" or AO.   This technique effectively\ndetects the distortion in an image caused by the Earth's\natmosphere, and then tries to restore the image to what\nit would look like without the atmosphere.  It does this\nby using the equivalent of a \"fun house\" mirror to remove\nthese distortions.  The result is an image that is as sharp\nas some space-based telescopes, but without the \nhigh cost of a space telescope.  We can also make use\nof larger mirrors than can be placed in space, giving yet\nsharper images, as described above.`\n\nWhy do we want to study asteorids?\n\nFirst, asteroids represent relatively primitive bodies that\nhave been unaltered, for the most part, by processes\nthat affect major planets, such as weather or volcanic or\ntectonic processes.  That means that they may still\nretain hints of the early solar system and contain information\nabout how our solar system formed.  The main process\nthat affects asteroids is collisions among asteroids.  Collisions\nbetween asteroids and the surfaces of planets or the Moon\nhave also occurred over the billions of years since the\nbirth of the solar system.   We see evidence of this\nprocess in the craters left on the surface of Earth's moon.\nMost, but not all, such craters on Earth have been\nerased by weather and geological processes.  \n\nThus, we know that collisions have played a critical\nrole not only in the evolution of asteroids, but also\nin the histories of the planets, including Earth.  And\ncollisions are still important when we consider the\nhazards that impacts by asteroids may still pose to\nlife on Earth. \n\nHow can searching for asteroid moons help us understand\nasteroids and collisions?\n\nPartly due to our program, we know that asteroid moons\ncan exist and that they can take many forms and are around\nmany types of asteroids.  Many of these moons were formed\nby collisions.   Collisions can be modeled by computer\nprograms and may be studied on small scales in laboratories.\nBut nothing of the scale of asteroids (some hundreds of miles\nacross) can be esimulated in any lab.  So these moons give\nus a giant real-life laboratory to study collisions by asteroids,\nhow they may affect Earth, and how dangerous they may\nbe to Earth.\n\nHow can determining size and shape of an asteroid help\nus understand asteroids and collisions?\n\nAsteroids that have been hit by other asteroids may retain\nmarkings (giant craters) that are remnants of the impacts\nsuch as those on the Moon.  Unlike the Moon, however,\nthe asteroids are small enough, that these impacts can\nactually change the shape of the asteroid, showing large\ngouges or facets.  We can detect these and try to\nunderstand the history of impacts.   \n\nTo help us understand the internal composition of\nasteroids, we need to know both the mass (\"weight\"\nor heft) of an asteroid, and its volume (how much\nspace does it take up).  The mass can be determined\nif it has a moon or from a close flyby of a spacecraft.\nThe volume can only be determined by high quality\nimages, such as those in our program.  The term\n\"density\" is used to tell how an object weighs for its size.\n\nFor example, iron is very dense,\nwhile rock is less dense, ice is less dense still,\nand styrofoam would be yet lower density.  Thus,\nthe density (mass divided by volume) gives a clue\nas to the composition of the a..."
