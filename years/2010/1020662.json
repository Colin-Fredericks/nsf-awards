NUESTRO FUTURO will utilize a comprehensive dissemination strategy, including traditional print media, web casting, and social media to reach a large segment of the Latino community regarding the urgent need to prepare future generations in STEM, and innovate to better serve the Hispanic community and the nation. Recommendations from the workshop will aid the NSF?s efforts to broaden participation of all underrepresented minorities, and facilitate the development of a diverse and competitive STEM workforce for the 21st century as mandated by the America Competes Act.",

First, although Latinos are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, the tide is starting to turn.. Engineering is rapidly becoming the most popular choice for Latino students. Second, it\u00c6s important to recognize that certain programs have proved quite effective in encouraging young Latinos to enter the STEM fields. Among those cited were LOFT, Great Minds in STEM and HESTEC. Third, there must be a renewed commitment to supporting teachers. In his remarks, Juan Sepulve..."
