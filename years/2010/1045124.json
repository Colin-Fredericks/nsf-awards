 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to develop pedagogical insights and strategies to overcome barriers to women and minorities in the STEM fields. The proposal includes concepts and pedagogical methods of attracting women and minorities to STEM fields with ultimate goal of diversifying the STEM workforce. The research approach focusing on 9-11th grade young women and minorities in three different public schools along with well structured survey instruments and proposed mentoring program. The proposal encompassing after-school programs, summer school, hands on laboratory experiments, parental involvement, mentoring, survey and evaluation. The PI has many accomplishments in the academia, with vast teaching experience and superb scholarly activities. In addition, facilities and resources are adequate for the proposal. \r\nIt is important that the youth are provided with the necessary tools and resources to minimize the impact of the current financial situation; and look toward the future for new innovation and emerging technologies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major finding of the research is that middle and high school female and minority student interest in STEM education is hindered by many barriers including ignorance about STEM, lack of ability to contextualize STEM in every day life and lack of female and minority role models:\n\n \n\n            - average female or minority teenager is exposed to less than 3\n\n hours/week of STEM-related material in popular media as  compared to over 100hours/week of non-STEM content such as\n\n sports, entertainment, music, movies. As a result, STEM issues are\n\n barely on their radar screens\n\n \n\n            - STEM curricula in most middle and high schools is not always\n\n presented in the context of real world applications and everyday\n\n needs of society that would interest this population\n\n \n\n            -  still very few female role models available in many areas of STEM\n\n such as engineering, physics and mathematics; some areas have\n\n significant numbers of female STEM professionals such as the\n\n biological sciences, medicine and pharmacy. With regard to\n\n minorities there are extreme shortages in every area of STEM\n\n\n\n\nA number of important pedagogical insights and strategies that overcome barriers to women and minorities in STEM have emerged from the STEM program. Specifically  evidence was found that three practices are very effective when incorporated into teaching STEM in middle and high school classrooms :\n\n \n\n(i)Peer-led Classroom Instruction \n\nThe presence of enthusiastic female and/or minority college level  STEM\n\nmajors in the STEM classroom working side by side with the teacher as teaching assistants plays a major role in eliminating barriers in the area of STEM perception. This greatly impacts student ability to see themselves in professional STEM roles. These college age female/minority teaching assistants are young enough to be viewed by middle and high school students as \"mentor-contemporaries\" rather than formal \"teachers\"; they do bridge the  \"academic and social\" gap between  the grade school students and the traditional teacher very effectively.\n\n \n\n(ii) Gender and Ethnicity Specific Illustrations \n\nA second important pedagogical strategy is the use of gender and ethnicity specific illustrations in the STEM classroom. The majority of female and ethnic minority students feel more comfortable and more self-confident in the study of STEM subjects when both the teacher and instruction media (books, DVD, youtube videos) make use of inclusive gender and ethnicity specific examples. This involves making explicit verbal, written or graphical reference to successful individuals  in STEM who look like the students &ndash; i.e. younger generation female and/or minority. For example, 95% of girls surveyed indicated that seeing \"normal\" persons in STEM \"with great hair and nice clothes\" was reassuring.\n\n \n\n (iii) STEM Contextualization\n\nThe third critical pedagogical strategy is to consistently give female and minority students in the STEM classroom the ability to contextualize STEM disciplines in terms of every day human needs. STEM fields are critical to serving and providing for humanity &ndash; this simple fact is not always communicated clearly in middle and high field classrooms.\n\nFindings from the STEM program strongly indicate that pedagogical strategies that emphasize the broader positive impacts of STEM activities in society are critically needed to recruit female and minority students into STEM classrooms. Teachers need to make clear and consistent linkages between STEM and everyday issues that human beings face.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit &amp; Broader Impacts\n\nResearch project has intellectual merit and advances NSF mission through important broader impacts on society. There is consistency with NSF intellectual merit criteria from several perspectives:\n\n1) advancement of understanding of urgent issue of why number of women and under-represented minorities in STEM continues to lag well behind other professions like law and medici..."
