 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to establish the NSF  HBCU-RISE Center for Advanced Multi-Scale Computational Algorithms (AMCA) at North Carolina A & T State University (NCA&T).Numerical modeling of many important physicochemical phenomena (atmospheric chemical transport,combustion,industrial chemically reactive flows,etc.)present an enormous challenge due to a wide range of spatial and temporal scales associated with the described phenomena and an enormous number of chemical species and reactions required for detailed desctiprion. The focus of this award is to study and enhance the performance of numerical techniques utilizing multiscale computational reduiction methods,taking advantage of the multiscale nature of the underlying physical proble.\r\nThe broader significance of the research is that it will enable the optimization of numerical solutions in many large scale  numerical problems arising in atmospheric chemical transport,combustion modeling, and  modeling of chemically reactive flows. As a result, simulation times of large scale phenomena will be shortened significantly.",
