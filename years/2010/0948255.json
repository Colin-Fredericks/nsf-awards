 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Renewal Award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program continues to support Professor Dale F. Shellhamer of Point Loma Nazarene College in his investigations of electrophilic reactions of fluorosubstituted alkenes. These studies will be focused on the mechanism of the reaction of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate with monofluoroalkenes to generate fluoro substituted beta-lactams. Kinetic measurements, product studies and computational chemistry will be employed to gain an understanding of the factors that cause additions of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate to change from an apparent one-step process with most fluoroalkenes to a step-wise process with hydrocarbons and some fluorocarbon alkenes. Although non-fluorinated lactams and other fluorinated compounds are often important pharmaceutical agents, fluorinated lactams are largely unexplored and should prove to be very interesting medicinal compounds.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this project will be the involvement of undergraduate students as researchers in all facets of the project. Students will gain expertise in organic synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry.  Professor Shellhamer has an excellent record of involving undergraduates in research and inspiring them to go on to advanced study in chemistry and medicine.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nImproved Synthetic Utility of a Sluggish Electrophile: Reaction of Chlorosulfonyl Isocyanate with Unreactive Alkenes and Evidence for a\n\npre-Equilibrium Complex or Single Electron transfer Intermediate\n\n \n\nDale F. Shellhamer\n\n \n\nDepartment of Chemistry, Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego, CA 92106-2899\n\n \n\nIntroduction\n\n \n\n            Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (CSI) is the most versatile and reactive isocyanate.1a,b,c  CSI reacts with alkenes to give N-chlorosulfonyl-&beta;-lactams that are readily reduced to &beta;-lactams.2a,b,3a-d  This reaction sequence can provide a synthetic route to &beta;-lactam antibiotics4a and cholesterol-lowering drugs.4b  CSI readily reacts with most hydrocarbon alkenes,1a-c but it is a sluggish electrophile with unreactive substrates.  For example, Graf reports 4-chlorostyrene  reacts poorly with CSI, and that CSI does not react with 4-nitrostyrene or 2,6-dichlorostyrene .1c  We found that monofluoroalkenes also react in a sluggish manner with CSI.5a,b  Our kinetic studies show that there is a pre-equilibrium complex formed with CSI and monofluoroalkenes that have calculated ionization potential (IP) values greater than 8.9 eV (Scheme 1).5a  Hydrocarbon alkenes, and monofluoroalkenes with IP values &lt; 8.5 eV, have a Single Electron Transfer (SET) intermediate rather than a complex in equilibrium with the two reagents.5a  We found that lowering the temperature of the reaction mixture to drive the equilibrium toward the complex or SET intermediate improves the reaction outcome.  Reaction times were reduced and the percent yield product increased when CSI and unreactive alkenes are treated under these conditions.5a \n\n \n\nFindings \n\n \n\n            Table 1 contains data for reaction of CSI with one unreactive monofluoroalkene and one hydrocarbon alkene.  The reaction conditions are maximized when the equilibrium is shifted to the complex or SET intermediate (Scheme 1).  For &alpha;-fluorostyrene the percent yield and shortest reaction time is at -15 oC while best conditions for p-chlorostyrene are at 0 oC.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit      \n\n \n\n            A stepwise mechanism with a dipolar intermediate has been accepted for over 50 years.  Our data with monofluoroalkenes did not fit this accepted mechanism and we proposed the SET pathway described in Scheme 1.  The basis for this new mechanism came from product studies, kinetic measurements and quantum chemical calculations.  An added benefit of understanding the new mechanism is that we are able to increase the synthetic utility of  a sluggish electrophile (CSI) with unreactive alkenes.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts \n\n \n\n            During the three years of this proposal supported by the National Science Foundation RUI  grant, three peer reviewed papers were published, the PI presented two oral papers, and eight posters were presented.  All of my students give a poster describing their research during their senior year at the spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (this year on April, 7, 2013 in New Orleans, LA).  Again this year one of my students is giving an oral presentation, and another student is presenting a poster, on campus describing their work.  This on campus presentation, to students not majoring in chemistry, requires a different approach than their presentation at the National American Chemical Society Meeting.  Our goal is to send our students to post-graduate studies with the skills needed to present abstract material to professional peers and the general public.\n\n \n\nReferences  \n\n \n\n(a) Dhar, D.
