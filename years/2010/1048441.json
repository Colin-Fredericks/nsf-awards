 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a joint program and three-day workshop to be held in Tokyo in October 2010 to observe the fiftieth anniversary of the NSF office in Japan.  The workshop will bring together leaders in research and education from the U.S. and Japan to discuss topics of common interest, to review accomplishments of past collaboration, and to identify opportunities for continuing joint activities. Topics on the agenda will encompass science policy as well as key research themes in biology, geology, ocean science, physical sciences, mathematics, information technology, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the workshop are to recap past accomplishments of U.S.-Japan cooperation in science and to lay the basis for future collaborations. Accordingly it will focus attention on research areas of high priority for both countries. The review of past activities and mutual discussions should identify new opportunities for collaboration research and education. In addition to the formal sessions covering particular research areas the participants will engage in informal communication involving site visits and outreach activities to enhance public understanding of science.",
