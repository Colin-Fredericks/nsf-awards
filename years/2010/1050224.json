 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many current Internet applications, users experience a crisis of confidence. Is the website really served from the correct server or was it altered in transit? Is the Facebook invitation really originating from the claimed individual or was it created by an impostor? Is the received email from the claimed individual or was it sent by a spammer? The PI's proposed work is based on the observation that individuals often have physical interactions with resources or other individuals they communicate with. Often, people communicate over the Internet after having met in person. Similarly people visit brick-and-mortar stores and later visit their websites. The intellectual merit is that human-understandable trust establishment is a fundamental research challenge. Despite decades of research, easy-to-use and secure mechanisms that individuals can use to establish trust in Internet resources are still elusive. This exploratory work has the potential to have a transformative effect on the research directions of the community, such that the urgent crisis of confidence users are experiencing for their digital communications can be resolved. The broader impacts of the work are that achieving a high confidence for the authenticity of Internet resources is an urgent need for our society. The proposed research could provide new directions on how to address these important challenges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe had the following major findings during the project.\n\n1) Development of a theory of trust in networks of humans and\ncomputers.\n\nOur community needs a general theory of trust in networks of humans\nand computers. Although we lack a theory of computational trust, we\nbelieve elements of this theory needs to build on concepts such as\nisolation, correctness, and trustworthiness.  Thus, towards a general\ntheory of trust, our first task is to identify primitives of\ncomputational trust akin to primitives of behavioral trust.  A second\ntask is to understand the precise relationship between concepts from\ncomputational trust and those from behavioral trust. Where are they\nthe same?  Where are they different? How do they combine and interact?\nFor example, behavioral trust shares with computational trust the\nnotion of belief in others trustworthiness, e.g., gift-exchange games\nin economics and reputation-building protocols in computer\nscience. Both areas target robust game design, which cannot be\nmanipulated by unscrupulous trustees. The notion of risk aversion and\nrisk management are common to both but are treated differently in\npractice to account for specific domain differences; e.g., one domain\naddresses social sciences concerns whereas the other addresses\nconcerns of computer network design.\n\nThe problem of determining whether a receiver may safely accept\nattributes (e.g., identity, credentials, location) of unknown senders\nin various online social protocols is a special instance of a more\ngeneral problem of establishing trust in interactive protocols. We\nintroduce the notion of interactive trust protocols to illustrate the\nusefulness of social collateral in reducing the inherent trust\nasymmetry in large classes of online user interactions. We define a\nsocial collateral model that allows receivers to accept attributes\nfrom unknown senders based on explicit recommendations received from\nsocial relations. We use social collateral as a measure of both social\nrelations and tie strength among individuals to provide different\ndegrees of accountability when accepting attribute information from\nunknown senders. Our model is robust in the face of several specific\nattacks, such as impersonation and tie-strength-amplification\nattacks. Preliminary experiments with visualization of measured tie\nstrength among users of a social network indicate that the model is\nusable by ordinary protocol participants.\n\nWe have published a paper at the 20th International Workshop on\nSecurity Protocols, Cambridge UK, March 2012, that analyzes\nthese topics.\n\n2) Development of a local trust establishment system.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress on this topic during\nthe project. We have developed SafeSlinger, a system for securely\nexchanging data among a group of users. You may select any fields from\nyour personal contact, photo, and/or developer-designed keys for\nexchange. SafeSlinger is available for free for Android and iPhone smartphones.\n\nSafeSlinger addresses the following problem: How can we start a\ntrusted relationship between people, on the fly, without people having\nsophisticated knowledge of security protocols?\n\nHistorically, researchers have tried a few approaches to this\nproblem. People may meet to digitally sign each other\u00c6s PGP keys,\nwhich leverages physical proximity to bootstrap trust. This method,\nhowever, requires all parties to have some sophisticated knowledge of\nsecurity protocols. Another method would be to have a central\norganization which signs keys, called a certificate authority. The\nlatter method requires considerable investment in infrastructure and\nadministration and, as such, is not a good fit for small spontaneous\ngroups.\n\nThe solution: easily bootstrap secure communication in-person with a\ndevice most people already own - their phone - in just a few easy\nsteps. SafeSlinger is designed to allow users to store any data, such\nas a public key, in their phone\u00c6s address book. When users run\nSafeSlinger, they select their own key from the a..."
