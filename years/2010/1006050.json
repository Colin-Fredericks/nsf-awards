The Aharonov-Bohm effect is one of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive phenomena in quantum mechanics: a charged particle can \"feel\" a magnetic field even when it remains outside this field.  This effect does not have an explanation in classical physics.  The light emitted when spatially separated charge carriers recombine can be stored - \"frozen in place\", then released on demand via a proper combination of external magnetic and electric fields.  This behavior opens a credible route for the manipulation of light in solids with profound implications for information technology, computation, and national security.  This research will be accomplished by employing such advanced scientific tools as nanofabrication, high magnetic fields, powerful lasers, and sophisticated computation.  Advanced facilities available at National Laboratories will be utilized.  This project will support the education of a PhD student, who will be exposed to an array of interrelated issues of growth, characterization, and theoretical analysis, which historically has been excellent training for many scientific careers in education, academia, and industry.  In addition, the project will involve undergraduate students in summer research as well as attract high-school students through cooperation with neighborhood schools.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT: This project will investigate excitons in stacked type-II quantum dots.  These, so-called type-II, excitons are created by a spatially separated electron and hole; such a pair, having overall zero charge, possesses an electric dipole, which in the presence of the magnetic flux give rise to the Aharonov-Bohm phase, observable in optical emission.  The techniques to be utilized include magneto-luminescence (continuous wave and time-resolved) at variable temperatures with and without an external electric field.  Using the proper combination of the magnetic and electric fields, the lifetime of the Aharonov-Bohm excitons will be controlled and manipulated.  The role of the electric field is to remove the orbital momentum degeneracy, and switch the exciton between its bright and dark states on demand.  The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to store the light in the Aharonov-Bohm exciton, which then can re-emit a photon at a controlled time.  These experiments are expected to be of general interest to the scientific community as well as to provide a credible route for the manipulation of light in solids and for quantum computation via exciton-based integrated circuits.  This project will support the education of a PhD student who will be exposed to an array of interrelated issues of growth, characterization, and theoretical analysis, which, for a long time, has been excellent training for many scientific careers in education, academia, and industry.  In addition, the project will involve undergraduate students in summer research as well as high-school students, through cooperation with neighborhood schools.",
