The primary purpose is to enhance the capacity of researchers in the young Learning Sciences field to conduct interdisicplinary work.  \r\n\r\nParticipants will interact prior to the conference through workshop web portals so they can become familiar with one another's work and help organizers identify possible thematic groups for presentation and discussion. Participants will present their research and receive feedback from peers and faculty mentors, discuss issues surrounding the establishment of research programs, career planning, and professional networking.\r\n\r\nWorkshop effectiveness will be evaluated through two surveys. One will be conducted at the conclusion of the workshops and the other one near the end of the subsequent academic term.",
