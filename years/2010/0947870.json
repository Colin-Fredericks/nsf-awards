These images will define the extent of the subducted slab beneath the Baja California Peninsula and define where the mantle is upwelling beneath the Gulf of California.  This region is of high interest to the MARGINS community and results from the study will be relevant to those studying the spatial and temporal variations in volcanism in the Gulf of California, and those trying to understand the tectonic history of Baja California.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe broader impacts include support of a graduate student and involvement of an undergraduate during the summer months.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit.\n\nIn this study, we used seismic surface waves propagating from distant earthquakes crossing the Baja California/Gulf of California region to probe the mantle structure at depths of 30 to 200 km beneath the surface of the Earth, much like a CAT scan of the interior of a body.  The results are a 3-D image of variations in the velocity of elastic shear waves.  A horizontal slice through the image at 100 km depth (see tomographic image) reveals a high-velocity anomaly beneath part of Baja California that is very similar to high velocity anomalies found in active subduction zones, where oceanic plates are sinking beneath continents. \n\nIn this area, active subduction ceased about 12 million years ago, leaving behind at the surface two remnants of a larger oceanic plate:  the Guadalupe and Magdalena microplates outlined on the tomographic image.  It appears that there is still a fossil slab attached to part of the microplates, extending down to about 150 km beneath the surface.  The rest of the slab is thought to have detached and sunk into the deeper mantle beneath North America.  After subduction ceased, volcanism continued near the volcanic arc that was part of the original subduction system, producing a high-magnesium andesitic rock called bajaite.  The location of the bajaites coincides with the landward side of the velocity anomaly, suggesting that they are caused by the melting of the subducted oceanic crust at the end of the fossil subducted slab.\n\nA similar high-velocity anomaly is found beneath the southern San Joaquin valley in California, opposite another unsubducted microplate, the Monterey microplate.  We speculate that the detachment of the slab at depths of 150 to 250 km leaves behind a neutrally buoyant, young oceanic slab that no longer pulls on the trailing plate, causing subduction to cease.  With the cessation of subduction, spreading on the plate boundary between the microplate and the large Pacific plate also ceases and the microplates are then incorporated into the Pacific plate.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe recognition of the existence of fossil slabs attached to microplates forces a re-examination of the tectonic and volcanic history of western North America over the last 20 million years.  We prepared a press release on our findings that attracted wide-spread media attention, thus informing the public about one of the fundamental processes of plate tectonics.  This grant supported the PhD research of one graduate student and two undergraduates were part of the research and co-authors on the primary paper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald W Forsyth"
