 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bio/computational Evolution in Action CONsortium (BEACON) is a Science and Technology Center (STC) that enables research on evolutionary dynamics in natural and artificial systems and training of multi-disciplinary scientists in bio/computation, with a unique focus on the intersection of evolutionary biology, computer science, and engineering. The Center will enhance the development of applications of computational methods in biology, the use of artificial intelligence in computer science, and the enhancement of genetic algorithms in engineering design. Evolution by natural selection defines an algorithmic approach to finding solutions for complex problems; computer scientists and engineers have harnessed similar algorithms to a diversity of challenges that require optimization over multiple competing dimensions. Likewise, biologists have begun to employ digital modeling of the evolutionary process to examine evolution of complex biological structures and patterns in areas such as paleontology and the gene networks, which defy experimental manipulation in vivo. The Center will promote these interdisciplinary efforts by coordinating activities through three thrust groups: (1) Evolution of Genomes, Networks, and Evolvability, (2) Evolution of Behavior and Intelligence, and (3) Evolution of Communities and Collective Dynamics. \r\n\r\nThis center has the potential to transform both biology and computational sciences by developing digital experiments to test and apply fundamental principles of evolutionary biology. The possible impacts will be far reaching: from cyber-security to everyday computing applications, from the evolution of disease resistance to the self-organization of social behavior. The BEACON center will train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and educate the public about evolution and its role in solving real-world problems through significant educational outreach for K12 students and science museums.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Natural evolution has a remarkable ability to produce organisms possessing novel features that enable them to thrive in most environments around the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;To a human observer, the biochemical and physiological complexity of these features is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex and elegant adaptive designs abound in nature, from the development of a single cell into a fully-formed organism to the reasoning power of the human brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying evolutionary processes allows us to better understand the amazing biodiversity around us and provides a template that can be applied as a constructive tool by scientists and engineers to solve problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolutionary change requires only reproduction where traits are inherited, a source of variation so that traits can change and new traits can arise, and for these traits to directly affect survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, while those are the minimum ingredients for evolution to occur, understanding the nuances of evolutionary change has been more complicated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action was an NSF Science and Technology Center founded in 2010 to explore evolution from a broad perspective in both natural and artificial systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Center made great strides in its mission to<strong>&nbsp;illuminate and harness the power of evolution in action to advance science and technology and benefit society</strong>. The key principle underlying the Center was that transformative discoveries in both computing and biology are possible through studying evolution&nbsp;<em>as it happens</em>, in both natural and digital domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEACON supported hundreds of projects involving over a thousand researchers across dozens of departments at member universities. The consortium was led by Michigan State University, and included North Carolina A&amp;T State University, the University of Idaho, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Washington.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">BEACON researchers advanced evolutionary understanding with a combination of theory and experiment that used numerous study systems including simulations, real evolving computational systems (?digital evolution?), laboratory work, and field studies. Natural organisms (from simple bacteria like&nbsp;<em>E.</em>&nbsp;<em>coli</em>&nbsp;to complex vertebrates, such as spotted hyena) were often paired with novel evolutionary computation systems that allow both experimental and applied research.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members of BEACON used these insights in evolutionary theory for more applied purposes. Developers of evolutionary algorithms have often borrowed concepts from biology to improve problem-solving methods and BEACON accelerated this research by capturing many important nuances from evolutionary theory to solve far more complex problems. For example, BEACON members studied how mutation rates influence evolvability, which they used to produce more evolvable evolutionary algorithms; likewise, they were able to transfer principles of how coevolution produces more complex solutions into computational systems. BEACON researchers also studied evolution directly in artificial systems,&nbsp;providing biologists with insight into the dynamics of the evolutionary process and the critical factors underlying emergent properties and behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, studies into how digital organisms distribute computational processes among themselves provided insights into the origins of multicellularity and division of labor among cells.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As an important bridge between natural organisms and evolved solutions to computational problems, BEACON members made extensive use of&nbsp;<em>digital organisms</em>, which are self-replicating computer programs that undergo open-ended evolution, interact with each other, and alter their environments. Such digital evolution systems are powerful research tools that make the evolutionary process transparent while giving researchers unparalleled control over their experiments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A major focus of BEACON was sharing the deep understanding afforded by this transformative research with the&nbsp;<strong>broader public</strong>, encouraging exposure to and intuition about evolution through first-hand experience. Although evolutionary science is the fundamental explanatory principle in biology, it continues to be widely misunderstood. Being able to observe and perform experiments on actively evolving systems helps people appreciate not only the creative power of evolutionary mechanisms, but also the nature of scientific reasoning itself. Digital evolution in particular provides a revolutionary educational tool that brings evolution to the classroom, to a museum, and even to a web browser through BEACON-developed software such as Avida-ED.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEACON also encouraged&nbsp;<em>diversity as a common thread in all activities:&nbsp;</em>the Center challenged the perception that diversity efforts are limited to programming and recruiting. BEACON fostered a culture in which all participants reach their full potential by creating a unified community of inclusion while diligently supporting the unique needs of underrepresented groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">BEACON will have a powerful legacy: the center has helped reframe public perceptions of evolution and increased understanding of scientific methods. At the same time, it has produced a conceptual framework to firmly establish evolutionary biology as an&nbsp;<em>experimental&nbsp;</em>science and cement its links to computing in a cross-fertilization that enhances both fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, BEACON supported dozens of students and post-docs each year, readying a generation of scientists to approach evolution studies with these powerful techniques.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;A&nbsp;Ofria</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/0939454/0939454_10036393_1674104321457_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/0939454/0939454_10036393_1674104321457_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"An Overview of Study Systems in BEACON\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/0939454/0939454_10036393_1674104321457_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"An Overview of Study Systems in BEACON\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">BEACON researchers study a wide range of evolving systems; some have rich natural dynamics, while others are fast and easy to interpret.

  "por_txt_cntn": "Natural evolution has a remarkable ability to produce organisms possessing novel features that enable them to thrive in most environments around the word.  To a human observer, the biochemical and physiological complexity of these features is amazing.  Complex and elegant adaptive designs abound in nature, from the development of a single cell into a fully-formed organism to the reasoning power of the human brain.  Studying evolutionary processes allows us to better understand the amazing biodiversity around us and provides a template that can be applied as a constructive tool by scientists and engineers to solve problems.  Evolutionary change requires only reproduction where traits are inherited, a source of variation so that traits can change and new traits can arise, and for these traits to directly affect survival.  Of course, while those are the minimum ingredients for evolution to occur, understanding the nuances of evolutionary change has been more complicated.\nThe BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action was an NSF Science and Technology Center founded in 2010 to explore evolution from a broad perspective in both natural and artificial systems.  The Center made great strides in its mission to illuminate and harness the power of evolution in action to advance science and technology and benefit society. The key principle underlying the Center was that transformative discoveries in both computing and biology are possible through studying evolution as it happens, in both natural and digital domains.  BEACON supported hundreds of projects involving over a thousand researchers across dozens of departments at member universities. The consortium was led by Michigan State University, and included North Carolina A&amp;T State University, the University of Idaho, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Washington.\nBEACON researchers advanced evolutionary understanding with a combination of theory and experiment that used numerous study systems including simulations, real evolving computational systems (?digital evolution?), laboratory work, and field studies. Natural organisms (from simple bacteria like E. coli to complex vertebrates, such as spotted hyena) were often paired with novel evolutionary computation systems that allow both experimental and applied research.\nMembers of BEACON used these insights in evolutionary theory for more applied purposes. Developers of evolutionary algorithms have often borrowed concepts from biology to improve problem-solving methods and BEACON accelerated this research by capturing many important nuances from evolutionary theory to solve far more complex problems. For example, BEACON members studied how mutation rates influence evolvability, which they used to produce more evolvable evolutionary algorithms; likewise, they were able to transfer principles of how coevolution produces more complex solutions into computational systems. BEACON researchers also studied evolution directly in artificial systems, providing biologists with insight into the dynamics of the evolutionary process and the critical factors underlying emergent properties and behaviors.  For example, studies into how digital organisms distribute computational processes among themselves provided insights into the origins of multicellularity and division of labor among cells.\nAs an important bridge between natural organisms and evolved solutions to computational problems, BEACON members made extensive use of digital organisms, which are self-replicating computer programs that undergo open-ended evolution, interact with each other, and alter their environments. Such digital evolution systems are powerful research tools that make the evolutionary process transparent while giving researchers unparalleled control over their experiments. \nA major focus of BEACON was sharing the deep understanding afforded by this transformative research with the broader public, encouraging exposure to and intuition about evolution through first-hand experience. Although evolutionary science is the fundamental explanatory principle in biology, it continues to be widely misunderstood. Being able to observe and perform experiments on actively evolving systems helps people appreciate not only the creative power of evolutionary mechanisms, but also the nature of scientific reasoning itself. Digital evolution in particular provides a revolutionary educational tool that brings evolution to the classroom, to a museum, and even to a web browser through BEACON-developed software such as Avida-ED.  BEACON also encouraged diversity as a common thread in all activities: the Center challenged the perception that diversity efforts are limited to programming and recruiting. BEACON fostered a culture in which all participants reach their full potential by creating a unified community of inclusion while diligently supporting the unique needs of underrepresented groups. \nBEACON will have a powerful legacy: the center has helped reframe public perceptions of evolution and increased understanding of scientific methods. At the same time, it has produced a conceptual framework to firmly establish evolutionary biology as an experimental science and cement its links to computing in a cross-fertilization that enhances both fields.  Finally, BEACON supported dozens of students and post-docs each year, readying a generation of scientists to approach evolution studies with these powerful techniques.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles A Ofria"
