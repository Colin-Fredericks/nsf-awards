 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hazards imposed by arsenic on human health are well recognized and nowhere better exemplified than South/Southeast Asia where the consumption of arsenic contaminated ground water has resulted high incidences of skin disorders and various cancers.  Arsenic is usually associated with iron oxide and other minerals in sediments.  However, in the absence of oxygen, microbes can carry out iron and arsenic reduction reactions that result in arsenic release from sediments and accumulation in ground water.  The contribution of iron vs. arsenate reduction to arsenic release, however, is unclear.  Furthermore, our understanding of arsenic fate and transport within soils and sediments is limited by poorly understood biological and geochemical processes occurring within complex ground water flow pathways.  Therefore, the overarching goal of this research is to determine how microbial metabolism impacts arsenic transport in sediments and soils.  Specifically, researchers will investigate the expression of bacterial genes responsible for iron and arsenic reduction and commensurate biogeochemical processes responsible for controlling the partitioning and mobility of arsenic (along with their spatial distribution) within model systems that simulate the physical complexity of natural soils and sediments.  The proposed research integrates biogeochemical and molecular genetic approaches aimed at developing a mechanistic understanding of the impacts of microbes on arsenic contamination of ground water.  Because the nature of the arsenic problem is rooted in geomicrobiology, the intellectual merit of the proposed research is the generation of crucial information important to understanding the mechanism(s) leading to arsenic release or retention in sediments.  The results will lead to a detailed conceptual model of how genetics and geochemical processes impact microbe-mineral interactions and arsenic fate. The broader impacts of the research will be to integrate research with teaching activities and community outreach by participating in a laboratory research mentorship program (called ACCESS) for community college students of under represented groups and a high school science summer program called COSMOS.  Lastly, the collaboration will enhance and promote diversity through intercampus mentorship of minority graduate students at both Stanford and UCSC.",

In order to study the processes ultimately controlling arsenic\u00c6s influence on water quality within soils and sediments, we developed a series of approaches that allows us to resolved the governing (fate determining) processes controlling arsenic (and other elements of biogeochemical importance) fate within the complexity of surface (soils) and subsurface (sediments) systems.

Utilizing experimental measurement and reactive transport simulations under both oxygenated (i.e., aerated) and anoxic advecting solute conditions, we reveal an important change in the distribution of arsenic.  Our results provide several important findings on the behavior of arsenic within the environment.  Possibly most importantly, we deduced that microbial reduction of arsenic alone causes it to change its partitioning from dominantly on the solids to appreciably in the aqueous (water) phase.  This has huge ramifications when projecting water quality within aquifers having the potential to become anaerobic.  From our work, we also observe that while arsenic is generally release to aquifer waters, under seemingly aerobic conditions, interior regions of soil and sediment aggregates (or fine grain deposits), arsenic repartitions to regions proximal to flow paths owing to microbially induced redox gradients within fine-grained regions.  While the arsenic remains stable (i.e., residing on the solids) under aerated conditions, a transition to anaerobic conditions within the flow path leads to a rapid pulse of arsenic release to pore water.  Finally, our research shows that iron(III) and manganese(III/IV)-oxides having strong controls on arsenic fate but in very different capacities.
