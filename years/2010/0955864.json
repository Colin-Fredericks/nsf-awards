 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Neil K. Garg of the University of California, Los Angeles.  Professor Garg will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing complex molecules. First, methods for synthesizing indolynes, or aryne derivatives of indoles, will be developed.  These efforts will enable various studies of fundamental indolyne reactivity. Second, Professor Garg will uncover methods for preparing fused indolines, motifs often encountered in naturally occurring complex molecules. This latter methodology will be applied toward the total synthesis of aspidophylline A, an intriguing alkaloid that possesses a densely functionalized furoindoline core.\r\n\r\nProfessor Garg will also undertake three educational projects that interweave research and teaching.  The first project involves an outreach program targeting a local high school that predominantly serves underrepresented groups.  The second educational project involves interactions with the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, where Professor Garg will serve as an alumni advisor for the international NSF/REU program.  Finally, an extensive synthetic organic chemistry website will be created that utilizes visual aids to convey the importance of chemical synthesis and explain various experimental techniques. \r\n",
