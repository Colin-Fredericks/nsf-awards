 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of a Physics REU site at the Molecular Physics Laboratory at SRI International with a focus on atomic, molecular, and laser physics. This program provides to talented undergraduate students in science, mathematics, and engineering the opportunity to participate in research projects for 12 weeks during the summer. Based on the individual student's interests, each student is assigned to a Ph.D. mentor from the SRI staff and works with this mentor on a project that is part of the mentor's research program. In addition, the REU program presents a seminar series, in which SRI staff members or outside visitors describe their research programs. A series of scientific activities such as visits to industrial, university, and government laboratories complement the experience, as do additional social activities. At the end of the summer, each REU student presents a seminar to the MPL staff on the results of his/her research project. With help from their mentors, the students also prepare a written summary of their research plan and goals at the beginning of the summer and a final report at the end. Underrepresented minorities and women students are especially recruited and encouraged to apply to participate.   This site is co-funded by the Division of Physics at the National Science Foundation and by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

The 25 participants in our program were selected from a pool of over 400 talented applicants. Special emphasis was placed on recruiting diverse groups each summer; 40% of our participants in the past 4 years were women, and 28% of the students were from under-represented minorities. The students contributed significantly in advancing the program\u00c6s efforts in a variety of research areas, including: the development of new droplet-based microfluidics techniques to perform numerous biological experiments; the design and assembly of a new compact Echelle spectrograph for aeronomical research; the development of mass spectroscopy methods to study plasma biomarkers; novel experiments to study the photochemistry and radical kinetics in aeronomy research; nonlinear optics experiments using stimulated scattering; and in the study of molecular reactions that affect the surfaces of hypersonic flight vehicles during their reentry into the atmosphere.\nEach REU student in our program was mentored by a staff scientist in our laboratory, and in-depth training was often supplemented with help from postdoctoral fellows. Environmental safety personnel and ergonomics specialists were always available on campus to train the students in lab safety protocols. The students performed research on a small project that was part of a larger research program with the assigned mentor. The students received extensive hands-on training in all aspects of performing research in a laboratory setting, from conceptualizing the problem, to executing experiments and, finally, analyzing data and presenting their work to the scientists and their peers in the laboratory at a final seminar series. The students also benefitted from several seminars given over the summer by scientists at SRI International, and invited guest speakers from all over the country. To complement these scientific interactions, the program included visits to industrial, university, and government laboratories in Silicon Valley. Some examples of such activities over the past four summers include visits to Stanford University, the Joint BioEnergy Institute, Intel Labs, and IBM, to name a few.\nSummer research programs for undergraduate students are also a vehicle for them to decide whether scientific research is a career path they would like to pursue after graduation. Scientists in our laboratory mentored students on wide-ranging career-related topics that included one-on-one sessions with students about what to expect out of a PhD program, and information on lateral career choices in science and engineering after an undergraduate degree. One measure of the success of our program lies in the fraction of our REU students that opt to attend graduate school. Almost all of our student participants opted for this career path, with one student from the past four years choosing to participate in post-baccalaureate research to pursue a MD/PhD career path. Our program has helped in developing a qualified Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. Over the past 4 years, we have had local students return over numerous school breaks to interact with their mentors and write journal manuscripts. We have published six peer-reviewed journal articles with former REU students (these include participants from earlier REU site awa..."
