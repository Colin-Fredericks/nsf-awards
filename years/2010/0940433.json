 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this initiative is to provide technical assistance to Tribal Colleges and Universities that are currently implementing or plan to implement projects funded by NSF?s Tribal College and Universities Program (NSF TCUP). Through the proposed AIHEC-NSF TCU Technical Assistance Program, AIHEC will work with NSF TCUP grantees to identify and address project implementation challenges. Emphasis is on helping TCU project personnel develop the skills and strategies needed to more effectively and efficiently manage and administer their projects. Successful implementation of the proposed AIHEC-NSF TCU Technical Assistance Program will result in a higher success rate among Tribal Colleges and Universities in implementing their STEM program improvement projects, and strengthening their institutional capacity to develop and sustain high quality STEM instructional and research programs.\r\nThe project is intended to support TCUs in implementing their STEM projects with a continual focus on the cultural relevance. This will be accomplished through use of the AIHEC Indigenous Framework for Evaluation, which provides specific guidelines for project implementation as well as evaluation. AIHEC?s ground-breaking work in this area will inform all aspects of the technical assistance implementation.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAmerican Indians are underrepresented in STEM areas.  The 2010 US Census reported  a total American Indian (AI) population of 5.2 million.  According to the census bureau of the total number of American Indians there were 67,644 American Indian and Alaska Natives twenty-five and older who had earned a graduate degree or professional degree, or approximately 1.4% of the total AI population.  Of this total the percentage in STEM is not reported possibly because the number is too small to sort.  Clearly the number of American Indians in STEM is inadequate.  In an effort to address the issue of underrepresented American Indians in STEM the National Science Foundation created the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).  The first awards were made in FY 2001.   TCUP strengthens the tribal colleges primary purpose of providing to American Indians quality higher education opportunities through education programs that are locally and culturally based.  It also is a vehicle for NSF to address \"broadening participation from underrepresented groups and diverse institutions across all geographical regions in all NSF activities by integrating research with education, and building capacity\" (NSF BP Publication).\n\n \n\nThe TCUP Technical Assistance Project was not a research project.  The project provided technical assistance designed to assist funded projects in all areas of post award project management.  The work was completed from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2012.   The activities included site visits and workshops on project management, leadership, and proposal development for tribal colleges seeking a TCUP project.   Fourteen technical assistance site visits to tribal colleges were made during the project.  A Report of a Visit was written following each site visit.  Included with the information reported are \"recommendations\" for project improvement.  The report of each visit was made available to each tribal college and is on file with the designated AIHEC SRO.  Generally, each site visit focused on improving project programmatic and fiscal management and general project administration.  Technical Assistance was provided in website exposure to nsf.gov and Fastlane, CFR\u00c6s and OMB Circulars, documentation and record keeping, fund management, budgeting, reporting, expenditures, allowable costs, cuff accounts, residual funds and re-budgeting, reports and responses to general questions.\n\n A Project Management Workshop was conducted for all existing TCUP projects.  The workshop covered grants management training in the following areas:  overview of the NSF-TCU program, elements of a typical proposal, the Award Letter, and the Annual Report Template, how to implement a successful project, community and stakeholders, data collection and record keeping, telling the story and using success, fiscal and fund management, evaluation and assessment, and project dissemination.  A Proposal Development Workshop was held targeting tribal colleges that had not received a TCUP award.  The workshop Agenda was designed to share proposal writing information for three NSF Programs, TCUP, Noyce, and ATE. The workshop provided information about TCUP in the following areas:  overview and brief history of the NSF-TCUP program, sample abstracts of successful proposals, TCUP project ideas including possible goals and objectives, elements of a typical one page project summary, the Merit Review Criteria, evaluation to include the Indigenous Evaluation Framework, budget preparation and budget justification.\n\n A TAP project brochure was developed and distributed at every opportunity.  A power point presentation that highlights project information was developed and was shared on several occasions.  A link to project information is available on the American Indian Higher Education Consortium website www.aihec.org .  Direct access to project information can be accessed at http://www.aihec.org/programs/NSF-TCUP.cfm .  Additional access is available at the Tribal Coll..."
