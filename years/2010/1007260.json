Knot theory has applications in understanding large and small \r\naspects of the universe, as well as long DNA strands confined to small space.\r\nA central question in knot theory is determining\r\nthe complexity of knots which in turn requires developing computable\r\nnon-trivial knot invariants.\r\nAgain holomorphic curves has recently provided a plethora of such useful\r\nknot invariants.\r\nThe Principal Investigator plans to develop other knot invariants,\r\nmotivated by string theory, that should be connected to these invariants\r\nbased on holomorphic curves.",
