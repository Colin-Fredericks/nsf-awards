 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperpycnal (high density) flows coming directly from the rivers and continental-shelf fluid muds are considered to control considerable cross-margin sediment transport but are difficult to study due to unpredictable nature of such large discharge events. Dam removal on Elwa River of the Olympic Mountains in Washington may allow the study of such events. Two dams will be removed over a 2-year period on the Elwa starting in 2011, during which time models predict turbidite formation and gravity flows (hyperpycnal plumes) in Juan de Fuca Straits. The PI will utilize this opportunity to study the high-density flows through real-time monitoring of suspended sediment in the rivers and offshore. They hypothesize that most of the sediment discharged soon after dam removal will move to relatively deep water as high density plumes move below the influence of waves and currents. They will study four specific river discharge conditions and the two peak discharges on Elwa will allow these conditions to be investigated individually.\r\nHyperpycnal flows to the ocean have not been studied in any detailed before and the proposed work should bring new information on the role of these elusive events on the dispersal of sediment to the basins. The PIs plan to incorporate the work with some field based courses and will support one graduate student.",

These included acoustic and optical sensors (e.g., ADVs, ABSs, ADCPs, high-resolution ADCPs, OBSs, and CTDs, to use industry jargon/alphabet soup) for measurements of currents, turbulence, and suspended-sediment concentrations. At least one package was deployed nearly continuously for 3.5 years, providing an excellent time-series record of boundary-layer sediment dynamics.</p>\n<p>Every 3-5 months, we conducted a survey from the R/V Barnes to recover instrument packages, collect seabed grab samples and/or box cores, and survey water-column salinity, temperature, and sediment concentrations. We also worked with USGS to make several &ldquo;rapid response&rdquo; cruises to survey water-column sediment properties during flood events.</p>\n<p>A key goal of this project was to capture real-time measurements of hyperpycnal plumes, a type of sediment gravity flow that emanates directly from rivers. Gravity flows are known to be key mechanisms of sediment transfer in coastal regions, but few have been measured in nature.</p>\n<p>Additional goals included evaluation of &ldquo;where will the mud go, and how fast?&rdquo; following a major dam removal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key Scientific Findings</p>\n<p>Measurements of gravity flows were one piece of a rich dataset. A rare gravity flow event occurred in March 2014, coinciding with a rain-on-snow event. This event produced ~30 cm of sediment deposition near the river mouth; measurements suggest that the primary instrument was located in the &ldquo;plunging zone&rdquo; of a gravity flow, where abundant sand was in suspension within at least 2 m of the bed (if not more), turbulent kinetic energy was suppressed, and rapid deposition occurred (see first figure). This highlights a rare set of measurements from the plunging zone (and just beyond) of a coarse-grained gravity flow, and aids our understanding of how rapidly such flows can deposit sediment, but also how rapidly they can extinguish themselves, even on steep shelves. The rapid deposition of sand over a gravel bed during the March 2014 event also provided a natural laboratory for studying shear stress estimation methods over coarse, mixed-size substrates.</p>\n<p>Another key outcome was an evaluation of how major amounts of fine-grained sediment were dispersed in the coastal ocean after erosion from the reservoirs. Prior to dam removal, much of the seabed near the river mouth was coarse sand and gravel, and was expected to be buried by fine-grained sediment. However, we documented little change in substrate character across much of this area. Instead, we demonstrated that strong, asymmetric tidal currents were competent to erode and transport most of the sediment delivered during rain events within days to weeks. A small deposit formed in an embayment near the river mouth, but tidal currents precluded measurable deposition elsewhere (see second and third figures).</p>\n<p>Other products from the surveys included estimates of particle clearance rates from the river plume during flood and non-flood conditions (see fourth figure), as well as detailed characterizations of grain sizes, isotopic signatures, and physical structures within the new sheltered mud deposit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Education and Outreach</p>\n<p>This project was used to provide rich education opportunities to a diverse group of students. Dr. Kristen Lee Webster compared measurements from the Elwha Delta and Skagit Delta to complete her dissertation; Emily Eidam reported on the tidal dispersal of un-dammed sediment for her master&rsquo;s project, and continued to use plume, boundary-layer, and flood deposit measurements for the majority of her doctoral dissertation.
