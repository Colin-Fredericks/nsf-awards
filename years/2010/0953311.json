 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: This project focuses on the fundamental theoretical and experimental study of metamaterial covers, operating as cloaks to suppress the otherwise inevitable disturbance that near-field sensors, imagers and absorbers produce on their surroundings. These findings will be aimed at advancing near-field measurements and imaging techniques, and increasing the efficiency of green-energy devices. Furthermore, these research concepts will be combined with a number of outreach and educational activities, aimed at integrating metamaterial research and education, with special emphasis on diversity and minorities.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project applies the unique property of plasmonic metamaterial shells to tunnel, capture and extract energy, combined with minimized scattering. In near-field probing applications, this may realize sensors that measure and image without perturbing their own measurement, drastically improving their overall performance. Moreover, this technology holds the potential to match, tune and maximize the efficiency of energy-harvesting devices by eliminating scattering, reflections and\r\nunwanted coupling. Finally, this project will establish thin-film conformal metamaterial technology also suited for a variety of other applications, from radio to optical frequencies.\r\nBroader Impacts: These results may substantially improve biomedical measurements and the efficiency of absorbing semiconductor devices. Moreover, the educational plan broadens the project?s impact through various activities, including the creation of a website, combining teaching resources on metamaterials with cutting-edge research updates, and the organization of a student symposium on metamaterials. These efforts will fill the gap between the considerable research activity on metamaterials and its currently limited educational extent, broadening the impact of these exciting topics to all society.",
