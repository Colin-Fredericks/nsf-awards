Its aim is to expose and explain the major recent accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and faculty, and to advance discoveries in the field by bringing together present and future experts in a supportive atmosphere, with special attention to and financial support for under-represented groups, graduate students, and young faculty.\r\n\r\nSince 1985, the Geometry Festival has been held in rotation at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Duke University and New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.",
