In collaboration with oceanographers and marine\r\nbiologists, the project aims to design motion, communication and\r\ninteraction protocols that maximize the amount of scientific information\r\ncollected by the platforms.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses multi-dimensional problems of relevance in\r\nEngineering and Computer Science by unifying fundamental concepts from\r\nmultiple cyberphysical domains (robotics, autonomy, combinatorics, and\r\nnetwork science).  Our team has expertise in a broad range of scientific\r\ndisciplines, including control theory and theoretical computer science and\r\ntheir applications to multi-agent systems, robotics and sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will have a positive impact on the emerging\r\ntechnology of autonomous and reliable robotic networks, performing a broad\r\nrange of environmental monitoring and logistic tasks.  Our educational and\r\noutreach objectives are manifold and focus on (1) integrating the proposed\r\nresearch themes into undergraduate education and research, e.g., via the\r\nexisting NSF REU site at the USC Computer Science Department, and (2)\r\nmounting a vigorous program of outreach activities, e.g., via a\r\nwell-developed collaboration with the UCSB Center for Science and\r\nEngineering Partnerships.",
