 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nThe importance of understanding and proper preparation for hazard mitigation topics in undergraduate civil engineering students is clear. This expansion effort focuses on the dissemination of previously implemented exercises that have been rigorously assessed and improved. The primary goal is to engage a wide range of students in innovative laboratory experiences based within the framework of earthquake engineering, one readily demonstrated element of hazard mitigation. The laboratory exercises, utilizing benchscale instructional shake tables and cyberinfrastructure tools provide learning experiences involving a combination of fundamental concepts and emerging technology. The mechanism for deployment is through a premier cyberinfrastructure project, NEES (Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation).  Tools have been developed for the remote control (tele-operation) and the viewing and analysis of streaming data and video (tele-participation) for the control of the instructional shake tables over the internet. This experience is enhancing undergraduate education, better preparing students to enter the workforce with a deeper understanding of hazard mitigation, and encouraging students to seek out innovative post-graduate experiences. A diverse group of students and institutions is involved, serving to broaden and engage the workforce of the future. Faculty development activities are also included to build an educational collaboratory. \r\n",
