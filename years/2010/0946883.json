 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Joseph A. Heppert, Mikhail V. Barybin and Timothy Jackson from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such: 1) characterization of manganese complexes involved in environmentally-friendly oxidation reactions; (2) azulene-based organometallics as platforms for molecular charge transport systems; (3) design of metal- and anion-binding supramolecular scaffolds; (4) characterization of heme and non-heme iron proteins involved in heme and iron sequestration in bacteria; (5) de novo design of heme proteins; and (6) identification of reactive oxygen species involved in the regulation of hypoxia inducible factors. In addition, the spectrometer will be available to researchers at other universities such as Kansas State, Wichita State, Emporia State, Northeastern State, and Prairie View A&M University.\r\n\r\nAn EPR spectrometer yields detailed information of the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to the imaging of biological tissues. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Kansas and collaborating universities.",
