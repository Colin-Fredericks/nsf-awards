 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funds for a two-year renewal of the St. Elias Erosion-tectonics Project (STEEP).  STEEP is a 9 institution, multidisciplinary study of the St. Elias orogen in southern Alaska that involves researchers examining the system from the outcrop to lithosphere scale.  To date, STEEP has produced 17 papers with another 9 submitted or nearing submission, sponsored 71 abstracts, will have matriculated 5 masters and 4 Doctoral students by Spring 2010, and fundamentally changed our understanding of Alaskan tectonics and the interaction of tectonics and climate in mountain building.  The renewal funds will be used for:  1) final processing and interpretation of some key datasets that were not acquired until year 5 of the project including the marine seismic survey (ship delays) and reoccupation of key GPS sites (weather problems in 2008); and  2) a complete integration of results which was not possible until now due to these delays. A complete integration and synthesis of these superb datasets has the potential to be transformative in our understanding of how crustal structure and tectonic forces interact with Earth surface processes of glacial erosion and sedimentary transport to grow a mountain range and a massive continental shelf.",

If erosion and associated deposition are faster than tectonics, the system can become what is called sub-critical and complicated faulting can develop. This scenario is exactly what we think is happening in the St Elias Mountains.\n\nThe tectonic driver for this interaction is the underthrusting of the Yakutat Terrane which during STEEP was discovered to be an remarkably thick oceanic plateau (see STEEP 3D figure).  This discovery was possible due to geophysical imaging and modeling geophysical where reflections and refractions of soundwaves through the mountains, shelf and deep sea fan where recorded and processed to make images from surface to mantle.  Integration offshore to onshore allowed mapping of key fault lines that defined the transition from nearly flat underthrusting of this Terrane to collision of this Terrane with North America as the thicker portions ident into southeast Alaska driving mountain building.\n\nBased on our offshore imaging and mapping to drill intervals on the shelf and in the fan, around 1 million years ago climate change that amounted to an intensificaiton of North American glaciation changed the erosional process and erosion began to dominate over tectonics.
