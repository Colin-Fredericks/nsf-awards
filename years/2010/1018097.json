 "awd_abstract_narration": "Query-Driven Visualization (QDV) is a knowledge discovery strategy that combines state-of-the-art methods from scientific data management with modern visualization approaches to support rapid data analysis. By restricting computational and cognitive workload in visualization and interpretation to records defined to be significant by a scientist, fast visualization responses can answer intuitive questions about the data. Thus, query-driven techniques are ideal tools for data exploration and hypothesis testing. However, uncertainty in data and query can strongly and negatively influence a visualization result and hence the insight obtained from it.  This research project explores a novel framework that generalizes QDV and is aimed at addressing deficiencies in existing methods. \r\n\r\nThe approach to providing robust visualization techniques that incorporate the uncertain nature of the analysis process into the visualization result, thus enabling tools that will allow users to factor uncertainty into the conclusions drawn from data sets are based on modeling uncertainty at all levels of the query-driven process. The methods developed leverage multi-resolution data representations incorporating uncertainty information; and this results in improved efficiency and parallel computation in answering queries over very large, high-dimensional data sets. New visualization techniques are derived by taking advantage of the improved flexibility, generality and efficiency of the provided framework, to address specifically the needs of comparative visualization of an ensemble of data sets pertaining to a common science problem. \r\n\r\nThe resulting robust query-driven visualization techniques that incorporate the uncertain nature of the analysis in the knowledge discovery process will allow users to factor uncertainty into the conclusions drawn from complex, large-scale, high-dimensional data sets. In order to increase the impact of the research, results will be accessible via the project Web site (http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~joy/NSF-IIS-1018097.html), and incorporated into an open-source visualization package.

  "por_txt_cntn": "Scientific visualization refers to the process of representing raw, scientific data as images, providing an external aid to improve the interpretations of large data sets.  Over the years, the development of visualization methods has been complicated by the dramatic increase in quantities and complexities of the data.  Scientists and engineers have developed ever evolving techniques that generate huge amounts of data of ever increasing complexity that stress the basic techniques of visualization. \nThis project addressed this problem by providing new techniques for visualization based upon Query-Driven Visualization, which is a visualization-based discovery strategy that combines state-of-the-art methods from Scientific Data Management with modern visualization approaches to support rapid data analysis, foster dataset exploration, and help scientists to interactively build and test hypotheses with their data.  These new strategies allow one to address both the complexity and the uncertainty in the data by limiting the attention of the algorithms to records defined to be significant by a scientist.\nWe have provided a new framework that enables one to model uncertainty in the visualization process, and have been able to integrate statistical methods into our analysis techniques that enable these new methods to be used on a wide variety of scientific and engineering problems.  This has enabled us to address problems that require analysis of ensembles of data, collections of data sets generated by a myriad of scientific simulations with varying parameters. Many computational scientists believe that these \"ensembles\" of simulations will be the primary computational method to perform large-scale experiments in the future.  The resulting ensemble data sets have a distribution of values at each point, and visualization techniques for these problems have been limited in the past. \nThe efforts behind this project have been successful in applying these new methods to problems in multispectral imaging, groundwater modeling, weather modeling, flow visualization, wind-turbine modeling, and materials modeling.  We have integrated these methods into an open-source software system that is publicly available.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth I Joy"
