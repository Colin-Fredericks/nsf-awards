The Information Integration and Informatics (III) program focuses on the processes and technologies involved in creating, managing, analyzing, visualizing, and understanding heterogeneous data, information and knowledge in order to enable intelligent actions throughout the knowledge life cycle. Given the III focus, the workshop goals include: (1) Analyzing the research and development issues of problems that are fundamental in making progress toward understanding complex data, information, knowledge and processes; (2) Specifying current and new areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; (3) Identifying needed collaborations (e.g., inter-disciplinary, academic-industry, international, inter-agency); and (4) Identifying research initiatives and facilities needed to meet current and future challenges.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is expected to have a significant impact for the participants and the broad Information, Integration and Informatics (III) research community. The participants will have an opportunity to explore fruitful collaboration and synergism by sharing accomplishments, providing demonstrations and interacting with each other. Workshop discussions will also focus on the objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by the Information, Integration and Informatics program and future research directions and activities for the III community. The workshop results, including new research directions that will be identified will be broadly publicized to the research community through publications and the workshop website (http://cs.georgetown.edu/NSF-III-2010/). The results dissemination is expected to inform and motivate III research community in their research, collaborative and education activities, and spur other innovative research directions.",
