 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription of genomic DNA into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase is the first step of gene expression, and is extensively controlled in all living organisms. The goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism by which a global transcriptional regulator DksA controls the bacterial response to starvation and stress. During starvation, DksA acts in concert with the alarmone ppGpp and to couple the ribosomal RNA transcription, and thus ribosome production, to the cellular demand for protein synthesis. The mechanism of the DksA action is very unusual: unlike most transcription initiation factors, DksA does not recognize a specific DNA sequence and instead directly binds to RNA polymerase near the enzyme's active site to alter the structure and the stability of transcription complexes. In this work, the Artsimovitch laboratory will dissect DksA interactions with RNA polymerase, investigate DksA effects on transcription elongation and termination, and test whether DksA alters the fidelity of RNA synthesis. Since DksA appears to exert its control near the RNA polymerase active site, whose structure and basic mechanism are universally conserved in all domains of life, the paradigms established by this analysis will have far-reaching implications.\r\nThe broader impact of this project lies in its education and dissemination emphases. The activities will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will receive broad multi-disciplinary training in structure/function analysis of a transcription regulator. The project will also generate tools for a laboratory course in microbial genetics and resource materials for other research groups around the world.",

Our previous data demonstrated that <em>Escherichia coli</em> DksA binds near the active site of RNA polymerase, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of all RNA messages in bacteria, and alters its catalytic properties. Proteins from the DksA family regulate expression of a large number of genes that are required for response to environmental stresses and for successful execution of virulence programs. Studies from other groups show that DksA can activate or inhibit transcription initiation but, in contrast to most initiation factors, DksA does not interact with the promoter DNA. It was thus not clear how DksA promoter specificity is determined. We used a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches to study the molecular details of DksA mechanism. First, we showed that DksA action is not limited to initiation of transcription, and that DksA also regulates the subsequent elongation and termination phases. Second, we identified the binding site for DksA on RNA polymerase. Third, we showed that DksA does not compete with a structurally similar GreB protein, which we previously showed to bind to the same site. Our experimental data, together with a molecular docking model, suggest that two domains of RNA polymerase hinder DksA binding, restricting DksA action to transcription complexes in which these domains are mobile due to the lack of stable interactions with the promoter DNA. In summary, we propose a model in which binding of DksA and GreB to the transcription complexes is controlled by the conformation of RNA polymerase, with each factor being able to bind to its target complexes irrespective of the presence of the competing protein(s).
