 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies how people use social media tools (e.g. blogs, wikis, electronic social networks) to work together more effectively to advance individual, group, organization, and community objectives. Despite high-profile success stories, we actually know very little about how best to use social media to enable effective collaboration among individuals or within organizations. The mere adoption of these tools by individuals or organizations is unlikely to have the desired effect unless people know how to use these tools to enable more effective collaborative processes. This research will employ qualitative content analysis to provide a rich picture of social media collaboration, conduct quantitative analysis on large-scale datasets to identify macro-level trends, and develop computer simulations to predict how social media might affect organizations in ways not yet observed. The educational activities of this proposal will focus on how to employ social media in the classroom to improve educational processes.  I plan to introduce five different social media enabled innovations -crowdsourcing exams, wiki-based peer review, in-class blogosphere, video podcasting lectures, and in-class electronic social networks - and empirically test the effects of these innovations on classroom outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is to better understand how social media tools can be used to improve processes in a wide range of organizations and settings.  These tools have been shown to have important economic, political, societal, and educational impacts.  Regardless of whether particular social media tools endure in coming years, the technological features and collaborative capabilities they represent will continue to persist and evolve.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMy NSF grant was awarded to allow me to study how organizations create and manage knowledge using social media.  Needless to say, the past 7 years has been a fascinating time to study the development of this topic.  The support of the NSF career award helped establish me as one of the forefront researchers in this area.\n\nIn terms of research, I have published 10 papers in top academic journals and 26 papers or presentations at academic or industry conferences in my NSF-supported research, spanning the information systems, marketing, and management disciplines.  I conducted this research from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.  I conducted big data analysis of millions of interactions between collaborators, as well as read the substance of many of those interactions to understand what was actually happening.  I found that the combination of these methods enabled a depth of understanding that would not have been possible with only a single approach used in isolation. Taken together, the results of my research show that collaboration communities on social media platforms represent a complex adaptive system, exhibiting recursive dynamics, non-linear tendencies, emergent structures, and co-evolution between contributors.\n\nA key insight that I derived from my own experience as an author, editor, and reviewer of research investigating such a novel and quickly changing phenomenon was that many other researchers were having difficulty publishing related work.  They were having difficulty articulating how social media differed from previous research.  This insight led to perhaps the single most influential paper of my research stream, a theoretical piece describing how social media platforms were different from previous generations of IT-enabled collaboration.  This paper used the insights generated from my experience as a researcher to chart a theoretically-driven research agenda that others researchers could use as a roadmap.  Although only three years old, this paper is already my most highly cited work. \n\nAdditionally, for the past 4 years, I have been working as the Guest Editor for Social and Digital Business for MIT-Sloan Management Review &ndash; a journal targeted at practicing managers.  Through this outlet, I published a monthly blogpost and one article per year.  This outlet gave me the opportunity to extend the broader impacts of my work to ensure that the findings of my research reached people who were actually developing these tools or seeking to apply them in an organizational setting.\n\nLastly, the NSF CAREER award is unique in that it is also intended to support an awardee?s teaching.  I have used this NSF support to further explore how to use social media tools in the classroom.  I have found that social media tools have completely changed my philosophy on teaching.  Over the duration of this award, I have used Wiki platforms to crowdsource my exam, blogs to allow students to write for an audience other than the professor (and receive comments from that audience on their work), and Twitter to create an always-on chat channel for the class. \n\nIt is important to note, however, that the technologies themselves are not important, but the new educational processes it enables are.  These tools can move the class beyond occurring in a single time and place, but the online interactions actually make that face-to-face meeting time more valuable and engaging.  It opens the boundaries of the classroom, such that my class blog receives over 1500 hits per week even when class is not in session.  Alumni of the course routinely contribute interesting material back to our Twitter feed, engaging with the class even after graduation. A colleague with 40 years of teaching excellence audited my course and declared it to be \"the first truly 21st century course he has ever experienced.\"   \n\nI am grateful for the support of the NSF through the CAREER award.  This support has helped me develop my career at an early stage, and it has made a significant impact on the researcher and educator that I have become.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerald C Kane"
