 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to collaboratively create an integrated and hybrid lab-on-chip platform that is electronically configured on-demand and maintains its programmed configuration without electrical power.  A single chip can access a vast library of microfluidic functions.  The approach is balancing 3-D electrowetting and Young-Laplace forces, such that emergent control in microchannel formation and fluid transport can be realized.  \r\n\tThe intellectual merit is that new scientific models will be developed for electrofluidics.  A simple graphical programming of lab-on-chip will be created, and the fields of continuous channel microfluidics and digital electrowetting transport will be united.  Furthermore, the lab-on-chip community will be able to leverage the enormous infrastructure for liquid crystal display manufacturing and 4-bit computer interfacing, to deploy highly affordable and agile lab-on-chip products for rapid chemical and biological discovery.\r\n  \tBroader impacts include integration of this project with NSF sponsored microfluidics course development, inspiring undergraduates to pursue advanced STEM degrees through the University of Cincinnati?s research co-op program, and continued involvement with NSF REU and RET programs. The significance of this proposed project stems from the need for lab-on-chip to full-fill promises to broadly reduce health-care costs, and provide remote access to patient diagnostics or environmental testing.  For example, clinics could perform diagnostic tests such as immunoassays and nucleic acid assays with little laboratory support.  Such agile lab-on-chip modules would allow user-defined access to laboratory tasks, all contained in a portable module that could have ergonomics as simple as an i-Phone.\r\n(243 words)",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe technical goal of the program was to explore a new platform to manipulate microscale fluids.  The overarching impact of such a platform could be used in important health science applications such as fast and agile drug discovery and therapeutic protocols and possible national security applications such water and airborne pathogen detection.  The platform merges technologies used in laptop displays &ndash; so called thin film transistors and a new liquid manipulation technique referred to as electrowetting.  Electrowetting is a basic phenomenon in which fluids move in response to an electrical stimulus and thus controllable fluid motion can be obtained by a sequence of electrical impulses.  The main limitation in electrowetting platforms is the number of discreet \"pixels\" that can be addressed.  Thus the thin film transistor array developed here has promise to extend simple small arrays being done in the laboratory (with tens to a hundred individual pixels) to platforms with over one million pixels (figure 1 for overview of the combined platform and associated technologies).  \n\nTo this end this collaborative program has demonstrated that thin film transistor arrays are suitable for controlling fluid motion and new fluid motion paradigms were discovered (see example figure 2). \n\nIn addition to significantly advancing the electrowetting platform, the project successfully educated multiple post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate students and bridged mutilple engineering disciplies including materials science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip D Rack"
