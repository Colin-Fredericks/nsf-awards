Student teams from degree-granting institutions will compete in a programming task building a query executor on top of an existing main memory index implementation.  The goals of the contest are to:\r\n \r\na) Stimulate student interest in the DBMS field; \r\n\r\nb) Present a research challenge; \r\n\r\nc) Foster the creation of sharable open source code modules; \r\n\r\nd) Foster Computer Science education by creating a forum in which students can excel; and\r\n\r\ne) Present a forum in which excellent students can get noticed, other than by writing papers. \r\n\r\nA prize of $5,000, donated by a Microsoft, Inc.,  will be awarded to the winning team. The NSF grant is used to provide equipment for the contest and travel support for the contestants.  The winning system will be made available to the public under the MIT open source code license.",
