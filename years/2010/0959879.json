 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Departments of Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Biology, Physics and Anthropology at the University of Northern Colorado will acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to support research activities in these Departments. This instrumentation will enable significant advances in projects focused on materials science, geology, biology, anthropology and the environment. Examples of projects include: 1) the investigation of how the mineral zircon can provide critical information regarding the formation of mountain belts, 2) the determination of elemental composition in intermetallic materials, 3) the investigation of monolayer formation and stability on surfaces, with respect to studying specific receptor-analyte interactions, 4) the elucidation of the uptake and distribution of selenium in several filamentous fungi, 5) the study of the tool cut and wear marks on ancient stone and bone tools to help in determining their use and function, and 6) the study of plant cell structure as a function of temperature stress. In addition, the SEM will feature in a number of outreach and education activities of the University, including the education of pre-service K-12 teachers, and ongoing collaborations with Laramie County Community College and the Greeley/Weld County Forensic Laboratory. \r\n\r\nScanning electron microscopy is a widely used technique for providing an image of a sample surface. The image is obtained from scanning the surface with a beam of electrons. Energy dispersive spectroscopy is combined with a SEM to provide elemental analysis i.e. chemical characterization of the sample. The SEM/EDS acquisition will be fully integrated into faculty members' research programs, and will be used by research students from a wide variety of science disciplines. The wide-ranging education and outreach activities carried out by the University of Northern Colorado will expose a large number of members of the public to the utility of SEM imaging in helping to answer important questions in science.\r\n",
