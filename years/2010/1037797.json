 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oglala Lakota College (OLC) proposes to extend and enhance its capability to \r\ndeliver the first two years of a Bachelor of Science degree program in engineering. This \r\ncapability will be developed through a Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) \r\nestablished with the College of Engineering at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the \r\nSouth Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), and is referred to as the \r\nOLC/SDSU/SDSMT PEEC (OSSPEEC). The project will establish collaborative offerings of \r\ngateway and bottleneck courses that occur in the first two years of engineering curricula coupled \r\nwith on-reservation hands-on laboratory and service learning experiences on the PRR that will \r\nincrease Native American student retention in pre-engineering and engineering programs across \r\nSouth Dakota. A major result of this project will be the establishment of a complete two-year pre- \r\nengineering curriculum at OLC, which will enable our students to enter any four-year \r\nundergraduate engineering program at the junior level. Further, this project will make an \r\nadditional unique or radical step in the transformation of classical engineering education at the \r\nstate colleges participating in the collaboration. \r\nWe propose to collaborate to develop and offer the courses required for an integrated two-year \r\npre-engineering program at OLC and to increase the success of OLC transfer and other Native \r\nAmerican students at SDSU and SDSMT through shared research, internship experiences, and \r\ncommunity building in the third and fourth years of an engineering program. The project will be \r\nunique in the United States in that during the collaborative process of building OLCs pre- \r\nengineering capacity, OLCs faculty and students will be helping to transform the concept of the \r\nfirst two years of the engineering curriculum at SDSU and SDSMT. This will occur through the \r\nintegration of project based service learning and undergraduate research projects on the Pine \r\nRidge Reservation, which will involve professors and cohorts of students from SDSU and \r\nSDSMT. Also, these projects will cultivate closer ties among our institutions and OST Tribal \r\nAgencies through collaborative summer research and internship opportunities on the Pine Ridge \r\nReservation that will lead to the development of future collaborative NSF research proposals.",
