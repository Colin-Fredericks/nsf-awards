  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis interagency agreement was actually used by NSF to fund three separate awards from NASA to AUI and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\n\n \n\nNASA Order Number NNG11PQ10I - The project's goal was to seach Fermi unassociated sources for radio pulsations.  During this project the research group found an additional 10 millisecond pulsars with the Green Bank Telescope. These detections and the timing of the new pulsars became the main portion of UVA Graduate Student Sira-prapa Sanpa-Arsa's Ph.D. thesis.\n\n \n\nNASA Order Number NNG10PM11I - The main goal of this project was to develop efficient search methods to allow searches for young pulsars in Fermi gamma-ray data.  Although the efficient search techniques did not end up being developed by the research group, the group had discussions with the Hanford LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravity-Wave Observatory), and they were able to implement the research group's ideas.  Also, the research group was able to develop new timing techniques in the project for gamma-ray pulsars which are being used in 3 of the Principal Investigator's Ph.D. theses and have been implemented in the new open-source pulsar-timing software called PINT.\n\n \n\nNASA Order Number NNG11PY64I - The main goal of this project was to see if there were correlations in the arrival of gamma-ray photons from the Fermi space telescope with giant radio pulses observed simultaneously with the Green Bank telescope.  If those correlations were detected, it would indicate a (suspected) link in the emission mechanisms between these very different phenomena.    Although the research group did not find correlations between gamma-rays and giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar, the limits on those correlations were the best to date.  We also published a paper on these limits (Mickaliger, et al. 2012, ApJ, 760, 64)..\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ethan Schreier"
