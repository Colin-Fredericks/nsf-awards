 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will advance understanding in the area of prejudice and stigma reduction by contributing to understanding the obstacles people face in prejudice confrontation.  Prejudice remains a significant and frequent experience for members of stigmatized groups; one with important consequences for physical and psychological well-being. Previous research on prejudice reduction demonstrates that one effective way to decrease prejudice is to confront it when it occurs. Not only does prejudice confrontation reduce subsequent expressions of prejudice, but it also empowers victims of prejudice. Despite these positive consequences of prejudice confrontation, people often refrain from confronting the prejudice they witness. Understanding the factors that predict whether people will confront prejudice would benefit our understanding of an important social psychological phenomenon.  The project also includes development of a training program to teach people how to overcome the obstacles to confrontation. \r\n\r\nThis research builds on previous knowledge about prejudice confrontation. The first set of studies investigates participants' judgments about the urgency of taking action against prejudice by measuring perceptions of harm and injustice as a function of the type of prejudice, target presence, and witness reactions. The second set of studies measures participants' perceptions of responsibility for confronting prejudice as a function of the number of witnesses, target presence, and role accountability. The third and final set of studies examines whether participants confront prejudice as a function of perceptions of confrontation self-efficacy and outcome expectancies.  Importantly,  this research can provide a base from which to build training programs to empower those who witness prejudice to voice their disapproval, and ultimately these findings may generalize and be useful in attenuating the occurrence of other incivilities (e.g., bullying, teasing).",

Past research suggests that when someone confronts another person\u00c6s prejudice, the confronted individual is less likely to repeat that behavior.

Thus, the more people who witness someone in need of help, the less likely that any given person is to provide help. \n\n \n\nThe goal of the current research was to determine whether a similar phenomenon occurs in prejudice confrontation:  is it also the case that the more people who witness a prejudice incident, the less likely any given person is to confront that prejudice?  We hypothesized that bystander intervention would occur in prejudice incidents, and the current research tested this hypothesis.\n\n \n\nParticipants read, edited, and provided feedback on an essay containing a prejudiced remark.  The essay was ostensibly written by a fellow student. The task was completed in one of four conditions, produced by two levels of two independent variables.

In addition, subsequent research will determine whether clear designation of a leadership role among bystanders can overcome any such diffusion of responsibility.  It is important to note that results produced in other studies funded collaboratively with the current research demonstrated that perception of responsibility is a partial mediator of prejudice confrontation.  More work needs to be done to determine the factors that contribute to perception of responsibility and its effects on prejudice confrontation.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of this work are educational in nature.
