 "awd_abstract_narration": "We live in a world made of diverse materials whose variations in appearance enrich our visual experience. It is also this variability of materials that adds daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft, hard, rough, and heavy.\r\n\r\nThe capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard quality food to prevent ill-health. The PIs work with research groups in these specific application areas to closely integrate the results from this project into their efforts. The results from this research are also broadly disseminated via publications, websites, databases, new courses and symposiums.",

Consequently, global illumination effects, such as inter-reflections, subsurface and volumetric scattering cause systematic biases in recovered scene properties, such as material and geometry.  We have studied the problem of direct-global separation for multiple light sources.

We showed that multiplexed illumination can be used to recover the N direct components corresponding to N different light sources by capturing just 2N + 1 images.\n\n \n\n2: Recovering 3D Shape of Translucent Materials\n\nConventional shape recovery techniques which use active illumination, such as phase shifting, make strong assumptions on the scene, light sources and sensors. For example, objects are assumed to be made of mostly opaque and diffuse materials. Light sources and sensors are assumed to have infinite depth-of-field.\n\nFor most practical scenarios, these assumptions are not true. Virtually every real world scene has global illumination &ndash; subsurface scattering in translucent materials (e.g., wax, marble, skin, plants, fruits, etc.) and interreflections between different parts of the scene.  Because of global illumination and defocus effects, conventional techniques often result in large errors in the recovered shapes.\n\nWe have developed a shape recovery technique called Micro Phase Shifting (Micro PS) which overcomes these problems. \n\nFindings and Results: Micro PS enables high quality reconstructions of scenes which have traditionally been considered hard, using only a small number of images.

In many real-world settings, structured light sources have to compete with strong ambient illumination. In these scenarios, because of the limited dynamic range of image sensors, the signal (intensity due to structured light) in the captured images can be extremely low, resulting in poor scene understanding (e.g., erroneous shape reconstruction and material recognition).\n\nThis is especially true outdoors, where sunlight is often 2-5 orders of magnitude brighter than the projected structured light. For instance, it is known that Kinect, a popular structured light device, cannot recover 3D shape in strong sunlight.\n\nWe have developed the..."
