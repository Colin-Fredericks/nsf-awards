 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop an integrated femtosecond high-energy fiber source for high-throughput photonics device fabrication.  The final goal of the project will be a laser oscillator/amplifier that confines the pulse to the fiber throughout the generation and amplification process.  This will lead to high stability, robustness, and easy integration into other systems. These characteristics will make the fiber laser system superior in terms of production throughput, size, and cost. Phase II will develop a functional prototype of the fiber laser. To demonstrate the ability of the laser to fabricate real-world devices, experiments will be carried out involving the microfabrication of glass and waveguide channels.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a breakthrough in understanding of high-energy femtosecond fiber lasers and an unprecedented new design for laser products across a wide range of applications.  The new laser product will offer a combination of high power, high repetition rate, and low cost which surpasses any existing laser on the market today.  Potential markets include photonic device fabrication (e.g. for waveguides, couplers, modulators, and switches), metal processing (welding, cutting, annealing, and drilling), semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing, general materials processing (e.g. rapid prototyping, desktop manufacturing, micromachining, and photofinishing), medical equipment, and biomedical instrumentation.  In the medical area, potential applications include ophthalmology, refractive and general surgery, photocoagulation, therapeutics, imaging, and cosmetic applications.  Biomedical measurements which might be affected include cytometry, DNA sequencing, laser Raman spectroscopy, spectrofluorimetry, ablation, and laser based microscopes.",
