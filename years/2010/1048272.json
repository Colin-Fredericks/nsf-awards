 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed funds are for a meeting in Washington, DC to be held in November/December 2010 to identify and establish research priorities and to help construct a framework that will support and sustain collaboration among institutions working toward creating a digital library and related digital resources for North Africa. The project builds on the results of two earlier events: the \"A Digital Library of the Middle East\" workshop held at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt, January 15-17, 2006, and the January 25-29, 2007 \"US-Maghreb Workshop on Digital Libraries for Education, Culture and Science\" held in Rabat, Morocco.  Both of these activities were funded in part by NSF.  The proposed meeting will stimulate dialog and provide information that can improve efforts toward creating a new generation of digital resources for the Maghreb region of North Africa enabled by advanced computing and networking capabilities.   Findings from the meetings are expected to inform grant-making agencies, private foundations and potential funders in other countries of new opportunities for research and infrastructure building efforts to broaden and sustain scientific collaboration with the research communities in Maghreb countries. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
