The improved sources will allow more intense interrogation of targets by MeV gamma rays.  The project addresses a key issue of electron sources.\r\n\r\nThis project will combine efforts related to optics, accelerator physics, materials and surface science, and the use of the relevant advanced instrumentation needed by the scientists and engineers.  Education of students, including high school students, and their introduction into the nuclear science and engineering career opportunities is an integral part of this project",
