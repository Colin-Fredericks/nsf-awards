The instrument will also be used by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and will support research activities such as: 1) study of disruption of metal-metal interactions and extended linear chains by organic solvent molecules; 2) synthesis, X-ray crystallography, and photoluminescence studies of high-coordinate gold(I) complexes with tertiary phosphine ligands; 3) use of light harvesting ligands to enhance emission from metal sites; and 4) study of small prototype molecules of biological, bioorganic, and bioinorganic interest.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research at this historically black university.",
