 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a highly-efficient and cost-effective plasma-based method for graphene mass production.  The approach is to utilize unique properties of magnetically controlled arc discharge to couple the plasma production of carbon species and the synthesis of graphene.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to enable the mass production of graphene for energy, electronics, aerospace, mechanical, civil, and biomedical applications.  Since it was first created in the lab, graphene has been considered as a wonder material.  Its distinctive electronic properties make it a leading candidate to replace silicon in applications ranging from high-speed computer chips to biochemical sensors.  However, the mass production of high-yield and low-cost graphene is very challenging.  This project is expected to provide a method for producing graphene in a scalable and cost-effective manner, which would make it easier for the wide adoption of graphene in the future.",
