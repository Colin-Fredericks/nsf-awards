 "awd_abstract_narration": "This scholarship program is a new model for targeting need-based assistance in STEM disciplines to non-traditional students with dependents, educating individuals most likely to remain in Appalachia.   The Trailblazer Scholars Program supports a cohort of 15 academically-talented, financially challenged nontraditional students with dependents to obtain two- and four-year degrees in STEM disciplines at Marshall Community and Technical College (MCTC) and Marshall University (MU).  Trailblazer Scholars have the ability to choose between entering MU directly or beginning at MCTC and transferring once they have earned an associate STEM degree.  The 2+2 academic programs included are Bioscience (MCTC) and Biotechnology (MU); Information Technology (MCTC) and Computers and Information Technology (MU); and Geospatial Science (MCTC) and Geography (MU).  Students interested in other College of Science and College of Information Technology and Engineering majors are also supported.  \r\n\r\nThe Trailblazer Scholars Program identifies nontraditional students with dependents as both an underserved population and an untapped resource for development of a diverse and well qualified STEM workforce.  Applicants for the program are recruited through an existing outreach infrastructure that involves MCTC/MU recruiting programs, high school teachers, and community organizations.  \r\n\r\nInnovative student support programs address unmet academic and social needs of the nontraditional student with dependents.  Targeted summer bridge programs, learning communities reinforced by enrollment in cohort courses, flexible, family-friendly daycare solutions, and online social networking communities for nontraditional students encourage student retention and degree completion.  In addition, career placement exploits existing strong alumni connections within regional STEM businesses.\r\n\r\nGoals of the Trailblazer Scholars Program are to:\r\n     - expand the technical and science-based workforce in the Huntington-Ashland OH-WV-KY Metropolitan Statistical Area;\r\n     - improve educational opportunities and student services for nontraditional students with dependents; and \r\n     - build a stronger, mutually-beneficial relationship between MU and MCTC STEM programs.\r\n",
