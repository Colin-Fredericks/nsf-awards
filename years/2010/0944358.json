 "awd_abstract_narration": "While changes in populations typically are tracked to gauge the impact of climate or habitat change, the process involves the response of individuals as each copes with an altered environment. In a study of Adelie penguins that spans 13 breeding seasons, results indicate that only 20% of individuals within a colony successfully raise offspring, and that they do so because of their exemplary foraging proficiency. Moreover, foraging appears to require more effort at the largest colony, where intraspecific competition is higher than at small colonies, and also requires more proficiency during periods of environmental stress. When conditions are particularly daunting, emigration dramatically increases, countering the long-standing assumption that Ad\u00e9lie penguins are highly philopatric.  The research project will 1) determine the effect of age, experience and physiology on individual foraging efficiency; 2) determine the effect of age, experience, and individual quality on breeding success and survival in varying environmental and competitive conditions at the colony level; and 3) develop a comprehensive model for the Ross-Beaufort Island metapopulation dynamics. Broader impacts include training of interns, continuation of public outreach through the highly successful project website penguinscience.com, development of classroom materials and other standards-based instructional resources.",

This important process can be very difficult when dealing with wild free-living animals. The most valuable data for understanding the population processes of wild animals emerges when we\u00c6re able to identify individuals, and then observe them and their community members over time.  We accomplish this by putting tags or marks on animals that allow us to tell individuals apart (i.e., marks are unique identifiers) and follow them through time documenting behavior and life history events (i.e., birth, death, reproduction, etc.).  Long-term mark-recapture data sets that allow us to follow individual animals over multiple years are even more valuable when the time span of our observations encompasses large amounts of annual environmental variation, and reflects at least the length of the study species\u00c6 lifespan - particularly when individuals are of known age because this provides an important context for understanding their life cycle. With these data, estimates of a wide variety of vital rates at the population level (i.e., survival, reproductive success) can be made and empirical data from wild populations can be used to understand the evolution of demographic parameters within a species (i.e., why do species do what they do?). \n\n This project collected long-term data on known-age, known-breeding history Ad&eacute;lie penguins, to investigate age-and breeding-status related survival, the probability of breeding every year (i.e., breeding propensity) and age of 1st breeding, as well as the degree to which these rates can vary among colonies, and in relation to annual variation in local and regional environmental conditions.  We collected data on the survival, and reproductive status and success of individual penguins at three colonies that differ vastly in size (i.e., by orders of magnitude) between from 1996 and 2014.  We have learned that annual survival rates differ by colony, by age and by breeding state.  Young birds prior to their first breeding attempt (pre-breeders) have the lowest survival rates, but survival increases by age, and by age 4, pre-breeders have higher survival then breeders of the same age.  We found that breeding birds (&gt;3 years old) don\u00c6t breed every year, and in fact the probability of an individual breeding each year can vary from 58-78%.  Birds that bred in a previous year, but are not currently breeding (non-breeders) had the highest survival across all age classes, suggesting that while breeding means \"success\" in one sense for an individual bird, it may come at a cost, consistent with prevalent life history theory.  Survival rates also differed by colony, with the lowest survival observed at the smallest colony (Cape Royds) across all age classes, breeding states and years.  Because of these differences in annual survival between colonies, age at first reproduction was on average, younger at the smallest colony (6.2 yrs; Royds), compared to the two larger colonies (6.8 yrs; Cps Bird and Crozier).  However, despite 18 years of data on known-age individuals, we do not believe we have reached the top end of the species\u00c6 life span, because we still have birds in our oldest age classes breeding each year.  So it\u00c6s likely the Ad&eacute;lie penguin lives and breeds well into its 20\u00c6s.  We continue to follow our known individuals at all colonies to learn just how long they live, the oldest age at which they will breed, and how the smaller colony persists despite lower annual survival rates\n\n We also learned how Ad&eacute;lie penguin populations cope with strong environmental change by taking advantage of the environmental variation associated with the calving of B-15 from the Ross Ice Shelf and the grounding of pieces of the iceberg just east of Cape Crozier.  After 5 years of data collection under what we believed were \"typical\" en..."
