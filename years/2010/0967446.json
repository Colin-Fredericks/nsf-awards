The project includes research on a novel physical BIM method for integrated solar building design and simulation, and the development and introduction of a new course using the physical BIM prototype tool for designing solar buildings.  The major objectives are to: (1) research the new method integrated physical BIM for holistic building energy simulation; (2) build a prototype of the method for solar building and simulation integrating photovoltaic, passive solar thermal, and daylighting systems; (3) test the BIM simulation results using benchmark simulations; (4) evaluate the usability of the method in architecture design classrooms; and (5) provide guidelines for software developers to create new tools for solar building and whole building simulations.\r\n\r\n \r\nBruce K.
