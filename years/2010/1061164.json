 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future integrated circuits will contain tens, hundreds, or possibly even a thousand cores per chip.  However, the scaling techniques that will make this possible also make the underlying circuit fabric less reliable-leading to increased wearout and defects that cannot be detected at manufacturing.  In response, the PI proposes fundamental research for generating new test sets on-chip to identify failing cores.  The tests will be created \"on-the-fly\" and dynamically targeted to the most critical areas of a core.  Some key portions of the proposed research involve the creation and verification of hardware monitors for determining which faults are most important for the user's applications, the diagnostic use of online error detection hardware to pinpoint locations that caused previous failures, and the analysis and development of protocols to efficiently create and transport tests in a network-on-chip environment.\r\n\r\nThe great performance advantages of future multi-core devices will remain unrealized if the reliability of those devices cannot be trusted.  The proposed research investigates critical tools for promoting that reliability.  The integrated education plan provides research opportunities for students at multiple levels?from high school to graduate school?including students from underrepresented groups.  In addition to recruiting undergraduates from Brown, the PI plans to work with the CRA-W DREU (Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program to host visiting female undergraduates for summer research.  The PI will also recruit high school students from the Providence Public Schools, many of whom are members of underrepresented groups, for summer research through the Brown GK-12 program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntegrated Circuits (ICs) are a critical part of modern life.  For example, they are the \"brains\" of smartphones and the MRIs used to diagnose and treat disease.  They are used by financial systems to transfer and secure funds, and automobiles contain an increasing number of mission-critical IC components designed to enhance comfort and safety. Almost nothing in daily life would be the same without these systems, and in critical applications (such as health care, financial systems, communication, and transportation) errors can have serious consequences. Methods that can identify and handle the sources of these errors&mdash;preferably before they cause functional failures&mdash;while still preserving the security of devices are thus of great importance.\n\nFortunately, modern ICs offer important opportunities for finding and correcting problems not only at manufacturing, but also through on-chip test and online error detection.  One core may even be able to test a different core. Ideally, the test sets should be not only highly effective, but also short to reduce the time and power required for testing, and the transportation of test information to and from the core under test must be efficient.  \n\nTo accomplish these goals, this project has 1) investigated the development of hardware monitors that can help predict which faults are more likely to cause noticeable errors; 2) investigated the use of logic implication checkers to not only flag that a failure has occurred while the circuit is running, but identify a set of \"suspect faults\" that could have caused the failure; 3) explored ways of using the information obtained by hardware monitors and implication checkers to choose the faults that should be targeted when testing resources are limited; 4) investigated how low-cost changes to traditional DFT (design for testability) circuitry can increase the probability of multiple stuck-at fault detections without increasing test time by capturing test results during otherwise unused testing clock cycles; and 5) explored how new IEEE standards can be used to efficiently and securely access embedded instruments (such as hardware monitors and error checkers) and also transport test data within a device.\n\nThese investigations were highly successful.  The hardware monitors and implication checkers were shown to provide very useful information for fault targeting.  The test pattern generation/selection and DFT methods have also been shown to be capable of significantly increasing test quality and/or reducing test time (and sometimes total test power), even when testing resources are limited. \n\nFurthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is foundational work regarding hiding the presence of embedded instruments (such as hardware monitors) within a test network that adheres to the IEEE 1687 standard.  IEEE 1687 Segment Insertion Bits (SIBs) were converted into \"Locking SIBs\" (LSIBs), and a variety of LSIB configurations were created and analyzed.  It was shown that a brute force attack could be expected to take hundreds or thousands of years on average with sufficiently large keys.  Some protection against power analysis attacks could be included by having multiple LSIBs share the same key bits, and the hierarchical nature of IEEE 1687 networks can be used to provide natural partitioning of the instruments such that engineers with a different \"need-to-access\" can be given keys for only appropriate subsets of instruments.  Additional work considered increasing the bandwidth of an IEEE 1687 network to reduce test time without compromizing security.\n\nOverall, this project generated many papers and/or presentations in journals, conferences, and workshops.   These papers have also earned multiple awards, including an NATW IEEE Excellence in Design and Test Engineering Award and two Jake Karrfalt Best Student Paper Awards.  In addition, the project has led to two issued patents.\n\nAlong with the technical accomplishments described above, this project has also had a significant broader impact on the education of students and young people, including promoting research opportunities for students who are members of underrepresented groups.  For example, in addition to including aspects of the project in both graduate and undergraduate classes, the PI has mentored multiple students through the CRA-W DREU program.  This program matches female undergraduates and students from other underrepresented groups with professors at other universities for summer research.  She has also mentored students in a Senior Design capstone project inspired by this research and oversaw the creation and presentation of a week-long module based on LSIBs that was presented to high school students at a summer camp held at SMU.  One of these high school students has continued working with the PI to learn more about digital design, test, and hardware security research.\n\nIn summary, this project has made important advances in test and embedded instrument access.  Such research is necessary to promote the reliability of the digital circuits and systems upon which so much of modern life depends.  The research has also proven to be an important learning vehicle for students from high school to graduate school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer L Dworak"
