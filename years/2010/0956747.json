 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a novel security capability for protecting websites against hackers by providing preventive and early diagnosis services. Compromising websites is an emerging and profitable business for hackers, with devastating effects since such attacks: (a) hurt the compromised site directly, e.g. stealing stored credit card information, (b) hurt the website visitors, who are subjected to viruses infections or identity theft via code injection, which turns a legitimate website into a distributor of malware, and (c) hurt the reputation of the code-injected website, which is inevitably blacklisted by search engines. The project will develop the technology to: (a) assess the vulnerability level of a website, (b) detect security breaches in the form of code injection, and (c) expedite the recovery of a compromised website.  the proposed work focuses on three key goals: (a) massive scalability through the minimization of manual intervention, (b) robustness and manageability by a carefully designed software-hardware architecture, and (c) continuous process of self-improvement and assessment of performance.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the impact of the proposed project has the potential to be immediate and direct: it promises to make website security more affordable, and not a luxury or an afterthought.  Website security is an immediate and expensive problem: (a) it is estimate that most websites (over 60%) are vulnerable, (b) web-based malware spreading is taking the dimensions of a pandemic, (c) all of the reported 74M active websites are likely targets: from banks, to the local cookie store, and ultimately, (d) cyber-crime is a top national security threat according to the government.  The proposed solution has the potential to make significant contributions in each of these four areas.",
