 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing-others (35) \r\n\r\nThis project bridges  the  boundaries  between  computer  science (CS)  and  natural  sciences,  as  well  as the  gap  between institutions  of  higher  education and  K-12 by teaching Computational Thinking (CT). Recent attention to CT as a \"fundamental skill for everyone\" is shifting the curricular focus in computing from programming to design and applications in such a way as to bring scientific thinking into mainstream education. It is producing an  inventory  of  CT  modules  and  assessment  tools  that  are being developed for use in  new undergraduate courses, including a general education introductory CT course and an upper-level Computational Scientific Thinking course for teacher candidates and STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics majors.\r\n\r\nThese courses are using a scalable game design. Through the progression from designing games to simulations, students are learning many skills including computer science concepts, computational problem-solving, mathematical modeling, analysis of system evolution through simulations and visualization, and experimentation with applications.\r\n\r\nComputational  science  serves  the  nation  as  both  a  teaching  pedagogy  and  a  workforce strategy.   In  teaching,  the project stimulates  a  systemic  change  in  undergraduate  education  that reflects  computation becoming  an  essential  and  permanent  element  in  sciences.  The project is providing  CT  skills  to  a   wide  audience  of  undergraduate  students  (CS  &  non-CS majors),  including  teacher  candidates.",
