 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate how training students in Creative Problem Solving (CPS) can be used as curricular enhancement to improve STEM engagement, integration and retention at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) via cognitive, behavioral, and social transformations. Science 100 is a required course for all freshmen in their first year with all achievement levels in the entering freshman represented and will serve as the environment of the CPS study. The course is designed as an interdisciplinary class with culturally relevant topics--Hurricanes, Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Tsunamis in the Caribbean. With frequent hurricanes, an abundance of volcanoes, many earthquakes, and the occasional tsunami, this topic is of great interest to citizens of the Caribbean. \r\n\r\nCreative problem solving skills may have the potential of creating a STEM learning culture that produces students who are motivated to pursue careers in STEM. The project has potential for developing cutting-edge methodological assessments, semantic knowledge representations and algorithmic developments. The project will follow a well articulated quasi-experimental design for testing hypotheses relative to the utility of CPS for fostering interest among STEM and Non-STEM students.",

About a third of the total SCI 100 laboratory sessions per study semester participated in the study.  \n\nFor four consecutive semesters, CPS training was implemented in the participating sections. In the first semester of implementation, the CPS training was presented through the use of weekly videos.  The videos provided students with strategies for developing creative problem solving skills.  However, the students were not receptive to the videos.  Changes were made to the curriculum the second semester of implementation.  The CPS training protocol was redesigned to have an expert guest lecturer deliver the training in a one-day session.  Additionally, short activities called Thinking Skills were developed and incorporated throughout the weekly sessions.  The Thinking Skills provided opportunities to practice CPS and reinforced student learning.  More importantly, the thinking skills connected the CPS curriculum with Science 100 subject matter which allowed students to see the relevancy of the CPS training. \n\n \n\nAccomplishments\n\nThe project created an assessment dataset consisting of 1,017 cases (observations).
