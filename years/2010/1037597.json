 "awd_abstract_narration": "College of Menominee Nation (CMN), together with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the \r\nUniversity of Wisconsin Platteville, is applying to the National Science Foundations Science, Tribal \r\nColleges and Universities Program (TCUP) Pre-engineering Education Collaborative grant to strengthen \r\nCMN?s capacity to establish CMN as an Associate Degree granting engineering program of distinction.   . \r\nThe CMN PEEC: Providing for the Education of American Indian Engineers collaborative project \r\nproposes the following objectives: \r\n&#61607; To build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a Pre-engineering Associate Degree Program. \r\n&#61607; To implement a Pre-engineering program of distinction. \r\n&#61607; By September 2015, to graduate at least twenty students from CMN?s pre-engineering program and \r\n   transition into U.W. Madison?s and U.W. Platteville?s engineering programs. \r\n \r\nProject Intellectual Merit:  This project recognizes and embraces diversity and the role Tribal Colleges \r\nplay in coordinating demonstrative research on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities \r\nin STEM fields. Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American Indians. \r\nProject research, data, and outcomes focused in the ultimate outcomes of increasing the number of and \r\nperformance of American Indian students in engineering, leading to increased numbers of American \r\nIndians in engineering careers, will provide key nationally recognized research. This collaboration will \r\ndevelop, apply and assess evidence-based practices shown to increase the participation of \r\nunderrepresented minority students in science and engineering. Furthermore, the partnership between \r\nCMN and its UW partners is tailored to establish robust connections between institutions that will serve as \r\na model for the engineering community in general and other minority-serving institutions as we assess, \r\ndocument and disseminate the success of this process. \r\n \r\nProject Broader Impact: This project will build upon the research of previous STEM activities, continuing \r\nthe investigation of essential research in discovering and understanding how Tribal Colleges and the \r\nunique strategies they implement promote education in minority students. The project further advances \r\nthe research of American Indian undergraduate education in engineering and contributes to the global \r\nbody of knowledge in underrepresented minority engineering education. The short term outcome of this \r\neffort will be to increase the knowledge, understanding and interest in engineering among students in \r\nrural populations, with emphasis on the American Indian population of Northern Wisconsin.  The long \r\nterm outcome will be an increase in the participation of American Indian students graduating with degrees \r\nin engineering.  This will ensure that the voices, perspectives and talents of a population that is so \r\nunderrepresented in engineering have an opportunity to contribute to the development of the engineering \r\nprofession.",
