 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel computing now plays a central role in nearly every science and engineering endeavor.  The leading supercomputers today comprise hundreds of thousands of processors, and in the near future are expected to comprise millions of processors.  Researchers at the University of Delaware are working to harness this vast computing power to make ground-breaking scientific discoveries.  This work requires fundamental algorithmic research and development to address issues such as multiscale coupling, scalability, and hybrid message-passing/threaded programming.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are building a new, highly parallel, computing system for scientific computation research and teaching at the University of Delaware.  This computer consists of approximately 1,600 processors, and is expandable to many more.  UD researchers who share a common interest in scalable parallel computation plan to explore a variety of scientific applications: 3D Navier-Stokes solvers for environmental turbulent flows; \"ensemble analysis\" in oceanic forecasting; computational electromagnetism; simulation of emulsion microstructure for environmental pollution control and material synthesis; electronic structure calculations for atoms and molecules; multiscale cloud dynamics for more reliable weather and climate prediction; computational carbon nanoelectronics; and vorticity-dominated flows.  The new computer will be used to optimize the current algorithms in each application, help identify limitations to scalability, and explore new ideas to enable scaling to hundreds of thousands of processors and to take advantage of hybrid architectures.  The system motivates collaboration among faculty interested in application problems and faculty with expertise in computer science.  Libraries for efficient parallel data redistribution and automatic optimization of parallel codes are some of the ways the computer scientists participating in the project are enhancing the scientific applications.",

A few examples include the following:\n\nChimera has enabled Prof. Branislav Nikolic and his collaborators to compete on the front of research in nanoscience and nanotechnology.  They have investigated new methods for DNA sequencing using nanotechnology.  The successful realization of fast and low-cost methods for reading the sequence of DNA bases is envisaged to lead to personalized medicine and applications various subfields of genetics.  A variety of tools borrowed from condensed matter physics, such as solid-state nanopores, have recently emerged as one of the pillars of the so-called \"third generation\" DNA sequencing.  The key issue in these approaches revolve around how to slow down the translocation speed of the DNA molecule and how to achieve single-base resolution.  The very recent fabrication of graphene nanopores and successful detection of DNA translocation through them has opened new avenues for nanopore-based sequencing.

The results of this work have appeared in the leading journal Nano Letters (2012).\n\nTraditional algorithms used in computational science are often not fit for execution on a highly parallel computer such as Chimera.  A large part of the intellectual merit of the work undertaken involved modifying these algorithms in ways that made them amenable to scaling to large numbers of processors.  One Chimera project explored these issues in the context of nuclear-reactor simulations, a field that is vital to designing safer and more efficient methods for producing nuclear energy.  Kyle Felker and Andrew Siegel of Argonne National Laboratory, working with Stephen Siegel at the University of Delaware, developed and tested new algorithms for efficiently re-distributing the vast amounts of data generated in the course of a typical simulation.  Such simulations require periodic \"re-shuffling\" of the data among the thousands of processors.

Chimera was used to generate test data for a new time domain inverse reconstruction algorithm, and for studies of transmi..."
