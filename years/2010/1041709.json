This will increase its node count from 8,256 to 9,408 by adding 1,152 nodes. With the addition of 1,152 nodes, Kraken will have significant room left to run other jobs simultaneously with 8,192 node jobs. Indeed, it will be possible to run a 8,192 job and a 1,024 node job at the same time. Given the ?bi-modal? distribution of the user jobs, with most job sizes at either 8,192 and above, or at 1,024 and below, this will greatly improve the responsiveness of the machine for users.  The Kraken upgrade will allow users to extend their codes by scaling them up to the largest NSF supercomputer, with over 110,000 cores, implementing new models that could not have been run before this upgrade. There already a number of users scaling their applications to the full size of the current Kraken, and some of them are already prepared to use a larger system. Additionally, this will help facilitate scaling for applications already chosen to run on the Track 1 Blue Waters system, and prepare them for that very large machine.",
