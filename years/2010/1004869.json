 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site supports students recruited primarily from nine cooperating Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  Research focuses on materials science and nanomaterials.  By recruiting at HBCUs, the project involves students that are 1) from underrepresented groups and 2) attending a primarily undergraduate institution with limited research opportunities. Enrichment activities complement the research activities and provide important training on research related topics.  An ethics component is also included. The project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers component for two secondary science teachers per year.  Participating teachers work in research labs alongside undergraduate students and participate in enrichment programs.  Teachers attend a graduate course training them to incorporate research concepts into their teaching.  Following summer participation, teachers introduce into their classrooms at least one new nanoscale science or materials science teaching module.  All participants present an end-of-summer poster on their research, and support is included for REU participants to present their research results at a national science conference.",

The current project (NSF-1004869) supported a total of 37 undergraduate participants from 2010-2013.\n\nIn addition to undergraduate students, we also hosted high school science teachers in a Research Experiences for Teachers site.  The teachers participated in the same research and enrichment activities as the undergraduate students, but teachers also enrolled in a graduate level class called Experimental Chemistry for Teachers.  In this course, teachers learned about the use of active learning, inquiry labs, and research projects in the context of high school classrooms.  The teacher participants applied their summer experiences to their academic year classrooms, impacting hundreds of high school students per year.  A total of 7 teachers were supported by this grant from 2010-2013.\n\n            This program will have dramatic impacts on the number of individuals from underrepresented groups pursuing careers in nanoscale science and engineering.  The participants gained important lab skills, confidence in their ability as scientists, and a broader perspective of how scientific research functions.  In addition, the participants learned important technical information that they were unlikely to learn in typical academic settings such as traditional lecture and lab courses.
