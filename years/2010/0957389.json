 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to further understanding of a broadly useful biopolymer self-assembly unit, the alpha-helical coiled-coil. Despite extensive study of coiled coil design principles, little attention has been focused on interactions at and between coiled coil surfaces.  Specific recognition of ligand peptides at coiled coil surfaces is a crucial step in the infection cycle of a broad range of RNA viruses, including many notorious human pathogens. An array of high-resolution X-ray structures demonstrates that recognition often relies on binding a few key ligand side chains, using a relatively focused constellation of coiled coil surface positions.  The Kennan group will examine ligand/pocket pairs from HIV, visna, Ebola and mumps, to glean rules for effective binding of buried hydrophobic side chains.  The interactions of interest will be displayed using a simple monovalent mimic of the HIV protein.  Similar investigations of surface and buried polar interactions will use a recently developed model. Once the portability of these recognition elements is validated, they will move on to designer systems that test programmed recognition patterns. These experiments will establish the first fundamental recommendations for targeted molecular recognition at coiled coil surfaces. Given the tremendous utility of these structures in biology, biotechnology, and materials chemistry, a general tool-set for designing and understanding these interactions will have broad applicability. \r\nThis project will produce a collection of young scientists with a significant diversity of identity and experience. The ideas and techniques are intrinsically multidisciplinary, applying the molecular level thinking of organic chemistry to the problems of structural biology. Students trained to date reflect a commitment to extending the research experience to undergraduates and underrepresented minorities.\r\nAll of biology is controlled by assemblies of biomolecules (proteins, DNA, sugars, etc.) that transiently stick together long enough to carry out their assigned biological tasks. The ability to control which molecules stick to each other thus holds promise for control over biology itself.  The interactions studied here are central to many viral infections of current public interest (HIV, Ebola, etc.), but they also target a very basic and common protein-protein interface that is a core piece in the larger puzzle of someday acquiring full control over biology's rules for how A sticks to B.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nVirtually all biological processes are critically dependent on the intimate interaction of one or more proteins to form larger macromolecular assemblies that regulate everything from cell growth to cell death and all points in between.  Because these so-called \u00e6protein-protein interactions\u00c6 (or PPIs) involve contacts between very large molecules, understanding and manipulating the factors that make one complex favored over another is a very complicated task. \n\nThe work supported by this grant targeted one specific type of a PPI that is central to a broad range of viral infection events.  Since both the viruses and their intended target cells are encased in biological membranes, one critical early infection step demands that the two respective membranes be fused, so as to encompass one larger compartment and provide the viral components unfettered access to the cellular machinery.  In many cases  this membrane fusion is accomplished by viral proteins that operate by binding peptide ligands to the surface of a protein motif called a trimeric alpha helical coiled coil.  Viruses operating by this mechanism include many serious menaces to human health, such as HIV, Ebola, human T-cell leukemia, and human respiratory syncytial virus.  The specific interaction involved has also been a target of intense pharmaceutical interest, including development and approval of the anti-HIV drug Fuseon. \n\nDuring the course of this investigation we developed model systems facilitating the examination of these interactions, and undertook to validate our understanding of the features controlling them by perhaps the ultimate measure: building new recognition interfaces from scratch.  In the end we have determined that such designs are complex and sensitive to seemingly subtle adjustments.  But we have succeeded in several cases in building new hybrid proteins that recognize our designed ligands in preference to others with similar sequence.  This improved understanding of how these types of proteins recognize their intended ligands provides a foundation for further development of molecules capable of disrupting these complexes, and thus of blocking viral infection.  In addition to the scientific outcomes of the work, we have trained three graduate students and five undergraduates.  Half of these students were women, and all are either gainfully employed in chemistry-related jobs or in graduate school.  The work was presented at several national conferences and one international one.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan J Kennan"
