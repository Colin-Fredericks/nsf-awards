 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EFRI-SEED project is to develop principles for the design of net-zero water buildings, off the water grid. These principles represent a paradigm shift from centralized reduction of oxygen demand, to energy-minimal conveyance and permanent destruction of pharmaceuticals, responsive to technological evolution. Three knowledge barriers are addressed: sustainable treatment system scaling and design; sociocultural and architectural acceptance; and real-time risk assessment. Concepts for system scaling will mimic energy minimal allometric scaling relationships in biological circulatory systems. New energy-minimal electrocatalytic treatment for effective destruction of pharmaceuticals will be advanced. Energy-intensive reverse osmosis (RO) treatment will be avoided through cistern drinking and make-up water, low-flow adaptation of new cloth filtration technology, and metallic iron-mediated filtration. To surmount acceptance barriers, behavioral simulations, interviews, and focus groups will first identify individual and group barriers to adoption and then test approaches for improving sociocultural acceptability. Design components including cisterns, residuals storage, annual maintenance, and natural water releases will be considered within the theoretical framework of New Urbanist architecture. Methods of evidence fusion will be developed for machine-learned assessment of in-vitro toxicity from fluorescence spectra, to advance real-time risk monitoring and to ensure system safety.\r\n\r\nSystem design concepts will directly address the energetics of water and wastewater conveyance, representing 15% of U.S. electric power generation, and leverage emerging capability for automated treatment, monitoring, and decentralized operation and maintenance. De facto reuse of surface water consisting largely of treated wastewater would be replaced with explicitly engineered control. Water rationing, and treatment of hardness, arsenic, and boron, and other geologic impurities, would be largely obviated. Treatment would be designed to routinely, permanently destroy pharmaceuticals, addressing widespread biotic feminization. Benefits will propagate through the engagement of a new generation in their future, immersed by living in a dedicated, cross-disciplinary, undergraduate ~20-bed retrofitted dorm unit with design input by students.  Well-represented Caribbean and Latin student populations will continue to be involved along with participating agencies and industry partners, for immersion in terms of research, industrial partnerships, public tours, and 1-2 high school student projects (MAST Academy). A Capstone Net-Zero Water Workshop will include regulators, consulting firms, students, and faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FY 2010 EFRI-SEED Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer & Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",

Moreover, this water is generally not impacted by the total 2 mg/L loading of hazardous chemicals on US surface waters. However, this clean, stable, freshwater source, having a total impurities concentration 100 times lower than ocean water, is currently disposed after a single use, often to saltwater bodies.

That is, we demonstrated that municipal wastewater can now be reused 100% (85% indoor), safely and at similar cost to conventional single-use and disposal technology. Moreover, because the thermal energy imparted to this water by US municipal water heaters reuse is ca. 72% more than the energy required for water and wastewater treatment and conveyance combined, and because the treated water retains this energy, returning to the tap warm, the process can save more energy than it uses. Detailed modeling indicates the process to be economical at scales as low as 100 homes per plant, and because no water source or wastewater disposal sink is needed, such plants can be located essentially anywhere. For example, while not generally permitted by regulatory agencies, they could be appropriately implemented in new developments and condo buildings, with regulatory monitoring and reporting, for demonstration and permitting. Further, the machine learning technology needed to detect health risk in the water via sensors was developed. Finally, it was shown that socially-conservative and female with purity/sanctity values are more likely to have stress reaction to net-zero water use, but that this reaction can be reduced through education.</p>\n<p>Principal intellectual contributions of the project have included (a) design of the first energy-positive water management system, concentrate-free and with capability to save 85% of municipal water demand and 1.6% of US energy demand, at currently competitive cost; (b) the first machine learning/evidence fusion algorithms to detect chemical risk in drinking water in near-real time; (c) characterization of the steady-state mineral composition of potable water following nearly closed-cycle advanced-oxidation-based direct potable water reuse with human input; (d) development of an aluminum-mediated aeration system for removal of organics and minerals including bromide from water; (e) characterization of the performance and energy demand of the peroxone and UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes for mineralizing residual municipal wastewater total organics to below detection limits; and (f) the finding that female, socially conservative, purity/sanctity-valued, and bottled-water consumers were associated with higher distress regarding NZW, though viewing an informational brochure lowered anticipated disgust.</p>\n<p>Principal broader impacts of the project on education and the betterment of society include the new prospect of energy-positive water management; the potential substantive reduction of endocrine-disrupting compounds in environmental surface waters currently imparted by conventional wastewater treatment plants; the potential substantive reduction in water shortage in the US and abroad; and the education and training of 70 grad/undergrad students and 1 Postdoctoral (30 female, 16 Hispanic, one African-American); 5 high school interns (2 female, all Hispanic); and 3 exchange student volunteers, in 22 REU, 10 independent study, and 11 volunteer roles, and 10 class projects. These impacts have been furthered by the regular public, school, and Chinese delegation tours that were conducted over a six-year period of the net-zero water project site, and by extensive media and online coverage garnered by the project. Additionally, at this time, the 20 peer-reviewed scientific publications produced by the project have attracted 350 citations, and this body of work will support continued advances in municipal water management technology for the future. In fact, the project has spawned two additional funded projects, leading to the development of a portable net-zero greywater system which can be dropped into remote areas to provide running water to Ebola and other health care units, and the development of a chemical-free electrochemical system to recover nutrients from municipal wastewater as fertilizer.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast

Finally, it was shown that socially-conservative and female with purity/sanctity values are more likely to have stress reaction to net-zero water use, but that this reaction can be reduced through education.\n\nPrincipal intellectual contributions of the project have included (a) design of the first energy-positive water management system, concentrate-free and with capability to save 85% of municipal water demand and 1.6% of US energy demand, at currently competitive cost; (b) the first machine learning/evidence fusion algorithms to detect chemical risk in drinking water in near-real time; (c) characterization of the steady-state mineral composition of potable water following nearly closed-cycle advanced-oxidation-based direct potable water reuse with human input; (d) development of an aluminum-mediated aeration system for removal of organics and minerals including bromide from water; (e) characterization of the performance and energy demand of the peroxone and UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes for mineralizing residual municipal wastewater total organics to below detection limits; and (f) the finding that female, socially conservative, purity/sanctity-valued, and bottled-water consumers were associated with higher distress regarding NZW, though viewing an informational brochure lowered anticipated disgust.\n\nPrincipal broader impacts of the project on education and the betterment of society include the new prospect of energy-positive water management; the potential substantive reduction of endocrine-disrupting compounds in environmental surface waters currently imparted by conventional wastewater treatment plants; the potential substantive reduction in water shortage in the US and abroad; and the education and training of 70 grad/undergrad students and 1 Postdoctoral (30 female, 16 Hispanic, one African-American); 5 high school interns (2 female, all Hispanic); and 3 exchange student volunteers, in 22 REU, 10 independent study, and 11 volunteer roles, and 10 class projects. These impacts have been furthered by the regular public, school, and Chinese delegation tours that were conducted over a six-year period of the net-zero water project site, and by extensive media and online coverage garnered by the project. Additionally, at this time, the 20 peer-reviewed scientific publications produced by the project have attracted 350 citations, and this body of work will support continued advances in municipal water management technology for the future. In fact, the project has spawned two additional funded projects, leading to the development of a portable net-zero greywater system which can be dropped into remote areas to provide running water to Ebola and other health care units, and the development of a chemical-free electrochemical system to recover nutrients from municipal wastewater as fertilizer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Englehardt"
