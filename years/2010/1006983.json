The institutions will significantly expand the number of workstations connected via gigabit per second links and establish an e-meeting facility in order to bolster collaborative research and STEM-related education offerings in the state. The resulting state-wide cyberinfrastructure will enable researchers to connect from their desktops to resources throughout the state and beyond. The investment in e-meeting infrastructure will serve to integrate research and education and support increased inter-institutional research and education activities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nEnhancing the connectivity and integration of research in modeling and simulation of complex systems will enable research contributions in the areas of multi-scale biological simulation, computational biology and chemistry, and support research efforts crosscutting a number of diverse disciplines, including chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physiology, ecoinformatics, genomics and numerous computer science sub-disciplines.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe activities of this project are designed to directly support improvements to the infrastructure, research and development capacity, and high-technology commercialization opportunities in Mississippi. In addition to bolstering research output by linking researchers, the cyberinfrastructure enhancements will help link computational science researchers with industry partners in order to establish collaboration between universities and private employers, to strengthen economic competitiveness, and to create high technology jobs for graduating students. Professional development for secondary teachers and community college faculty and curriculum enrichment and development are expected to increase exposure and interest in STEM-related disciplines among high school and community college students in Mississippi. The institutions will deliver workshops to geographically dispersed students and teachers via enhanced e-meeting facilities.",

However, inadequate connectivity between the researchers and educators at these institutions has been a barrier to accelerated growth\n\nThe funding provided by RII-C2 project had the following three major objectives: a) to bring 1Gbps connectivity to workstations and desktops; b) to provide an e-meeting facility; and c) to enhance the availability of cluster computing resources to researchers, educators, and students in Mississippi. \n\nDuring the first year of the project, the four MRIHLs drew up plans for acquiring the equipment and services outlined in the proposal and began the equipment acquisition process.  In the second year, the RII-C2 team focused on completing the acquisition and installation of equipment and services to implement the infrastructure upgrade plans.  Towards the end of the second year, the RII-C2 team sought and received a one year extension in order to complete the acquisition of e-meeting infrastructure.  This infrastructure was placed into service at the beginning of the third year.\n\nAt MSU, 10Gb line cards were installed at various buildings housing the following departments: Computer Science and Engineering, Computer and Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Entomology, Mechanical Engineering, and the College of Veterinary Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Plant and Soil Sciences, Geosciences, Physics and Astronomy, Agriculture and Biological  Engineering, Business and Accountancy, Architecture, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology, African American Studies, and Industrial Education.  Many of these departments are non-EPSCOR affiliated.
