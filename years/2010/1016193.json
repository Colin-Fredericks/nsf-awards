 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the trustworthy distribution and retrieval of information across the Internet. Specifically, it concerns the distribution of metadata and requests, the matching of requests and metadata, and the retrieval of information corresponding to the metadata.  In the Internet today, this functionality is provided by centralized search engines and search indexes.  However, such centralized mechanisms can be easily subverted to prevent the distribution and retrieval of information.\r\n\r\nThe iTrust distribution and retrieval network aims to ensure that individuals cannot be prevented from distributing or retrieving ideas and information across the Internet.  In iTrust, source nodes produce metadata that describes their information, and distribute that metadata to nodes chosen at random.  Similarly, requesting nodes distribute their requests to nodes chosen at random.  Nodes compare the requests with the metadata they hold.  If a node finds a match, it returns the URL of the associated information to the requesting node, which then retrieves the information from the source node.\r\n\r\nThe iTrust distribution and retrieval network is the first to provide an effective fully distributed Internet search that is difficult to subvert.  This project will develop infrastructure software for iTrust and a user interface that is convenient and easy-to-use.  The technology and source code for iTrust will be freely available on a public Web site.  The expected impact and significance of iTrust are that, even if the conventional centralized Internet search mechanisms are subverted, an alternative will exist to protect the free flow of information across the Internet.",

Currently, our trust in the accessibility of\ninformation over the Internet and the Web depends on benign\nand unbiased administration of centralized search\nengines. Unfortunately, centralized systems rely on one or a\nfew nodes that can be easily subverted to censor\ninformation.\n\nIn this NSF research project, we have developed a\ndistributed and decentralized publication, search and\nretrieval system, named iTrust.  Our initial implementation\nof iTrust, based on the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP),\nis most appropriate for desktop or laptop computers on the\nInternet. However, today, many people use mobile phones to\norganize their activities and, in many countries, mobile\nphones are the only computing platform generally\navailable. Consequently, we have developed a version of\niTrust for mobile phones using the Short Message Service\n(SMS). To guard against the risk that both the Internet and\nthe cellular telephony infrastructure are disabled, we have\ndeveloped a Wi-Fi Direct version of iTrust for mobile ad-hoc\nnetworks. Mobile phones or tablets enabled with Wi-Fi Direct\ncan share information directly, without the need for\nwireless access points or cellular network\nconnections. Thus, with iTrust, users can decide which kind\nof network is most appropriate for their current needs, and\nthey can share information without reliance on, or\ninterference from, a third party.  Figure 1 illustrates the\ndifferent kinds of networks over which iTrust operates.\n\nThe Basic Idea of iTrust\n\nThe iTrust network is an unstructured network in which all\nnodes are equal.  Some of the nodes, the source nodes,\nproduce information, and make that information available to\nother participating nodes. The source nodes also produce\nmetadata that describes their information.  A source node\ndistributes the metadata, together with the address of the\ninformation, to a subset of the participating nodes chosen\nat random.\n\nOther nodes, the requesting nodes, request and retrieve\ninformation. Such a node generates requests that contain\nkeywords, and distributes its request to a subset of other\nparticipating nodes chosen at random. Nodes that receive a\nrequest compare the keywords in the request with the\nmetadata they hold.  If a node finds a match, which we call\nan encounter, the matching node returns the address of the\nassociated information to the requesting node. The\nrequesting node then uses the address to retrieve the\ninformation from the source node.  Figure 2 illustrates the\nbasic concept of iTrust.\n\nThe Intellectual Merit\n\nThe intellectual merit of the iTrust publication, search and\nretrieval system lies, in part, in its distributed and\ndecentralized nature, and its objective to support the\nsharing of information without fear of censorship.  It also\nlies in its probabilistic nature and its distribution of\nboth the metadata and the requests (queries) to randomly\nchosen nodes in the network.\n\nThe intellectual merit of iTrust also lies in its\nstatistical algorithms for detecting and defending against\nmalicious nodes in the iTrust network. Using the chi-squared\nstatistic and the exponential weighted moving average, the\nnovel statistical detection algorithm estimates the\nproportion of subverted or non-operational nodes in the\niTrust network. The novel defensive adaptation algorithm\nthen increases the number of nodes to which the requests are\ndistributed to maintain the same probability of a match as\nwhen all of the nodes are operational.\n\nThe intellectual merit of iTrust also lies in its adaptive\nmembership protocol, which exploits the messages that are\nalready being sent to distribute metadata or requests, thus\nreducing the need for additional messages. The novel\nadaptive membership protocol estimates the membership churn,\ni.e., the nodes joining or leaving the membership, based on\nthe responses that a node receives to ..."
