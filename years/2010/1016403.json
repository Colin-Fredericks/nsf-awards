The workshop seeks to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries to develop the new knowledge needed to better manage the impact of natural hazards in major urban areas.  The potential impact of large-scale natural hazards on today?s urban agglomerations is so huge, they can be called Mega-City/Mega-Disasters (MCMD).  The workshop will explore specific strategies for rapid emergency response/recovery/rebuild during MCMD.  In addition, it will closely examine the broader questions that surround these issues, including factors that may cause long-term changes in the risk of disaster and factors that may affect and impede response by governments, agencies, and populations.  To accomplish these objectives, the workshop will assemble a diverse group of international specialists working at the forefront of their respective fields to explore and promote opportunities to develop more effective approaches for disaster mitigation in large urban areas.  In particular, specialists in emergency response and recovery, social economics, land use policy, natural hazard (e.g., wind, flood, landslide and earthquake) mitigation, and information technology will participate.  The workshop will allow researchers and practitioners from different countries to espouse a common research framework in disaster mitigation that leverages existing global research infrastructure for multinational cooperative research.  In addition to the PI, workshop organizers include Michael Goodchild, University of California, Santa Barbara; Jerome Lynch, Iniversity of Michigan; and C.H. Loh, National Taiwan University, Taiwan. The meeting is jointly funded by the Office of International Science & Engineering and the Directorate for Engineering Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.",
