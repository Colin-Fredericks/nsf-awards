All three vessels are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes four items listed by priority:\r\n\t1) LADCP Instruments\r\n\t2) SWR/LWR Met Sensors\r\n\t3) Soutar Box Core\r\n\t4) Knudsen 3260 Echosounder\r\n\t5) SBE 19+ CTD\r\n\t6) Multi-Channel LSC\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
