To gain hands-on experience, I helped several of Professor Kwon\u00c6s students make microparticles with specialized functions.  We made particles that were infused with fluorescent molecules &ndash; molecules that absorb a certain wavelength of visible light and then emit a different color.  We also treated the particles with chemicals that enabled cells to adhere to them.  In the future, these particles will be used to expose cells to a variety of different chemicals to see how the cells respond.
