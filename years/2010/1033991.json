The PI has already shown that electrospun aligned fiber arrays can guide the migration of adherent human-derived tumor cells. By fabricating a \"core-shell\" nanofiber, oxygen-sensitive indicators can be added to the \"core\" of this fiber while the \"shell\" protects cells from exposure to the indicator. Confocal microscopy can interrogate oxygen content and enable experiments involving one or more neurospheres, how they interact with the surrounding [O2] and with each other.  \r\nA sensor system that recreates hypoxic, normoxic, and hyperoxic conditions within the human body while simultaneously encouraging migration known to be a component of tumor metastasis will be useful in the study of many human cancers. Furthermore, the sensing capability will lead to increased understanding of similar issues that arise in the creation and integration of new, normal human tissue during organ generation and replacement.",
