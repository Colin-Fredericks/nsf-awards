 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is systematically changing how professional scientists and the public engage with astronomical data and with one another.  One of the most striking examples of new ways astronomers and the public are collaborating is the \"Galaxy Zoo.\"  This online citizen science project has attracted over 230,000 people from around the globe to make over 100 million classifications of the morphology of galaxies.  These classifications, taken in aggregate, have been shown to be as accurate as the work of professional galaxy classifiers and have led to the publication or submission of 14 papers on topics as diverse as galaxy mergers, active galactic nuclei behavior, and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy Zoo is now transforming into a project called Zooniverse that will provide a framework for a diverse set of citizen science tasks.  As the Zooniverse grows, we need to find effective ways to expand the Galaxy Zoo user base, and this project uses Facebook to address this fundamental need.  One of the fastest growing virtual communities in the world, Facebook potentially offers exceptional leverage to scale up the number of research questions that can quickly be answered in the realms of both astronomy and education.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop the first two Facebook applications to engage citizen scientists.  The first will focus on getting people to do science by inviting them to pick from a \"Rogue's Gallery\" the galaxy that best matches a \"Most Wanted\" galaxy.  The second will use social networking to build the user base of the main Zooniverse website by linking users' Facebook and Galaxy Zoo profiles, allowing users to share socially the results of their citizen science work, to play trivia games, and to give friends \"galaxies\" to build their own \"clusters\".\r\n\r\nThe results of these galaxy classifications will be used in a Principal Component Analysis looking for new ways of categorizing galaxies.  The sample of roughly 250,000 galaxies provides a valid space in which to define meaningful categories of galaxy morphology, deriving for the first time natural classification classes from the appearance of a large sample of galaxies, instead of sorting them into categories defined a priori.\r\n\r\nThis project will also pave the way for future applications to migrate into Facebook by defining what characteristics do and do not attract users to engage in citizen science online.  This will allow other projects to engage users in astronomical research and will inform those working on non-astronomy citizen science about how better to create future applications.",

On one side, we have the public that is often less scientifically literate than the public of other first world nations, a problem with the potential to have huge impacts on how our nation faces global issues in genetic engineering, commerce, and green energy. On the other side, growing economic problems are leading to cutbacks in funding available for basic research, especially in areas such as astronomy that do not provide immediate boosts to standard of or quality of living. One potential way to address both of these troubles is to actively seek to engage the public in doing science in ways that will facilitate learning, while helping scientists do science they could not otherwise do given the current funding state. Termed citizen science, this type of endeavor has been recently used by a myriad of online sites (see scistarter.com for a comprehensive listing).

While we were able to beta test apps, they didn't attract engagement at any level sufficient to justify continued development. This was due in part to how people are changing their interactions with Facebook.
