 "awd_abstract_narration": "The behavior of a communications network depends on the configuration\r\nof hundreds to thousands of switches, routers, firewalls, and other\r\ndevices.  For example, a campus network may have as many as 2,000\r\ninter-operating network devices and about one million lines of\r\nconfiguration; whether the network operates correctly depends for the\r\nmost part on the configuration of these devices.  Human configuration\r\nerrors are the single biggest contributor to network downtime. This\r\nproject seeks to develop techniques to make networks easier to manage\r\nby improving both configuration testing and synthesis. Testing takes\r\nas input an existing network configuration and determines whether the\r\nconfiguration is operating correctly.  Synthesis generates\r\nconfigurations automatically.  The project draws on two testing\r\ntechniques to make network configurations easier to test: differential\r\ntesting and dynamic testing.  Differential testing generates test\r\ncases to characterize the run-time behavior of two different programs;\r\nanalyzing differences in network-wide configurations can help testing\r\nby allowing test cases to focus on the smaller subset of\r\nconfigurations that change more frequently.  Differential analysis may\r\nmake testing more tractable by reducing the amount of configuration to\r\ntest.  Dynamic testing checks the correctness of a program by\r\nexecuting it; this execution can be performed in a parallel \"shadow\"\r\nnetwork, for example.  The expected results from this project include\r\ntools for network operators to test and automatically generate\r\nnetwork-wide configurations for both enterprise and ISP networks.  The\r\ntools will also be useful in graduate-level courses.",
