 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) and Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) programs of the Division of Chemistry support Prof. Joel M. Harris of the University of Utah to develop new approaches to characterizing the composition, structure, and functioning of lipid vesicles and their bilayer membranes.  Optical trapping confocal Raman microscopy is being developed to probe the composition and structure of individual lipid vesicles, with an aim to better understand the relationship between the structure of the lipid bilayer and its permeability.  This in turn may provide control over molecular uptake and release, which impact drug delivery and trace analysis applications. Fluores\u00accence microscopy tools are being developed to probe individual lipid vesicles immobilized on glass surfaces, with an aim of assessing internal pH and molecular transport rates, which can be detected as single-molecule events. The work also seeks to devise means to measure the affiliation of small peptides with supported lipid bilayers, and quantitative determina\u00action of membrane-bound peptide populations and their kinetics of binding and unbinding.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide routes to new understanding of the structure and functioning of lipid membranes and the processes that affect them.  These membranes are important components of living cells, and their understanding is critical, for example, to the successful development of membrane-active pharmaceutical products.  The research provides multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in spectro\u00acscopy, microscopy, colloid science, and biological chemistry. The project impacts K-12 education and public awareness through involvement in classrooms, contributions to a new science center serving the metropolitan Salt Lake City area, and new touring exhibits that are transported to rural districts of the State of Utah.",
