  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:\n\n            The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) offshore drilling rig, located 41 km off the coast of Louisiana in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOMEX), experienced an explosion on April 20, 2010, sinking of the rig, and uncontrolled discharge of oil and gas.  The well was successfully capped 87 days later but released an estimated 4.93 million barrels of oil, which places the DWH incident as the most severe marine oil disaster in U.S. coastal waters.  The biodegradation of petroleum by in situ microbial communities is well established and recognized as a desirable means for petroleum spill remediation; however O2 is consumed during bioremediation.  We collected samples from two research cruises in the NGOMEX that occurred approximately one month after the occurrence (May) and cessation (August) of the DWH incident.  Our research stations were located within 300 km of the DWH well and showed signs of the presence of oil in May, based on personal observations, satellite imagery and hydrocarbon abundance.  Consequently we had the opportunity to collect samples to analyze the concentration and isotopic composition of O2 as a means for understanding the role of the DWH incident in O2 metabolism and the development of hypoxia.  This proposal provided funds to develop a gas preparation system (GPS) that enables the extraction and purification of O2 and N2 for high precision isotope and gas ratio analysis. The GPS is not commercially available, and enables the analysis of the triple isotopic composition of O2. The GPS is comprised of high vacuum pumps, a gas chromatograph, a cryogenic cold trap system (Janis), valves, tubing and molecular sieve traps to enable cryogenic purification of O2.  Assembly of the GPS was accomplished by the PI and Dr. Hasand Gandhi, laboratory manager of the MSU Biogeochemistry Stable Isotope Laboratory (BSIL) and is now fully operational.  This proposal also provided funding for the purchase and installation of a new computer and software to operate one of the mass spectrometers in BSIL.\n\n            The research cruises provided a unique opportunity to observe the response of O2 metabolism to oil from the DWH incident.  We compared our results to previous studies of O2 metabolism in the NGOMEX based on isotope data and incubation methods.  These two approaches have provided contrasting values of the importance of water column and sediment respiration in driving hypoxia.  Thus, our objectives were to (1) evaluate the impact of the DWH oil spill on O2 metabolism and (2) provide insight into disagreement between incubation and isotope approaches to the evaluation of respiration beneath the pycnocline.  Our study found that hypoxia was evident at most stations in both May and August of 2010 and is consistent with the early establishment and persistence of a large hypoxic zone.  Despite the presence of the oil, we found no evidence that O2 metabolism was driven to levels outside historic ranges.  Consequently, we agree with the findings of the annual survey that the size of the July 2010 hypoxic zone can largely be explained by nitrogen loading from the Mississippi River.  Unique features of the 2010 hypoxic zone include (1) our observation of hypoxia east of the Mississippi River, which is not often included in annual surveys, (2) observation of hypoxia far west along the Texas coast that may have extended beyond the range of the July survey, and (3) a likelihood that the size of the hypoxic zone was reduced prior to the July survey by the passage of two storms.  Thus, the actual extent of the 2010 hypoxic zone and involvement of the DWH oil spill remains uncertain.  Future resolution of the NGOMEX hypoxic zone, therefore, requires more extensive surveys on both seasonal and spatial scales and/or deployment of an extensive network of continuous and in situ monitoring sensors. \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\n            The project involved two undergraduate students from MSU in both field and laboratory act..."
