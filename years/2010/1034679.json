 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discovery Science Center of Orange County (DSC) is building a \"Dynamic Earth\" gallery dedicated to improving Earth systems science literacy. This grant funds the purchase and installation of three exhibits developed by Exploratorium, Exhibits Services, a national leader in exhibit design. Tectonic Basin, Rift Zone, and Braided Stream are designed to teach fundamental Earth science concepts, preparing visitors to understand complex concepts from another exhibit, Science On a Sphere, a dramatic visual display developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Volunteer educators delivering supplementary table-top demonstrations reach learners of all types by verbally and visually presenting hands-on activities. This layered, multi-faceted approach (a) improves the quality of informal geosciences education for over 70,000 K-12 students visiting on structured field trips (including 7,000 low-income, minority students participating on scholarship); (b) increases the number and competency of K-12 educators who teach geosciences-related concepts in their classroom by serving as teaching props for 1,000 teachers in professional development workshops onsite; and (c) communicates the importance of the geosciences to the public and increase public literacy regarding Earth system science by serving more than 420,000 visitors of all ages each year. Project effectiveness is evaluated by California State University-Fullerton's Catalyst Center for the Advancement of Research on Teaching and Learning Mathematics and Science, which brings together science and math education experts across two colleges and seven departments to advance research in teaching and learning across the entire spectrum of math and science education, including informal education.",
