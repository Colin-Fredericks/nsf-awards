Since it is now commonly speculated that most stars &ndash; including our Sun &ndash; are born in clusters that may contain massive stars, an understanding of how a forming massive star interacts with its environment is a vital part of the complete star formation picture. However, despite the great importance of massive star formation, a great deal is not yet understood. The formation of low-mass stars can be studied at high resolution in nearby Galactic sources. However, Galactic massive star formation studies are plagued by many problems, including large distance uncertainties, confusion along the line-of-sight, and extinction along the Galactic plane. Moreover, Galactic massive star forming targets are very limited in number. On the other hand, a nearby Galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the perfect laboratory for massive star formation studies since it is located at a known distance of 50 kpc (~160,000 light-years) with relatively low extinction and a nearly face-on orientation that provides a clear, close-up view of the entire Galaxy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in;\">Using a combination of near and mid-infrared images and spectra from <em>Spitzer</em>, my collaborators at the University of Illinois have developed a large and unique catalog of 277 massive young stellar objects (YSOs) covering the entirety of the LMC (Gruendl &amp; Chu 2009, Seale et al. 2009). Contained within the infrared spectra is information about the evolutionary stage of each massive YSO (Seale et al. 2009). In order to confirm these evolutionary stages, it is necessary to look at the surrounding gas of the YSOs. The youngest YSOs should be inside dense clouds of gas.

We had hope to also see a relationship between size of the YSO and the age, but we could not draw any significant conclusions here either (see Figure 2).
