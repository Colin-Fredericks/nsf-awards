 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Doreen Leopold and her group will investigate the structures and reactivities of small transition metal clusters.  Gas phase metal species will be prepared in a flow tube reactor, and mass-selected anionic products of their reactions with unsaturated organic molecules will be probed by anion photoelectron spectroscopy.  For the bare metal clusters and metal-ligand complexes, these results will provide measurements of electron affinities, electronic state energies, and vibrational frequencies.  In addition to the training of researchers directly involved in these experiments, broader impact activities will include the continued leadership of a new teaching mentorship program for graduate students and postdoctorals interested in academic careers, and the development of methods to improve the calculator-free math fluencies of undergraduate general chemistry students.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will yield spectroscopic information for organometallic radicals that may serve as models for intermediates in the reactions of transition metal catalysts, and will help to elucidate structure-reactivity relationships.  In addition, these studies of small, well-defined clusters will provide experimental benchmarks to aid other researchers in developing improved computational methods to treat larger metal nanosystems of more direct technological relevance.",

Molecules whose studies in our lab have been supported by this NSF grant include the Group 5 / Group 6 diatomic series NbCr, NbMo, NbW<sup> </sup>and their singly-charged anions.&nbsp; These neutral molecules have 11 valence electrons and the anions have 12, offering the possibility of extremely high formal bond orders of 5.5 or 6, respectively.&nbsp; Anion photoelectron spectroscopy of anions prepared in our temperature-variable flow tube ion source yields insight into their bonding properties and provides benchmarks to aid in the development by other groups of theoretical methods applicable to these computationally challenging systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, the 488 nm photoelectron spectrum of the niobium-molybdenum anion, NbMo<sup>-</sup>, shown in Figure 1, displays transitions from the ground state and from a low-energy excited electronic state of the anion to two states of the neutral molecule.&nbsp; These spectra provide measurements of the electron affinity of NbMo, energies of the observed states, their spin-orbit splittings and vibrational frequencies, and differences among their equilibrium bond lengths. &nbsp;These data for singlet and triplet states of the anion and two doublet states of the neutral molecule help elucidate the effects of different electron configurations and charge states on the equilibrium geometries, vibrational force constants and relative bond strengths of molecules with very high-order multiple metal-metal bonds.</p>\n<p>A second focus of this project is on coordinatively unsaturated organometallic complexes produced by gas phase reactions of metals with simple hydrocarbons. &nbsp;The application of vibrationally-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the mass-selected product anions, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations of possible structures and spin states of the anionic and neutral clusters, can identify the isomeric and electronic structures of the observed species.&nbsp; For example, reactions of butadiene (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) with metal atoms in the presence of free electrons in the flow tube produce NbC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&#713; as the major anionic product, indicating loss of H<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp; The photoelectron spectra and DFT spectral predictions show that this is a metallocycle with the Nb atom bonded to two carbon atoms and lying out of the plane of the ring.&nbsp; Two of the less abundant products observed under these multicollision conditions are the NbC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and NbC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> anions.&nbsp;

These results provide the electron affinity of the neutral molecule, the energies of low-lying excited electronic states of the neutral molecule and the anion, and frequencies for some of the totally symmetric vibrational modes.&nbsp; Combined with the predictions of DFT calculations for the spectra that would result from one-electron electron detachments from various possible structures and spin states of a NbC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ion, these spectra enable the observed complex to be identified as having a planar or nearly-planar niobium-\"benzyne\" structure in which the Nb atom bridges across the two adjacent carbon atoms which are not also bonded to H atoms in the 6-membered ring.&nbsp; The spectroscopic characterization of these simple organometallic complexes, produced in the flow tube from butadiene molecules via reactions mediated by a single niobium atom, can provide insight into possible intermediates in more complex metal-catalyzed reactions which also involve carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bond activation, carbon-carbon bond formation and cyclization processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader impact activities</em></strong> by the PI have included continuing as the founding director of our Department's novel Mentorship Program for Aspiring Chemistry Teachers, MPACT (\"<em>em</em>pact\").&nbsp;
