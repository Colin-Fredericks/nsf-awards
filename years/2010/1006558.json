 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Vanderbilt University is to design novel biomaterials that regulate angiogenesis through control of the host-foreign body inflammatory response. The researchers plan to design novel biomaterials that will respond to inflammatory cells through regulation of oxidative and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated degradation. It is anticipated that elucidation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MMP-mediated mechanisms whereby host inflammatory responses lead to vascularization of implanted scaffolds will provide a more realistic paradigm to improve functional survival of the scaffold. Development of 'smart' biomaterials that respond to changes in the tissue microenvironment is a promising approach for solving challenging problems in regenerative medicine such as angiogenesis, an essential step in tissue regeneration. A growing body of evidence confirms that the processes of angiogenesis and inflammation are interconnected through various molecular mechanisms. The roles of ROS and MMPs in mediating cross-talk between inflammation and angiogenesis have received much attention, since regulation of these mediators causes substantial changes in important pathophysiological processes (e.g., cancer and atherosclerosis). The research and education activities of this project will be integrated with those of the Vanderbilt School for Science and Math, and the Departments of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Biomedical Engineering to train students from High School to Graduate level. In addition, the researchers plan to develop grade-appropriate curriculum components that introduce high school students to tissue engineering and other biomaterial related topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the proposed project is to create new therapies for healing tissue defects by developing 'smart' biomaterials that respond to the body's healing process.  To accomplish this goal, the researchers will investigate the interactions between inflammation, which leads to rejection of the biomaterial from the body, and angiogenesis that promotes healing. The project will integrate research and education through activities aligned with the goals of the Vanderbilt School for Science and Math (VSSM) and the Vanderbilt School of Engineering. VSSM, a part-time high school located on the Vanderbilt campus and dedicated to public high school students, is a joint venture between Vanderbilt and Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools. In conjunction with core instructors at the VSSM, the PI and co-PI will develop grade-appropriate curriculum components that introduce high school students to tissue engineering. Additionally, through research assistantships, graduate and VSSM high school students will gain experience in the creation of biomaterials that improve tissue healing.",

In this process, 3D templates with tunable pore size were printed by fused deposition modeling and filled with a settable polymer.  The template was then dissolved into an organic solvent.  By varying the composition of the settable polymer, templated scaffolds with tunable rigidity were prepared.  In preliminary studies, we found that the pore size and rigidity controlled angiogenesis in mice.  These 3D templated scaffolds are being used in a number of studies to answer other important questions, such as how the properties of trabecular bone influence the progression of cancer-induced bone disease.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A Guelcher"
