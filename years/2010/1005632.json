It will extend multi-domain numerical techniques currently used in black hole\u00a0simulations to cases in which matter fields and shocks are present. It will also investigate the use\u00a0of heterogeneous (in particular, GPU) computing in numerical simulations of Einstein equations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will have direct impact in high accuracy simulations of binary sources in realistic times, as needed for the generation of gravitational wave templates for earth-based gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. In a broader context, the developments of this project should be\u00a0of value to disciplines such as\u00a0computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetism, as well as heterogeneous computing and large-scale simulations in general.\u00a0",
