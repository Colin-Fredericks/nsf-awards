 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction\r\nThis project will re-examine the origins of the study of human heredity, including the eugenics movement. Classical accounts of the history of human heredity (from 1900) have portrayed it as an outgrowth of basic science, with genetics coming first followed by its application to humans. This project will carry forward preliminary research that broadens the scope of relevant developments related to human heredity to include the use of statistics in institutions such as asylums, prisons, and schools. The PI's research to date indicates an alternative account of the history of human heredity in which that research was mainly a statistical and an administrative endeavor, rather than the standard view in which it is understood to be driven by work in biology laboratories. The PI will continue his research along these lines to support this alternative account and ultimately produce a book on the subject.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe twentieth century has been called \"the century of the gene,\" and genetics is no less prominent in the twenty-first. In the era of genomics, the study of human heredity has become still more central to this project. Historians have usually understood it as an outgrowth of basic science, and also, in the form of eugenics, as a perversion of it. The PI will determine whether the flourishing after 1900 of eugenic investigations and dogmas, especially in the study and management of vulnerable human populations called \"defective,\" was really due to the new genetics. He has discovered and is exploring a vast endeavor involving the collection, circulation, and analysis of data on human heredity carried on in such institutions as schools, prisons, life insurance companies, and especially asylums. Research on human heredity was not mainly a laboratory field but a statistical and administrative one. \r\n\r\nPotential Broader Impacts\r\nThis project will serve to highlight the dangers as well as the possibilities of contemporary genomic research, which notably extends beyond the laboratory to studies of populations and institutions that concentrate certain genetic traits.  It also provides background to a scientific endeavor that has always been as much about the gathering and quantitative analysis of data as about laboratory research and molecular technologies.",

More and more, genetics has become allied to medicine, and not least to psychiatry.  In the past, human genetics was closely allied with eugenics, a scientific program claiming the capacity to alleviate social problems and improve humanity by biological means.  Eugenic means such as forced sterilization are commonly associated with Nazi Germany, where many innocent people were murdered as part of a eugenic program, but eugenic measures were also applied in places like the United States and Scandinavia.  Everywhere, \"negative\" eugenics (the effort to keep certain people from reproducing) was applied especially to the mentally ill and the learning disabled.  Eugenic ideas are usually presented as a consequence, perhaps an exaggerated or improper extension, of Darwinian evolution.  This study shows that the systematic investigation of human heredity, and especially of inheritance of mental illness and disability, did not begin in biology but among doctors and administrators at insane asylums.\n\nThe asylums began a period of rapid expansion about 1800.  This expansion continued into the 1960s, after which a period of deinstitutionalization\" set in in many countries, including the United States.  In the early nineteenth century, champions of the asylums argued that most patients would be cured.  They supported these claims with statistical tables of patient admissions and outcomes.  For a variety of interesting reasons, these cheering results proved unsustainable; indeed they were misleading from the start.

The allied fields of human and medical genetics, which gained acceptance in the 1940s and 1950s, depended heavily on statistical techniques developed within psychiatric genetics.
