 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wightman laboratory at Muhlenberg College is studying the mechanisms by which genes direct the formation of organs during animal development. One gene, called tailless plays an important role in directing how the uterus of the microscopic nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans forms. The lab uses molecular, biochemical and genetic strategies to learn how this gene is controlled by other genes and how it, in turn, controls still other genes. The outcome is a better understanding of the molecular pathway - the series of specific steps - that allows cells to communicate with each other during development to create organized tissues and organs. The tailless gene also exists in vertebrates, including humans, where it functions in the development of stems cells in the brain. Therefore, an understanding of how the nematode tailless gene works helps illuminate the equivalent pathways in other animals. The Wightman laboratory consists of two professional scientists and six to twelve undergraduate students. Therefore, a major impact of this work is to advance education. Students who learn science by participating in scientific research learn more and are well-prepared for careers in science and the clinical professions.",
