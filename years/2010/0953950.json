 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term research goal is to develop novel data mining\r\ntechnologies to elucidate the structures and dynamics of complex\r\nbut ubiquitous networks. A  complex network is a large system\r\nof elements (vertices) that are joined by non-trivial relationships\r\n(edges). Examples of such complex networks include the WWW,\r\nmetabolic and protein networks, social networks, and economic\r\nand financial markets. The underlying principles and laws of these\r\nnetwork systems can help us construct more effective\r\ncommunication mechanisms, find cures for fatal diseases, and\r\ndeal with economic crises.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the significant advances that have been made towards\r\nunderstanding the fundamental laws that govern the structure and\r\nbehavior of complex networks, there is still a disconnect between\r\n current analytical techniques and their applicability to real-world\r\ncomplex networks. A principled approach is lacking to systematically\r\nanalyze a single large complex network and link system behaviors to\r\n network structure. There is also immediate and crucial need for a\r\ntheoretical framework to understand the relationships between\r\nmultiple networks, which is the key for comparative network analysis. \r\nHow to integrate and leverage the rich system data, such as\r\nmeasurement time series, associated with network topology to study\r\ncomplex systems is still an open question. This project addresses\r\nthese issues by:  1) developing novel graph and information\r\ntheoretical approaches to extracting network backbones which both\r\nsimplify and highlight network structures; 2) developing information\r\ntheoretical network distance measures and clustering algorithms for\r\ncomparative network analysis; 3) applying causality inference and\r\nnetwork modularity to integrate time series with network topology.\r\nThe proposed mining methodologies build upon an innovative blend\r\nof graph theoretical, information theoretical, and statistical learning\r\nconcepts and techniques, and can greatly expand the reach of\r\ndata mining. This project will also help us better analyze the\r\nemerging complexity, heterogeneity, and large scale of real-world\r\ncomplex network data.\r\n\r\nIn a close collaboration with domain experts from social and political\r\nsciences, software engineering, and bioinformatics, the proposed\r\ntechniques have the potential to help understand how human society is\r\norganized at the individual level (social networks) and organizational\r\nlevel (political science); illuminate how large scale software systems\r\nform and evolve; reveal the organizational principles of biocellular\r\nsystems in a dynamic environment; and identify therapeutic or drug\r\ntargets. Using the popular online social networks, such as MySpace\r\nand Facebook, as ``hooks'', this project will attract, recruit, and\r\nprepare students from underrepresented groups including women\r\nand minorities to computer science and involve underrepresented\r\nstudents in the cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web page at:\r\nhttp://www.cs.kent.edu/~jin/NSFCAREER/",
