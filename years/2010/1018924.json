 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world-wide web has become one of computing's great success stories,\r\nchanging the way that people around the world communicate, compute,\r\nand conduct their business.  Unfortunately, security problems on the web\r\nare prevalent, and these problems increase costs for website operators\r\nand for Internet users.  This project aims to develop new methods for\r\nsecuring the web, providing website developers and operators with new\r\nand improved tools to protect their site and their users.\r\n\r\nThe research involves several technical directions.  First, to help\r\nprotect existing websites, this project will investigate ways of hardening\r\nlegacy web application code to defend it against the most common attacks.\r\nSecond, to provide a solid foundation for web systems of the future,\r\nthis project will study how to provide robust protection for newly\r\ndeveloped code.  The project will also study web development frameworks\r\nthat are safe by construction.  Third, this project will develop tools\r\nand techniques to incrementally migrate existing web applications to\r\nnext-generation safe-by-construction web frameworks.  Fourth, this project\r\nwill devise and carry out user studies to measure rigorously the effect\r\nof different programming languages, frameworks, and programming practices\r\nupon the security of web applications.  The broader impacts resulting from\r\nthe proposed activity are potentially significant; if it is successful,\r\nthis research could have a significant positive impact on the security\r\nof web services and, in the longer term, on software security in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research have provided new insights and understanding about how to develop software so that it will be secure against attack.\n\nWe studied the effect of choice of programming language on security, and found no evidence that programming language has a measurable effect on the security of software, though we did find evidence that support for secure API's from the libraries and underlying frameworks might contribute to more secure software.  This result has implications for software developers who wish to build secure software.\n\nWe developed new techniques and tools for building software that is \"secure by construction\" and \"secure by default\".  We showed how to design frameworks and libraries to help software developers avoid certain types of vulnerabilities.  In some cases, we can show that these kinds of vulnerabilities are completely eliminated, if developers use a suitable framework/library.\n\nWe studied the effectiveness of vulnerability reward programs.  Vulnerability reward programs (also sometimes known as security bug bounty programs) have started to gain attention and adoption by many software vendors, including the Firefox and Chrome web browsers.  Our research shows that vulnerability reward programs are an effective and economically efficient way to enhance software security.  We draw the conclusion that vulnerability reward programs should be considered a core part of secure software development.\n\nWe have also developed other methods for improving the security of software, including both hardening existing legacy software and development of new software.  Our work has also contributed to training and education of multiple graduate and undergraduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Wagner"
