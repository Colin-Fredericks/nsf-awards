 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: \r\nThe primary goal of this project is to sample two beds in the Meyer Desert Formation, which are known to be especially fossiliferous containing plants, insects, other arthropods, freshwater mollusks, and fish. There is a possibility that the teeth and bones of a small marsupial could also be found. Previous studies have demonstrated that these horizons contain unique fossil assemblages that provide information used to reconstruct paleoenvironments and paleoclimate. The fossils represent organisms previously not found in Antarctica and consequently their study will lead to the development of new hypotheses concerning southern hemisphere biogeography. The new discoveries will also increase knowledge of paleoenvironments and paleoclimates as well as biogeographic relationships of the biota of the southern hemisphere. For some organisms, such as Nothofagus (Southern Beech) or the trechine groundbeetle, fossils would confirm that Antarctica was inhabited as part of Gondwana. For other fossils, such as the cyclorrhaphan fly or freshwater mollusks not expected to have inhabited Antarctica, the discoveries will require a reassessment of phylogenetic interpretations and a reinvestigation of the role of Antarctica in the evolutionary history of those organisms. The new fossil-based knowledge will require integration with interpretations from cladistics and molecular genetics to develop more comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses for a range of organisms.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe discovery of fossils in Antarctica and implications for climate change has proven to be popular with the media. This attention will help disseminate the results of this study. Before the field season, the PI will work with local media and with area schools to set up field interviews and web casts from Antarctica. The project will also involve the training of a graduate student in the field and in the follow up studies of the fossils in the laboratory.",

Major cooling that led to the growth of the modern Antarctic ice sheets started in the late Miocene after 14 million years ago.&nbsp; Before that, a greener Antarctica was inhabited by numerous plants and animals.&nbsp; What types of plants and animals?&nbsp; How did they get there? How warm was the climate?&nbsp; The only way to answer these questions is from the study of fossiliferous deposits.&nbsp; The Meyer Desert Formation exposed in the Oliver Bluffs on the flank of the Beardmore Glacier at lat 85&deg;S, literally within sight of the Polar Plateau, is one of the most important fossil sites in Antarctica (Fig. 1).&nbsp; There, deposits of an advancing ancestral Beardmore glacier buried a vegetated glacial outwash plain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plant fossils are represented by pollen and spores, wood and leaves of Southern Beech (<em>Nothofagus</em>) shrubs, entire cushion plants, moss stems, and fruits of several species of flowering plants. Insects are represented by chitinous skeletal pieces of beetles and flies. Freshwater organisms are represented by calcium carbonate carapaces of seed shrimp (ostracods) and shells of pill clams and snails.&nbsp; A small conical fish tooth is the only vertebrate to have been discovered.</p>\n<p>In the most recent phase of the studies we targeted the deposits of a shallow lake and those of a stream channel for sampling.&nbsp; From those deposits we have identified numerous seeds (Fig. 2) of buttercups (<em>Ranunculus</em>), Mare&rsquo;s tail (<em>Hippuris</em>), Water-Milfoil (<em>Myriophyllum</em>), Crowberry (<em>Empetrum</em>), wood from the Southern Beech (<em>Nothofagus</em>), fungal structures, &nbsp;beetle parts and complete shells of new species of a pill clam (<em>Pisidium</em>) and a freshwater snail (Lymnaeidae).&nbsp; We have assigned the beetle wing cases (Fig. 3) to a groundbeetle (Trechini), the first to be described from Antarctica.&nbsp; All of the fossils from the MDF are related to living organisms.&nbsp; The fossil trechine shares characteristics with trechines from South America and from Tasmania (Fig. 4). The combined fossil and modern geographic distributions suggest that trechines were widespread on Gondwana before the supercontinent broke up and populations were rafted to South America and Tasmania where they evolved independently.&nbsp; Not all of the MDF plants and animals belong to ancient Gondwana lineages.&nbsp; There is strong biogeographic evidence that fruits of Mare&rsquo;s tail were transported to Antarctica &nbsp;by migrating shore birds, probably from the northern hemisphere. Collectively, the types of MDF animals and plants and their low biodiversity represent a tundra biome.&nbsp; There had to be sufficient environmental warmth and available moisture to support the complex life histories of the individual species. Based on the maximum geographic and ecological overlap of those species today we are able to provide an analog for the paleoenvironment and to provide an estimate of the summer temperatures. New fossils discovered during this study confirmed our earlier interpretation that the mean summer temperature of the upper Beardmore glacier would have been similar to that at treeline on Isla Navarino today. For a November to January growing season the mean mean summer temperature would have been 4-5&deg;C .&nbsp; This would have been about 25&deg;C warmer than summers on the upper Beardmore Glacier today.&nbsp; Various hypotheses invoking tectonics, ocean currents, changes in atmospheric gases have been advanced to explain the amount of climate change but the ultimate cause remains unknown. &nbsp;Antarctica was located on the pole so geographic position cannot be used to explain the difference. &nbsp;Based on other lines of evidence the tundra biome became extinct in the interior of Antarctica about 14 millions years ago.</p>\n<p>Nine undergraduates received training in every aspect of the research from the original field study to subsequent lab and database projects.
