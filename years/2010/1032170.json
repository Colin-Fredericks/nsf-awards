 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite several decades of U.S. anti-poverty policies, up to 13 percent of the population still lives below the poverty line, and many areas, such as Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta consistently, have significantly larger percentages of residents living in poverty.  The economic downturn affecting the U.S. from 2008 through 2010 requires identification of the kinds of projects that have the most positive impact on the economy and on areas that have the greatest need for public assistance. This research project will complete the first in-depth analysis of the role of local, state, and federal government spending on the economic development of U.S. counties from 1996 to 2007.  Using a unique dataset that captures the counties' economic characteristics and public spending, the investigator will identify what types of investment (such as education, transportation, business support, human services) are the most effective in promoting growth among counties.  The novelty of this approach lies in assessing whether public programs that are not designed for economic development purposes may also affect the economy of a county.  It also will account for the presence of spillover effects that take place when public spending is allocated to a recipient county by means of spatial statistics and spatial econometrics.  An example would be the construction of new transportation infrastructure that will impact the economy of the recipient county as well as that of its neighbors.  Previous empirical estimations of the impact of public policies have failed to account for this type of spatial dependence.  The investigator also will explore the potential presence of a \"crowding-out\" of local and state expenditures by federal spending.  Identification of circumstances where the volume of federal expenditures becomes overwhelming could help support changes in the design of federal programs to enable funds from all levels of government to be used most effectively.  The investigator also will test for the potential endogeneity of public spending and the robustness of the results to different spatial scales.\r\n\r\nThis project will assess the efficiency of public policies in promoting economic growth across counties.  Project results will suggest what types of projects have the greatest impact on economic growth.  Particular attention will be devoted to measuring the role and the extent of spillover effects in promoting growth.  Information and insights from this project therefore will give policy makers a better understanding of how investments in one place diffuse to neighboring places.  This project will lead to new insights regarding the ways allocation criteria should be defined and recipient areas assisted so that programs such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and future regional development policies can become more efficient.",
