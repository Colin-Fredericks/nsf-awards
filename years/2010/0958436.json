Despite the increasing ability of wireless devices to sense their surroundings, wireless systems have yet to fully leverage contextual data to improve performance. To this end, the Dallas-ARea Testbed for Context-Aware, Cognitive Research (DART-CARs) allows the study of wireless performance in a broad class of mobile and static environments from indoor labs to outdoor high-way speeds within a single testbed. Our hardware platform functions across many different wireless bands to enable real-time, multi-band operation. Such a first-of-its-kind infrastructure is critical for designing context-aware and cognitive algorithms that utilize multiple frequency bands to adapt to dynamic environmental settings. Our project has three major initiatives:\r\n\r\n-Deploy a wireless research testbed to enable study across a vast array of urban environments \r\n-Design multi-band wireless hardware and reconfigurable embedded software tools that enable context-driven, cognitive switching across frequency bands to improve performance in the aforementioned environments\r\n-Develop an open-access data repository of wireless performance in multiple urban scenarios and across frequency bands\r\n\r\nThe project incorporates topics across disciplines such as wireless theory, embedded programming, hardware design, and ubiquitous computing.  Student involvement in courses and research will allow cross-disciplinary intellectual growth.  Further, field measurements will be made available to the research community.  Finally, handheld mobile devices are increasingly being used as the primary method for under-represented groups to access the Internet.  This infrastructure and resulting research will improve the performance these devices.",
