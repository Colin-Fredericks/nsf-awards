This report will become available on the web within two weeks after the conclusion of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of four tracks that span all areas of defenses in cyberspace:\r\n\r\n1. Trustworthy cyber-physical systems and infrastructures: to provide robust control and communications.\r\n\r\n2. Pervasive monitoring and analytics: to provide self-awareness and situational-awareness, particularly in real time\r\n\r\n3. Attack-resilient system operation: to provide continuous services even under persistent attacks\r\n\r\n4. Cooperative autonomous cyberspace defense: to enable systems to work together cooperatively with shared understanding",
