 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (A: C) partnership between Oklahoma State University (OSU), an NSF PFI graduate (0332723), and Cameron University (Lawton, OK), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee)--builds upon the previous PFI award which enabled the creation of the New Product Development Center (NPDC) at OSU.  This proposal provides a multidisciplinary approach to the integration of three education programs with the aim of building innovation activities in small- and medium-sized U.S. manufacturing firms (SMMs). These three programs are 1) the Manufacturers Innovation Leadership Program (MILP), designed for manufacturers who have leadership potential within SMMs; 2) the Presidential Innovation and Creativity Scholars (PICS), which will create multidisciplinary teams of senior college students and faculty, who will produce and process innovation projects with small manufacturers participating in MILP; and 3) the Innovation Program for Teachers (IPT) which provides K-12 teachers an opportunity to take an internet-delivered class on manufacturing innovation. MILP will embrace a combination of experiential, problem-based, and research-based learning. Project participants will study innovation successes, learn about innovation processes, perform research to evaluate alternative solutions to problems, and be mentored by, and interact with, leaders in innovation from SMMs as well as by university faculty.\r\n\r\nThe future global competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing depends on the innovation capacity of SMMs.  Societal and economic impacts include job creation and retention, wealth creation, student education, minority manufacturing capabilities, and K-12 education for innovation. By targeting manufacturing capability in the state, the project will have a direct impact on the diverse, lower income populations of Oklahoma.  Moreover, an explicit effort is made to include underrepresented groups, including military veterans, in the state of Oklahoma in all facets of this project.\r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Oklahoma State University (OSU) (lead institution) and Cameron University;  Private Sector Organizations: Charles Machine Works, Lucas Metal Works, Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance, and Stolhand Heating and Air Conditioning; and State and Local Governments: Oklahoma EPSCoR and Oklahoma Center for Advancement of  Science and Technology (Oklahoma City).",
