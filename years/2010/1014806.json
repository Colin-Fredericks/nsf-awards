 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) collaborative award is to explore interdisciplinary parallels between volcanology and thermal spray materials processing, notably the behavior of molten materials at extreme temperatures and pressures.   Volcanic magma is subjected to high (700-1200\u00b0C) temperatures and pressures approaching 1000 atmospheres.  Thermal spray involves impinging molten (1000-2000\u00b0C) metallic or ceramic micro-particles at 100-200 m/s onto substrates, where instantaneous pressures can reach 10000 atmospheres underneath the impacting \"splat\".   The collaborative link stems from a recent discovery of highly nanoporous structures on the underside of frozen splats, the hypothesized mechanism of which is bubble nucleation due to rapid depressurization; this is known to occur in magma during volcanic eruption.  Accordingly, existing geologic models and controlled thermal spray processing will be used to better understand this phenomenon for a wide range of materials and environmental variables.  The approach taken will be to (1) utilize volcanologic modeling techniques and experimental parameter space to explore the capability of thermal spray to produce \"geo-inspired\" nanoporous thin films and coatings on a useful scale and (2) use thermal spray processing, specifically splat formation, to develop microscale experiments in which the high-temperature properties of volcanic materials may be measured systematically.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the benefits of this research will include robust design tools to fabricate useful nanoporous surfaces and structures of a wide range of materials using thermal spray, a multi-billion dollar industry with significant infrastructure.  This would also introduce a new technological \"pull\" for thermal spray driving further fundamental studies and innovation.    In addition, it would create a reliable tool to address highly debated topics in magma behavior, important for understanding and prediction of eruptions.  For outreach, the program will take advantage of the highly visible and dynamic nature of both fields, to facilitate dissemination of complex scientific concepts to undergraduates, under-represented pre-collegiate students, and senior citizens.\r\n\r\nThe project is an Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) Project jointly funded by ENG/CMMI and GEO/EAR.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award began from several observations of thermally-sprayed splats.  A splat is formed when a molten droplet of a metal or ceramic is impacted on a solid surface, at which point it rapidly spreads and freezes.  Splats are the building blocks of thermally-sprayed coatings; these coatings are formed through the successive impact and solidification of thousands of molten droplets.  Thermal spray is a fairly low-cost, industrial-scale process, meaning that any fundamental discoveries or improvements can be quickly disseminated over a large scale, or a range of industries.   The observations that started this award were that under certain conditions, splats displayed a high degree of nanoporosity, arising from frozen nano-bubbles.  Nanoporous materials are technologically important for a range of applications, and thermal spray represents a method by which they could be produced quickly and cheaply.   To help understand the fundamentals of these observations, thermal spray experts collaborated with experts in volcanology, as frozen bubbles are common in magma.  Key outcomes of this collaboration are:\n\n1) The team produced powders of volcanic material &ndash; obsidian from Big Glass Mountain &ndash; and used it as feedstock in Air Plasma Spray (APS) to produce \u00e6volcanic splats.\u00c6 In the splats, a wide range of frozen bubbles were observed, with uncommon, high-aspect ratio shapes that were not oriented to any obvious flow.  This indicates that the bubbles grew in a highly anisotropic manner.\n\n2) Volcanic materials differ from typical engineering materials in that as liquids, they exhibit a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity.  Therefore, the unique bubble and pore morphology observed in the volcanic splats led to the hypothesis that bubbles grew in a \u00e6viscosity gradient.\u00c6  To test this, we constructed an experimental apparatus in which a bubble was nucleated underneath a layered structure of silicone oils displaying different viscosities (see image).  The resulting bubbles were highly anisotropic, indicating the potential for control of bubble and pore morphology given the appropriate conditions.  It should be noted that experiments of this kind are attractive and enabling to a wide range of students, and all characterization and experimental work was carried out by a diverse group including under-represented minorities and women.\n\n3) Morphology of splats was also used to support key theories in volcanic materials themselves, as bubble wall thicknesses with remarkably low thicknesses were observed, before fragmentation.\n\n4) Geologic material behavior is strongly dependent on composition, in many cases more so than in engineering materials.  Interdisciplinary discussions of the role of impurities in thermal spray splat impact led to a new hypothesis of the transition temperature between disc-shaped and fragmented splats, supported by data from temperature-programmed-desorption spectroscopy experiments.  \n\n5) Collaborative discussions on natural material spurred experiments and analysis on the usage of thermal spray to produce nacre-like composites, for the first time on a large scale.   \n\n6)  The collaboration led to an exciting new development for active learning in engineering currlcula.  In Mechanical Engineering, a constant challenge is described by the following question: \"How do we connect fundamental principles with relevant topics in the real world?\"  In most classes, this connection is attempted by showing inspiring examples.  For examples, fluid mechanics is motivated by showing a computational fluid dynamics video of an F1 car, or stress tensors are motivated by discussing notable examples of dramatic mechanical failure.  The problem with these approaches is that the example is often several steps away from the fundamental principles being taught, and is also part of a complex system.   The other approach is to provide \u00e6demos\u00c6 in class that are analytically tractable, yet these often don\u00c6t have the connection to cu..."
