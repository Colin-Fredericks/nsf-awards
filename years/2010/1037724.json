The PIs plan a comprehensive survey of electrical and chemical engineering faculty; the project partners with the IEEE (electrical engineering) and AIChE (chemical engineering) professional societies to improve participation.  If successful, this research project will help provide the faculty perspective on barriers to broad adoption of research-proven pedagogies.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project will be to understand, then ultimately lower, barrier to adoption of teaching techniques that have been proven to engage diverse audiences of engineering students.  While successful at improving retention and engagement of students, including those from under-represented groups, these techniques have not spread widely, and researchers do not yet have a clear understanding of why.",

In this study, these approaches to teaching have been referred to as research-based instructional strategies (RBISs).

That is, how closely does engineering science classroom practice reflect the intentions of the original developers? While the question may be important, it can be difficult to collect and analyze how faculty members teach. High-quality measures of faculty instructional practice do not exist. Therefore, the authors had to create measures.\n\nThe authors surveyed 387 U.S. faculty teaching chemical, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering courses. To help estimate the degree to which faculty members followed recommended implementation of a RBIS, that is, the fidelity of implementation, the authors include questions about class time spent on sixteen (16) critical components of various RBISs together with questions about use of eleven (11) different RBIS. Fidelity was quantified as the percentage of RBIS users who also spent time on corresponding critical components. Overall fidelity of the 11 RBIS ranged from 11% to 80% of users spending time on all required components. Fidelity was highest for RBIS with one required component: case-based teaching, just-in-time teaching, and inquiry learning. Thirteen of 16 critical components discriminated between users and nonusers for all RBIS that were related to the 16 critical components.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey E Froyd"
