 "awd_abstract_narration": "Asian and Hispanic families comprise the fastest growing populations in the U.S., yet continue to experience low enrollment in early education programs such as daycare and nursery school due to cultural preferences and socioeconomic barriers. Early childhood care and education are instrumental in providing a basis for positive academic, social, cognitive, and physical outcomes later in life. Due to their lack of enrollment in early education, Asian and Hispanic immigrant children are arguably entering school with a deficit compared to their U.S.-born counterparts of all ethnic group backgrounds.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of formal programming, community organizations have developed family and parent education programs to address the gap in early childhood education, in hopes that culturally-rooted, parent-directed services will help parents provide the supplemental education required to enhance outcomes for their children. In a time of economic crisis, increasing numbers of immigrant families are turning to community organizations for assistance and it is essential to provide these organizations with best-practice models in order that they can generate the best possible outcomes for children from immigrant families.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit. The use of applied methodology in developmental research has long been discussed in academic circles, yet remains underutilized due to the gaps between theory-based research and practice (Winkle-Wagner et al., 2009). This study is rooted in applied methodology in which theory and practice are used to generate gains in both scientific knowledge and practical applications. Parental ethnotheories motivate the extent to which parents will seek early education opportunities for their children and will mediate the effectiveness of those opportunities. It is essential to gain an understanding of Asian and Latino immigrant parents' beliefs and goals about child development, including how the ethnotheories are adapted to new cultural environments, in order to design effective programs with the ultimate goal of increasing positive outcomes for their children. Current studies have documented deficits in engagement in early childhood education and related negative outcomes. This study expands upon that body of research to define culturally-embedded intervention models to minimize those deficits and help immigrant parents and children defy the barriers which would otherwise lead to negative outcomes for the families. Findings from this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals as well as among providers of early childhood education programs.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts. This project utilizes theory of change methodology to provide evaluation of two model programs in the Philadelphia/Southeastern Pennsylvania area. Evaluation of these programs increases the effectiveness of their service delivery to immigrant families and lead to development of best practice models to be used in advocacy efforts for other community organizations and immigrant children in the region. Impacts of the postdoctoral training opportunity include the development of a scholar who is experienced in applied methodology and will use this expertise to advocate for 1) cultural psychological and applied research approaches to human development; in particular, incorporating the development of immigrant and ethnic minority families into existing narratives about child and adolescent development, 2) research-based public/social policy change that will increase the ability of community organizations to serve immigrant families, thereby enriching the developmental environment of immigrant children, and 3) increased engagement of students from immigrant backgrounds in higher education STEM fields and in particular, increased participation of immigrant students and students who study immigrant families in the social sciences.",

With exponential growth in the past decade, schools must be adequately prepared for children who bring different cultural and linguistic strengths and needs into the classroom. For newcomer Latino families adapting to the expectations and norms of US schools can be a daunting task for parents. Understanding how parents\u00c6 beliefs are similar or different from school expectations can help schools and community agencies target their activities to promote Latino students\u00c6 successful transitions to school. This study examined parental belies about the most important aspects of raising children, kindergarten preparation, and reading (literacy) development to understand how they contribute to school readiness preparation and how participation in a parent education program can additionally increase school readiness.\n\n The Study\n\n In Fall 2011, 16 Mexican American mothers who were newly enrolled in a Parents-As-Teachers (PAT) program were recruited to participate in the study through a community agency serving Latino families in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Researchers made home visits to the families once at the start of the program and again after one academic year of involvement. Additional visits were made to families whose children entered kindergarten in Fall 2012.

All parts of the study were conducted in Spanish.\n\n Mexican parent beliefs: Social and behavioral focus is on-track\n\n Even before starting the PAT program, Mexican American mothers\u00c6 beliefs about what children need in order to be prepared to enter kindergarten are in line with teacher and educational scholars\u00c6 perspectives that enthusiasm, communication proficiency, and appropriate behavior are more important than academic skills (although they do agree that parents should prepare children with basic academic skills at home) (Olmstead &amp; Lockhard, 1995).\n\n Parents stated that the most important roles they play throughout a child\u00c6s lifetime are first, moral education (impart values) and second, to provide practical and emotional support to children (e.g., food, caring). These beliefs must be valued but also acknowledged as potential reasons that inhibit parents from focusing their efforts on children\u00c6s educational experiences.\n\n Participation in the PAT program helped to increase mothers\u00c6 engagement in \"Academic Stimulation\" activities from 3.98 to 4.56 (statistically significant, Figure 1). Support and access to knowledge and materials used to engage children in school preparation activities was helpful to the parents. At the same time, however, there was a statistically significant decrease in self-efficacy (Figure 2) which was measured by questions such as \"I feel sure of myself as a mother.\"\n\nParticipating in the PAT program helped parents learn about previously unknown/unattended issues in child development.

As one parent expressed: \"They (the parent educators) can do [a better job] than me.\" It is important that parents see the parent educators as allies from which they can learn and get support in promoting their own skills as parents.
