Current research  indicates that potentiated innate immunity due to the release of danger-associated-molecular-patterns (DAMPs) should be added to this list. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the role of the stress-inducible member of the 70-kDa Hsp (heat-shock) family of proteins Hsp72, as an important systemic DAMP. The discovery of Hsp72 as a DAMP would have implications for all organisms that generate adaptive acute stress responses. Using a systems biology approach, this project examines the nature of eHsp72 release and its function in host defense following bacterial challenge. The results of this work will enrich the interplay of research between the fields of stress physiology and immunology and could yield ways of capitalizing on the adaptive aspect of stress. In addition to specific scientific advancements,  this research will sustain recruitment of undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups in the biological sciences, with the goal of preparing them to enter graduate school. \r\n\r\nThe PI has historically trained and mentored undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. Students involved in the project will be mentored and trained in research design, critical thinking, oral and written communication. Undergraduate students will present their work at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journals as co-authors. The project outcomes will be disseminated to the general public through television, radio, and mainstream periodicals.",
