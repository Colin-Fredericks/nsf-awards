 "awd_abstract_narration": "he goal of this CAREER project is to develop novel mechanisms that use\r\ntransactions to improve software assurance.  This project is developing\r\nTransactional Memory Introspection---or TMI, which is an approach to \r\nbuilding software security mechanisms by leveraging recent advances in \r\nhardware and software transactional memory. Security mechanisms based \r\non TMI build upon the same machinery that transactional memory systems \r\nuse to ensure performance and functionality. TMI therefore promises to \r\nmake security mechanisms efficient and easy to integrate with software.\r\n\r\nTMI-based security mechanisms being researched in this project include:\r\n(1) TxAuth: a reference monitor architecture to better ensure complete\r\nmediation of security-sensitive operations and allow easier integration \r\nwith legacy systems;\r\n(2) TxInt: a data structure integrity monitor to protect extensible \r\nsoftware systems, such as operating systems and browsers, from untrusted \r\nextensions; and\r\n(3) TMWatch: a data watchpoint framework that equips malware analysis \r\ntools and debuggers with new capabilities to reverse-engineer malware \r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this project seeks to demonstrate that concurrency control\r\nmachinery implemented in transactional memory systems can also be used to \r\nimprove software assurance. These additional benefits may lead to more \r\nresearch on transactions and their ultimate adoption by hardware and \r\nsoftware vendors.  The results from this project are being disseminated \r\nvia the development of new course material that will expose students and \r\nsoftware vendors to the dos and don'ts of secure programming. Suitable \r\ncourse material developed in this project is also being included in \r\ncourses targeted towards K-12 and undergraduate students to attract\r\nthem to computer science programs.",
