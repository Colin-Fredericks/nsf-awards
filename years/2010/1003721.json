 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yakima Valley Community College's program expansion addresses the growing employment demand in Washington State's Viticulture (grape growing) and Enology (winemaking) industry by redesigning its 2-year AAS programs in Vineyard and Winery Technology. The curriculum is developed around the wine industry calendar year to take advantage of externships at local vineyards and wineries, while allowing for continual pursuit of an associates level degree. The change in curriculum offering is designed to correlate with the industry down times, as well as the existing academic calendar, and give flexibility for work experiences during the busiest times for the industry: harvest and crush, which currently conflict with fall quarter classes. In addition, the college is developing the curriculum for online delivery while maintaining the hands-on technical and science based training using short course and weekend seminars and practicums at the YVCC Teaching Winery and Vineyard.",
