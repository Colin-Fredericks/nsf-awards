 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this planning project Lesley University is strengthening existing relationships with the Urban Ecology Institute, MassBay Community College, and one or more high-need school districts to develop a Teaching Fellows and Master Teaching Fellows (TF/MTF) program. The planning process is building on Lesley's successful standards-based teacher preparation and professional development programs to achieve the following objectives: 1) solidification of partnership agreements to recruit and train STEM professionals to become highly qualified teachers of science and mathematics; 2) determination of the capacity of the partners to conduct the program effectively, including commitment to cost sharing elements and the recruitment and retention of individuals who would not otherwise pursue careers in teaching for the TF program, including individuals from underrepresented groups; 3) identification of high need school districts interested in participating in a TF/MTF program; 4) estimation and justification of the number and quality of participants to be served by the program; 5) assessment of the needs and quality of pre-service student support and new teacher support infrastructures for TFs; 6) completion of development of a high quality professional development program for MTFs based on Lesley's current professional development for teacher leaders; 7) formulation of an evaluation plan that will measure program effectiveness; and 8) development of a plan for sustainability beyond the period of NSF funding. The planning year is thus expected to result in creation of long-term, sustainable pathways for recruiting and training high quality STEM teachers and teacher leaders, thus helping to alleviate long standing science/mathematics teacher shortages and ultimately resulting in significant improvements in student achievement.",
