 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of sensor-rich mobile devices such as smartphones, an increasing number of people are sharing personal \"contextual\" information like location, activity, and health/fitness information with members of their social network.  To enhance privacy for people sharing such information, a large body of research has focused on ways for users to specify who should be authorized to access their information. This research improves end-user privacy by addressing the related question of \"Who is accessing my information and to what extent?\". Providing users with an accurate sense of their \"exposure\" will enable them to better control how their contextual information is shared and will help mitigate emerging privacy risks.\r\n\r\nThis research advances the state of the art in privacy by formalizing the notion of exposure-awareness research, and by investigating metrics that can be used to quantify a person?s exposure, developing usable feedback models and visualizations that leverage these metrics to convey exposure, and creating exposure control extensions to established policy architectures to help users control exposure and refine their data sharing policies over time.  The proposed research will thus allow ordinary people to proactively rein in the amount of personal information shared online, and will reduce the privacy risks for the large population of users who are increasingly using social-networking applications to share personal contextual information.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith the advent of mobile-computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, an increasing number of people are sharing or broadcasting personal contextual information using social-networking services such as Facebook and Twitter. For example, people are now sharing not only their location, but also geo-tagged photographs, activity information as deduced from onboard sensors such as accelerometers, and fitness information.  A large body of research has focused on disclosure policies for personal information (i.e., Who should see my information?), but has neglected to characterize what we call a user's 'exposure' (i.e., Who is accessing my information and to what extent?).  Existing work on disclosure policies allows, e.g.,Alice to specify that her co-workers are permitted to access her physical location during the work week.  While such policies may provide Alice with some baseline notion of exposure control, they do not provide Alice with feedback about her queriers.  Would Alice still feel in control if she learned that Bob was accessing her location every 5 minutes?  Or if every member of her project team checked her location while she was visiting a medical specialist?  To truly enable individual control of data, people need a way to quantify, interpret,and control the extent to which this data is accessed,cross-correlated, and disseminated.  During the course of this project, we have made a number of important advances with respect to this exposure control lifecycle:\n\n - Design Principles for Exposure-Aware Systems: Throughout this   project, our team has conducted a variety of surveys and user   studies to better understand exposure in contextual sharing   systems.  These studies have provided insight into (i) the types of   factors that individuals want to consider when sharing contextual   information and where existing systems fall short of supporting   this conditional disclosure; (ii) how differences in usage (e.g.,   social vs. professional, always-on vs. check-in) of the same system   can lead to very different norms of sharing and access, and thereby   different exposure threats; (iii) the types of access patterns to   an individual's data that are allowed by specified access policies,   but are inconsistent with the individual's intended sharing   behavior; and (iv) how over- and under-exposure awareness can alter   an individual's use of a system.  Our findings led to the design of   the first exposure-aware policy language, and have informed the   design of all system artifacts produced during this research.\n\n - Exposure Awareness Interfaces: A key difficulty in building   exposure-aware systems lies in identifying instances of   over-sharing.  The contextual, temporal, and intra-personal factors   that lead to instances of over-exposure are often impossible to   capture using the policy or preference languages supported by most   platforms; as such, although an access is allowed by an   individual's preferences, it may still be contrary to their desired   exposure goals.  To this end, we have developed exposure awareness   interfaces that leverage aggregate exposure summaries to convey   information to participants in a system, and evaluation   methodologies for assessing the efficacy of these types of   interfaces.  Balancing the coarseness of these types of interfaces   with the cognitive overhead of more frequent interruptions is a   challenging problem that defines a fruitful space for future work.\n\n- Exposure from Camera Sensors: We explored the impact of exposure   from emerging wearable cameras (e.g., Google Glass, Narrative Clip,   Autographer), and how users can control their exposure from   inadvertent collection and sharing of images from such sensors. We   conducted a 'lifelogging' user study to understand what people   consider to be 'sensitive' in images collected from such devices   and developed a framework for controlling the collection and   sharing of such images based on attributes within the image. We   developed a mechanism to automatically detect sensitive images   through the blacklisting sensitive spaces, e.g., bathrooms,   bedrooms and offices.\n\nThis work has made important strides toward advancing all phases of the exposure control lifecycle, ranging from policy specification and deployment, to quantification metrics, to interfaces supporting feedback and policy revision.  Ongoing collaborations enabled by this award are now investigating the deployment of exposure-aware services in the context of social sharing, data management, and workplace presence sensing.\n\nThe project also sought to strengthen the interests of underrepresented groups in STEM fields (science, technology,engineering, and math) including graduate study in STEM fields. We hosted multiple African American summer interns from HBCU institutions, and US undergraduate male and female interns as part of this effort.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Apu Kapadia"
