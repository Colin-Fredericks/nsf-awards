 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study improved computational algorithms for\r\nmodel reduction of complex fluid flows.  This research will have two\r\nmain thrusts, new closure models and a parametric modeling framework.\r\nThe investigators will investigate closure for models that are based on \r\nthe proper orthogonal decomposition.  This component of the research \r\nwill leverage current developments in large eddy simulation along with \r\ntwo-level algorithms for efficient computational implementation.  The\r\nfact that the closure models follow from both mathematical and physical \r\narguments will allow for a methodology that generalizes to physical \r\nsettings other than fluid flow.  A new globalization methodology that\r\ncombines more accurate local models with an interpolation framework\r\nto evaluate the models in parameter space will also be studied.  The \r\nlocal model improvements are provided using flow sensitivity analysis \r\nand basis functions are constructed using a multidimensional Hermite \r\ninterpolation method.   The investigators will emphasize problems in \r\ngeophysical fluid dynamics as well as flows with free convection.\r\n\r\nThis research will expand the applicability of computationally\r\nefficient simulations to a wider class of fluid flows.  The availability\r\nof dramatically faster simulations is important to many engineering \r\napplications including optimization and control of fluid flows, data\r\nassimilation and uncertainty quantification.  Therefore, the research \r\nconducted in this project has direct application to a wide range of\r\nproblems that include data assimilation in climate and weather modeling \r\nas well as simulation, optimization, and control of energy efficient buildings.",
