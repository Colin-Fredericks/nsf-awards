 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Science and Math (CSM) and the Graduate College of Education (GCE) at the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMB), in partnership with Boston Public Schools (BPS) and Randolph Public Schools (RPS), are collaborating on a Noyce Phase II Scholarship and Stipend project for the purpose of supporting additional cohorts of STEM professional Noyce scholars in the Teach Next Year (TNY) program; to expand the research begun on issues that arose as a result of the Phase I project; and to extend the longitudinal evaluation of the progress and retention of the scholars. The funding supports 50 STEM professionals total (in 5 cohorts), to complete the year-long TNY residential teaching program that culminates in a Master's degree, licensure in secondary science or math, and additional certification in either teaching students with moderate disabilities or teaching English language learners.  As a result of the Phase I project, four innovations have been added to the project as follows: (1) measurements of academic progress made by the students taught by the Noyce graduates; (2) the addition of Randolph Public Schools; (3) the additional certification to teach students with moderate disabilities or English language learners; and expansion of the school-based professional learning communities to district-wide and cross-district professional learning communities.",
