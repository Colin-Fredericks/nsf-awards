Prof. Murphy and her students will study how to modify the surface of gold nanoparticles and nanorods with ligands and proteins to form objects that will be recognized by cells as natural proteins. Achieving this goal requires significant increase in our ability to control ligand orientation and coverage on the surface of gold nanostructures. The study could lead to the development of new and improved nanometric carriers with the capability to selectively deliver drugs into cells. The use of plasmonic forces to heat the gold nanostructures could facilitate controlled release of drugs into the cells. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the cutting edge research area of nanobiotechnology.",
