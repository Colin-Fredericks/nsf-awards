 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Symposium on Lepton Moments brings together the communities from atomic\r\nphysics, nuclear physics and particle physics that are interested in magnetic dipole\r\nmoments, electric dipole moments and the transition moments that could lead to\r\nlepton flavor violation in lepton decays. With the apparent disagreement between\r\nthe muon magnetic dipole moment and the Standard&#8208;Model theory, all of these\r\ntopics are at the forefront of the search in precision measurements for physics\r\nbeyond the Standard Model. Thus this meeting addresses key issues in physics: The\r\nsearch for physics beyond the Standard Model; the searches for new sources of\r\nviolations of Charge Conjugation combined with Parity, which is necessary for the\r\npredominance of matter over anti&#8208;matter in the universe. These participant costs\r\nwill permit young scientists, graduate students and young postdoctoral scientists to\r\nattend this meeting.",
