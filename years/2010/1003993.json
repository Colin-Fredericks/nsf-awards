 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at Grand Valley State University will provide talented undergraduate students from across the nation with first-hand, experiential knowledge of the process of conducting mathematical research.  Over the course of eight weeks each summer, eight undergraduate students will engage in mathematical research on an interesting, original, and mathematically significant topic selected by a faculty mentor. Research results may have applications in national security, political science, and industry. These experiences will enable the participants to make an informed decision about pursuing a career as a mathematician.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the program, faculty mentors will also work to enhance students' written and verbal communication skills and build a community of scholars. Students are expected to present their findings several times over the summer.  Projects funded by prior REUs at Grand Valley State University have resulted in prize-winning posters and numerous award-winning student talks at national meetings of mathematicians, and more than a dozen published or accepted papers in journals. Most of the alumni of the previous REUs choose to attend (or have attended) graduate school in mathematics or a closely related field.  These students report that the REU had an impact on their choice to pursue a career in mathematics or a related field. The nonacademic career choices of program alumni include software engineering, working for the National Security Administration, and financial engineering.",

(MathFest was held in Pittsburgh, PA in 2010, Lexington, KY in 2011, and Madison, WI in 2012.)  In addition, four students presented their work at the 2012 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Boston, MA, and two students presented their work at the 2013 Joint Mathematics meetings in San Diego, CA.  Another group of students presented their work at the Council on Undergraduate Research national conference at Penn State University in November 2011.\n\nParticipants won numerous awards for their presentations.  At MathFest in 2010, one research group won an award from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) for their talk on multiple-criteria evaluation schemes.  At MathFest in 2011, one group won an outstanding presentation award from the MAA for their talk on iterative voting methods.  Another group from 2011 won an award from the MAA for their poster presentation at the 2012 Joint Mathematics Meetings in Boston.  There they presented an algorithm for detecting potholes using smartphone data, which was later awarded a significant cash prize for solving a problem posed by the City of Boston.  This group\u00c6s work was also featured in Science magazine.  Finally, at MathFest in 2012, two groups won awards from the MAA: one for their talk on equal circle packing and another for their talk on preferences in referendum elections.\n\nIn addition to presenting their work at local, state, and national conferences, many program participants have continued to work with their mentors after the conclusion of the summer program to prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.  One paper from the 2011 program has been accepted for publication pending minor revisions, and seven others have either been submitted or are in preparation.\n\nWhile many of the 2010-2012 REU participants are still completing their undergraduate studies, others have gone on to enroll in graduate programs in mathematics or related fields.  Currently, alumni of the 2010 program are enrolled at Yale University, University of Iowa, University of Utah, University of Vermont, University of Illinois, and Western Michigan University.  Alumni of the 2011 program are enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic University, Iowa State University, Michigan State University, and Brown University.\n\nIn summary, the Summer Mathematics REU at Grand Valley State University provided 24 undergraduate students an opportunity to conduct original research in mathematics and to present their work in various local, state, and national venues.  These students won numerous awards for their research, and many have gone on to graduate school in mathematics and related fields.  The research from this REU has practical applications to problems such as designing voting systems and detecting road anomalies.  In addition, it has already led to one accepted paper and several others either submitted or in preparation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William C Dickinson"
