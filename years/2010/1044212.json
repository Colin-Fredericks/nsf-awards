This study provides the background necessary to undertake the modification and integration of existing algorithms in order to improve collection management.  Two facets of the project are the goal of finding similar or replacement resources for those that disappear, and the use of semantic analysis to help determine if a resource has been repurposed or otherwise changed over time.  The former is useful to collection managers enabling them to bring new and relevant items into their collections, while the latter aids in maintaining the usefulness of the collection.  The tools are expected to lower the costs of maintaining links to the resources.",
