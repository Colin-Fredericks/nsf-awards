In this context, cyberinfrastructure encompasses the tools and services, encapsulated in an IT appliance) needed for capturing, communicating, authoring, viewing, sharing, controlling access to, storing, and conferencing about data and information regarding events resulting in the children?s death. The project builds on an existing functional IT appliance developed for collaborative mechanisms of injury to children in motor vehicle crashes. Enabling its extension, this appliance could quickly be adapted to a more diverse range of causes of death, allowing for different kinds of participants with varying degrees of security and privacy. The work is expected to enrich the presentation of death scenarios for quicker analysis of their causes, leading to more efficient identification of potential prevention strategies. Expected contributions within the research thrusts include techniques for:\r\n-\tAutomatic generation of interfaces, integration of components and services, and recovery of domain-specific collaborative IT appliances and\r\n-\tFine-grained spatio-temporal access-control of shared objects.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis project addresses a real need for easy-to-use tools that reflect semantics and workflow collaborative activities by non-IT experts as undertaken by professional teams engaged in child death reviews. The project engages graduate students in advanced IT research. Minorities and women will be recruited and encouraged to apply.",
