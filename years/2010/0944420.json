 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop new analytical methods for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) to enable significantly greater safety and performance of batteries. Combing impedance spectroscopy testing with physical analysis, the methodology will identify specific cell components responsible for performance loss under a range of test conditions; a significant advancement to the current industry standard evaluation methods of only providing pass/no pass information. If successful, the outcome of this research will provide more useful feedback information to develop next generation battery technology and new quality control metrics, as well as to serve as basis for novel controller circuitry.  \r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, is the enhancement of safety of lithium-ion battery technology to the level that larger applications can be achieved.  Since its introduction in 1991, the world market for LIBs has grown beyond $10 billion/year. LIBs have become ubiquitous in powering new consumer technologies, including mobile phones, laptops, and digital cameras/videos. Depending on the specific chemistry employed, LIBs energy densities can be 2 or 3 times those of previous battery technologies. To date, larger applications, as in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or full electric vehicles, have failed to materialize on a significant scale due to concerns over battery safety. Individual vehicle propulsion battery packs will each utilize many cells. The proposed research is intended to provide unique advancement towards understanding safety failure in LIBs that would benefit a wide range of clients from cell and battery-pack manufacturers to battery end users. Ultimately, the application of LIBs on a large scale in hybrid or electric vehicle propulsion will lead to more energy efficient transportation in the US, thereby decreasing the nation's dependence on oil imports, and simultaneously reducing our CO2 emissions.",
