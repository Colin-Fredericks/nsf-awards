Transforming nanoscale science into systems is the unifying theme, with technical thrusts on: (1) nanoscience of biosystems, (2) nanomaterials for energy conversion and (3) microsystems. A diverse range of projects provide unique research experiences for twelve undergraduates each summer. The interdisciplinary environment brings together faculty from six departments on campus and includes student mentors from nearby Sandia National Laboratories. Students also participate in a series of seminars that include faculty, national lab and industry speakers, as well as a series of seminars that addresses the role of ethics in the modern research environment. Field trips to Los Alamos National Laboratories and to local industries enhance the students' exposure to career opportunities and exciting research problems.",
