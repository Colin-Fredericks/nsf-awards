 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's team is working on a website for family reunification for the Haiti earthquake. In addition to crawling and scraping data from Web pages for the repository at http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/ coordinated by Google and many other volunteers, the team has built a powerful search interface on the data. During this effort, the team has identified several interesting research challenges to be studied in this project in order to make the system more scalable. The intellectual merits of this project include the support of powerful keyword search with efficient indexing structures and algorithms in a clouding-computing infrastructure that is increasingly popular for supporting large scale applications. The main challenge is how to use limited programming primitives in the cloud to implement index structures and search algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will have a broad impact on many information systems that are moving to the cloud-computing paradigm. The adoption of the techniques in the family-reunification domain will have a significant impact in our society by helping people find their loved ones in a disaster. The PI's team will use the Google Person Finder project as a real application to test the techniques in the Haiti earthquake. The team plans to provide the techniques and source code in future releases so that the techniques can be used in family reunification during future disasters.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at the URL: http://fr.ics.uci.edu/haiti/",
