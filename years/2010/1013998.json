In the US, great emphasis is placed on the \"big picture\" or the overarching question underlying the research. In my experience, this emphasis is missing in China.

Transfer RNAs are small, non-coding RNAs best known for their role in protein synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that stress-induced tRNA fragments, like other non-coding RNAs, may play a role in regulating gene expression under a variety of stress conditions. The proposed research project aimed to develop a novel method for the identification of potential tRNA targets. This project was an excellent match between my expertise and that of my host laboratory, as it took advantage of novel photo-crosslinking agents synthesized in the He laboratory and applied them to an emerging question in t..."
