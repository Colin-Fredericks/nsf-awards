 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to assess both the direct impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on migrating shorebirds as well as the carry-over effects of the spill on distant ecosystems where these birds breed during summer months. Carry-over effects on breeding success resulting from the degradation of winter habitat have been documented in several avian species and are important not only to shorebird populations but also to the entire ecosystems in which the shorebirds breed. The investigators will compare oil-exposed versus unaffected control sites with respect to the toxicological status of individual birds, contamination levels in the environment, food availability, survival, correlates of subsequent breeding success, and other indicators of fitness for four small wintering shorebirds. The outcome will be to determine how individual toxicological status and environmental status contribute to variation in measures of fitness and correlates of breeding success. This work will provide a foundation for the development of population models and further studies aimed at documenting the effects of the oil spill on the distant, Arctic ecosystems where these birds breed. \r\n\r\nThis work will highlight the importance of Gulf of Mexico habitats as wintering grounds for migrating shorebirds, providing baseline information for the conservation of threatened coastal habitats and bird species and demonstrating the multiple ways in which a major environment disaster can affect ecosystems on a global scale. Part of this project will be to develop a novel assay for measuring oil ingestion using fecal samples of birds. This project will provide training for one PhD student, four undergraduates and one postdoctoral researcher.  Citizen scientists will be engaged to help re-sight banded birds.",

Predicting these impacts requires a detailed understanding of the interactions between shorebirds and their habitats. However, the refueling performance and migration ecology of shorebirds on the northern Gulf have not been well studied. Some coastal wintering shorebird species are believed to use a \"jump\" migration strategy; migrating long distances in the spring from coastal habitats on the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) to the northern Prairie pothole region of North America without stopping. Other species use a \"hop\" migration strategy stopping at shorter intervals in agricultural fields and natural wetlands along their migratory journey.
