 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective is to study the structure of the stably stratified boundary layer based on results of field measurements and numerical simulations. For this purpose, observations obtained during two recent atmospheric boundary layer experiments will be analyzed. Turbulence data collected during these projects on instrumented towers and by the Tethered Lifting System (TLS) will be examined. Two numerical models: (i) a one-dimensional stochastic model, developed by Dr. A. Kerstein, and (ii) the three-dimensional large-eddy simulation (LES) model, developed by the principal investigator, will also be used. The first model will be used to simulate the observed temporal transformation in the nocturnal boundary layer during these projects. The LES model will be employed to evaluate gradient-based similarity functions.\r\n\r\nThe specific aim of the proposed program is to systematically improve understanding, description, and parameterization of the stably stratified boundary layer. Investigations will be conducted of transitions from strong to weak stable turbulence.  Asymptotic laws for turbulent statistics in these conditions will be defined. The classic similarity approach will be improved by developing and testing new scaling systems and techniques, which will reduce negative effects of diminishing scales and self-correlation.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is improved understanding of processes and regimes in the nocturnal boundary layer, which currently are insufficiently understood and are not well-represented in current numerical models of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the project is application of this improved conceptual understanding of turbulence and diffusion in the stable boundary layer to important problems. Results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at scientific conferences.  These results will be used to develop boundary layer parameterizations, which are essential in numerical weather predictions, climate simulations, and air pollution studies. The developed methods could also be applied in studies of tropospheric turbulence",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe performed research was devoted to studying the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL),  the lower part of the atmosphere (depth ~100-1000 m). The ABL has a great practical and scientific importance, since all human and biological activities take place in this region. \n\nThe ABL can be divided into sublayers. In the \"surface layer,\" which typically exists up to 10 &ndash; 100 m above the surface (10% of the boundary layer depth), the turbulent fluxes do not significantly vary with height. The portion of the boundary layer above the surface layer is referred to as the outer layer. \n\nOur research focused on the stable (nocturnal) boundary layer. The basic research technique in the project was the similarity theory. The similarity theory is the method of finding universal relationships between physical variables, often applied in situations, when the complexity of physical processes prevents obtaining the direct solutions of governing equations. The theory is based on dimensional analysis, which allows expressing parameters of a considered phenomenon in terms of scaling factors (scales). \n\nThe similarity theory of turbulence in the atmospheric surface layer  was first intoduced by Monin and Obukhov (1954), based on the assumption that the regime is governed by the momentum flux &tau;o, the surface temperature flux Ho, both constant with height, moreover, by height z, the buoyancy parameter &beta; = g/To, where g is the gravity acceleration and To is the reference temperature. From these parameters, the following flux-based scales could be obtained for velocity u* = &tau;o1/2 , for temperature T&lowast; = &minus; Ho/ u*, and for length L&lowast; = -u&lowast;3/ (&kappa;&beta;Ho), where L&lowast; is referred to as the Obukhov length.\n\nA statistical moment X, scaled in terms of the above scales, is expected to be a universal function &phi;x(z/L&lowast;) of the dimensionless height z/L&lowast;. This statement conveys the so-called \"self-similarity\", a property, which manifests itself in the reduction of the number of independent dimensionless variables, in comparison to the number of dimensional ones. Self-similarity substantially simplifies the description of phenomena and their experimental, analytical and computational analysis.\n\nIn our project, an alternative gradient-based scaling was introduced, based on  the local gradient of the potential temperature  &Gamma;, the buoyancy parameter &beta;, and the mixing length L, with scales\n\n                                            for velocity : UN = L N,  \n\n                                            for temperature : TN = L &Gamma;,                                  \n\n                                            for length : L\n\nwhere N = (&beta; &Gamma;)0.5 is the Brunt-V&auml;is&auml;l&auml; frequency, &Gamma; is a gradient of the temperature, &beta; is the buoyancy parameter,  and L the mixing length. A statistical moment X, scaled in terms of the above scales, is expected to be a universal function &psi;x (Ri) of the Richardson number Ri = N2/S2, where S = [(dU/dz)2+  (dV/dz)2 ]1/2 is the wind shear. \n\nIn the lower part of the stable boundary layer, the mixing length can be expressed as L =  &kappa;z, where z is the height above the surface, and &kappa; = 0.4  is the von Karman constant. In the most general case, the mixing length can be described by  the expression L =  &kappa;z/(1+&kappa;z/&lambda;o/+&kappa;z/&lambda;B), valid in the entire boundary layer, where &lambda;o, &lambda;B are parameters.  \n\nAlternatively, the mixing length can be also expresed in terms of the standard deviations of the vertical velocity &sigma;w , or temperature &sigma;&theta;, which leads to two other scaling systems, with the following scales:  \n\n                                            for velocity : Uw = Lw N,  \n\n                                            for temperature : Tw = Lw &Gamma;,                                \n\n                                            for length : Lw  = &sigma;w/N  \n\na..."
