 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award has been made to the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. This award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The program, titled \"Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TECBio),\" focuses on the simulation and visualization of biological systems at multiple scales. TECBio students can expect a challenging and fulfilling research experience that will prepare them for a successful graduate career. A pool of at least 26 research mentors will provide students with a large array of theoretical and experimental research projects to choose from. Students will also receive classroom training in topics pertinent to the emerging field of computational biology, such as computational structural biology, cell and systems modeling, computational genomics, and bioimage informatics. Additionally, TECBio students will participate in a weekly journal club, attend research and career seminars organized specifically for the program, take part in an Ethics Forum that will instruct them in the responsible conduct of research, present their work at a Pittsburgh-wide annual research symposium, and experience the various social and cultural activities available in Pittsburgh. Students will be admitted to the TECBio REU from diverse majors that include biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, statistics, engineering, and computer science. TECBio students will receive a stipend, housing, and travel allowance to, from, and within Pittsburgh. Students who are rising juniors and seniors, especially from small universities and colleges that do not have ample research opportunities and those from underrepresented groups, will be encouraged to apply. TECBio students will play an active role in enhancing the REU program, and will have several opportunities, including the BIO REU common assessment tool, to give their feedback. The TECBio REU will provide various networking opportunities both among students and between students and faculty to foster interactions. Additional information can be found at http://www.ccbb.pitt.edu/TECBioREU/, or by contacting Maureen Hernandez at mhdez@pitt.edu (412-648-8107), or the PI/Program Director, Joseph Ayoob, at jayoob@pitt.edu (412-648-8646).",

As one of the \"New Biologies\", Computational Biology uses quantitative approaches and the power of computing to answer questions in many fields of science. Our TECBio program reaches out to students from a wide range of academic disciplines, from ethnic and racial backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences, and from schools with limited research opportunities to give them a primary research and training experience in this new interdisciplinary field. Our 37 students who participated in the program over the first 3 years were majors in 14 different areas of study, and over one third of them were double majors. We also achieved our goals of demographic diversity by admitting an overwhelming majority (80%) of students from either underrepresented groups or smaller, non-PhD-granting schools. All of our students were integrated into our department\u00c6s \"tiered mentoring\" framework, which both gave them access to a team of mentors and provided them with the opportunity to mentor younger scientists. In addition to performing cutting-edge computational research in bioimage analysis, genomics, structural biology, and systems biology, TECBio students also participated in other academic and professional development enrichment activities. These events included introductory classes in computational biology, hands-on computer laboratory sessions, research and career seminars, responsible conduct of research training, and numerous writing and presenting opportunities, all of which were geared to help prepare our students for success in graduate school and other STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-related careers. To this end, over 80% of the program alumni who have completed their undergraduate degree (31 students) have gone on to pursue further education and careers in STEM fields; another 7% are actively pursuing these endeavors. The majority of these students, which also equals about 50% of all graduated alumni, have enrolled in graduate programs. Their preparation for success in these programs is bolstered by their productivity during and after their summer experiences. Two of our students, Ms. Yagmur Muftuoglu and Ms. Katie Cunningham have published their summer work as primary research papers, and another student, Ms. Carsen Stringer, had her work accepted as a published abstract for a national conference. Several other students presented their work at national and international conferences, for which many were able to obtain awards to fund their travel. Lastly, program alumni, Ms. Kimberly Schneider and Ms. Stringer have procured additional NSF funding in the forms of an NSF supplement and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, respectively. Through the many achievements of our students, we are encouraged by the success of our program in helping to prepare the next generation of scientists, science educators, and ambassadors for science. The TECBio REU @ Pitt looks forward to continuing our efforts to equip tomorrow\u00c6s scientific leaders who will continue to push the edge of discovery and be a leading force at the forefront of interdisciplinary scientific research and teaching.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph C Ayoob"
