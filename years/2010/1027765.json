Examples include advanced battery materials and quantum wires proposed for use in next generation opto-electronics.  Features on these scales are subject to profound changes over time due to the thermally induced motion of atoms.  The focus of this project is to develop the computational tools that are required for predicting the way these features evolve with time by developing computer programs referred to as \"meta-codes.\"  These meta-codes allow researchers to consider these problems by integrating knowledge obtained from the smallest scales, on which electrons control atomic interactions, to the largest scales, on which elastic interactions drive features to form or dissolve with time. The expected result is an automated, top-down working paradigm that naturally integrates tools from quantum mechanics, statistical physics and continuum elasticity.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual impact comes both from an increased understanding of how to develop meta- codes to undertake multi-scale modeling and from a deeper understanding of the energy storage and electronic materials studied with these novel tools. The broader impact of this work arise from the development of an approach that integrates chemistry, physics and mechanics, and that can be used to refine our understanding of how a wide variety of materials systems evolve when there exist large spatial variations in composition and stress. The project includes active participation of students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level, and incorporates a series of outreach activities that leverage those ongoing in the involved institutions.",
