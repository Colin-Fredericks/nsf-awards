 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a novel photoacoustic (PA) microscopy system that would enable the mapping of deeply buried subsurface defects in optically opaque materials. Imaging of subsurface objects with sub-100 nm dimensions in opaque materials remains a major concern to integrated circuit reliability and performance. PA techniques combine the benefits of the large penetration depth of ultrasound with the lateral spatial resolution of an optical probe.  However, the spatial resolution of PA techniques is limited by diffraction. To overcome these challenges, a novel approach is proposed for sub-wavelength PA technology by creating highly localized optical and ultrasound fields using: a) surface plasmonc nano-focusing for sub-100 nm confinement of the optical probe for high sensitivity detection of laser generated high frequency (0.5 - 10 GHz) ultrasound, and b) time reversal acoustics for spatial focusing of the scattered ultrasound field from nanoscale sub-surface objects. This PA system would provide an unprecedented spatial resolution and penetration depth for imaging sub-surface defects in microelectronic devices. \r\n\r\nThe educational and out-reach programs proposed are deigned to excite high school level students to pursue careers in STEM and provide unique multidisciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in the area of photoacoustic imaging.",

Acoustic methods provide a nondestructive approach for the characterization of the dynamic elastic behavior of solids and for probing their interior structure. The velocity of the acoustic wave depends on the elastic properties of the solid medium. Defects in a solid such as grain boundaries, dislocations, voids, etc, impede the propagation of acoustic waves leading to wave scattering and attenuation. Measurement of the wave velocity and amplitude can be used for the characterization of the elastic properties and imaging the microstructure. Photoacoustic techniques are particularly suitable for characterization of local properties because they use laser sources for generation and detection of high frequency (GHz) acoustic waves. The technique is suitable for the characterization of elastic properties of small scale structures and for microscale defect metrology applications. The amount of spatial information from a sample microstructure that can be obtained using a photoacoustic measurement is fundamentally limited by size of the probe laser and the acoustic wavelength. Typically, a light source cannot be focused to a spot size that is smaller than half its wavelength, using conventional optical components. Using a probe light source in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the probe spot size is close to 1 micrometer.
