 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program, Julie Arslanoglu of New York's Metropolitan Museum, of Art and John Loike of Columbia University seek to develop and improve methodologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection, identification, and localization of proteins and gums in art. Identification of these diverse biological materials (found in paints, coatings, and adhesives) will improve understanding essential for informed treatment, preservation, and authentication. The approaches developed will improve specificity in identification, enabling for example distinction between use of whole egg or only egg white as a gilding adhesive, or the use of sturgeon?s glue or goat?s milk explicitly as a paint binder.  Parallel mass spectrometric studies should enable identification of specific targets for improved characterization, and aptamer technology is being used to identify organic molecules in art.  The complementary nature of these techniques is being explored.  Finally, the localization of proteins and polysaccharide in paint or coating layers in cross-sections is being characterized using Surface Enhanced Raman (SERS)-labeled antibodies. This will greatly enhance knowledge of an artist?s technique as well as conservation treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to important insights into the preservation and authentication of cultural heritage objects, methods developed in these studies should contribute to other fields affected by similar limitations (low concentration of highly degraded organic materials with interfering inorganic ions), such as environmental monitoring or forensic analysis. The research entails teaching and training of students and postdocs interested in the science of preservation of cultural heritage. Results will be widely disseminated to the general public through websites and presentations in the museum setting, as well as scholarly conferences and publications.",
