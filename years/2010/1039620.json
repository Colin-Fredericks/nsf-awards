 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras is awarded a grant to support participation in an \"Ideas Lab\" workshop focused on innovations in biological imaging and visualization.  Modern biological research is increasingly enabled and empowered by enhanced imaging technologies.  Very high-resolution microscopy systems to continental-scale imaging platforms combined with high-throughput data streams produce an enormous challenge for research involving image-based data.  The outcomes of this workshop are aimed at addressing and improving our ability to analyze, interpret, compare, and represent biological image data for dissemination or meta-analysis.  A range of interdisciplinary scientists will be invited to participate. Participants will be selected on the basis of preliminary proposals describing their interests, experience, and expectations that attend the formation of collaborative research teams at the Ideas Lab.  The interdisciplinary, collaborative, and immersive workshop is expected to result in the formulation of project ideas that address challenges of using image-based data in biological research.  After the Ideas Lab, selected project ideas will be invited to submit full proposals to the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nSubstantial efforts are directed towards the constitution of a participant group with diversified interests, expertise, affiliations, and demographics to ensure the greatest potential for identifying appropriate image processing challenges and creative project prospective for solving the challenges. The utility to a broader community of researchers has transformative potential to increase the rate of data analysis, synthesis, and dissemination that make image based data broadly useful.  Positive impacts on research are coupled to societal benefit of enhanced and accelerated research programs.  In addition, the opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral training during the conduct of the projects identified at the Ideas Lab workshop will help to foster the generation of a broadly trained cadre of interdisciplinary scientists able to apply their expertise across multiple fields of inquiry.",
