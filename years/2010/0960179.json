Apkarian and colleagues Rachel Martin, Reginald M. Penner and Eric Potma from the Department of Chemistry at the University of California-Irvine (UCI) will acquire a confocal Raman microscope to facilitate research at the NSF Center for Chemical Innovation on Chemistry at the Space-Time Limit and the UCI Center for Solar Energy. The instrument will be broadly utilized for the molecular characterization of fabricated novel materials, nano-structured devices for solar cells, single molecule devices based on nano-tube and nano-wire platforms, nano-catalysts, polycrystalline hydrates and protein aggregates. These are all examples of heterogeneous specimens in which molecular composition and function greatly vary with space.\r\n\r\nA confocal Raman microscope is a highly flexible instrument, principally used for the non-destructive chemical characterization of heterogeneous specimens. Raman spectra allow the identification of molecular structure and environment. The confocal Raman microscope produces images of specimens, consisting of spectra obtained with a spatial resolution of 1 micrometer. The instrument will be an integral part teaching and research activities of two research centers and will in addition serve the broader research communities at UCI.\r\n",
