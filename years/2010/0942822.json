Students and consultants with visual impairments are participating in the development and testing of different techniques for presenting screen information and for allowing interactions with simulations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The immediate goal is the development of a set of techniques that will allow participation of a more diverse set of students in inquiry-based biology labs, including visually impaired students for whom most traditional biology labs are inaccessible. Ultimately, this focused project should help improve simulated laboratories for all students.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact: The techniques being developed are breaking down some of the challenges facing those with visual impairments in the pursuit of scientific careers. In addition to directly benefiting the students who use the Simbiotic labs, the results of this project will be published in both technical and non-technical forms to inform and inspire other educational software developers.\r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported by funds from the Research in Disabilities Education program and the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Emerging Frontiers Division.",
