 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to conduct a workshop in Washington, DC, February 24-26, 2010, to discuss and address uncertainty and risk in machining and related manufacturing operations. The majority of models currently used to support manufacturing decision making are deterministic. Results produced by these models often provide only rough guidance for many manufacturing decisions and, thus, many manufacturing decision makers rely heavily on rules of thumb and extreme conservatism. Such behavior often results in considerable economic loss to the manufacturer. The key notion underlying this workshop is that rigorous mathematical treatment of uncertainty and decision making under uncertainty and risk can provide substantial economic benefit to the industry and enhance the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. The Intellectual Merit of this workshop is based on its goal to broaden the perspective on engineering decision making from one of applied science and problem solving, which does not rely on the mathematics of prediction and decision theory, to one that does incorporate these rigorous mathematics.\r\n\r\nWhile this workshop is focused on manufacturing with a concentration on machining, the findings of the workshop could have profound effects that permeate all of engineering practice. The Broader Impact of this workshop includes the economic benefit to the manufacturing sector, which will come about from improved decision making. It will also provide a new perspective on engineering decision making in general that will eventually influence both engineering practice and engineering education.",
