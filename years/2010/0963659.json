 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boise State University has created the STEM Central STATION (Strategic Transformation Aligning Teaching, Immersion, Outreach and kNowledge) to increase the scope, efficiency and effectiveness of NSF-supported STEM programs on campus, and catalyze the transformation of STEM institutional culture for students and faculty.  Boise State is transforming from a focus on high-quality teaching and learning to excellence in teaching, learning and research, making it an ideal \"laboratory\" to study institutional change related to STEM education.  Exceptional growth in STEM enrollment (32% over four years) and research funding (32% in 2009) converge to provide optimal timing for STEM education transformation. \r\n\r\nThe STEM Central STATION builds upon current STEM programs (LSAMP, MSP, Noyce, STEP, S-STEM, GK-12, and Idaho EPSCoR) by providing value added activities including: 1) a campus hub for STEM resources, research and programs, 2) a peer Learning Facilitators program that supports all the NSF STEM programs, 3) a STEM Community Seminar Series to foster interdisciplinary research, teaching and student support, and 4) STEM pedagogy workshops and research groups for faculty.  The STATION focuses on critical junctures for students and faculty and STEM research and evaluation. Overall goals of the STATION are to: \r\n     -  Facilitate and achieve STEM students' transitions through academic and cognitive critical junctures; \r\n     -  Increase STEM faculty appreciation for and implementation of student-centered pedagogy and inclusion of students in research, particularly for faculty involved with NSF STEM programs; \r\n     -  Conduct research on institutional transformation and evaluate program impact on STEM student satisfaction, retention, and completion, and faculty engagement in learning about STEM pedagogy; and\r\n     -  Provide a model for other metropolitan universities undergoing similar transformations. \r\n\r\nThe STEM Central STATION is grounded in literature regarding learning theories and institutional change, with an emphasis on concepts of self-authorship. The evaluation plan of the STATION offers a case study of a metropolitan university in transition to a research university, while continuing to value and advance quality teaching and learning.  The outcomes of the project are amplifying the results of the NSF STEM programs at Boise State, which include emphases on students from minority and underrepresented groups (particularly LSAMP, STEP and EPSCoR), serving low income and first-generation students, women, and Latinos/as, whose regional population has recently more than doubled.  The Service Learning component of the Learning Facilitators training course provides outreach to K-12 students and teachers, enabling expansion of STEM outreach in K-12 classrooms.  With strong commitments from the university president and leadership of resources, graduate assistants and space, the project implementation plan includes strategies to phase out grant support and transition to university support to sustain the STATION after the grant period.",

The LA program which grew from a pilot of nine LAs covering five courses in the 2010-11 academic year to 29 LAs serving a total of 101 sections in the 2015-16 academic year. The LA program achieves, on average, a .47 higher grade point average (spring 2016 data) among student participants, AND it contributes to professional and identity development of LAs themselves, and provides sponsoring faculty a gateway to implementing additional student-led learning and high-impact practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An example of institutional integration that started with the NSF STEM education grants and expanded across other grants and disciplines is the team&rsquo;s advocacy for undergraduate research communities and the creation of the campus-wide Summer Research Community (SRC). The first year of the SRC, 2011, involved about 90 students and 15 faculty. Members of the SRC team spun off an Idaho Conference on Undergraduate Research committee and expanded the poster session to a statewide undergraduate research conference. In 2016, this conference was attended by 210 undergraduate students from 36 institutions in Idaho and beyond, and 130 faculty, academic staff, and industry representatives. Our research about this program indicates that participation in an interdisciplinary research community can increase students&rsquo; identity development as a professional in their own field and provides connection and exposure to other disciplines&rsquo; professionals and research methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faculty communities have been a centerpiece of the STEM Station efforts to build faculty interdisciplinary connections and capacity in STEM education research and application of evidence-based pedagogy. The essence of the STEM Station impact on interdisciplinary faculty community building was summarized by external evaluators: &ldquo;Perhaps the biggest impact of the STEM Station was, as described by interviewees &lsquo;connecting faculty&rsquo; and &lsquo;creating synergy&rsquo; among faculty.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With support from the STEM Station team, the Provost/PI advocated for inclusion of STEM in the university&rsquo;s 2012-2017 strategic plan, which included a specific strategy in the plan to &ldquo;increase student recruitment, retention and graduate in STEM degrees.&rdquo; In 2011, Boise State compared the proportion of its graduates in STEM fields against the national average and set a goal to match it within five years. By 2015, Boise State met this goal, two years earlier than planned. Recognizing the centrality of assessment, one of the first staff positions added to the Institute for STEM and Diversity Initiatives was a data analyst serving the entire campus and dedicated to providing standard and customized data for research, publication, and other university needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most ambitious goal of the STEM Station was to create a more <em>permanent</em> center that would continue to guide transformation and adapt to changing needs of students, faculty, community, workforce trends and national priorities. In years three and four, plans were developed for the Institute for STEM and Diversity Initiatives (ISDI) &ndash; a campus resource that would carry on the spirit of the STEM Station while integrating it with the driving need to improve the university&rsquo;s outreach and support of its students and faculty from traditionally under-represented and under-served groups. Rather than settling for an office hidden in the organizational chart of the university, the leadership team aimed high and created an Institute in the Office of the Provost &ndash; in Idaho, this required approval of the State Board of Education, showing a real commitment to investing in this future path.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond sustaining specific initiatives, the creation of ISDI has allowed the mission to grow to creating an active climate of inclusive excellence in STEM at Boise State.
