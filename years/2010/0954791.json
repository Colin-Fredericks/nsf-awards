Willer\r\nUniversity of South Carolina\r\n\r\nThis research tests theory that places three contrasting actors: an individualist, prosocial, and competitor in the positions of two exchange networks. Individualists are actors who rationally seek to maximize payoffs only to self. Prosocials are equally rational but seek to maximize payoffs to self and other(s) while minimizing payoff differences. Competitors are also rational actors, but they seek to maximize the difference between payoffs to self and to other(s). Placing all combinations of the three actors in dyads and three-actor power structures generates highly contrasting predictions for interaction processes and outcomes. This research will experimentally test those predictions. \r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACTS: The broader impact of this research is that if the theory of this proposal is supported, it will reject exchange theory's justification for using only the individualist actor and thereby call for a wide-ranging change in the way that exchange theory is formulated in sociology, game theory and economics.",
