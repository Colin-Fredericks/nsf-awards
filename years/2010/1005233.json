 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the North Carolina State University contribution to the Ultracold Neutron asymmetry A (UCNA) experiment.  The goal of the UCNA experiment is to provide a high precision measurement of neutron beta-decay through a determination of the beta-asymmetry.  The beta-asymmetry, known as \"A\", is the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the emission direction of the electron following beta-decay of the neutron, and is very sensitive to the value of the axial coupling constant in the charged weak interaction.  This constant is a fundamental parameter governing the strength of the weak interaction, is an important target for lattice calculations, and is an input parameter in spin-structure studies of the nucleon.  It is also of importance in astrophysics, being a critical input for energy generation in the sun and in fixing the magnitude of the neutron lifetime. The proposed measurements, if successful, will improve the precision of the beta-asymmetry over the most precise current experiments, and provide a value for the axial form factor competitive with the most precise current measurements of the neutron lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe UCNA experiment is unique, in that it is the first experiment to measure angular correlations in neutron decay using polarized ultracold neutrons (UCN). UCN have significant advantages for the control of systematic uncertainties intrinsic to angular correlations measurements, but experiments which use them have been limited by the available densities of UCN.  The UCNA experiment, uses a dedicated solid deuterium source, also the first of it's kind, coupled to a spallation target for the 800 MeV proton beam in Area B of at Los Alamos. This source now produces UCN densities of about 1/cc, comparable to densities in experiments at the Institut Laue Langevin in Grenoble, France (the strongest UCN source in the world), with further upgrades on the way. The experimental facility developed for the UCNA experiment can potentially be extended to several other neutron beta-decay observables (such as the lifetime, and angular correlations sensitive to new tensor and scalar interactions) also under development in this project. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research stems in part from the fundamental impact of our planned measurements on the fields of nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics. The source development program also contributes to the broader impact of the project, potentially expanding the reach of our fundamental symmetries experiments, and by potentially shifting neutron and nuclear experiments back onto the university campus.  Proof-of-principle tests of a UCN source constructed at the PULSTAR reactor at NCSU will be carried out in the first year of this project, permitting an assessment of the possible impact for these next-generation UCN sources in nuclear physics rearch.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project  \"Beta-Decay Measurements with Ultracold Neutrons\" had in its outcomes several major acomplishments, with the three most signficant being the completion and publication of two updates to our measurements of the beta asymmetry with the UCNA experiment and our publication of a detailed assessment of the performance of the ultracold neutron source we have constructed at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE), now one of the strongest sources in the world.\n\nThe neutron decays into a proton, electron and an antineutrino.  The beta asymmetry is the angular correlation between the initial neutron spin and the outgoing electron momentum.  Measurements of this asymmetry provide the most precise determination of one of the two, fundamental coupling constants that determine the strength of the charged weak interaction, called the \"axial\" coupling constant.  This quantity is important for high precision predictions of the rate at which the sun produces energy, neutrino cross sections, and searches for physics beyond the current standard model of particle physics.\n\nWe approach our measurement differently than traditional angular correlation measurements with neutrons, because we do not use a cold or thermal neutron beam.  Instead we use ultracold neutrons (UCNs), which are neutrons moving more slowly than about 8 m/s and give us new handles on two of the challenges for these measurements: how to polarize the neutrons and how to keep background signals produced by the neutrons as small as possible.  What makes UCNs remarkable is the fact that they reflect from many naterial surfaces, and can be stored in material vessels or magnetic traps for many minutes (the neutrons spontaneously decay with a time constant of about 880 s, so that puts an upper limit on the storage time). \n\nUCN are guided into our decay vessel much as a gas might be guided, bouncing off the surfaces of guides as they exit our source, go through a very strong magnetic field region in our polarizer/spin-flipper apparatus, and then enter the decay vessel inside of a magnetic spectrometer.   The kinetic energy of the UCN are so low (below about 240 neV in our experiment) that the high field region in the polarizer/AFP magnet creates a potential barrier for one of the two spin states of the neutron due to the interaction of the magnetic  moment with the field.  The potential energy barrier is about 60 neV/T, so a strong field can reject all UCN in the spin-state that is repelled by the magnetic field.   This leads to essentially 100 percent poalrized UCN in the high field region.  After the neutron passes through this region, the almost perfect polarization slowly degrades due to various processes in the guide system, so we must measure the polarization to extract a high precision value for the beta asymmetry, but we find the polarization stays of 99 percent, even after the UCN have been stored in our decay volume for more than 20 s.   Because UCNs move slowly, they have a relatvely high chance of decaying in our spectrometer compared to the traditional beams experiments, making the neutron-produced backgrounds easier to control as well, since far fewer neutrons need to be sent through the system to get the same decay signal.\n\nWhen a neutron decays in the measurement spectrometer, the emitted electrons are captured in a 1 T magnetic field and spiral to detectors situated parallel and antiparallel to the field.  The difference in the rates in these detectors is proportional to the beta asymmetry.  Because the beta-asymmetry changes sign when you flip the neutron spin, we actually measure the ratio in each detector of the rates with the neutron spin parallel and antiparallel to the spectrometer magnetic field.  This has the advantage of almost eliminating dependence on the detector efficiencies.\n\nWe reported on two high precision measurements of the asymmetry, with the second just below the percent level.  The asymmetry is parameterized by the coefficient A,..."
