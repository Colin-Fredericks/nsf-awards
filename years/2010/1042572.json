The meeting discussions will advance the leading edge of the research by bringing together researchers from the different disciplines, to define and answer their emerging needs of the next decades.\r\n\r\nBroader impact:\r\nThe Integrated Photonics research Topical Meeting has been the premier forum addressing the technology since 1972. It gathers both theoretical and experimental international experts in the field. The meeting offers a small platform conducive to direct dialog and discussions in identifying novel directions in photonics integration, enabled in particular by novel silicon and nano photonic technologies. This research covers multidisciplinary fields of science and impacts a broad range of applications, from the information technology to biomedical sensing.\r\nThis Topical Meeting of the Optical Society of America will contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.",
