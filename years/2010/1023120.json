 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: This project builds on the joint work of two projects: The Paradigms in Physics Project, a complete redesign of the physics major, and the Vector Calculus Bridge Project, an effort to bridge the gap between the mathematics and physics of vector calculus. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is on the upper-division content in the area of electromagnetism. The goal is to increase the usability of the materials in four distinct ways: improving the effectiveness of the classroom materials; continuing development of a resource wiki, including descriptions of sequence of activities; adding narratives and video of classroom practice; and creating a modular online text. Both the text and the wiki are designed to be modular, allowing maximum flexibility in use. Both also contain a \"meta\" layer extensively documenting multiple pathways through the individual modules. The wiki further encourages faculty users to design and document alternatives, tailored to the needs of their own students. Pilot versions of all four pieces have been tested by instructors both at Oregon State University and elsewhere; extensive feedback is guiding further development. \r\n\r\nThis project includes an established team, an experienced science education researcher, recent adopters of the materials, a National Advisory Panel, and an external evaluator. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The primary goal of this project is to provide online resources to a large audience, with most of the resources freely accessible to the general public. In the long run, the materials generated by this project can be used by many students and faculty well beyond the immediate adopters, both in the classroom and for professional development of TAs and other teachers. Furthermore, project research results and case studies are being disseminated to the education research community, not only on the project website, but also through presentations at conferences and publication in appropriate refereed journals.",

Written materials produced by these projects include more than 250 group activities and class notes for 20 separate courses.\n\nThe Paradigms in Physics Project completely redesigned the upper-division physics major in order to better present the content the way professional physicists organize their own expert knowledge.  In addition to a rearrangement of content, grouping topics by paradigmatic ideas rather than traditional subdisciplines, the junior-year courses are short but intensive, with an emphasis on active engagement.\n\nThis redesigned curriculum is intended to remedy drawbacks of conventional curricula by using a variety of pedagogical techniques and by applying insights into the cognitive structures that are being constructed by advanced students.  While some of these techniques are inspired by those that have been successful in lower-division physics instruction, many are new.  Upper-division students must deal with problems of greater complexity and must learn to see patterns that cross the boundaries of traditional physics disciplines.
