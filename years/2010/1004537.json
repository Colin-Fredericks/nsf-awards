 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  An award was made to the University of Michigan to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 undergraduate students per year, for the summers of 2011-2012.  Students will  participate in either laboratory or field studies in the general areas of ecology and evolutionary biology on the University of Michigan campus or at faculty research sites.  In this program, faculty and advanced graduate students in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology will be paired with individual students and guide them through the process of developing a research project. During their training, students will carry out required laboratory or field work, write up a final report and present their results at a symposium held in August at the University of Michigan.  Subject matter may range from, for example, field work on changing mammal distributions in northern Michigan to the mathematical modeling of the expansion of malaria due to global warming, depending on student interest and availability of specific mentors.  In addition, students will attend a workshop dedicated to training in scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research.  First and second year students will be recruited especially from minority-serving institutions through mass mailings and web advertising.  Student progress will be continually assessed by the mentor and an advisory committee over web-based conferencing during the active phase of the research, and a final evaluation of the program will be conducted at the close of the summer session each year.  An important goal of the program is to increase diversity in ecology and evolutionary biology, and the program will emphasize the promotion of connections among students underrepresented in biology, thereby furthering the development of a diverse graduate student community and research faculty  For further information contact  John Vandermeer (jvander@umich.edu), Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,  University of Michigan, or visit http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/undergraduates/reu.html.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes report for ED-QUE2ST\n\nThis Research Experience for Undergraduate Program was designed to provide research opportunities in ecology and evolutionary for under-represented minorities after their first or second year in college.  We recruited students from a wide range of colleges across the U.S. and provided a structured, 10-week summer program in research programs of faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan.  Students worked in research laboratories on the university campus or at research sites in northern Michigan or in Mexico.  The long-term goal of this program is to increase the participation of under-represented minorities in graduate programs and faculty positions in departments of ecology and evolution.\n\nThe pilot phase of the ED-QUE2ST Program ran for three years, with three cohorts of students.  From 2011 to 2013, the number of applicants increased from 10 to 45, and the number of participants increased from 6 to 11 (our target number was 10 students in each cohort), for a total of 24 participants in three years.  Our typical ED-QUE2ST student was a rising sophomore with no prior research experience and little academic preparation in science beyond coursework taken in the freshman year.    \n\nThe ED-QUE2ST Program ran for 10 weeks from late May to the end of July.  After arriving in Ann Arbor, Michigan, students had several days of orientation and then began work with faculty or doctoral-student mentors in their research laboratories.  Students and mentors selected a research project for the student to conduct over the next nine weeks.  Students gathered data, analyzed results, prepared an oral presentation, and wrote a research paper about their research projects.  The EDQUEST coordinators met weekly with all the students as a group to discuss selected readings, progress on research projects, and housing.  In the last week of the program, students gave oral presentations in a symposium to which the entire department was invited.  Students provided feedback and evaluations to the coordinators of the program during the middle of the program, at the end of the program, and one or more years following the program.  From year to year, the ED-QUE2ST coordinators modified the publicity, recruitment, and logistics of the program in response to useful feedback from both students and mentors.\n\nCoordinators, research mentors, and ED-QUE2ST student participants all concluded that the program was successful in introducing participants to the research process, enhancing student interest and confidence in their research ability, and increasing the likelihood of the students applying to graduate school in ecology and evolutionary biology.   Students reported gains in problem-solving, understanding the research process, and clarifying their future academic goals.  Based on the success of the pilot program and with suggestions for improvements in hand, the coordinators have applied for another grant from the Research Experience for Undergraduates Program to continue the ED-QUE2ST program for another three years.\n\nThree accompanying photographs depict activities of ED-QUE2ST between 2011 and 2013.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John H Vandermeer"
