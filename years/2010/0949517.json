 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFungi represent a poorly understood and neglected group of organisms that are rich in scientific research potential. An explanation of the roles of fungi in applied research requires baseline knowledge of their diversity, ecological roles in nature, and evolutionary history. Here the investigators will produce baseline data for Australian Inocybaceae. The mushroom family Inocybaceae is ideal for a revisionary synthesis because of its cosmopolitan distribution (including a highly diverse assemblage that occurs across tropical and temperate Australia), and its long evolutionary history of obligate symbioses with both tropical and temperate plants. Integration of austral tropical and temperate taxa is important to understand historical processes that have shaped current distributions and diversification patterns. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of modern taxonomic revisionary methods, analytical studies of the evolutionary history of Inocybaceae over the past 65 million years will be performed to address hypotheses of broad biological appeal. This research will include collaborations between scientists from different continents and provide field and analytical training for two junior researchers. Results will be disseminated online and via monographs, journals, and conferences and forays involving scientists, students, and nature enthusiasts.\r\n\t\t \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
