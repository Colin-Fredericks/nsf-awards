Testing new classifiers for automatic indexing of polyphonic music, specifically those for the automatic classification of instrumental sound from recordings of orchestral music is difficult and involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty as to the outcome. If successful, the results may prove to be transformative and have significant impact on music information analysis.  The work will employ resources in the MIRAI database developed in an earlier NSF supported project.  The main MIRAI database contains about 1,000,000 musical instrument sounds, each represented as a vector of approximately 1,000 features.  Each instrument sound is identified and matched to a corresponding instrument.",
