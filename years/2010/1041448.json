A vegetation survey will be conducted in the summer and fall 2010 in order to provide ground truthing capability for the summer (snow off ) LiDAR data acquisition. This data acquisition is planned to cover the entire area of the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), as well as some area to the west of the VCNP that lies within the caldera boundaries and represents part of the headwaters to the Jemez River, but is nonetheless outside of the boundaries of VCNP.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to provide \"ground truthing\" by direct measurement at ground level, for comparison and calibration of LiDAR data acquisition of landscape topography.  LiDAR is an optical remote sensing technology that can measure the distance to, or other properties of a target by illuminating the target with light, using pulses emitted from a laser. \n\nIn 2010, a grant written by Dr. Qinghua Guo at UC Merced, permitted LiDAR to be employed at the six NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) in the US (see www.criticalzone.org for more information on the CZOs).  This data acquisition was invaluable in permitting the CZOs to characterize the topographic properties of the surface, including both bare earth elevations, and also vegetation structure and distribution.  In the case of the Jemez - Santa Catalina CZO (www.czo.arizona.edu), we employed two LiDAR flights.  One flight was flown in March 2010 at maximum snowpack and another was flown in July 2010 (now snowpack) in order to provide information on snow depth distribution, vegetation structure and bare earth elevations.\n\nHowever, in order to calibrate and validate the LiDAR data acquisition, it was necessary to ground-truth the LiDAR data through direct, ground based measurements of vegetation and snowpack.  The funding provided by the present NSF grant permitted this to be done in March and July of 2010 to assess snow depth and vegetation structure, respectively.  At both periods, teams of scientists and students were deployed to the field site in campaign mode to collect a wealth of plot-scale, field based data on (i) snow depth (in March) and (ii) vegetation structure (in July).  The resulting data sets contain a wealth of information on critical zone structure that is now being developed into manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon D Chorover"
