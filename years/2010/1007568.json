 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the dynamic and electrodynamic interactions between upper atmospheric regions using measurements acquired by an extensive suite of ground-based instrumentation located throughout the Caribbean.  Specifically, the research will focus on characterizing the development of neutral and electrodynamic irregularities related to sporadic, patchy layer formation in the lower (E-region) ionosphere, traveling ionospheric disturbances, and quasi-periodic irregularities associated with coupling between the ionospheric E- and F-regions.  Experimental investigation of these phenomena will utilize the incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in addition to active and passive optical remote sensing by Arecibo imagers and LIDAR systems.   Active experiments using the new Arecibo facility for ionospheric modification are also planned.  To supplement the Arecibo instrumentation, a set of coherent scatter radar imagers, one located on St. Croix and one to be deployed on the island of Dominica in the West Indies as part of the proposed work, will be used to locate plasma irregularities, identify their intermediate-scale structuring, and place them in the context of quantitative, ground-based measurements for the first time.   This project will result in a significant expansion of ground-based infrastructure in the Caribbean which will benefit both students and international collaborators.",
