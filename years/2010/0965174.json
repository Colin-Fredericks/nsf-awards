 "awd_abstract_narration": "0965174\r\nDatye\r\n\r\nCatalysis is a key technology for improving the quality of life while simultaneously reducing the adverse impact of human activities on the environment. The discovery of new catalytic processes and the improvement of existing ones have a major economic impact and it is estimated that 80%\r\nof the products of modern society go through a catalytic process at some point in their manufacture. Catalysis is also critically important for securing the national energy supply. \r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for the 2010 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Catalysis to be held at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire,\r\nfrom June 27 to July 2, 2010. This conference is traditionally held every 2 years and will bring together leading researchers from around the world to discuss their latest, most exciting work in catalysis. The 2010 conference \r\nis organized into session topics with a discussion leader who is a specialist in the particular field of catalysis. The topics for the 2010\r\nconference are listed below:\r\n. Alternative Feedstock For Chemicals And Fuels\r\n. Novel Catalytic Materials\r\n. 3D Imaging Of Catalysts\r\n. The Science Of Catalyst Synthesis\r\n. Engineering Of Catalysts For Exceptional Stability\r\n. Molecular Insights Through Theory\r\n. Spectroscopy, With Special Emphasis On Heterogeneous Catalysis In The Liquid Phase\r\n. Surface Science\r\n. Future Perspectives On Catalysis\r\n\r\nThis conference seeks to gather leading people in the field and to bring them into contact with each other and with younger graduate students, post-docs and\r\njunior faculty to seed new thoughts across catalysis. The secluded setting for the conference keeps the participants on site and  maximizes interactions and intellectual discourse and networking. The primary product is the summary and dispersal of ideas across the catalysis community.",
