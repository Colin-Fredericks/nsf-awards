Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. \r\n     \r\nThe proposal prototypes a new virtual environment, where based on new methods heterogeneous computing resources are integrated in the virtual world to mimic dynamic situations. The new data and dynamic situations are continuously evolving based on the availability of information from various sources, and thus updating the virtual world representation, which can be about disaster situation or large event of societal and environmental importance. The proposal combines methods to use cloud services, virtual world servers, compute accelerators and client systems ranging from multi-core desktops to mobile phones to build the virtual world test bed. The PIs are very well qualified to conduct the proposed research. The proposed activities have sufficient access to the necessary resources. \r\n\r\nThis project will allow for synthesis of best current practices in divergent areas of multicore computing, data assimilation models and knowledge representation while exposing areas requiring new approaches to better utilize emerging computing paradigms to solve urgent broad social needs. The work will be readily applicable to develop future event response situations, including natural or manmade disasters, e.g. recent Haiti earthquake. All three universities have active programs for female, international and African-American students and cooperative programs with local schools to encourage and mentor high school and undergraduates from underrepresented groups to go on to university and graduate school in science or engineering, including computer science. Results will be disseminated by reports and meetings. The developed software will be made available under the same public license as Google Android.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of Situation Awareness depends upon the ability to make sense of rapidly transforming knowledge of particular situations.  This information can have a wide range of quality and even be contradictory, yet it needs to be rapidly available to decision makers and responders.  Our work has furthered the capability to make readily available, complex visual information from very divergent sources.  Through our work on this project, we have developed the concept of \"Human Sensor Networks\" as a means of enriching the knowledge base from which critical decisions can be made to assist in dynamic, rapidly changing disasters such as oil spills. The concept of Human Sensor Networks views Social Media users as sensors deployed in the field, and the Social Media Content that they post as \"in-situ measurements\" in the field.  \n\n     We developed approaches to searching databases of large amounts of social media data to find relevant information for dynamic situations.  We developed approaches to ingesting the above data into virtual world simulations to create highly interactive, data rich, multi-user simulations that are able to be updated during runtime by data coming from external databases.  We demonstrated that geophysical data can be automatically extracted from Social Media sources. We also demonstrated how this Geophysical data extracted from Social Media outlets can be ingested into an oil spill trajectory model. Then we showed how it can be used to improve the trajectory model forecasts which are valuable for emergency responders in cases of natural and man-made disasters such as oil spills. Thus we developed the foundation for a framework for improving situational awareness in natural disasters.  As a result, we are currently working on expanding this foundation to build a fully functional system that will be transferred to operational environment of emergency responders.  To further guide the approaches to creating on-site observational data, we examined ways in which ubiquitous sensors &ndash; in the form of mobile phone digital cameras &ndash; should be optimized to aid in data gathering.  We have shown the surprising result that a general-purpose embedded processor may well be more power efficient than an application-specific image processor for certain image processing applications.  Furthermore, we have made a fundamental contribution to computer architecture of parallel systems via the pattern-based work that was a direct result of this project.\n\n     We worked with several events scenarios to develop and test our approaches: the Haitian earthquake of January 12, 2010; the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 20, 2010; and the 2011 T?hoku earthquake of March 11, 2011.  For each of these we developed approaches to search through social media databases such as flikr and twitter for metadata tags which would either mention these sites or have geolocation information.
