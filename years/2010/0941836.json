The team proposes to create a structured, in-depth, and hands-on course material in real-world information security problems like penetration testing and real-time intrusion analysis, defense, and recovery.\r\n\r\nThe project plans to eliminate a gap between the types of active learning environments needed to help undergraduates understand complex attacks and the static trace captures used in current labs. The team plans to investigate the network, systems, and management aspects of a standard for describing and encoding high-interaction hands-on information security training scenarios, and of a simulated network environment capable of supporting simulations of complex enterprise-class networks.\r\n\r\nSISMAT contains a comprehensive outreach program. It creates a repository of projects undertaken by SISMAT participants that is freely shared with the public. It also directly engages security researchers and industry experts as faculty mentors. Project personnel and student participants help forming a community of academics, professionals, and practitioners by supporting conferences like Annual Conference on Education in Information Security.",
