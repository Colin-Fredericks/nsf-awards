 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty to attend the 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Research at High Pressure to be held June 27 - July 2, 2010. This conference has been held for more than 50 years and owes it continued success to the active and diverse nature of scientific research that employs high pressures. This conference attracts leading researchers in physics, chemistry, materials and geo-sciences, as well as biology, who use and develop methods for the study of matter at extreme conditions. Invited talks at this year's conference will cover all of these topics and include the very latest advances in methods for predicting structures and properties of materials at very high pressures to practical chemistry applications at very moderate pressures. The conference places a special emphasis on providing an environment for interactions of young researchers with the leading experts in high pressure research. To help accomplish this we have a Young Investigators session as well as two additional special talks, named after pioneers in this research area, to be given by new researchers in this field. The award receives support from the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Earth Sciences.",
