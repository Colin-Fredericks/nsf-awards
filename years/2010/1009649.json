 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project centers on optical (visible-light) observations using large, ground-based telescopes, designed to maximally exploit the science return from the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT, an NSF-funded experiment at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, consists of a 10-meter diameter, millimeter-wave radio telescope designed to measure the subtle fluctuations in the brightness of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at multiple wavelengths. As part of its survey operations, the SPT is producing a list of possible galaxy clusters detected by the effect the hot, intra-cluster plasma has on the CBR. The size of this spectral distortion, known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, is independent of distance, offering the opportunity to inventory galaxy clusters in the universe, relatively free of the strong distance bias that affects other types of observations. In this project the collaborating team (from Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard University) will perform optical follow-up observations of the SPT cluster candidates, to confirm the existence of the clusters, to obtain their redshifts, and to identify the member galaxies. The team will make use of an array of existing instrumentation on the current suite of large telescopes, including PISCO, a multi-bandpass imaging camera developed with NSF support for the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope. The primary result of this work will be an unprecedented, volume-limited catalog of approximately 600 galaxy clusters. The full catalog of photometric and spectroscopic observations will be released to the astronomical community through a web-accessible archive using well-developed database architectures. These observations are intended to enable a wide variety of subsequent inquiries, including studies of galaxy evolution in different environments, efforts to further constrain cosmological parameters, and cluster mass measurements through gravitational lensing. The project will support the work of a postdoctoral fellow, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, and will be publicized through the Principal Investigators' close involvement with significant public-media projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nClusters of galaxies are the largest structures in the Universe.  They develop over cosmic time from small density enhancements in the first instant of the Big Bang.  Since the speed of light is finite, we can see back in time by looking out in distance: we see Sun as it was 8 minutes ago, the nearest stars as they were years ago, and we can see galaxies and clusters of galaxies as they were billions of years ago, and follow their development up to the present day.  Since the Universe is approximately uniform and isotropic, the distant structures we see are similar to, but younger than, the galaxies and clusters of galaxies near the Earth.  We can effectively observe the development of structure in the Universe.\n\nIn this project, we observed clusters of galaxies at optical and infrared wavelengths, and we completed and fielded an astronomical camera, the Parallel Image For Southern Cosmology Obsevations (PISCO), in order to confirm the existence and take the first images of clusters of galaxies detected by the South Pole Telescope.  In a project funded by the Office of Polar Programs, the South Pole Telescope has been surveying a large area of the southern sky (about 6% of the whole sky) at millimeter wavelengths, essentially very high frequency radio waves.  One of the results of this survey is the detection of galaxy cluster candidate regions, via the Sunyeav-Zel'dovich effect --- the hot gas in the galaxy clusters causes a shadow (about the angular size of a large lunar crater as seen from the Earth) in the Cosmic Microwave Background.  One important property of this shadow is that its detectability is approximately independent of distance to the cluster, so clusters at all redshifts between us and our event horizon (13.6 billion lightyears away) are detectable, provided they are sufficiently massive.  These South Pole Telescope cluster candidates then need to be verified and observed at optical and infrared wavelengths.  In this project, we carried out this optical follow-up and detected 677 clusters of galaxies, 415 of which were new detections.\n\nWith this comprehensive catalog of galaxy clusters, we have obtained new scientific results.  The number of galaxy clusters that form, as a function of cluster mass and look-back time, is sensitive to the nature of the cosmos.  We compare our catalog of clusters with computer simulations of the development of structure in the Universe.  We can pick the simulation that best fits the observed data, and thereby constrain the properties of the Universe.  Our data is particularly sensitive to the \"bias parameter\" &sigma;8, which measures the clustering of matter, and to the \"equation of state of the Dark Energy\" and its history, w0 and wa . These constants relate to the mysterious Dark Energy force that pervades the entire Universe and is not well understood in modern physics.  Our data also sets constraints on the nature of neutrinos &mdash; in the early Universe, neutrinos are relativistic particles, moving near the speed of light, but as the Universe expands the neutrinos cool and become a non-relativistic component of the Dark Matter: this affects the growth of clusters of galaxies in a measurable way, and depends on the still unknown rest mass of neutrino species.  We have published our catalog of galaxy clusters and made our data available in a public, searchable database.\n\nAs part of our work on this project, we installed the PISCO camera on the Magellan 6.5 meter diameter Clay telescope and got it to work to its design specifications.  PISCO incorporates a novel optical element that we developed in collaboration with the optics firm Barr Associates.  PISCO uses enhanced software that improves the efficiency of astronomical observations.  PISCO is a general-purpose fast imaging camera that will be useful for many astronomical purposes for many years to come.  We have already used PISCO in a collaboration to detect an Earth-mass exoplanet, GJ1132b, that is only 40 lightyears aw..."
