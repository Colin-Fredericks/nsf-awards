 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technology to harvest electricity from wind energy\r\nis now sufficiently advanced to make entire cities powered\r\nby wind a reality. High-quality, short-term forecasts of\r\nwind speed are vital for making this a more reliable energy\r\nsource. The investigator proposes to study two topics in\r\nwind power forecasting, develop relevant methodologies and\r\nanalyze their corresponding properties and performances both\r\ntheoretically and through Monte Carlo simulations studies.\r\nThe new methods will be applied to a first-of-a-kind testbed\r\nwind dataset from northeastern US. The first topic concerns\r\nshrinkage and selection of space-time variables in various\r\nmodels for wind power forecasting. The investigator proposes\r\nto combine techniques such as partial least squares and the\r\nadaptive lasso with space-time correlation information that\r\nnaturally arises among the predictor variables in the wind\r\nforecasting models. The second topic concerns realistic\r\nforecast evaluations in the context of wind power forecasting.\r\nThe investigator proposes to develop new loss functions that\r\nare economically relevant for wind power and study their\r\nproperties and their use in building and evaluating forecasting\r\nmodels in the wind energy arena.\r\n\r\nThe primary impact of this project is that the new methods\r\nfor wind power forecasting will provide valuable tools to\r\napplied practitioners in wind farming. There is an obvious\r\nneed for statisticians to be involved in such important\r\nproblems related to renewable and clean energies for the\r\nwell-being of our society. In particular, the research \r\ntopics address crucial and major challenges for advancing \r\nthe use of energy from wind.",
