The 2010 Annual SACNAS Conference will take place in Anaheim, California from September 30 to October 2. The Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Sciences (SACNAS) provides a forum for networking between STEM postdocs and faculty and administrators from a wide range of institutions. The conference will include sessions on developing individual professional plans, writing peer-review articles, and searching for academic jobs. In addition, there will be an exhibit booth and the piloting of a symposium on faculty diversity interventions that will include advance graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty. A reception supported by SACNAS, where postdocs will present research posters, will be another opportunity for networking. The activities at the conference will be supported by online resources before and after it takes place. The goal of this project will be to nurture future diverse STEM faculty that is comfortable working with a diverse group of students.",
