 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to advance personalize learning, one of the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges, by creating resources to develop self-directed, life-long learning.  The project is based on research in learning styles, motivation, life-long learning, and self-regulated learning.  The project identifies four characteristics of life-long learners, and seeks to develop these characteristics through on-line learning modules, having students create learning materials, and performing research on the effectiveness of these interventions.  Since life-long learning is an outcome required by most higher education accreditation agencies, development of these resources may be widely adopted, and thus have potentially large impact in higher education.",
