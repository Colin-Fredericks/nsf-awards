 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to compile and provide information (e.g., species name, location, habitat, and flowering time) from California-collected vascular plant specimens held at 19 herbaria in California and at Harvard University (repository of many older California specimens). The plants targeted are those that dominate California habitats and those most imperiled by threats to biodiversity (including climate change). Specimen information will be available online at the Consortium of California Herbaria (CCH) Web portal (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium). The project will also accomplish the seamless provision of data on California plants held by the museums of SEINet (Southwest Environmental Information Network) via the CCH web site as a step toward building regional and national consortia.\r\n\t\r\nThis project provides tangible benefits to the public, students of all levels, and the research community. Specimen data will be downloadable so that anyone can use the information to pursue interests and questions (e.g., understanding current plant distributions, identifying plants of a particular place, predicting future plant migrations). Undergraduate students will be involved extensively with data entry, providing them with skills and training applicable to future professional pursuits. This project is a major step toward building a United States virtual plant museum that provides information on the distribution of plants nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.",

Each specimen has a label that says where and when the specimen was collected. Herbarium specimens housed in herbaria worldwide provide a record of the historical distribution of plant species. This five-year project was carried out by numerous herbaria in California, and there were five Principal Investigators. All data contributed to this project is jointly displayed at the Consortium of California Herbaria website at UC Berkeley. The main goal of this project was to support the national effort to predict, understand, and monitor the effects of climate change. To this end, the Consortium of California Herbaria member herbaria databased herbarium specimen label data for species that will be most affected by climate change in California (we called these \"target taxa\"), and we georeferenced (added latitude/longitude coordinates) to as many of those specimen records as possible. The target taxa are dominants in California habitats (i.e., woody plants and grasses) and those most imperiled by threats to biodiversity, including climate change (i.e., alpine plants and those listed by the California Native Plant Society as of conservation concern). At UC Davis, we ended up databasing all of our California-collected specimens, not just target taxa; we databased approximately 61,000 specimens. The georeferencing part of the project was done by dividing up the counties of California among herbaria. At UC Davis, we were responsible for georeferencing all the contributed specimens from 15 counties, and we ended up georeferencing over 60,000 specimen records. The work was mainly carried out by 25 UC Davis undergraduate student employees with oversight by the curator of the herbarium. A number of these students were mentored in herbarium specimen curation and field collection and have gone on in a career in botany. In total, the Consortium dataset now totals over 2 million records, and it is a powerful source of data on California plant species distributions used by scientists in many different disciplines. The Consortium of California Herbaria search engine at http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/consortium/ allows users to easily access the entire dataset generated by this grant. Many agencies, non-profits, and botanists all over the United States, both professional and amateur, access our data and use it for their work, including analyzing plant distributions, adding rare plant locations to state databases, and building floristic checklists. The dataset is also made available to the non-profit data aggregator CalFlora http://www.calflora.org) which is used heavily by California botanists to identify plants. The dataset is also provided to iDigBio, a data aggregator which is funded by NSF (https://www.idigbio.org/portal), and the international data aggregator GBIF (<a href=\"http://www.gbif.org/\">http://www.gbif.org/</a>).
