 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve the educational experience of cybersecurity students around the nation by piloting an environment in which they can obtain the valuable hands-on experience in defending digital assets. The proposed system is a remotely accessible isolated lab environment, allowing thousands of students from a wide range of institutions to use this facility to enrich their educational experience. The prototype system has been developed and tested at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and is replicated at the United States Military Academy at West Point (USMA) and a number of other academic institutions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed system provides a vital component to the study of computer security topics, namely the ability to gain hands-on experience, similar to the experience that biology, chemistry, or geology students gain in their course labs. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative metrics gathered help to inform both the development and delivery methods for new exercises and, in general, the hands-on approach to computer security education.\r\n\r\nThis project provides access to state-of-the-art computer security lab facilities and materials to a wide range of intuitions, and, consequently, provides substantially more students with empirical learning opportunities in this critically important field. This isolated Remote Access Virtualized Environment (RAVE) is used to help meet the national need for experienced cybersecurity workforce by providing access to these novel educational opportunities for students around the nation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project was to provide an infrastructure in which educational institutions can create, deploy, share, and update computer security related hands-on lab exercises.  This infrastructure allows faculty members to focus on teaching rather than re-creating content that already exists, and allows students to gain experience by working through a range of high-quality hands-on lab exercises.\n\nThe primary goal of RAVE has been to offer high-quality, hands-on, computer security exercises for students.  In order to achieve this, we had to deploy several geographically disperse nodes to host these VMs.  To date, we have 6 nodes with a combined total of 2560 GB RAM, 618 GHz CPU, and 45 TB disk storage.  The resources in each node are on gigabit networks, with a low-bandwidth VPN serving as a backbone between nodes.  The nodes are managed by VMware\u00c6s vSphere suite and through various custom written systems that interface with the provided API.  Given the nature of the virtualization technology being used, RAVE can easily support over 10,000 concurrent VMs as we have already done in the past.\n\nRAVE is not simply a hosting platform for resources, but is also a resource sharing environment where one instructor or organization can provide materials that are made available to all other RAVE users.  This has been achieved through the creation of scenarios &ndash; sets of VMs on a given virtual network with supplementary instructional materials &ndash; that were developed through this effort or an existing NSF funded effort.  Having this repository of scenarios on a wide range of topics allows an instructor to easily test out a new scenario and then use it within their class all without having to deal with the complexity of administrating a local environment or developing the exercises themselves.\n\nOver the its duration, RAVE deployments have been made for over 4,000 students at nearly 100 institutions across the nation totaling approximately 25,000 VMs, and in many cases students utilized RAVE resources in more than one class. The institutions utilizing RAVE are primarily those that lack the infrastructure or personnel required to manage their own local physical infrastructure.  This centralized management allowed for RAVE to provide high-quality materials at a significantly reduced cost than would have otherwise been possible, and ultimately allows a greater number of students to experience first-hand the concepts covered within their course curriculum.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kara L Nance"
