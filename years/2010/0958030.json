 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Colorado Boulder is to provide partial support for the attendance of graduate students, postdocs and young faculty members at a symposium on ?Engineering Biomaterials for Regenerative Medicine?. This symposium will be held as part of the Materials Research Society Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts from November 30 to December 4, 2009. Scientific themes of the conference include: a) bio-inspired scaffold design, synthesis and modification; 2) interactions between stem cell and materials; 3) nanotechnology including nanoparticles and fibers; and (5) development of new technology for biomedical applications and microfabricated devises. The\r\nobjectives of the proposed conference are: a) to highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis and application of materials for fundamental understanding of cell biology and practical applications in tissue engineering; b) to provide a platform for material scientists, bioengineers, and biologists from academia and industry to establish connections, collaborations and exchange of ideas; and c) to facilitate opportunities for women, minority and junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to present their research results, and establish collaborations and interactions for future research.\r\n\r\nBroader impact of the conference is to bring together students, junior scientists and leading researchers from USA and abroad to present their recent research. The conference is expected to advance the knowledge base for design and development of new materials and technologies in the field of tissue engineering. In addition, this conference is expected to create interactions and collaborations among current and future researchers from academia and industry in this field. \r\n",
