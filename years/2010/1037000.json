 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on high-latitude cloud and aerosol properties via observations conducted at the Arctic Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (AFARS), operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  AFARS supports of two polarization lidars, a polarimetric Doppler W-band radar, and a suite of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiometers.  Researchers will use these instruments, along with cloud microphysical models and satellite measurements from the A-train constellation, to:\r\n\r\n  1) Characterize the macrophysical and microphysical properties of mid and high level clouds in the Arctic and compare them to midlatitude clouds\r\n  2) Study aerosol intrusions into the Arctic and improve their characterization through multi-wavelength depolarization methods\r\n  3) Study recent findings that aerosols, such as transported Asian dust, volcanic dust, and forest fire smoke, are indirectly affecting clouds\r\n  4) Combine polarization lidar and polarimetric Doppler radar to study precipitation physics\r\n  5) Test the ability of satellite methods to characterize the observed clouds and aerosols\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this activity comes through use of a combination of ground-based remote sensing and satellite-based observations in characterized clouds and aerosols in the environmentally critical yet under-sampled Arctic region.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this activity will center on the education and continued career development of a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher, respectively.  Additionally, results from this work are potentially important for understanding climate change feedbacks involving alterations in cloud cover and cloud microphysical properties in high-latitude regions.",
