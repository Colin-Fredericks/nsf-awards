 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes an undergraduate summer school in mathematical logic,\r\nto be held at UCLA in summer 2010. The goals of the summer school are\r\nto introduce promising undergraduate students to graduate level material\r\nin mathematical logic, including central results and research techniques; ac-\r\ncommodate a wide spectrum of experience with mathematical logic, ranging\r\nfrom students who have very little experience with the area to students who\r\nhave already taken advanced courses in their home institutions; improve the\r\nstudents? mathematical problem solving skills; and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in mathematics. One such summer school had already\r\nbeen held, in 2009, with great success. The proposed school will continue\r\nthe same innovative format, and build on the publicity and reach generated\r\nby the 2009 summer school to ensure continued success.",
