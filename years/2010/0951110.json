 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\nAn important class of proteins, occurring throughout both the plant and animal kingdoms, possess a so-called heme group at the active sites whose structure and inherent chemical reactivity are largely responsible for their critical functional properties, including the transport and storage of oxygen by hemoglobin and myoglobin, anti-bacterial activity and the clearing of pollutants from living organisms. This last function being facilitated by a group of enzymes known as cytochromes P450. Certain heme enzymes, such as the hydroperoxidases, are responsible for elimination of dangerous oxidizing species from living systems. Despite the great importance of such processes to maintenance of life, many of the details of these critical reactions with oxygen and derived species still remain unclear, because the reactions occur so fast that the fleeting intermediates that arise and actually control the reaction are difficult to trap and characterize. This research project employs an effective combination of two powerful methods to attempt to clarify many of these unresolved issues by determining the structure of key parts of the trapped intermediates. First, the heme enzyme is reacted with oxygen and very quickly frozen at very low temperatures to stop further reaction. It is then exposed to high energy light, so called gamma rays, which cause electrons to be generated in the frozen sample. These electrons can migrate to the site where the oxygen is bound to the heme iron to reduce the bound dioxygen and generate these highly reactive species that normally can\u00a1\u00a6t be trapped; the low temperatures restrict further reactions, allowing the reactive intermediates to be further studied. In this work Raman spectroscopy, which is exquisitely sensitive to the heme active site structure, is exploited. This overall approach is used to characterize the active site structure of these crucial, but elusive species for several important types of heme proteins, including myoglobins, peroxidases and the cytochrome P450s.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nInasmuch as heme proteins are involved in so many aspects of plant and animal life, including processes important to agricultural and environmental sciences, gaining a better understanding of how these proteins actually perform their function is of wide general and fundamental importance. Obviously, this project will present very effective training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and High School students; Marquette University has a thriving undergraduate program and Chemistry Majors are strongly encouraged to participate formally, with the possibility of earning up to 6 credit hours towards graduation. Also, connections and communications with local high school students is now made more efficient through a so-called SMART Team program being conducted in cooperation with local high schools and MSOE, another local college.\r\nThis project is jointly supported by Molecular Systems cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes in the Division of Chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The intellectual merit of the proposed activity\n\n Heme proteins occur throughout the plant and animal kingdoms where they are responsible for many of the critical functions of life, including conversion of food degradation products to energy, transport of oxygen, synthesis of important bodily chemicals such as hormones, metabolism of pharmaceuticals and destroying harmful pollutants entering humans, among many others. These enzymes possess a so-called heme group at the active sites whose structure and chemical reactivity, mainly in combination with oxygen, largely control their normal function or cause potentially disastrous consequences if conditions arise to alter their structure and reactivity. Despite the great importance of such processes to maintenance of life, many details of these critical reactions with oxygen and derived species still remain unclear today, because the reactions occur so fast that the fleeting intermediates that arise are difficult to trap and characterize; this is a serious issue, because it is the behavior and fate of these intermediates that actually control what happens in the reaction. This project used a synergistic combination of two special techniques to address this important, long-standing problem. Briefly, the heme enzyme is first reacted with oxygen and very quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop further reaction. It is then exposed to g rays, causing electrons to be generated in the frozen sample. These electrons migrate to the site where the oxygen is bound to the heme iron to reduce the dioxygen, generating the first of these highly reactive species that normally can\u00c6t be trapped. The low temperature restricts further reactions, allowing this primary, so-called peroxo-intermediate to be spectrocopically characterized. Then, carefully controlled warming to slightly higher temperatures allows movement of protons, and some protein residues, to permit transformation to the next intermediate, the so-called hydroperoxo- form, allowing its characterization. This collection of procedures constitutes the technique called Cryoradiolysis; it effectively allows the researcher to control movement of electrons and protons, separately to trap the species being targeted, an impressive accomplishment.

This overall approach was used in this project to characterize the active site structure of the crucial, but elusive, species for several important types of heme proteins, including those involved in certain physiological processes. Obviously, since heme proteins are involved in so many aspects of plant and animal life, the work conducted here is highly relevant to processes important to agricultural and environmental sciences, both of which have impact on industrial and other societal issues. \n\n The broader impacts associated with the proposed activity\n\n From the perspective of the large number of scientists involved with heme protein research, the work completed in this application helps provide needed deeper insight into the mechanistic principles generally applicable to the reactions of many oxidative heme enzymes, targeting as it does, the elucidation of the fundamental structural dynamics associated with the, heretofore largely inaccessible, crucial intermediates. In addition, one of the primary objectives of the work is to develop a computer-based description of the vibrations of the..."
