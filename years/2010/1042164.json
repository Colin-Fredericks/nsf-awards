 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peer review is the main tool for scrutinizing scholarly publications, grant proposals and career advancements in science. However, the current peer review system is under severe strain, with consequences for the quality of science and the rapidity of dissemination of scientific results. Several studies have found that the current way of performing peer review can be inefficient, slow, and even biased. Almost every scientist has ideas on how to improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform experiments to determine which measures are most effective. The project implements a simulation framework in which many ideas of how to improve the review process can be quantitatively tested.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit The framework is built using agent-based modeling. Scientists, manuscripts and journals are digital agents and a peer review system emerges from their interaction. Multiple experiments can be run: for example, one proof-of-concept application shows how changing the way peer review is performed can dramatically alter the pace at which science is disseminated.\r\n\r\nThe research develops a full-fledged and open-source simulation software that allows to study alternatives to the current system.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts The proposed work is potentially transformative of the way science is carried out. This framework can be used to identify better and more efficient models for peer review, leading to profound changes on scientific publishing and funding. Also, if this exploratory research is successful, a new computational branch of sociology of science could emerge. Changing the way peer review is performed to favor faster and more efficient solutions could potentially have broad effects on the daily work of scientists, including more time for academic training and research, and less time spent revising and reformatting manuscripts and grant proposals. Favoring unbiased practices could enlarge the representation of minorities in science.",
