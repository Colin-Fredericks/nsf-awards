 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nFor nearly every major topic in an elementary science course, student assignments include many practice problems.  Repeated practice helps students hone their skills.  The project explores if software can simulate authentic interaction giving students a more effective experience than traditional rote drill-and-practice.  Investigators are developing courseware, called Syrus, to help computer science students develop their skills with predicate logic and proof argument.  Syrus allows student interactions that are more flexible than can be achieved with practice problems from a textbook.  Students are not given a selection of answers to choose from and are not simply told if their answers are right or wrong.  Instead, open-ended responses to practice problems are checked by sophisticated mathematical software in real-time.  The system generates an almost endless supply of problems meeting instructor-specified criteria.  Syrus is a web application available to anyone, anywhere, using a standard web browser.",

This result was consistent among different subpopulations.  However, no effect of the use of Syrus was seen in a question embedded in the final exam that was specifically designed to gauge the knowledge that Syrus most directly covered.  Further study in an experimental setting where heavy use of Syrus is required would seem to be needed to better understand its value.\n\nIt has become especially clear in the last few months that the key ideas behind Syrus will have increasing impact as higher education struggles with the potential of \"massive open on-&shy;line courses\" (MOOCs).  MOOC students in STEM courses in particular will need to practice solving problems, some of which are of a sort that can be solved automatically with sophisticated research tools used by researchers in the same discipline.  Students should receive, because of their \"massive\" numbers, automated feedback; and, because it is possible with automation, instantaneous feedback.\n\nThe key ideas behind the Syrus project are already appearing in MOOCs.

The application of Syrus ideas to calculus courses was one of the possible futures mentioned in our proposal.  Our vision was that Syrus ultimately would help math professors address classical epsilon-&shy;delta proofs in a calculus course. Unfortunately, support for this kind of interaction remains beyond the reach of current research tools in logic.  By contrast, technical results regarding which problems can be solved automatically by tools for introdu..."
