 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to obtain new insights into elasticity and dynamic properties of the protein elastin, using solid-state NMR. Elastin is comprised primarily of long hydrophobic chains interspersed with alanine-rich cross linking regions.  Elastin has a complex makeup and there is limited information to link its molecular-scale structure and dynamics to its elasticity. The very nature of this protein precludes the use of high-resolution structural tools, such as X-ray crystallography and solution-state NMR. In this project the PI will utilize solid-state NMR and related methods to provide an integrated and detailed picture of the dynamics and structure of native elastin. This project also includes the first characterization of elastin fibers in native like conditions, using innovations in sample preparation and probe design. This is the only solid state NMR-focused research program with a dedicated, long-standing interest in the molecular-scale characterization of elastin. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide an excellent training opportunity to students at all levels.  The PI will train postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary research project at the interface of chemistry, physics and biology.  In addition, the PI will provide research experience to future high school teachers.",
