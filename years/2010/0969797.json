 "awd_abstract_narration": "Winter Schools at the University of Central Florida are being designed to focus on a topic of relevance to some part of the planetary community, either by introducing something relatively new to people who are not yet heavily engaged in it or by developing a new approach or technique within an established research area.  The first such Winter School is a three-day learning workshop geared toward planetary scientists who are interested in exoplanets.  By bringing together (a) planetary scientists working on projects in exoplanets, (b) planet searchers interested in planetary physics, and (c) exoplanet researchers seeking planetary science students and collaborators, it will provide a base of knowledge, a showcase for the latest results, and a productive environment for networking and brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe Winter School integrates research and education directly, and promotes the training and learning of graduate students.  It will also facilitate the broad dissemination of current research results, enhancing the understanding of these topics by planetary scientists, and is specifically designed to act as an incubator for new research projects and new collaborations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe University of Central Florida's Winter Workshop 2010: Exoplanets for Planetary Scientists attracted 73 professional astronomers and graduate students to Orlando, Florida, to present their work and to learn about research on planets orbiting stars other than the Sun.  The workshop had six sessions, each led by an invited speaker who provided a graduate-student-level introductory review of the topic of that session, facilitating cross-disciplinary discussions and the initiation of collaboration in the ample discussion time.  Contributed talks and posters filled out the program.  A seventh session, on the technical definition of \"planet\", engendered a lively discussion.  The grant included support for travel for invited speakers and graduate students.  The collected talks and posters are archived on the conference web site, http://planets.ucf.edu/meetings/winterworkshop2010.\n\n\nThe sessions were:\n\nExoplanet Discovery and Missions\nChair: Andrew Collier Cameron, University of St. Andrews, Scotland\nSchool: Anatomy of a successful search program\n\nMeasurements of Exoplanets\nChair: Drake Deming, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center\nSchool: Planning measurement and analysis of exoplanets\n\nWhat is a Planet?\nSpecial talk by Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute\n\nAtmospheres and Interiors of Exoplanets\nChair: Adam Showman, University of Arizona\nSchool: Hot planets meet cool theory\n\nSurfaces, Oceans, and Life\nChair: Eric Gaidos, University of Hawaii\nSchool: Physics of Terrestrial Planets\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Stars to Study Exoplanets\nChair: Jeff Valenti, Space Telescope Science Institute\nSchool: Stars are not blackbodies (and why that matters for exoplanets)\n\nGravity\nChair: Renu Malhotra, University of Arizona\nSchool: Basics of disks and migration theory\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Harrington"
