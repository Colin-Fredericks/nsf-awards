 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Targeted Math-Science Partnership of Science Learning through Engineering Design (SLED) vision is to increase grade 3-6 student learning of science by developing Indiana's first integrated, engineering design-based approach to elementary/intermediate school science education. The partnership involves Purdue University's colleges of Engineering, Science, Technology, and Education working with four Indiana school districts: Taylor Community School Corporation, Plymouth School Corporation, Lafayette School Corporation, and Tippecanoe School Corporation. The project is devising a design- and standards-based curriculum, inventing design-informed science instructional methods, and implementing on-going assessments to inform the project at the pre- and in-service teacher education levels in central Indiana. The partnership is using summer institutes, linkages with Purdue pre-service teachers, cyber-infrastructure, action research, and graduate coursework to equip teachers with design-based pedagogical skills and science content. An external advisory board consisting of recognized experts in science education, mathematics education, and engineering design meet annually to provide input to the project team.\r\n\r\nThe project has four interrelated components: \r\n\r\n1) collaboration between STEM disciplinary faculty and grades 3-6 teachers to adapt and develop engineering design-based tasks; \r\n2) an in-service teacher professional development program to equip grades 3-6 teachers in partnering schools to use engineering design as a tool for teaching science through authentic, inquiry-based, multi-disciplinary design units; \r\n3) a pre-service teacher education program to prepare future elementary school teachers to teach science using the engineering design process; and \r\n4) research that will investigate how grades 3-6 teachers teach science through the engineering design process and how students learn through design-based activities.\r\n\r\nSpecific outcomes that the partnership is working to produce include:\r\n\r\n1) In-service professional development for 200 elementary/intermediate school teachers and preparation of 100 pre-service teachers in the use of engineering design to teach science through authentic, inquiry-based, multi-disciplinary design projects.\r\n2) Improved science achievement of 5,000 students in grades 3-6 in the partner schools through exposure to engineering design-based curriculum and activities implemented by teachers. \r\n3) A library of tested, design-based curricular materials to support teaching science in grades 3-6. \r\n4) Creation of a cyber-infrastructure-enabled community of practice related to science education through engineering design that can disseminate grades 3-6 engineering design-based curriculum materials. \r\n5) Research on the understanding of how teachers teach science through the engineering design process and how young students learn science through design-based activities.\r\n6) Institutionalization of engineering design-based innovation through the development of an undergraduate engineering design-focused science methods course, a graduate course for in-service teachers and STEM graduate students, and the integration of engineering design-based curriculum in grades 3-6 of partner schools.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Science Learning through Engineering Design (SLED) targeted math-science partnership sought to increase grade 3-6 student learning of science by developing Indiana's first integrated, engineering design-based approach to elementary/intermediate school science education. By focusing on the development of teachers' and students' understanding of engineering design and its application to science learning, the SLED project addressed newly adopted Indiana Academic Science Standards as well as the subsequently adopted national Next Generation Science Standards which call for students to learn content and demonstrate practices from both science and engineering. To accomplish its goals, the SLED project established a partnership among Purdue University scientists, engineers, and teacher educators; participating school teachers and administrators; and community partners. The partnership provided teacher professional development for both in-service and pre-service teachers to prepare them to use engineering design as a vehicle for teaching science through authentic, standards-based and inquiry-oriented design activities. While the partnership began with just four participating school districts, over the life of the project professional development was provided for 181 pre-service and 353 in-service elementary school teachers representing 102 schools in 62 school districts in the State of Indiana. To support the use of engineering design to teach science in elementary/intermediate classrooms, teams of scientists, engineers, and school teachers collaborating on the SLED project adapted existing curricular materials and developed new materials to create a library of more than 30 standards-based, inquiry-oriented curricular units that use engineering design-based challenges or tasks to help students learn engineering and science concepts and practices in the targeted grades. The curricular materials developed by the project were all classroom tested and refined, and SLED curricular materials and classroom practices are estimated to have impacted more than 10,000 students. The SLED curricular units were made available to participants in the partnership as well as the broader community of science and engineers educators throughout the country and beyond via SLED's cyberinfrastructure (<a href=\"https://stemedhub.org/groups/sled\">https://stemedhub.org/groups/sled</a>). Classroom implementation of SLED curricular materials and approaches demonstrated that teachers can learn to effectively integrate engineering design into their teaching practices, and elementary/intermediate students can effectively learn science and engineering concepts and practices through the use of engineering design-based activities in the classroom. Through the development and use of an observational protocol, the project has successfully identified the instructional moves and discourse practices that teachers utilize when teaching via engineering design-based activities. These observations have demonstrated that teachers can successfully teach using engineering design and that they become more proficient with increased experience. Tests of achievement and interviews with students using think-aloud protocols have demonstrated that students learn science and engineering concepts as a result of using engineering design-based activities in the classroom, and students' science achievement is associated with the instructional moves that teachers make to facilitate their learning. The collaborations among the participants in the partnership were instrumental in creating a working community of practice that led to successful project outcomes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/10/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brenda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Capobianco</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141298859_SLED_logo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141298859_SLED_logo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLED logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141298859_SLED_logo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLED logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SLED logo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James Lehman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brenda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLED logo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141650520_SLED_PD_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141650520_SLED_PD_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLED Teacher Professional Development\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568141650520_SLED_PD_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLED Teacher Professional Development\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brenda Capobianco and Todd Kelley work with teachers during the SLED teacher professional development summer institute in 2014.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">James Lehman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brenda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLED Teacher Professional Development</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142112938_SLED_PD_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142112938_SLED_PD_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLED Professional Development\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142112938_SLED_PD_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLED Professional Development\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A teacher demonstrates a design product during the SLED teacher professional development summer institute in 2011.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brenda Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brenda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLED Professional Development</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142414569_SLED_Students--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142414569_SLED_Students--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLED students work on design task\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/0962840/0962840_10044993_1568142414569_SLED_Students--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLED students work on design task\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students in a participating elementary school use knowledge of electrical circuits to design a door alarm as part of a SLED design challenge.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brenda Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brenda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Capobianco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SLED students work on design task</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
