 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global degradation of coral reefs is accelerating as a result of direct human-related stresses and climate change.  To preserve these ecosystems, scientists and managers are exploring new ways to address the issues facing coastal resources.  One such framework is the emerging transdisciplinary approach of marine landscape ecology. While most landscape ecological studies have quantified the natural environment in two dimensions, three-dimensional structure is well documented to be an important factor affecting community structure in the marine realm, particularly in coral reef environments.  This doctoral dissertation research project will use remotely sensed data from bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to quantify the three-dimensional structure of coral reef environments at multiple spatial scales beside the main Hawaiian Islands.  A geographic information system-based approach will be used to characterize the appropriate scale of analysis based on ecologically defined groups of coral reef fishes.  The relationship between LiDAR-derived seascape metrics and measurements of coral reef fish assemblage structure, such as abundance, diversity, and biomass, will be evaluated to develop a suite of ecologically relevant three-dimensional seascape metrics to support modeling of marine fish assemblages.  The LiDAR-derived metrics then will be used to produce predictive maps of fish assemblage structure in the main Hawaiian Islands.  The results of this research will provide a critical step for marine landscape ecology theory in understanding the link between pattern and process in the ocean.  They will advance spatially predictive modeling of fish assemblages; demonstrate a new application of bathymetric LiDAR technology; and have significant implications for marine protected area design theory.\r\n\r\nThe extension of landscape ecology to the marine realm represents an important contribution to both theory and application.  The use of bathymetric LiDAR data will advance the understanding of the linkages between marine landscape patterns and ecological processes to the third dimension.  This project will be one of the first to apply a landscape ecological approach to advance basic understanding of the functional and ecological processes on Pacific coral reefs and the scales at which these processes operate.  Coral reef fishes play a vital role in the economy, culture and lifestyle of the people in Hawaii and other tropical areas, and this research will have major implications for coral reef management.  The predictive map products of fish abundance, diversity, and biomass may be used to identify critical habitat, evaluate current marine protected areas (MPAs) and also be applied to support the best placement of future MPAs in Hawaii. Partnerships with State and Federal program offices in Hawaii have been established to ensure that the research results will be integrated into marine policy at multiple levels.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
