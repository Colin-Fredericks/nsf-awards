The researcher proposes to develop indices that measure the long-term viability of rural fishing communities in Alaska by investigating how fisheries create and maintain culture and community.  To understand long-term viability of rural fishing communities this project will focus on socio-cultural factors such as culture change, kinship based social networks, and local-level politics that shape contemporary commercial and subsistence fisheries in Alaska.  It will also take into account the local mixed economy that enables families to ensure adequate food security.  In the North fisheries have become a reified symbol of the reliance on subsistence for many rural communities in sub-Arctic Alaska situated along river and coastal marine environments. This project will also identify whether a robust subsistence economy, particularly one focused on fisheries, is an indicator of cultural success in these communities.  Finally this project will identify whether a project such as this could create indices to measure the long-term viability of rural fishing communities in Alaska.  The project uses three communities as test cases; Kokhanok located in the Bristol Bay watershed, Chenega Bay located in Prince William Sound, and Tyonek located in Cook Inlet.  This project could be a model for other projects to investigate long-term viability of fishing communities in Alaska, or potentially across the North.  Understanding the viability of fishing communities in the United States is a critical component in sustaining community participation in fisheries and maintaining the uniqueness of fishing communities.",

Alaska has become a key case study of the viability of fishing communities in the United States. Participation in any fishery in Alaska provides an individual not only with access to food, but is an activity that involves residents\u00c6 working together maintaining strong relationships with their families and communities. Three geographic and culturally distinct rural Alaska case study communities were included in this study; Chenega Bay in Prince William Sound, Kokhanok in Bristol Bay, and Tyonek in Cook Inlet (See Figure 1).  A census survey was conducted in all three communities and overall 24 in-depth interviews were conducted. \n\nThe primary results show that residents in all three communities value fishing for culture continuity.   For example, one Kokhanok resident who grew up in a small village nearby said that fishing \"helps kids form their identity\" and it also teaches them how to work together as a group. \"Everyone has to get along at fish camp\" in order to make the harvest a success. \"You have to help everyone, it\u00c6s important for the entire community.\" Residents interviewed in all three communities talked about how important it is to pass on knowledge about fishing activities to their children as an important part of their culture. The practices involved in fishing (preparing gear, setting out gear, waiting, processing, etc.) involve families working together to continue their subsistence way of life and develop a unique set of values surrounding the practice of fishing.  These values placed on subsistence fishing provide support for their subsistence way of life and the continuity of their culture.  The subsistence lifestyle is a major reason for continuing to live in these communities; however there are also other important factors that arose during research.  Many residents, when asked why they continue to reside in their communities, simply answered that it is home. When asked what \"home\" means, they explained that it comprises family, feelings of comfort and security, freedom, a quiet and peaceful environment, and a sense of community (See Figure 2).  The response of \"home\" when asked why someone remains in their community was the response of the majority of respondents in all three communities.  The values associated with a sense of place were not foreseen in the original hypothesis.  This value could be the strongest value in regards to community vitality.  The practice of fishing does not only ensure cultural continuity by maintaining a subsistence way of life, but it perpetuates a sense of place and identity for residents in these small Alaskan communities.  The research showed that commercial fishing is still viewed as an important activity in all three communities (Figure 3), that participation in the activity is still high (Figure 4). Commercial fishing is important for economic sustainability by providing jobs and a way of life that is passed down through generations. Participation in subsistence fishing is still high in all three communities as well (Table 1).

Commercial fishing has provided fewer jobs for all study communities in recent decades; at the same time, the communities have continued to value subsistence fishing for the food it provides and the family relations it builds and secures.  \n\nHow well a community can adapt fishing opportunities and their values surrounding fishing as an activity is an indicator of community viability.  Chenega Bay, Kokhanok, and Tyonek have been able to adapt how they value fishing over the past century as their ec..."
