 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI) will be held June 21-26, 2010 at Indiana University, Bloomington. NASSLLI is a week-long event including thirteen five-hour graduate-level courses given in parallel sessions, two associated workshops, and a session for student papers. The school has run several times in the past and aims to establish itself as a biannual event. The general areas of emphasis for the school are at the intersection of linguistics, philosophy, and computer science, specifically applied logic, computational linguistics, as well as broader themes from cognitive science.\r\n\r\nNASSLLI is an interdisciplinary event, designed to foster interactions and provide instruction in ways that would be difficult in traditional academic departments. Most of its topics are not standardly taught at many colleges and universities in the USA and smaller  institutions frequently do not have faculty with multi-disciplinary research experience. The summer school will give post-doctoral students, graduate students, and even advanced undergraduates the chance to interact with faculty who are active researchers and leaders in their fields. The school aims to expose the next generation of researchers in linguistics, philosophy, and computer science to a vibrant interdisciplinary research atmosphere, at the same time as it gives them the tools to advance their learning.",
