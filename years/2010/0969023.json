Bruce Thompson\r\n   \r\nCNDE is seeking a Phase III support (third five-year period) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a single-university Center at the Iowa State University.  \r\n\r\nCNDE was established in 1985, and is currently a self-sustaining Center that continues to operate under the IUCRC model.  The Center focuses on the use of noninvasive measurement techniques to gather information on defects in materials and the various properties of materials, components and structures-information. Included are techniques that are familiar from medicine, e.g. the use of x-rays and ultrasonic waves to detect cracks and other material conditions that might lead to failure, as well as techniques that have no medical analog.\r\n\r\nIn Phase III, detailed brain-storming sessions are planned between the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and Principal Investigators to guide the evolution of project plans in the context of the generic industrial needs. The work proposed involves research in ultrasonic, x-ray, electromagnetic, signal processing, and magnetic measurement techniques. Additional projects are focused on materials specific problems in the characterization of microstructure and the NDE of composites. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will help avoid major structural failures and the resultant loss of human life, create and maintain a unique base of specialized equipment available for use beyond the I/UCRC, and help train a new generation of NDE engineers. Significant attention will be given to broadening participation of under-represented groups through special programs (Science Bound Program), encouragement of women in undergraduate and graduate research, and involvement of women in leadership positions. The Center plans to disseminate information via the Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation, an international meeting attended by 300-350 researchers annually.\r\n",
