 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to fill the need for a more efficient development environment for Autopilots by creating a usable Hardware In the Loop Simulator system, in which Attitude, Altitude, Wind Speed and Global Positioning System are simulated, resulting in a system where an autopilot can experience flight under any conditions in the lab. The benefits of such a system include the ability to compare the performance of multiple autopilots, develop and evaluate different control algorithms.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research proposes the creation of a novel system that will allow an autopilot to experience all flight stimuli in a controlled laboratory environment. The system will therefore allow for the quick development and evaluation of autopilots and control algorithms, the enhancement of Inertial Measurement Unit performance, as well as the evaluation of different autopilot systems under identical conditions, allowing for the creation of standards against which autopilots could be benchmarked. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed system is expected to have a direct impact on many commercial and military applications by reducing the time and cost of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle system development. Furthermore, this project will provide an opportunity for minority undergraduate and graduate students at Jackson State University to work in advanced research in engineering. The project will also contribute in enriching the curriculum and expanding educational infrastructure of Jackson State.",
