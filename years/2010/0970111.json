 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year award will allow the University of Minnesota, Duluth particle physics group to continue studies within the RUI program related to neutrino physics and cosmic ray physics. The intellectual merit of such studies is well established. The group consists of two faculty and M.S. and undergraduate students. It will continue to contribute to operational support for the Fermilab MINOS far detector located in the Soudan Underground Laboratory and in the preparation of the NOvA far detector - all located in northern Minnesota. Physics analyses in support of the neutrino oscillations and neutrino interactions programs with MINOS as well as the MINERvA detector at Fermilab will continue. In addition, contributions to the field of particle astrophysics are supported via studies of the cosmic ray interactions in the neutrino detectors, the use of the MINOS far detector in the detection of astrophysical neutrino sources, and the development of software to allow for similar studies with NOvA.. The broader impacts are impressive. This program provides support for the practical research education of both M.S. and undergraduate physics students. The close proximity of the campus to the detector sites provides the students with a unique opportunity to participate in research at a lab on a regular basis. In addition, the PIs lead a program in which high school teachers and undergraduate interns become involved with the research at the Soudan Lab and give tours to the public and school groups. This and the annual open house serve to connect the activities at the lab to the general public, especially the northern Minnesota communities surrounding the Soudan Lab and the NOvA far detector site.",
