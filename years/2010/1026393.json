 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will survey and document the biodiversity of amphibian, reptile, bird and small mammal faunas in Nuclear Central America, defined as the region between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico and the Nicaraguan depression. Due to its location at the boundary of several tectonic plates, this region is extraordinarily varied in its topography, including volcanic and uplifted highland areas of varying age and geological origin. The continuing recent reports of many new species from the region demonstrates that much of the diversity of the region remains to be described. Unfortunately, this part of Central America has suffered extensive deforestation. This research project aims to generate extensive data on species distributions and diversity that can be used both to test evolutionary hypotheses and to guide conservation actions for the region. \r\n\r\nThe project is a collaboration between the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School in Honduras, and the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de Nicaragua. This project will include training of a postdoctoral student, as well as training and exchange of several undergraduates from the University of California and the four Central American universities mentioned above.",
