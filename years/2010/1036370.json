 "awd_abstract_narration": "Echinoderms include familiar animals such as starfishes, sea urchins, and a wide array of extinct forms stretching back to the Cambrian Period, circa 500 million years ago. Echinoderms share a common ancestor with backboned animals and thus provide a crucial link to understanding a huge portion of the entire tree of life as well as the history of our species. This project, the Echinoderm Tree of Life Project, will resolve the phylogenetic placement of Echinoderms within the tree of life and clarify important unresolved relationships among major echinoderm lineages using data from genetic sequencing and anatomy.\r\n\r\nEchinoderms are fascinating, and their unique features, such as mutable ligaments and novel means of detecting light, have biomedical engineering applications.  Because research on such marine animals and their adaptations is naturally attractive to young people, excellent students are expected to be recruited and the importance of science will be communicated to a broad audience. Long-term impacts, embodied by scientific publications, textbooks, anatomical and genomic data, and extensive pages in the Tree of Life and Encyclopedia of Life web projects, will provide resources to researchers and educators.  Outreach will include videos and broadcasts about marine exploration and applications of fundamental biological research across the biomedical sciences.",

Rebecca&rsquo;s role in this collaborative research project was to add to the body of knowledge concerning evolutionary relationships among ophiuroids. Ophiuroids, more commonly called brittle stars, basket stars and snake stars, comprise one of the major groups, or classes, of echinoderms.

Rebecca and eight undergraduate researchers (full-time students) from the Biology and Biochemistry departments at Abilene Christian University worked together over a period of five years from 2011-2015. Undergraduate researchers learned fundamental molecular biology techniques such as DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequencing. Some students were also involved in the analysis of DNA sequence data and manuscript preparation. Most of the ophiuroid samples used in this study were collected on research expeditions that preceded this project (to locations including Antarctica, Guam, Norway and the Florida Keys), but several samples were collected by students during a Marine Biology class field trip to Cozumel, Mexico. Additionally, most students involved in the research were given the opportunity to present research results at a scientific conference.

Participation in this research project provided invaluable experience for these undergraduates as they prepared for graduate school and medical school.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DNA from two different genes was sequenced from 39 ophiuroid species. Collectively, these species represent 14 of the 18 families that currently exist in ophiuroid taxonomy, or classification. Both genes used code for part of a ribosome, the cellular structure involved in making proteins. The gene sequences from the 39 individuals were aligned and analyzed for similarities and differences. A phylogeny (family tree) was built on the basis of this gene data. This phylogeny showed some similarities to recently published phylogenies, but was different in significant ways from older phylogenies that exist in the scientific literature. Our data indicated several instances of traditional taxonomy based on morphological characters not corresponding with relationship information encoded in DNA.

Results such as these suggest taxonomic revisions may be necessary for multiple ophiuroid taxonomic groups, and that morphology can be misleading in assigning species to groups when not carefully interpreted. Discordance between traditional taxonomy and molecular systematics can be helpful in determining which morphological characters are most useful in grouping species vs. which ones are misleading.
