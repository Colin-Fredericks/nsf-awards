This Ecological Society of America organized project is supporting an initial workshop to address the need in the ecology community to develop digital materials that are available to teach ecology at the undergraduate level.  The workshop is bringing together research scientists, faculty and technology experts to: 1) identify strategies and technologies to lower barriers that hinder, and develop incentives that will accelerate, contributions to and usage of the EcoEd DL resources; 2) establish and coordinate strategic partnerships among scientists (as potential providers of resources), and educators with their students in a wide variety of settings (as both potential contributors and users) to achieve intellectual sustainability; and 3) outline strategies for the financial sustainability of EcoEd DL to ensure site maintenance and anticipate the next generation of technology.",

KEY FINDINGS OF MARCH 2010 SURVEY\n\n\n   The survey (N=419) revealed that while an overwhelming 87.6% majority agreed that ecology researchers have a responsibility to share their research findings for education purposes.\n\n   Other than lab exercises, almost half believed that it would only take between 1-4 hours to prepare simplified tables and charts, simplified datasets that students can analyze, as well as raw data that students can  process and analyze on their own.
