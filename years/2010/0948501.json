 "awd_abstract_narration": "The period between 1.78 and 1.63 billion years ago (Ga) was a time of important southward growth of the North American continent.  The rate of growth within this 150-million-year period far exceeds Phanerozoic (542 million years ago to the present) crustal growth rates. As a result of recent work in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, in a region known as SW Laurentia, the PIs have identified a deformational, magmatic, and thermal event at 1.62-1.58 Ga, which is surprising because the region was thought to be tectonically quiescent.  The researchers will combine detailed kinematic histories of shear zones in northern and central Colorado, with precise, texturally-linked dates on deformation, and well-dated metamorphic pressure-temperature paths to evaluate two end-member hypotheses where the enigmatic tectonic 1.6 Ga event may represent either (1) intracratonic deformation of the newly accreted continental crust with stresses transmitted far inboard of the active plate margin or (2) deformation associated with delayed subduction of a long-lived remnant ocean basin. The 1.6 Ga tectonism may reflect the closing of this basin and the final accretion at the southern edge of the North American continent.  \r\n\r\nThe recognition of 1.62 to 1.58 Ga deformation, magmatism, and metamorphism as much as 1200 km away from the continent-ocean plate boundary has important implications on several levels. First, the event may have Phanerozoic analogues in the Laramide (80 million years ago) orogeny or the modern Tibetan Plateau. If correct, this hypothesis would suggest rapid stabilization of, and efficient stress transfer within, newly accreted crust of this age. The present midcrustal level of exposure of rocks affected by the 1.6 Ga event affords an opportunity to investigate the crustal stress transfer in the strongest part of the crust. There are also implications for modern earthquake hazards well away from active plate boundaries. Alternatively, if the event reflects closure of a small ocean basin, then the crustal growth process was not a simple north to south progression and indeed was not completed in some of the northernmost regions until after 1.6 Ga. This might also explain some of the anomalous features on recent deep seismic surveys of the region. In either case, results from this study are likely to result in substantial revision of tectonic models for Paleoproterozoic crustal growth, assembly, and stabilization in SW Laurentia.",
