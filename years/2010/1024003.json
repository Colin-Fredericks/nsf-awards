 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to understand the representations and processes behind syntactic priming. Syntactic priming occurs when processing the syntax of one sentence facilitates the processing of a related syntactic structure in another sentence later in the discourse. This research will test the hypothesis that syntactic priming is caused by two different types of mental processes, one that operates over short time scales (a few seconds) and another that operates over longer time scales (a few minutes to several days). This dual-mechanism hypothesis proposes that 1) transient increases in activation of syntactic representations that are tied to specific words produce short-term priming effects and 2) reorganizations of long-term memory produce longer-lived changes in the relative strength of different syntactic representations, which in turn produce long-term priming effects.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed experiments use behavioral and neurophysiological research methods to test the dual-mechanism account. These methods have complementary strengths but both are highly sensitive to momentary changes in cognitive processing load. Using both methods in parallel gives the potential to illuminate the mental processes that give rise to neurophysiological responses. In addition, the proposed research may contribute to our understanding of adult language learning, in particular, changes in the adult system of syntactic representations and parsing processes as learning proceeds. This in turn may suggest ways in which poor readers can improve their reading skill. The project will also provide training opportunities for graduate students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\nThis is a basic science project that investigates how linguistic knowledge is organized in long-term memory, and how that knowledge is activated and applied in real time as people assign meanings to sentences.  The main objective of the project is to uncover the mechanisms responsible for syntactic priming during sentence comprehension. Syntactic priming occurs when the processing of one sentence facilitates the subsequent processing of a second sentence that shares aspects of syntax with the first.  Understanding how and why syntactic priming happens helps us understand important aspects of the human language faculty.  Specifically, it helps us understand the relationship between knowledge of words and knowledge of sentence structure, how that knowledge is acquired, and how it is deployed in real time.\n\n \n\nOur experiments support an account of linguistic knowledge under which two types of processes contribute to syntactic priming effects.  Priming that occurs over time scales of a few seconds is caused by a residual activation process.  On this account, processing a sentence involves activating syntactic structure knowledge that is tied to specific word-entries in long-term memory.  When two sentences share content words and have the same syntactic structure, residual activation makes processing the second sentence easier.  Priming that occurs over longer time scales is caused by an implicit learning process.  When comprehenders process a sentence, they construct and retain a memory trace of the sentence's syntactic form.  Exposure to various sentence forms changes the memory strength of those forms.  Exposure to a sentence of a given form can lead to changes in the memory strength for that form, which in turn can make other sentences of the same form easier to process and interpret.\n\n \n\nOur experiments have also improved our understanding of the role of prediction in language interpretation processes.  One prominent view advocates for prediction and error-monitoring as vital parts of language interpretation and language learning processes.  On this account, a language comprehender actively predicts how sentences are likely to continue.  When the comprehender makes an inaccurate prediction, the processing system responds by changing the assumptions that led to that inaccurate prediction.  Our experiments show that the effects of accurate and inaccurate predictions are separate from the effects of contextual support and semantic plausibility.  Our experiments indicate further that task and the broader context influence how strongly comprehenders commit to their predictions.  These findings rule out accounts under which predictions are generated by a simple, \"dumb\", reflex.\n\n \n\nOver the course of the project, the research team produced 25 publications, including 17 peer-reviewed research articles, 7 book chapters, and one textbook.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nFive graduate students, including four women scientists, received training in cognitive psychology research methods (eye-tracking and electroencephalography/evoked response potentials).  The two students who have graduated have gone on to academic (tenure track faculty) and research careers (postdoctoral scholar).\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Traxler"
