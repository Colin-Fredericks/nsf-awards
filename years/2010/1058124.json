 "awd_abstract_narration": "This high-risk, high-reward project is concerned with environmental-impact modeling for infrastructure-network decision-support. The intellectual merit of the research lies in the introduction of an entirely new modeling framework which broadly captures environmental impact in infrastructures by meshing computing and controls concepts, and in the development of a suite of analysis and design tools for this framework. The proposed modeling framework draws on the influence model, a structured representation of interacting Markov chains that can capture the intricate spatio-temporal patterns that are observed in environmental impact, and yet admits rapid computation of local statistics due to its moment-linearity characteristic. By building on the influence-modeling construct, the PIs expect to develop a hybrid model for environmental-impact evolution. A second key task is to develop a suite of tools that allow the use of the environmental-impact model in decision support, with a particular focus on inference and analysis tools.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research is twofold. First, the research has the potential to impact computation and communication technologies in numerous widely-used infrastructures. Second, we the research is envisioned to enact a paradigm shift in modeling for large-scale computation, toward models that incorporate control-theoretic constructs to permit analysis and design of network (and multi-network) dynamics. Education and research-dissemination activities are planned to foster both the societal and computer-science-related impacts of the work. Highlights include multi-disciplinary course-development efforts, and industry-interface and research-experience provisions for undergraduates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStrategic decision-making under uncertainty in large-scale infrastructures (like the air transportation network and the electric power grid) is still largely a manual process.  A significant barrier to automating these decision-making tasks is in forecasting and evaluating the impact of environmental processes (like convective weather and consequent capacity reduction in the airspace system, or wind generation in the electric power grid).  Modeling these uncertain environmental processes and their impacts is challenging, because the processes are high dimensional, networked, hybrid (involving discrete and continuous quantities), and have complex impact trajectories on infrastructure functions.\n\nThe purpose of this project has been to develop and analyze models for environmental-uncertainty propagation.  The project yielded several significant outcomes:\n\n1) Tools and analysis techniques for tracking networked environmental-uncertainties across a wide area (e.g., convective weather in regions in the airspace system), that exploit a stochastic automaton known as the influence model.\n\n2) Methods for modeling environmental futures and their impacts in detail at critical locations in the infrastructure. \n\n3) Techniques for inferring uncertain network processes from limited measurements.\n\n4) Training of graduate and undergraduate students, dissemination of research to colleagues via conference and journal publications, and integration of project outcomes in coursework.\n\n5) Technology transfer to industrial partners in the air transportation and electric power arenas.\n\n6) Integration of computing and control theory concepts, to develop tractable models for complex network processes.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sandip Roy"
