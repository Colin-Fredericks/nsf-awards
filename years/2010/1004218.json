 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry and Solid State Chemistry Programs supports work by Professor Tewodros Asefa at Syracuse University to rationally design and develop multifunctional metal-oxide nanomaterials that contain multiple active functional groups distributed at controlled intervals. The materials are expected to catalyze chemical reactions, enhancing their reaction rates and yields.  The controlled distribution of the active, functional catalytic sites may enable the nanomaterials to catalyze several chemical reactions simultaneously, thereby efficiently producing fine chemicals and synthetic materials with higher yields, fewer unwanted byproducts, and reduced cost.  Undergraduate and graduate students participating in this research will learn how to synthesize air-sensitive organosilane precursors and solid-state materials and will gain valuable skills in applying these materials to various catalytic reactions.  The proposed work will enable Professor Asefa to realize his multi-pronged educational objectives: (1) to develop a peer-led tutoring support program on math-related chemistry topics for at-risk students.  Both science majors and non-majors will be enrolled.  The program may increase the retention rates for undergraduate students enrolled in gateway courses at Syracuse University and beyond.  (2) to increase interest in the sciences among middle, high school, and college students through active participation in Syracuse's local science center and summer science camps; and (3) to create and expand undergraduate and graduate course offerings in nanoscience and materials chemistry at and around Syracuse University.\r\n",
