 "awd_abstract_narration": "ConfVeal: Automated Testing of Security Conguration Enforcement in Access Control Devices As network security devices constantly updated in their implementation to accommodate new features, or new hardware optimization, the enforcement of the security conguration becomes questionable. In this project, we propose a fully automated pseudo-live testing system (called ConVeal) of security conguration enforcement of access control devices. Our system, ConfVeal, has two novel components: (1) Segmentation-based Test Trac Generator: it uses a novel technique that translates policy congurations into coarse and ne-grain segments in trac space and then generates packets intelligently according to the segment criticality in order to achieve high test space coverage, and (2) Comprehensive Policy Generator: it generates comprehensive policy proles considering various policy structures, eld values, rule complexity and interactions based on customized proles or learned features of existing policy conguration. This research will investigate fundamental issues related to security devices quality assurance. This is important for vendors, government and general consumers. We believe that our proposed research agenda will promote deployment new ecient techniques for access control conguration testing by vendors. New concepts and tools for testing security systems which will stimulate modeling and theorizing pseudo-live conguration testing in research and education. The project will integrate research and education through a close interaction between faculty and both graduate students.",

We can summarize our findings in this  project as follows: \n\nFinding #1 [Existing proposed or commercialized solutions for automated firewall testing are insufficient]: This is because that the existing solutions (1) lack many critical features for generating a realistic policy testing scenarios including rule complexity, fields overlapping and rule inter-dependencies, (2) they use random or exhaustive testing generation of traffic which leads to inaccurate or unsalable solutions, and (3) existing tools lack flexible models for generating syntactic policies based on policy grammar and traffic generation, which does not guarantee efficient coverage of testing space.\n\nFinding #2 [The potential of incorrect enforcement of security policy due to implementation bugs is high]: Deploying new optimized filtering algorithms such as adding new features into the access-control increases the potential of software bugs that leads to incorrect firewall policy refinement. Based on our experiments with giant vendors in this area, at least 30% of new beta releases have at one bug or more.\n\nFinding #3 [Random or exhaustive testing techniques of firewall implementation enforcement are inaccurate and/or impractical]: Testing the firewall by exhaustively injecting all possible packets into the firewall is not feasible due to the huge number of packets needed in this case, even if restricted ranges based on domain address are used. For example, if web traffic (tcp, port 80) is being mishandled by a firewall, then one million random packets will miss the error with probability around 94%.\n\n Finding #4 [Smart traffic generation is required for accurate and scalable automated firewall testing]: one of the main research questions is how to select a reasonably small random traffic samples that can cover the maximum policy coverage. Our proposed smart traffic generation based on policy segmentation is a novel approach to address this problem.\n\n Finding #5 [Unlike general software testing, automated firewall enforcement testing requires generation random policies as well]: We identify two requirements for generating firewall policies effective for testing: (1) the policy generator should accommodate different firewalls languages, (2) the generated policies should cover the rule configuration effectively considering field values, rule complexities and rule inter-relations degree of interaction, rule space etc.\n\n Finding #6 [Automated testing using our proposed INSPEC is more efficient than manual expert testing]: The system was successful in discovering various kinds of nondisclosed bugs in beta-versions of the firewall OSs. Some bugs were unlisted, but were discovered by the vendor previously, and others were introduced for the purpose of testing the power of our system.\n\n Finding #7 [Our proposed policy segmentation-based approach is shown to be much more accurate and faster than the purely (uniform) random approach]: The evaluation results show that it is not necessary to know beforehand the error model of the implementation to be able to efficiently discover the existence of implementation problems. We also show that our proposed approach is superior in all policy cases and high coverage of field combination is necessary for low false negative.\n\n Finding#8 [Automated firewall enforcement testing framework must include policy generation, traffic selection and injection, post-test analysis and reporting components]: The investigating such framework must include several subcomponents: policy generation, traffic selection/injection, post-test analysis/reporting.
