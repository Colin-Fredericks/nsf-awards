 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an interactive online social network incorporated into a mobile electronic device such as an iPhone, to monitor and test the physiological state and sobriety of users struggling with alcohol, chemical, and other dependencies. The proposed innovation will improve the number and quality of support network contacts, and provide those contacts in real-time, thereby providing a system that is expected to significantly decrease relapse rates of recovering addicts. The system is enabled by the novel integration of diverse technologies to significantly improve the relapse rate of recovering alcoholics.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research in society results from the capability of the system to address a critical social need: reducing the relapse rate of recovering addicts. Presently, one third of the 500,000 addicts entering rehabilitation centers each year will relapse within 4 years. Over 90% of those will have their relapse in the first year after treatment (Polich, 1981). It is well documented that the best social environment conducive to recovery is one in which the addict has consistent interaction with support groups and frequent monitoring for sobriety. The proposed innovation provides both of these through a hand-held mobile device and online environment. The project will initially focus on alcohol and chemical dependencies where both a significant need and a well-established, mature market exist. Later embodiments will apply the same methodologies to other dependencies and process addictions such as gambling and eating disorders.",
