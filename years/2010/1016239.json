 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on organizing a 2-day international conference entitled Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional data at the Texas A & M university, College Station, TX, March 25-26, 2010. The conference provides a unique platform for bringing together researchers working in two cutting edge areas of current research in statistics, namely, Resampling methods for complex data structures and Inference for high dimensional data, in order to facilitate the exchange of research ideas on the two topics and to further the development of these booming fields. The meeting is co-sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences and by the Section on Nonparametric Statistics, American Statistical Association. The conference has an international program committee chaired by Professors S.N. Lahiri (Texas A & M), and an Advisory Committee, consisting of Professors R.J. Carroll (Texas A & M), Bradley Efron (Stanford), and Hans R. K\u00a8unsch (ETH, Zurich, Switzerland).\r\n\r\nThe two-day conference Conference on resampling methods and high dimensional data brings together top and junior researchers to define and expand the research frontiers of two highly active research areas of statistics and probability that deal with complex data structures. There are a number of areas of science and engineering, such as bio-informatics, brain imaging, econometrics,electrical engineering, finance, meteorology, etc., where such data appear frequently and which directly benefit from advances in these topics. The funding provides support for selected groups of participants including graduate students, minorities, and young researchers who can not attend the conference otherwise, thereby promoting human resource development.",
