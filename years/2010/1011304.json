 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species interactions have important effects on the geographic ranges of species and on the composition and diversity of local species assemblages. The outcome of species interactions can be highly variable in time and across space, and outcomes can be strongly influenced by the identities of the interacting species. Mutualisms, interactions in which both species benefit, are assumed to be important to the species involved, but the role of mutualistic interactions in structuring ecological communities is poorly understood. Understanding how mutualistic interactions between ants and their host plants varies through time, in space, and across host plant species will give a better understanding of the role of species interactions in shaping communities, and will help us understand how mutualisms evolve and are maintained in nature. Interactions between the ant Myrmelachista flavocotea and its required host plants Ocotea atirrensis and O. dendrodaphne will be examined within and among populations at three sites in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station, Monteverde Biological Station, and Pitilla Biological Station). Results from this study will provide important insight on how an ant-plant interaction influences community level processes. \r\n\r\nIt is likely that ant species new to science will be encountered while conducting this research, contributing to our knowledge of biodiversity in Costa Rica. Undergraduate students will participate in the project, gaining valuable research experience and exposure to the astounding biological diversity present in Costa Rica. Data collected for this project will be made publicly available, and publications arising from this work will be deposited in the Organization of Tropical Studies Libraries in Costa Rica.",
