Topics include but are not limited to: (1) fabrication of power generation devices such as photovoltaics and solar-thermal as well as solar-hydrogen hardware, (2) fabrication of energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and hydrogen storage units, and (3) manufacturing of efficient electronic displays, lighting, communication devices, and sensors. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This award provides support for approximately 20 experts and 10 students to attend the workshop. The agenda will include technical presentations and panel sessions culminating in a comprehensive report that will identify specific scientific and engineering issues pertaining to laser processing in energy applications. A report will be generated that will be readily accessible on an appropriate website, and a review article will be published in the archival literature. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The workshop topic has broad application to a wide array of manufacturing challenges relevant to emerging energy applications. In addition, current and future education and training needs related to laser processing in energy applications will be a critical component of the workshop. The organizers will ensure participation by a diverse cadre of attendees, including those from underrepresented groups.",
