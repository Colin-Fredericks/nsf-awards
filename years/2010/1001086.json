Ray tracing theory:\nThe vertical group velocity of wave packets is a function of the central wave\nnumber of the wavepacket. As wave packets dissipate because of scale dependent viscosity the central wave number diminishes. A theoretical development indicates that this effect can be large and we have accounted for in ray tracing calculations in the thermosphere.  \n\n4.
