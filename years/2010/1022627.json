 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oscillations and other patterns of neuronal activity arise throughout the central nervous system. These activity patterns have been implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms, sensory processing, working memory and pathological rhythms that arise in diseased states such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.  While numerous mathematical models have been proposed for these systems, there has been very little mathematical analysis of these models.  This is because the models are highly nonlinear, they exhibit an extremely complex structure of spatio-temporal dynamic behaviors and they depend in often unintuitive ways on the numerous parameters in the model.  This research develops mathematical and computational tools for analyzing a general class of neuronal models.  In particular, the research: (i) helps explain mechanisms underlying complex spatiotemporal patterns seen in recent experiments on early sensory processing in the insect antennal lobe; (ii) develops a novel model for working memory based on calcium dynamics and excitatory-inhibitory interactions within the prefrontal cortex; and (iii) develops new mathematical and computational tools for studying calcium and membrane potential wave propagation in spatial domains with complex geometries.  The issues considered arise in many neuronal systems throughout the brain and the new mathematical tools will be very useful in the study of these other systems as well.\r\n\r\nEverything that the brain does depends on the firing properties of neurons.  This includes the control of movements, learning, memory, emotion and sensory processing.  Changes in neuronal firing patterns are associated with memory and aging, and pathological patterns have been implicated in  neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.  With the development of new sophisticated experimental techniques, neuroscientists are now beginning to better understand the functional roles of these firing patterns in normal brain processing, the biophysical mechanisms underlying these patterns and what is responsible for changes in these patterns during learning, aging and disease. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that mathematical modeling and computational methods are critically important in accounting for the massive amounts of new data, testing new hypotheses and understanding how complicated  processes interact to generate complex brain rhythms.  Novel mathematical tools are developed for analyzing detailed models that arise in numerous brain systems. In particular, models for working memory are constructed and analyzed; this corresponds to our ability to store and manipulate information for a short time in order to carry out complex tasks.  Problems with working memory is associated with several neurological diseases including schizophrenia and the project explores how changes in neurotransmitters such as dopamine lead to pathological rhythms associated with these neurological diseases.",
