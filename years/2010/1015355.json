  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of my work in Japan I have discovered a new species of mushroom in the genus Rhizopogon which grows in a mutually beneficial relationship with Japanese Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga japonica).  The interaction between these species begins when growing tree roots are colonized by fungal mycelium.  These roots then become a site of direct resource exchange where the tree and the fungus exchange nutrients with one another.  Such relationships are referred to as \"mycorrhizal\" and both members of these relationships realize many benefits from this association.  Such relationships with fungi are well known for many species of trees, but this is the first time which it has been observed between mushrooms in the genus Rhizopogon and Japanese Douglas Fir.\n\nDouglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is a tree of great ecological and economic importance which provides a diversity of ecosystem services and is grown on a global scale as a major timber species.  Mushrooms in the genus Rhizopogon are known to be very important mycorrhizal partners of Douglas Fir whose nutrient contributions to the tree are well known. The relationship between Rhizopogon mushrooms and Douglas Fir trees has been demonstrated to increase survival and resiliency of trees.  However, the regenerative capacity of North American Douglas Fir forests has decreased over the last decade in response to changing climate factors and Japanese Douglas Fir is listed as a \"vulnerable\" species according to the Red List of Threatened Plants of Japan.  Understanding the details of the relationships between Douglas Fir trees and Rhizopogon mushrooms will provide invaluable information useful in forest conservation and enhance the management of harvested stands under the growing pressures presented by global climate change.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2010\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alija B Mujic"
