The interplay between partial differential equations and applications has been particularly interesting in geophysical fluid dynamics and climate dynamics.  The investigator and his colleagues hold an International conference on Advances in Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and their Applications to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics during May 31 - June 4, 2010 in Fudan University, Shanghai, China.  Funding supports US researchers, in particular, junior, women, and under-represented researchers, to attend the conference.  The conference contributes in promoting, enhancing, and stimulating international research interactions and collaborations in the mathematical sciences, more specifically, in applied and computational mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this international conference is to bring together experts who work on diverse frontiers of nonlinear PDEs and their applications to geophysical fluid dynamics to survey recent progress and current challenges, to discuss how new ideas and methods could advance the field in coming years.  The conference involves a large number of researchers from the United States, China, and other countries, and contributes significantly to the development of the international applied and computational mathematics community.  A special forward-looking session is arranged for panel discussions, focusing on the challenges and opportunities facing the fields of nonlinear partial differential equations and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Findings from this special session, together with other papers by the speakers and the participants, are published in the Chinese Annuals of Mathematics.",
