 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to develop an alternative to the theory of expected utility (cost/benefit analysis), which is pervasively used in making decisions. She aims to use the following as inspiration for the alternative theory: The capacity of biological organisms to avoid catastrophe through the use of triggers or reference points. The project will explore how regulation by reference points could be used to generate decision theory principles.\r\n\r\nCost-benefit analysis grew out of 20th century British moral theory, especially Utilitarianism, culminating in the publication of von Neumann and Morgenstern?s seminal doctrine, the theory of expected utility (EU). According to EU, to be rational in practical matters is simply to maximize expected utility. But EU treats risk evenly wherever it finds it: increments of hangnail risk are treated on a par with same-size increments of catastrophic risk. This seems to be irrational, especially if the catastrophic outcome in question is irreversible. This leads to the question as to whether there is a better, more precautionary, model of approaching catastrophic risk. \r\n\r\nPhysiology suggests such a model of caution by way of organic systems that organize their activities around reference points or triggers. When an approaches a reference point, a self-regulatory mechanisms triggers the damping of further activities in the direction of catastrophe. That is to say, physiological systems possess cautionary mechanisms designed explicitly for \"putting on the brakes.\" As a result, organisms are enormously stable, capable of regulating internal environments to within very narrow tolerances of ideal values for temperatures and toxicity. This project will study the theoretical foundations of regulating social and decisional systems (either individual or communal) via reference points. \r\n\r\nAlthough the core of this project is philosophical, the results of it will be significant to a broad range of researchers pursuing theoretical inquiries on risk and the conduct of ordinary life in the face of risk, such as risk analysts, decision theorists, economists, philosophers of economics, motivation psychologists, and philosophers of practical reason. The study will also promote interdisciplinarity (joining risk analysis with physiology, for instance). The findings of this project will be broadly disseminated to scholars, activists and policy-makers.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhat is precaution?   In conventional decision theory, caution is conceived as \"due attention\" to potential negative consequences.  And \"due attention\"  to potential negative consequences is no different from attention due to ANY consequences: it is a calculation of an \"expectation value\", which is simply a measure of the goodness of the outcome weighted by its probability of occurring. This attention is to be given at every point of decision-making&mdash;that in other words precaution is a \"local\" matter to be given at every decision point. We argue in this project that this attention is insufficient to qualify as precaution, especially when the negative consequences are potentially catastrophic.\n\nWe argue that precaution, especially vis-&agrave;-vis the catastrophic negative outcomes, is a matter of structuring one\u00c6s decision \"space\" so as to reduce overall the risks of catastrophe.  In other words, that precaution is a matter of planning very far ahead, and across a wide range of possible decisions, so as to ensure against the catastrophic.  We thus distinguish between \"scales\" of decision, demarcating between \"planning\" or \"governance\" decision-making (long-scale decision) and \"immediate\" (short-scale) decision making.  Precaution, we argue, is due attention especially in the governance region of decision making.  And such attention requires careful examination and handling of the risks of catastrophe&mdash;in statistician\u00c6s terms, it requires careful examination of the \"fatness\"  of the tails that represent catastrophe.\n\nCurrently, conventional decision analysis (referred to also as \"cost-benefit analysis\") makes no distinction between governance decision-making and short-scale decision-making.  Therefore it cannot reasonably put a premium on precaution in the long-scale.  We propose modification to cost-benefit analysis that would require that it make this distinction, and moreover that a premium be put on precaution in governance decision-making. \n\nOne area in which such a premium can be activated is in the province of alliance formation.  Alliances can be a means to securitizing the future.  For instance, an alliance between  females in an elephant herd collectively securitizes their offspring: elephant young are less vulnerable to catastrophic risks when they are reared by a group of elephants than when they are reared by mothers individually.  Obviously this point helps to explain (in biological terms) why elephant females herd in the first place.  The principle of alliance explains the origin of herds&mdash;because it explains how they succeed in securitizing the young.  There are many such examples of principles that explain a large-scale social structure by means of its success in securitizing something in precautionary terms.  And this is a job that a theory of decision can--and must--take on.  Because that\u00c6s where principles of precaution are best located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/21/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mariam Thalos"
