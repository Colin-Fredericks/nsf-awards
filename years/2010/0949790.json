 "awd_abstract_narration": "Histerid beetles are conspicuous members of the arthropod microfauna. As predators of numerous insect pests, especially flies and bark beetles, they have forensic and economic significance. Some are specialist predators of social insects, and have evolved remarkable ecological integrating mechanisms. Despite their ecological and economic importance, our knowledge of their diversity is poor. This project will clarify the  taxonomy of approximately 400 Neotropical species in the Exosternini, resolving their evolutionary relationships using DNA and anatomical characteristics, describing hundreds of new species, providing illustrated identification guides, and developing species pages for the Encyclopedia of Life.\r\n\r\nThis project will strengthen international scientific collaborations. Our fieldwork will be done in collaboration with Latin American research institutes, who will serve as specimen repositories, provide local expertise and support, and benefit through project workshops. This research will open up an important component of beetle biodiversity to further study, provide greater understanding of the evolution of the most diverse group of animals on the planet, and will help develop human resources in biodiversity science.\r\n",
