The plan is for a two and one-half day conference. Each of the first two full days will feature four (hour) lectures, two each morning, two in the afternoon. Each afternoon will also feature three short talks by junior researchers. Further, the second day will culminate with an open problem session.  On the final day of the workshop there will be two morning talks and a planned outing in the afternoon.",
