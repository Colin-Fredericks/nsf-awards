 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor William Taylor of the University of Central Arkansas and his undergraduate research team will examine the activation of sigma bonds in halogenated molecules by metal ions. The reactions of interest will be carried out in the gas phase using a selected ion drift cell reactor which will generate transition metal ions in both ground and excited electronic states using a sputtering glow discharge source.  These ions will then be mass selected via a quadrupole mass filter and introduced into a drift cell containing low pressures of helium and the neutral reactant molecule of interest.  Subsequent analysis of reaction products will be carried out using a second quadrupole.  This instrument will also be used to characterize the metal ion electronic state distributions via electronic state chromatography (ESC).  ESC will also be used to determine the state-specificity of reaction products.  Neutral reaction species will include various halogenated methanes (CH3X, CF3X, where X =Cl, Br and I), SF5Cl and SF5Br, and others. The experiments are designed to reveal the dependence of reaction outcome (e.g., halogen or halide abstraction, HX elimination) on various parameters, including the electronic state of the metal species as well as structural characteristics of the reactant neutral.  Temperature dependent kinetic studies of selected reactions will be aimed at identifying likely transition states.  These experimental efforts will be complemented by  ensity functional calculations of reaction potential energy surfaces.\r\n \r\nTransition metal ions have the ability to break sigma bonds, and this property is most useful in converting hydrocarbons to other, more useful compounds. Understanding the mechanism of this process will allow design of new and better catalysts for use in chemical synthesis and the petroleum industry. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities to undergraduates in an area which they might not otherwise be exposed to. Undergraduates participating in this work benefit from a valuable research experience which serves them well in a variety of subsequent career choices including graduate/professional programs and science-related jobs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStudies funded by our previous NSF grant focused almost entirely on the gas-phase chemistry of electrically charged metal species (called ions) with a number of small molecular partners.  Specifically, we have focused our attention on the chemistry of copper, gold, and nickel ions.  Our interest in these species is in regard to their ability to selectively rupture chemical bonds in typically inert chemical compounds, thereby transforming them into other (more useful) species.  Although fundamental in nature, these experiments inform the broader area of catalysis, in that catalytic mechanisms frequently incorporate transformations induced by metals.  Representing ~35% of world GDP annually, catalytic processes are involved in the production of an estimated 90% of all chemical products.  In addition, catalytic processes have a tangible environmental benefit by either direct remediation of pollutants, or by reducing the environmental burden of industrial chemical production.  By furthering our understanding of the interactions between metals and molecular substrates, this work extends our understanding of how catalysts function and can be controlled.  All reactions studied here were examined using a specialized apparatus located in our laboratory which enabled us to precisely control the energetic conditions under which they occurred.  Selected reactions were also explored using computational modelling techniques.  The chemical systems examined in this work exhibit an intriguing array of product formation despite their structural simplicity.  Formation of specific products was observed to be highly dependent on the nature of both the metal and the molecular reacting partner.  In addition, we have demonstrated that product formation can be controlled by regulating the energy content in the metal ion.  Although the discovery of new science has been the major factor in driving this research, involving undergraduate students in the research process has also been a high priority.  The studies described above have provided an excellent vehicle for training students in methods of scientific inquiry and communication of their results.  Research conducted during the previous granting period has included students from chemistry, physics, and biology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Taylor"
