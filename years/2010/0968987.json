Sampath\r\n   \r\nNGPV is seeking a Phase I support (first five years) for the Center, including support for center personnel, evaluation and research.  The proposed Center is a single-university Center led by the Colorado State University (CSU).  \r\n\r\nThe proposed Center will develop with industry partners, new materials, precursors, and formulations for manufacturing high performance and low-cost NGPVs that have great potential for energy sustainability.  Novel materials, processing strategies, and device structures that result from fundamental materials discovery research at CSU will then be evaluated and optimized with a focus on thin film CdTe PVs.  The aim of the proposed research is to overcome the scientific challenges outlined in the National CdTe Roadmap.  \r\n\r\nA solution to deceasing PV manufacturing costs significantly would mean widespread adoption of solar cell technology worldwide and a decrease in the worlds reliance on non-renewable energy resources. The proposed deliverables and outcome of this proposal include: fundamental understanding and \r\nadvancement of PV devices, hands-on experience for students to learn PV technology, and advancing the technology by demonstrating improvement in device performance, and meeting the goals of the National CdTe roadmap. The Center plans to interface with some key educational programs (such as the green technology focus), and to have a team of faculty and students that is diverse in gender, race and ethnicity.",
