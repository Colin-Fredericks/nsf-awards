 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades, string theory has come to play a leading role within the field of theoretical high-energy physics.  It has not only provided many new insights concerning the possibilities for physics at the highest energy scales, but also led to new, deeper understandings of gauge theory, gravity, and even condensed-matter physics and nuclear (heavy-ion) physics.  This award provides support for Strings 2010, the latest in a series of highly successful annual international conferences covering all aspects of string theory, to be held at Texas A&M University. In general, speakers at the Strings conferences include most of the leading figures of the field.  NSF support of this conference will enable young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to attend this conference at reduced expense.  This will enable them to keep abreast of current developments in the field, and to publicize the work that they themselves are doing to a larger audience of their peers, both senior and junior.",
