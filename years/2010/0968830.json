 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing organization of partisan politics by racial attitudes suggested by these results could have important policy ramifications. Race is probably the most visceral issue in American public life. As such, increased polarization of the electorate along the lines of racial attitudes would likely make the contemporary political discourse even more vitriolic than the already rancorous atmospheres under Presidents Clinton and Bush. Such a racialized environment would potentially make it more difficult to achieve common ground on public policy in the Age of Obama. That is a major reason why the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of research demonstrating that implicit racial communications can make racial attitudes more important in subsequent decision making (see Mendelberg 2008 for a review). Multiple studies, in fact, show that mass communications can make racial attitudes a more central ingredient of opinions about ostensibly non-racial policies such as welfare, crime and Social Security (Gilens 1999; Mendelberg 2001; Hurwitz and Peffley 1997; Winter 2008), as well as evaluations of presidential candidates in all-white contests (Mendelberg 2001; Valentino, Hutchings and White 2002). Research from the 2008 campaign significantly builds upon this existing knowledge by showing that merely situating a person or policy in opposition or accordance with Barack Obama made racial attitudes a much more important ingredient of public evaluations of these objects than they were beforehand (Tesler and Sears, forthcoming). This research project attempts to provide further evidence for this Obama-induced racialization by pinpointing the extent that health care opinions are influenced by racial attitudes and determining Obama?s causal role in racializing public opinion about a policy that has no manifest racial content.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary of Key Findings \n\n The problem we addressed was the extent to which having an African American president beginning in 2009 led to the racialization of issues with which he was associated.  Our data consisted of a new wave of interviews in Fall 2009 with a panel of respondents previously interviewed throughout the 2007-2008 presidential campaign.\n\nWe did in fact find significant racialization of attitudes toward President Obama's health care proposals. Racial resentment, as measured in March 2008, became significantly more linked to white American's support for private health insurance in November 2009 than it was before Obama's position on the issue was subjected to heavy media scrutiny.  \n\nOther evidence indicated that the public's polarization over health care in that epriod was due to the issue becoming racialized, not to its implication in standard partisan and ideological debates.  The relationship between white Americans' health care opinions and non-racial considerations like partisanship and ideological self-placement did not increase over this time period.\n\nFurther evidence pointing explicitly at the racialization of the health care issue came from experiments embedded in the re-interview survey.  Both racial resentment and anti-black stereotypes were more closely associated with white Americans' opposition to health care reform when policies such as universal coverage and the public option were framed as President Obama's proposal than when these exact same initiatives were framed as part of Bill Clinton's 1993 reform efforts. \n\nLikewise, white Americans' opinions about the $787 billion stimulus passage passed in February 2009 were much more polarized by racial attitudes when framed as Barack Obama's plan than when passage of that legislation was attributed to Congressional Democrats. \n\nExperimentally attributing policies like universal coverage, the public option and the stimulus package to President Obama did not yield significantly less support from white Americans, though.  Rather, and consistent with our earlier research on the two-sides of racialization (Tesler and Sears 2010), Obama's policies generated both greater support from racial liberals and greater opposition from racial conservatives than policies attributed to ideologically similar democrats.  \n\nAside from greater polarization of white Americans' health care reform preferences by racial attitudes, Obama's proposals also appear to have driven the opinions of black and white Americans farther apart.  The CCAP re-interviews, for example, showed the white-black divide in support of private insurance increased by 10 percentage points from March 2008 to November 2009. \n\nFinally, many panelists changed their 2008 attitudes about government involvement health care to comport with their earlier documented feelings about Barack Obama.  Few, however, changed their 2008 opinions about Barack Obama to comport with their previously recorded health care opinions.    \n\nIn sum, the results from the CCAP re-interview survey provide strong evidence that public opinion about health care polarized by both racial attitudes and race during the fall of 2009 in response to Barack Obama's legislative proposals.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David O Sears"
