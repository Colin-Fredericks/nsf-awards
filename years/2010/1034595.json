Organized by Dr. Adam Wasserman of Purdue University, the PASI will bring together top theoretical and experimental scientists from four different fields centering on the fundamental question of how electronic properties of complex systems are determined.  Spectroscopy, electronic transport, laser chemistry, and multiscale modeling will be discussed with the goal of establishing the most significant open problems in these fields.  The format of the proposed PASI, with a mixture of classes, lectures, round-tables, and poster sessions, will encourage approximately forty participants to be fully engaged in the process of understanding the main problems and suggesting novel strategies to overcome them.\r\n\r\nLecturers/researchers will be drawn from the Americas and Europe, and will include graduate students and post-docs from throughout the Americas.  Among the expected outcomes of this PASI is the establishment of new collaborations between scientists in the U.S. and Latin-America and the promotion of nanotechnology education and research efforts in the hemisphere.  Results from the PASI will be disseminated through a website where all the lectures will be made available.",
