 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Vicki Grassian of the University of Iowa. Prof. Grassian and her students will carry out detailed mechanistic studies using different spectroscopic tools, isotope labels, microscopy and calculations to provide a clearer understanding of chemical reactions that are of atmospheric significance. Prof. Grassian and her students will study the surface photochemistry of adsorbed chromophores, in particular the nitrate ion, on different surfaces and in different chemical environments. They will also study the surface chemistry, photochemistry and redox chemistry of anthropogenic metal oxide dusts. The study is potentially transformative since it could change the way we think about the chemistry of mineral dust aerosol in the atmosphere and its impact on our climate. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for students, including some from under represented groups, desiring to work at the forefront of environmental science.",
