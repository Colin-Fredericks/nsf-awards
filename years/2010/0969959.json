 "awd_abstract_narration": "The R&D described in the award Superconducting RF (SRF) Development for the Project X Neutrino Beam to DUSEL is viewed as highly relevant, and can be is of national and international importance. The science that could be enabled by this R&D includes programs at DUSEL, the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory in South Dakota.\r\n\r\nProject X is a collection of experiments proposed to compose a future Fermilab program. A component of such a program is likely to consist of measurements of neutrino properties.  Physicists now think that neutrinos could provide answers to some of the puzzling questions not addressed by the Standard Model. In particular, physicists think that neutrinos might be the reason that we exist: their interactions could explain why matter is abundant while antimatter disappeared in our universe. The proposed Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment aims to find out whether that is the case. It will explore the interactions and transformations of the world's highest-intensity (made possible through SRF R&D) neutrino beam by sending it from Fermilab more than 1,000 kilometers straight through the earth to the largest particle detectors ever built. The detectors could be housed in the proposed DUSEL laboratory.\r\n  \r\nSuperconducting radiofrequency is a key enabling technology for state-of-the-art particle accelerators. It is of critical importance to Fermilab 's Project-X, future Linear Colliders, and to future accelerators for high-energy and nuclear physics as well as next-generation light sources such as those based on energy-recovery linacs and free-electron lasers. SRF applications cover a very broad range of accelerator and beam parameters; cost savings in SRF can determine the feasibility of a particular design or whether a project is funded at all. Small improvements in achievable SRF cavity performance can lead to significant reductions in construction and operating costs of major accelerator-based facilities. The basic physics and chemistry governing SRF cavity limits and behavior at the niobium surface is still insufficiently understood, and it is still impossible to guarantee that a particular cavity fabricated and processed according to a particular recipe will actually meet its specifications. No US vendors can match European or Asian vendors in cavity quality, achievable gradient, or production reproducibility. US industry on its own cannot undertake the necessary R&D. Intellectual and practical mentorship of US industry by university and laboratory experts is a step on a path that American industry can follow to help it regain leadership in many specialized high-tech areas, including SRF.\r\n\r\nThe frontiers of science are often shaped by accelerator physics and technology. As examples, SRF has opened up a new world in nuclear physics and neutron production; the short x-ray pulses from free electron lasers will revolutionize atomic and molecular physics, and accelerator science will determine the future of its progenitor, particle physics, where inventions are needed to overcome size and cost limitations.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration is positioned to make substantial progress in understanding, improving, and detailing the important steps in fabricating and processing cavities. The US vendors who become partners in this program will benefit in that they can begin to learn how to successfully compete with the rest of the world on US and international cavity procurements. It is also worth noting that accelerator science is a very forward-looking area for a young scientist to pursue.",
