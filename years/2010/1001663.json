 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposal is to organize a conference on logic, more specifically descriptive set theory and model theory, and its applications. The lectures in the meeting will represent the highest quality work being done in the field. By bringing together major contributors to applications of descriptive set theory and model theory, the conference will help develop new avenues of cooperation and will help familiarize researchers with each others work.  Goals of the project include, on the one hand, helping mathematicians learn to use tools coming from logic in their work and, on the other hand, familiarizing logicians with problems and ideas originating in other fields which may resonate with methods and ideas developed within logic.  The young researchers whose participation in the meeting will be supported by this project will benefit by directly interacting with the best mathematicians in the field. Attendance in the conference will be a valuable component in their graduate and postgraduate education.  The conference will take place at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the second half of April 2010.",
