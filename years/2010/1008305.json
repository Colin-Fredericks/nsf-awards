Of particular interest to the United States is the key role played by the IOC in facilitating and coordinating the collection and distribution of ocean data. The United States (NOAA, NSF, US State Department) contributes about US$1.5 million per year to the IOC in direct and indirect funds. IOC is important as the intergovernmental mechanism for coordinating access to exclusive economic zones for purposes of ocean data collection. It serves as a forum for addressing issues such as ocean data exchange policies and internationally agreed standards and strategies for long-term ocean observing activities. The capacity building mission of the IOC helps developing countries through the combined efforts of all Member States. \r\n\r\nNSF has been providing its contribution to IOC for at least 25 years. It seems fitting that NSF fund a TOS special issue commemorating the 50 years of IOC contributions to ocean science. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:    \r\n\r\nThe proposed chapters for this special issue cover a wide array of topics and current directions in oceanography, ranging from basic approaches and methodologies needed to address contemporary topics in oceanography, including ocean circulation, C cycling, living marine resources, harmful algal blooms and problems. Relevant time and space scales for addressing these topics will be discussed and approaches to synthesis of data in order to make it meaningful to the scientific and management communities as well as decision makers and formulating policy will be covered. The list of prospective authors that are experts in these respective research and management areas is impressive.",
