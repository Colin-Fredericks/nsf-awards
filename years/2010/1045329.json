 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 20 years of work in the deep Gulf of Mexico we have assembled a large database on over 40 sites with chemosynthetic communities and 14 natural sites with extensive cold-water coral development. As a result of the ongoing oil leak at the Deep Water Horizon rig, some of these sites are very likely to be exposed to high concentrations of hydrocarbons and dispersant. Visitation, imaging, and sampling in the very near future at a subset of these sites will provide timely information on any acute impacts on benthic fauna, as well as provide ground-truthing of data suggesting that the oil/dispersant mixture is spreading along density gradients at depth.\r\nWe propose to revisit sites where we have ongoing studies, including pre-exposure tissue and live coral samples, and well-marked and navigated mosaics of coral and coral/tubeworm communities. A site in MMS lease block VK 826 and another in MC 751 are identified as high-priority sites with extant mosaics, excellent pre-existing macrofauna sample sets, and are currently monitored with time series sediment traps. A third high-priority site is in MMS lease Block MC 294, within 7 miles of the leak site. This site harbors a typical seep community of mussels and tubeworms. Numerous others could be visited if ongoing plume modeling and ground-truthing work suggests other important areas or depths in the Gulf of Mexico for study.\r\nAt each site visited, we will conduct high resolution imaging of the hard ground megafaunal communities for comparisons to similar imagery collected last year and make a series of macrofauna collections for a suite of analyses. These analyses will include analysis of hydrocarbon load (tissue PAHs), Comet assays to assess DNA damage, analysis of phospholipids fatty acid biomarkers from bacteria in coral mucous, and also experiments with living Lophelia pertusa for growth studies under laboratory conditions.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nFor the first time in US history, we are dealing with a massive leakage and spread of oil and trial dispersants (potentially much more toxic to life than the oil itself), which have been directly injected at over 1500m into the deep sea. The scale of this disaster dwarfs any previous oil spills and how plumes of these substances will travel in the deep sea and what their effects on the benthos will be is still almost completely unknown. As a result, there is a critical need to assess the impact on deep-sea megafauna communities and communicate those results as soon as possible.",

This site was chosen for exploration because examination of industry 3-D seismic data suggested there was a strong likelihood of hard bottom (rocks) or \"hard grounds\" where deep-water corals might be present in the area, and its location and depth placed it in the likely path of the deep water plume of oil and dispersant released between April 20 and July 15. Approximately 7 hours into the dive a single colony of the hard white coral (Madropora sp.) was encountered which exhibited visible signs of stress in the form of excess mucous production, including strings of darkly colored material hanging off the colony in several places. Thirty minutes later and 370m to the NW the ROV encountered an area with two large carbonate slabs and numerous carbonate boulders colonized by at least 4 different species of deep water gorgonian (soft-bodied with internal skeletons) corals.\n\nMany of the coral colonies were covered in part by a brown flocculent material and many ophiuroids were bleached in color and exhibited atypical attachments to the coral.  Gorgonians and other soft corals were present in an area of about 20 square meters. Most colonies were present on two adjacent carbonate slabs of rock covering an area 30 x 30 meters.  Surrounding this are scattered boulders hosting colonies of Paramuricea coral species.  More than 52 corals were observed in the central area using a combination of the down-looking imagery and review of video records of all dives. \n\nWith the rapid response funding from (NSF #OCE-1045329), we made an additional 4 dives to this site between December 8 and 14, 2010 with the submersible Alvin. Our rapid response efforts were focused on the symbionts or animals living on the corals and identifying potential impact through observation and sampling.  Here we documented potential impact to the gorgonians and symbiotic coral associates at this site, and a comparison of the apparent condition of the corals and associates between visits.  Impact to the colonies was assessed from images of 42 colonies that were imaged well enough during at least one cruise for a qualitative ranking on the basis of the percent of the colony exhibiting signs of recent impact in the form of bare and clean skeleton above the basal region or covered with the brown material.  83% of the coral colonies in the central area exhibited clearly visible signs of impact with 43% ranked with impact to at least 50 % of the colony in images from both visits and 21% of the colonies ranked as sustaining visible impact to over 90% of the colony in both years. \n\n Coral associates at MC338/294 included 13 anemones and brittle stars with 25% of the 52 examined corals hosting no invertebrate animals living on them.  There were a total of 78 brittle stars documented on 38 corals at MC338.  These brittle stars are typically tan to red in color.  At MC338, 47% of ophiuroids were tan to red, 44% displayed pale arms, and 9%, all hosted by Paramuricea sp., were considered bleached white.  A majority of the individuals of A. clavigerum displayed this atypical bleached coloration, 53% were either partially or mostly bleached. Although numerous individuals of the brittle stars showed atypical color and posture, perhaps indicative of impact, we detected no direct evidence of mortality of these individuals. Through comparison of imagery collected between and during each visit, we noted that 78% of the brittle stars either did not alter their position or did so just slightly, while 22% noticeably shifted position on their host coral, consistently occupying areas with live polyps. \n\nBroader Impacts \n\n1.
