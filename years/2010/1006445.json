 "awd_abstract_narration": "****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\n\r\nAccording to quantum mechanics, small objects such as electrons behave like waves in addition to behaving like discrete particles.  As waves, electrons show many interesting effects.  An example is the interference of waves: think of the patterns of waves on the surface of a small pond when a stone is thrown in it.  Quantum waves also encode the results of various interactions and correlations between particles, and devices that take advantage of these effects are the fundamental building blocks of many modern electronic devices.  The effects of interference and correlations between electrons due to their wave nature can be seen by measuring the electric currents that are generated by them.  However, these fragile interference and correlation effects are easily destroyed, and extremely low temperatures (close to absolute zero) and very sensitive measurement techniques are required to observe them.  This project will explore correlations between electrons in metals that are induced by their interactions with a superconductor, which is a material that can carry an electrical current without resistance at very low temperatures.  The experimental techniques that will be used include fabrication of very small devices that include metallic and superconducting parts, and measurements of the currents and voltages through these devices, as well as the electrical noise generated by these currents and voltages at very low temperatures.  A major component of this project is the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in research, who will learn sophisticated techniques of nanofabrication and device measurements.  This training will enable the students to have careers in academia or high-technology industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\n\r\nThis project will explore quantum correlations induced in normal metals and ferromagnets due to their interactions with superconductors.  In particular, the primary focus of this project will be on non-local correlations introduced in spatially separated normal metals and ferromagnets induced by crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and elastic co-tunneling (EC).  CAR and EC will be probed using nonlocal electrical transport measurements as well as noise measurements.  The noise measurements will also be used to probe for spin entanglement of quasiparticles using samples with ferromagnetic elements.  A second set of measurements will focus on the conditions under which one can observe superconducting correlations over long length scales in systems with finite spin polarization.  While superconducting correlations have been observed in ferromagnets, the length scale over which these correlations extend has been extremely short.  The new material systems that will be investigated may extend this length scale, and lead to the possibility of new superconducting devices in addition to furthering our understanding of exotic forms of superconductivity in ferromagnets.  Integral to the project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students in nanofabrication and sophisticated measurement techniques.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA superconductor is a material that shows no electrical resistance below a certain temperature, and as such has many technological applications.  For example, the large magnetic fields required for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are produced by running large currents through superconducting wires; these currents are large enough to melt ordinary wires.  From the perspective of fundamental physics, however, one of the most interesting things about a superconductor is the essential quantum mechanical nature of the superconducting state.  Superconductivity results when the electrons in a metal join to form an object called a Cooper pair.  Cooper pairs can travel through the material without being scattered, and thus can carry currents without resistance.\n\nWhen another material such as a conventional metal or a magnetic material is placed in contact with a superconductor, the Cooper pairs in the superconductor can leak into the the other material, a phenomenon called the superconducting proximity effect.  In particular, when two such metals or ferromagnets are placed in contact with a superconductor, the first electron of a Cooper pair can go into one metal, and the second into the other.  The electrons still remember that they belong to the same Cooper pair, and so their behavior remains correlated.  Thus, actions and measurements involving one electron also affect the other electron, which may be relatively far away.  Such \"action at a distance\" has potential applications in quantum computers and quantum computation.\n\nIn this project, we have studied nonlocal phenomena associated with the superconducting proximity effect, and have shown that correlated \"paired\" electrons and normal electrons can coexist in a conventional metal that is in contact with two superconductors.  We have also used ferromagnets (instead of conventional metals) in contact with superconductors to control other properties of the correlated electrons, in particular their quantum mechanical spin.  Finally, we have set up the instrumentation to be able to measure these correlations in real time, which is challenging as the time scales involved are of the order of a billionth of a second.  It is hoped that the understanding of these systems that we are working to develop will lead to future high speed electronic devices.\n\nThis project has actively involved a number of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  The graduate students have become experts in a number of sophisticated experimental techniques, including fabricating devices by nanolithography, making ultra-sensitive low noise measurements, and measurements involving microwaves.  A number of the undergraduates involved in the project have gone on to graduate school in science and technology fields at prestigious universities.  Finally, we have hosted a number of high school students from local high schools, who have become actively involved in experimental research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Venkat Chandrasekhar"
