 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infectious diseases play a key role in ecosystems: regulating wildlife populations, mediating inter-specific competition, causing dramatic population declines, even driving local extinctions of wildlife. During the last two decades, ecologists have led the growth of a new field of disease ecology, developing theoretical and practical research that understands these interactions. However, integration of disease ecology into veterinary and human health sciences has been slow, partly due to the slow response of health science curricula to incorporate these advances. This lack of integration, and the significance of pathogens shared among animals and humans (zoonoes) has led to repeated calls for increased collaboration among ecologists, veterinarians and public health researchers. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this award is to develop \"EcoHealthNet,\" a new \"Ecohealth Alliance\" linking Centers of Excellence in NGOs, Universities, and Research Societies and fusing the fields of Conservation Medicine, Medical Geography, and the \"One Medicine\" or \"One Health\" concept. EcoHealthNet will fill a critical role in bringing together ecologists, environmental biologists and the disciplines more traditionally involved in infectious diseases - veterinary medical, human medical and public health researchers. It will provide mentored training opportunities for more than 100 graduate students, openly recruited from the medical (human and veterinary), ecological, epidemiological, microbiological, economic, and environmental science fields.  The training will include workshops in epidemiology, mathematical modeling of infectious disease, and field epidemiology; and international applied field research in ongoing, well-supported programs such as the ecology of Nipah virus, Avian Influenza, rodent pathogen diversity in urban America; West Nile Virus and SARS ecology. \r\n\r\nOver the five years of this project, over 100 students from diverse backgrounds will be trained in tackling the global problem of emerging diseases which threaten wildlife conservation, public health and development.  Research findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, media interviews, conference presentations, and congressional briefings, in close collaboration with national and intergovernmental agencies that cover conservation, development, trade issues, and public health.  Network members will help make data publicly available via online databases, via the student section of the International EcoHealth Association, the Wildlife Trust Alliance and the EcoHealth Alliance.",

Diseases like SARS, Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and HIV are among the most significant human epidemics in recent history and are all zoonotic.  Where did they come from?  How did they first infect people and how are they spread?  Are there predictable patterns of emergence that we can use to prevent pandemics?  These questions have complex answers and relate to the field of disease ecology.  There is an urgent need to provide STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) students with exposure to the breadth and complexity of infectious disease research and to train them to think beyond their specific discipline and to approach research in multidisciplinary teams. The EcoHealthNet program is a Research Coordination Network that identified high caliber graduate students from around the world and provided them with cross-disciplinary training in the field of disease ecology using a combination of workshops and immersive field-based mentored research internships.  Each year over the five-year program, EcoHealthNet offered a one-week workshop for up to 25 students on themes related to global health and the ecology of zoonotic diseases.  Students were competitively selected with a goal of creating a diverse peer-network of graduate level science students and senior research scientists from various disciplines (e.g. veterinary medicine, epidemiology, ecology, medicine, environmental biology, etc&hellip;).

Professional science journalists and journal editors provided students with insights and techniques related to communicating their research to the public and to the scientific community through media and peer reviewed articles.\n\nThe second major component of the EcohealthNet program was a mentored research exchange which placed students into a field or lab-based research program where they developed a discrete research project under the mentorship of a senior scientist.  Students spent 6 -12 weeks learning critical skills such hypothesis development, study design, data collection and analysis, and in several cases manuscript writing and publication.  Under this program a specific effort was made to link students to projects that used a multidisciplinary approach to a health issue such as zoonotic diseases (e.g. Nipah virus, a virus carried by bats that causes fatal disease in people and livestock) or the health impacts of the illegal international wildlife trade.\n\nEcoHealthNet instructors and mentors came from world-class academic institutions, government agencies, or intergovernmental organizations.
