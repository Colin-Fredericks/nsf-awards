 "awd_abstract_narration": "Testing represents one of the major manufacturing costs in the semiconductor industry. Designing circuits with testability features significantly reduces testing costs and time. Thus, it is important for designers to be exposed to the concepts in testing which can help them design better and reliable products.\r\nIn this collaborative project between the University of Toledo (UT) and Ohio Northern University (ONU), a \"Digital/VLSI Test and Reliable Computing Research Laboratory\" is being established for the development of computationally intensive algorithms and use of commercial CAD tools for testing digital, VLSI, and advanced semiconductor devices.\r\n\r\nSome of the research projects being carried out include: Novel Testing Techniques for Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits; Built In Self Test (BIST) for Embedded SRAMS in System on Chips; Testing Look-Up-Table (LUT) Delay Aliasing Faults in SRAM Based FPGAs Using Half-Frequencies;  Analysis and Testing of Electromigration Failures; Testing and Modeling Soft Errors in FPGAs; Reliability Analysis and Device Failures in Advanced Semiconductor Devices; Reliability Issues Related to Power Consumption in VLSI Chips during Test; and Small Delay Defects and Test Generation.\r\n\r\nEducational modules developed from the research carried out in this project are integrated into a number of graduate and undergraduate courses at ONU and UT. Since applications of semiconductor chips are far and wide, many different industries including auto, aerospace, defense and healthcare may benefit from this project.",
