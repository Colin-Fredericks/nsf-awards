  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship supported the Principal Investigator (PI) at the Courant Institute at New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the mentorship of Robert Kohn and Scott Sheffield, respectively.  The fellowship facilitated interaction with many new students, postdocs, and faculty, and provided exposure to new ideas and potential research projects.  During the tenure of the award, the PI produced eight research articles, gave many seminar talks, and secured a tenure-track position at MIT.  Much of this would not have been possible without the fellowship.\n\nAs stated in the proposal, the PI used the award to study nonlinear partial differential equations typically arising as scaling limits of stochastic models.  The PI's most broadly accessible research project focused the Abelian sandpile, which is a simple model for particles interacting on an infinite grid.  This process was long known to generate fractal images like figure.\n\nHowever, this image was one of the great mysteries of the sandpile before one of the PI's research articles explained why it appears.  The explanation incorporated techinques from analysis, number theory, and probability and required many hours of computer experimentation to discover.  Moreover, since the Abelian sandpile process is relatively easy to describe, the PI has been able to interact with several undergraduate students on this topic.\n\nThe PI's other research focused on regularity and stochastic homogenization of fully nonlinear elliptic equations.  Here the PI (and his co-authors) solved several important open problems and laid ground work for future research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles K Smart"
