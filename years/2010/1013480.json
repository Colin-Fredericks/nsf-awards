This reactor helps to defeat the equilibrium limitation of the standard Claus Reaction and in addition allows one to capture hydrogen which is otherwise expended as a waste.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project will be to focus attention on the production of sulfur from petroleum refinery waste streams of H2S instead of treating the  hydrogen as a waste exhaust gas (as the Claus process does). This process allows for the use of hydrogen both as a fuel and also to drive turbines and thereby save energy.  Furthermore, hydrogen is a carbonless fuel.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nUnder this Phase I Small Business Innovative Research\nproject, Innovative Energy Solution modified its superadiabatic autothermal\nreforming process, a partial oxidation process marketed as the SuperATR, to\nincrease the hydrogen yield from hydrogen sulfide cracking.  In reforming hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen and\nsulfur, the process achieved a 38% hydrogen yield thus surpassing its main\nobjective by one point.  In effect,\nInnovative Energy Solution achieved another milestone with the 38% hydrogen\nyield from hydrogen sulfide.  During the\ndevelopment of the original SuperATR process a couple of years back, the 31%\nyield represented a milestone then as it as the highest yield in a thermal\nprocess.  Until to that time; the highest\nyield (22%) was obtained by a competing process under development by Alberta\nSulfur Research Limited, Canada.  The\nyield could have reached above 40%, with higher firing rates for higher\ntemperatures.  But the simple bench-scale\nSuperATR reactor, constructed with quartz, did not permit higher firing rates\ndue to safety limits.  With natural gas\nreforming, a 65% hydrogen yield was obtained with the bench-scale reactor and\n64% in the pilot unit. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe new and improved reformer will be marketed in the SuperATR-max\nbrand.  Those improvements were achieved\nby significant modifications made to the existing bench and pilot-plant scale\nreactors to include: a) addition of a new reaction zone\nat the reactor\u00c6s mid-axial center and b) improved heat exchangers.  The additional reaction zone, resulting in a\ntotal of three reactions zones in a single chamber, effectively turn the whole\nreactor into a high temperature volume. \nThe improved heat exchangers operate with a high circulation rate of\nwater, as the coolant, to quickly quench the product stream for preventing\nrecombination reactions.  The company\nconducted a wide array of experiments reforming both hydrogen sulfide and\nnatural gas in two types of SuperATR reactors: 1) a bench scale for hydrogen\nsulfide along with natural gas and 2) a pilot plant scale reactor for natural\ngas.  It was concluded that four factors\nproduce the highest hydrogen yield:\n\n\n\n\n\ni)    \nHigh Temperature: This requirement\nis key to overcoming the equilibrium limitation of hydrogen sulfide reforming. \n\n\n\n\n\nii)   \nResidence time: A critical parameter\nthat must be coupled with temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\niii)  \nFast quenching: This is needed to\nprevent recombination reactions between hydrogen and sulfur to revert back to\nhydrogen sulfide since the reverse reaction is also fast.   \n\n\n\n\n\niv)  \nUltra-substoichiometric operation: Operation\nin the ultra-substoichiometric, where much less oxygen is consumed, prevents\nformation of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the technical tasks, the company continued\ndiscussions with both strategic and venture investors.  These endeavors resulted in the sale of a\nmodified version of the SuperATR reactor to a major oil company that is also a\npotential strategic investor, for pollution control purposes.  Another oil&amp;gas super-major has begun\ntechnical due diligence on the process.  In addition, the company is revamping is\nbusiness plan for major venture capital firms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jacques P Bingue"
