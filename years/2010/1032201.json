 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worldwide government spending for fuel cell and hydrogen infrastructure surpassed $1.5B in 2004, and it is estimated that world markets for fuel cells systems will grow tenfold by 2007 and reach $12.6 billion per year by 2012. Despite the gains that have been made in fuel cell technology over the last decade, major barriers to implementation of commercial fuel cell generation remain. One of the key shortcomings of contemporary fuel cells is the proton exchange membrane (PEM), which serves as the electrolyte for proton transfer and as the separator to prevent direct physical mixing of the fuel (e.g., hydrogen, methanol) and the oxygen at the anode and cathode. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research effort is to investigate the use of solution and melt processing to control the PEM microstructure of multicomponent, multiphase polymer systems and to understand the effect of the controlled microstructure on the transport and mechanical properties of the PEMs. The polymer systems that will be investigated include polymer blends, block copolymers and polymer nanocomposites. Methods will be developed for manufacturing membranes and simultaneously orienting the conductive phase in the direction of proton transport using external electrical and magnetic fields. Use of a multicomponent/multiphase system will allow one to decouple the transport and mechanical properties, which is a major problem in current PEM technology. Performance of the membranes in an actual fuel cell environment will be evaluated at an on-campus fuel cell center, equipped with facilities for manufacturing membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) and fuel cell test stations. \r\n\r\nThe program is fully expected to produce novel results that will be published in scientific journals and presented at national scientific meetings. As well, this program will train students in polymer membrane manufacturing and fuel cell technology.  Undergraduate students will participate either through independent studies during the academic year or as REU students. Under-represented minority students and women will be especially targeted for involvement in the project. A lecture and demonstration teaching module about fuel cell technology will be developed and offered to students and faculty at high schools and primarily-undergraduate colleges. Research collaborations will also be established with science and engineering faculty at primarily-undergraduate institutions. Industry will be exposed to the results of the research through the IMS Associates Program, an industrial outreach program in the Institute of Materials Science at the University of Connecticut. \r\n\r\n",
