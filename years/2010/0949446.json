Software will support a tremendous variety of geodynamic research from mantle and core dynamics, to crustal and earthquake dynamics, to magma migration and seismology.  To be successful, the CIG will develop and maintain a high level of community participation across this research spectrum to ensure:\r\n?  Reusable, well-documented  geodynamics software that can be demonstrated to be keeping pace with developments in hardware.\r\n?  Basic software building blocks from which state-of-the-art modeling codes could be quickly assembled;\r\n?  Extension of existing software frameworks to interlink multiple codes and data through a superstructure layer;\r\n?  Strategic partnerships with the larger world of computational science and geoinformatics to ensure ?best practices? community-specific tool kits for scientific computations in solid-Earth sciences;\r\n?  Specialized training and workshops for both the geodynamics and larger Earth Science communities; and\r\n?  Hardware resources sufficient to support and facilitate software development and community use.",
