 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMichael P. Chiarelli and Nancy C. Tuchman of Loyola University and Pamela Geddes of Northeastern Illinois University will acquire a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) equipped with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system.  The instrument will support work at the Center for Urban Environmental Research & Policy (CUERP) at Loyola University Chicago.  The instrument will be a primary tool for research within CUERP's \"Clean Air, Clean Water\" program (CACW), in which emergent contaminants found in natural aquatic ecosystems in and around the Chicago area as well as the fate of these compounds and their metabolites will be experimentally manipulated at Loyola's artificial stream facility to determine their effects on aquatic biota and functioning. Additional research projects include: 1) studies to determine the positions of phosphorylation in proteins suggested to be key in triggering malaria, and 2) determination of the structures of organic semiconductors formed by the gas-phase modification of rubrene crystals by dieneophiles.\r\n\r\nA mass spectrometer is used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer.  Liquid chromatography is a technique that separates chemicals from a mixture or in a solution before they are ionized by the mass spectrometer.  The instrument will provide structural and quantitative characterization of the chemical composition of mixtures and reaction products for a core group of faculty users from the Departments of Chemistry and Biology at Loyola University and Northeastern Illinois University.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF MRI-R2 grant \"Acquisition of a Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer\" was used to purchase a piece of chemical instrumentation (an Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a model 1290 Liquid Chromatography system) that is contributing to research progress in chemistry, biology, and environmental science at Loyola University in Chicago, IL.  The instrument was installed three years ago this month in April 2010.  Ongoing research projects include the study of how specific water pollutants affect life in an aquatic environment.  The effects of two pollutants, azithromycin (an antibiotic) and bisphenol a (possible teratogen), have been studied thus far.   We have taken advantage of some unique features of this instrumentation to demonstrate the discovery of previously unknown water pollutants. The triple quadrupole MS has been used to measure the illicit drug consumption in a school population in Northern Illinois through the analysis of wastewater runoff.  We have demonstrated that small populations (e.g., several hundred students) can be tested without resorting to testing individual urine samples that can be personally invasive or relying personal surveys that may underreport drug use.   The instrument is being used to help discover new Malaria vaccines.  This malaria vaccine study  is funded now by the National Institutes of Health (NIH R21 AI101396).  The mass spectrometer is also being used to help identify new molecules that can be used in electronic circuits and devices to improve their function.\n                We have used the mass spectrometer in partnership with some of the Chicago City (2-year) Colleges to enhance their undergraduate laboratory learning experiences.  We have developed undergraduate laboratories based on the analysis of the anti-microbial pollutant, Triclosan, in consumer products and water taken from Lake Michigan.  Harold Washington, Truman, and Malcolm X Colleges have participated in this collaboration.  The City Colleges of Chicago serve a large population drawn from underrepresented groups in the sciences.  It is hoped that our partnership with the City Colleges will encourage more of these students to pursue Bachelor\u00c6s degrees and advanced degrees in Chemistry and related areas as a broader impact of this NSF award.\n \n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n    \n\n  Normal 0     false false false  EN-US X-NONE X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/23/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael P Chiarelli"
