 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Targeted Infusion project is to implement an integrative B.S. degree program in Biochemistry within the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum for this program was approved by the University Faculty in the spring of 2009. The decision to offer a B.S. in Biochemistry was made following several years of feedback from our chemistry graduates that pointed to the need for an undergraduate curriculum that allows more exposure and experience in biology. As is the case with many Chemistry programs, the Chemistry program at Hampton is designed along the traditional single discipline mentality, allowing for very limited opportunity for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization. Only two entry level biology courses (introduction to Biology I&II) are required for our chemistry majors. Program integration is becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of future scientists. With the implementation of this program, the Department of Chemistry will offer two baccalaureate degrees: the traditional B.S. degree in Chemistry, and a B.S. degree in Biochemistry. Both degree programs meet the American Chemical Society certification requirements.",
