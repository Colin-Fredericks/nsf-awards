 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the state of Florida has over 1,350 miles of salt-water coastline, the state represents a significant, untapped opportunity for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) network to expand its geographic and programmatic reach. Our proposed center, COSEE Florida: Water as Habitat, will build statewide connections with Florida's ocean research community. This project will provide professional development opportunities for scientists to improve their ability to communicate the value and importance of their science to nonscientific audiences and achieve a better understanding of their role in supporting STEM education.\r\n \r\nFounding partners for COSEE Florida are the Indian River State College, the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, and the Florida Institute of Technology.  Our content theme \"Water as Habitat\" is engaging and appealing to students and the public and will allow us to place naturally charismatic marine organisms and ecosystems within a systems framework linking physical, chemical and geological ocean processes to biodiversity, marine ecology, climate change, threats to human health, and stewardship actions. COSEE Florida will advance ocean science literacy through the implementation of three strategic initiatives: \r\n\r\n1.\tProfessional Development Workshop Series for Scientists: Ocean scientists will participate in workshops to improve their effectiveness in communicating their research to non-scientific audiences. COSEE staff will also provide assistance to scientists who wish to develop quality outreach programs to broaden the impact of their research. Six workshops will be conducted around the state each year. \r\n\r\n2.\tA new Ocean Science Concentration for Pre-Service Educators: Ocean science focused educational content will be added to the Bachelor of Science STEM Education degree for middle school science at Indian River State College in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Students will participate in a suite of courses, research opportunities and high quality practicum situations. The program will be disseminated to additional State College campuses in year 5. \r\n\r\n3.\tCOSEE Florida Ocean Science Learning Network: This initiative is the linchpin that brings scientists, educators and the public together to communicate and collaborate. Water As Habitat events will feature ocean-based interactive presentations, educator workshops, and opportunities for continued participant engagement at regional nodes throughout the state. On-line communication tools will be developed to facilitate post-event collaborations and resource sharing. At least five regional Learning Community nodes will be established around the state. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur work will engage a spectrum of people and organizations from across Florida. Ocean researchers, higher education faculty, informal education institutions, educators and the general public will participate in a wide range of activities. Through our initiatives we will (1) involve up to 90 Florida ocean scientists in effective outreach and education each year, (2) expand the skills and strengthen the ocean science content of at least 200 pre-service undergraduates, 100 in-service teachers and 100 informal educators over a 5 year period, (3) improve the ocean literacy of over 3000 Florida residents and tourists and (4) learn from and contribute to the work of other Centers in the National COSEE Network. \r\n\r\nThe ocean science content of our programs will draw on current research findings from Florida's leading ocean scientists (Intellectual Merit) and significantly expand public awareness of the significance of their work (Broader Impacts). Scientists will also develop a deeper understanding of the challenges facing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education today (Intellectual Merit) and contribute to improving the quality of teaching and learning in Florida through the integration of cutting edge research into K-16 education (Broader Impacts).",

COSEE Florida set out to build a broad \"community of practice? to engage a spectrum of people and organizations from across our state &ndash; ocean researchers and higher education faculty, informal educational institutions, school districts, classroom teachers and future science teachers. \n\nThe ocean science content of our programs were based on current research findings from Florida?s leading ocean scientists (Intellectual Merit) and significantly expand public awareness of the significance of their work (Broader Impacts). Scientists also developed a deeper understanding of the challenges facing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education today (Intellectual Merit) and contributed towards improving the quality of teaching and learning in Florida through the integration of cutting edge research into K-16 education (Broader Impacts).\n\nIndian River State College (IRSC) focused on training pre-service teachers in STEM disciplines to develop and pilot a new ocean science concentration for pre-service education majors.  Over the past seven years, (IRSC) was able to design Florida?s first Ocean Sciences Concentration (OSC) with a Bachelor of Science education for middle school science teachers.  The course content for Marine Biology (OCB2010) focused on basic concepts of oceanography including properties of ocean water, plate tectonics, ocean circulation, weather and climate, the water cycle, and diversity of ecosystems and life.  The course content for Current Issues in Marine Environmental Science (OCB3070) focused on anthropogenic effects of Florida?s estuaries, Florida ecosystems, the Kissimmiee-Okeechobee-Everglades (KOE) watershed, the Florida aquifer, and climate change.  Both courses required interrogation of data collected from Kilroy water monitors located in the Indian River Lagoon.\n\nCOSEE Florida developed the Research Experience for Pre-service Teachers (REPT) program involving ocean scientists in educational outreach with future teachers to connect relevant science and real-world applications for the classroom.  Pre-service middle education majors at IRSC participated in a seven-week research experience at one of the College?s participating research facilities.  Each week, student interns spent 20 hours working with their scientist mentor teams and five hours receiving support from IRSC?s science faculty. \n\nThe Ocean Science Concentration and REPT program have provided opportunities for pre-service educators to gain valuable science content knowledge and conduct real-world research projects in partnership with FL-based marine scientists.  These opportunities allowed pre-service educators to bring forth relevant ocean science research into their classrooms and ultimately their students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edwin Massey"
