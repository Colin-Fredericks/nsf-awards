 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaboration through virtual organizations is crucial for analyzing and tackling problems such as preventing terrorists, understanding business risks, tracing outbreaks of disease, and conducting criminal investigations. Nonetheless, these collaborations can fail to connect the dots for lack of a technological and organizational framework for leveraging large amounts of dynamic shared information collaboratively. A key research question is how to support the ability of collaborating organizations to attend to and follow up on scattered and often unexpected information from different sources. This research will gain a fundamental understanding of inter-organizational collaborative investigative analysis. The investigators are conducting interviews with members of virtual organizations and controlled laboratory studies to examine interventions that might increase information use across organizational boundaries, and developing and evaluating tools to accomplish these interventions. The research contributes in three areas: (a) understanding how analytical processes across organizational boundaries are evidenced in how people make use of shared but unexpected information, (b) understanding the benefits and costs of different methods for managing collaborative analysis in an environment of large amounts of dynamic information, and (c) designing and testing the effectiveness of interfaces that provide information to support emergent attention and responsibility taking in a multi-organizational collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project will inform collaborative investigative analysis in fields such as criminal justice, intelligence, science, and epidemiology. The results could lead to new visualization tools for analysts in these areas, recommendations for organizational practices to improve the quality of collaborative analysis, new methods for training professional analysts to solve complex, interconnected problems, and learning tools for graduate programs in fields such as intelligence and epidemiological analysis and criminal justice. The research will also involve undergraduate and graduate students, and will result in their further training and education in interdisciplinary research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCollaborative analysis of information plays an import role in societal domains such as crime solving, epidemiology, and national intelligence.  The goals of this project were to improve collaborative analysis by (a) identifying the kinds of problems that arise when collaboration occurs across multiple organizations; (b) evaluating interventions that can facilitate better collaborative analysis across agencies; and (c) designing and evaluating new computer tools that make it easier for teams to work together to analyze data.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we conducted laboratory studies that looked in detail at how people shared, or failed to share, information during a collaborative crime analysis task.  We also developed and evaluated several new computer interface techniques to facilitate collaborative analysis.\n\nFindings from our laboratory studies suggest that collaborative analysis involves a complex interplay between the cognitive processes of individual analysts and the communication and collaboration processes involved in teamwork.  Problems can arise at either the individual or team level.  For example, an individual analyst may fail to consider all the available information, come to an erroneous conclusion, and then share that conclusion with partners.  Or, an individual analyst may come to the correct conclusion but for organizational reasons, fail to share it with others who need to know. \n\nOur development and evaluation activities attempted to solve some of the problems we identified in our laboratory studies of collaborative analysis.  One set of tools aimed to improve the cognitive processes of individual analysts, for example by helping them visualize the data and link it to a timeline. Another set of tools aimed to improve collaborative processes, for example by making it easier for analysts to overcome organizational barriers that prevent timely information sharing or by helping them identify the trustworthiness of information they receive from partners.  Users rated most but not all of our interface tools as helpful for collaborative analysis, and some also improved objective task outcomes.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The project provided training in STEM disciplines to eight undergraduate students, ten Master's students in computer science, two doctoral students, and one PHD-level visiting researcher.
