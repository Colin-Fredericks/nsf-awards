However, the low power densities achieved to date limit their applicability. This proposed research seeks to improve the power density of biological fuel cells through controlled assembly of enzyme catalysts onto the fuel cell electrode.  To achieve this goal, the proposed research seeks to improve electrical contact between the redox proteins and the conductive support, and to create electrode architectures which are designed to achieve higher power output.  The assembly process is hierarchical, where proteins of nanometer dimensions are templated into viruses of nearly micron size which then self-assemble into macroscopic electrode structures.  \r\n\r\nThe model system will focus on glucose, a renewable feedstock, as the fuel source for electricity production.  The research plan has two major objectives.  The first objective is to create virus-templated enzyme electrodes which are based on assembling enzymes with inorganic constituents into an integrated structure.  The heterofunctional M13 virus is designed to couple glucose oxidase to a gold nanowire through selective peptide binding to achieve mediated electron transfer between the redox center of the glucose oxidase and the electrode. The three enzyme electrode structures are proposed to overcome the limitations experienced in establishing electrical contact between the redox protein and the conductive support. The second objective is to use the liquid crystal nature of the M13 virus to self-assemble these templated enzyme electrode structures into robust electrode architectures.  This approach seeks to obtain electrodes of least 10 micron thickness that are densely packed with enzymes but possess controlled porosity for electrolyte accessibility. The potential of this electrode design to achieve higher levels of power density by increasing the density of electrically-wired enzymes and ensuring accessibility of the fuel to the electrode will be assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe education and outreach plan is based on the proposed research activities.  Undergraduate and graduate students will receive cross-disciplinary training in bioengineering, electrochemistry, and nanomaterials.   Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited through existing programs at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) to participate in the proposed research.  In collaboration with California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), biofuel cell kits and instructional videos will be developed for high school teachers as a way of bringing renewable energy topics to the high school science curriculum of the Los Angeles Unified School District.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSummary of Objective and Outcomes:  Biofuel cells show great promise as a green and sustainable source of alternative energy.  Biofuel cells harness the energy production processes found in nature and have significantly less environmental impact than traditional energy sources based on fossil fuels.  The biofuel cell system which is the focus of this study converts the chemical energy of glucose and oxygen directly into electrical energy utilizing enzymes to biocatalyze redox reactions.  However, there is frequently a barrier to electron transfer because the redox center is deeply embedded in the protein.  This barrier may be overcome by the use of a mediator solution to facilitate electron transfer, however this lowers the energy potential of the system.  The ultimate objective of our research is to improve electrical contact between the redox proteins (catalysts) and the conductive support and to create electrode architectures that are designed to achieve higher power output.  Key outcomes include (1) Direct electron transfer was achieved with glucose oxidase covalently attached to nanogold (&lt;2nm diameter) decorated M13 bacteriophage on a gold electrode. M13 phage can then be used to create large-scale, densely packed enzyme electrodes for biofuel applications.  This approach will increase the available surface area for reaction and allow for significant improvements in power density; (2) in a related effort to improve energy efficiency through improved catalyst-support contact, we developed a new catalytic platform based on graphene and molecular metalloporphyrin for demanding oxidative reactions, such as toluene oxidation.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit: In the enzyme-bacteriophage aspect of the work, we addressed two important problems faced by enzymatic biofuel cells: improving electrical contact between the redox protein and the conductive electrode and creating enzyme-electrode architectures which are designed for higher power output.  The hemin-graphene work presents a brand-new concept of combining graphene and metalloporphyrin molecules as an oxidation catalyst platform. For over a decade, chemically exfoliated graphene has been studied as a catalyst support due to its high active surface area and excellent electron conductivity. Our results illustrate for the first time that by combining hemin and graphene, an active catalytic system can be obtained with high conversion rate, high selectivity and outstanding long-term stability under harsh reaction environments. This combination of two distinct material systems achieved an unexpected, improved synergistic effect, and significantly advances systems materials engineering.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact in Science and Technology: The novel architectures developed with enzyme/metallic nanoparticles/bacteriophage/metal substrates can be applied to other technologies. The design and development of new biofunctional materials impacts the general materials science community by combining functionality with biological properties. The toluene oxidation reaction achieved within the project has been cited for its industrial challenge and there is booming market demand for benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. Traditional industry approaches use environmentally hazardous halogen co-catalyst and acidic solvents and suffer from low conversion and selectivity. Most industry processes require high temperature and high pressure, which further raises cost and energy demand. Our reported catalyst system with low materials cost, a simple materials synthesis route and energy-saving catalytic reaction conditions (low temperature and atmospheric pressure) offers great potential to revolutionize the oxidation catalyst industry. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact on Society: Throughout this project, we participated in multiple outreach sessions with the UCLA Clean Energy for Green Industry Fellowship.
