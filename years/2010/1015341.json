We scanned Chinese participants with strong self-reported interdependent selves using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they observed a friend with high closeness with the self and a stranger with low closeness to the self experience social suffering during a social exclusion task. We found that observing a friend&rsquo;s social exclusion activated brain regions associated with the direct (i.e. firsthand) experience of social suffering (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula), whereas observing a stranger&rsquo;s social exclusion activated regions associated with thinking about the traits and intentions of others (i.e., the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), precuneus, and temporal pole (TP)) but not regions associated with suffering. Directly comparing activation from observing the friend&rsquo;s vs. the stranger&rsquo;s social exclusion showed increased activation in brain regions associated with the firsthand experience of social suffering (dACC and anterior insula) and with thinking about the self (i.e., the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate), all of which correlated with self-reported degree of closeness with the friend. These results suggest that in Eastern cultures, where interdependence is pronounced, closeness to the self enhances empathy for social suffering.
