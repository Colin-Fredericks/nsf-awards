 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although ray-finned fishes (e.g. catfish, salmon) are the most diverse group of vertebrates on the planet today, their early evolution is poorly understood.  This is because primitive fossil ray-finned fishes, the palaeoniscoids, are an understudied group.  Countless palaeoniscoids remain to be described and included in analyses that investigate evolutionary relationships among extinct and extant ray-finned fishes. These extinct fishes are important because the body plan of today's fishes has originated from palaeoniscoids, and there is evidence that some are closely related to today's fishes.  The goal of this project is to shed light onto the early evolution of fishes by investigating the interrelationships of palaeoniscoids in a comprehensive study. This will be accomplished with descriptions of new species from museum collections, investigations into anatomical changes in ancestral palaeoniscoids and descendants, and reconstructing evolutionary relationships among palaeoniscoids and living fishes. \r\n\r\nKnowledge of relationships of fossil ray-finned fishes (palaeoniscoids) will provide a better understanding of the early evolution of today's living fishes.  Fossil fishes most closely related to today's forms will be identified.  Anatomical features identified in this project can affect many areas of study into today's fishes by identifying the ancestral condition for ray-finned fishes.  In addition, lessons describing what can be learned from fossil fishes will be created for elementary school students.",

Fossil lower actinopterygians, or non-teleostean fossil fishes, are critical to understanding the early evolution of actinopterygians but these fishes are poorly understood.  This project focused on a subset of these fossil fishes, the palaeoniscoid actinopterygians.  The main goal of this project was to form a better understanding of palaeoniscoids by concentrating on descriptions of new taxa, reassessments of morphological characters, and phylogenetic analyses to investigate the evolutionary relationships of taxa ranging from the Devonian to the recent.  By concentrating on the morphology of these fishes and phylogenetic analyses, a greater understanding of palaeoniscoid fishes was formed  \n\nThe taxonomic portion of the project was successful and resulted in the description of four new taxa.  One taxon described is the earliest occurrence of a specific genus in North America, and only the second discovery of this type of fish in North America. \n\nThe investigations into morphological characters were also successful.  A skull bone, the preoperculum, was examined across an array of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and recent fishes.  This project concluded that this cheek bone is more diverse than previously thought.  It was also the first time this morphological character was examined within a phylogenetic context.  These findings were presented at national and international meetings to other paleoichthyologists and published in a book series dedicated to paleoichthyology. \n\nOne of the most important outcomes of this project dealt with the recognition that there is no standardization in how bones of the snout region of palaeoniscoids are identified and named.  The same bone names are used to identify very different bones.  This is problematic because it makes comparing taxa described by different researchers difficult, impairs our understanding of the morphological diversity of palaeoniscoids, and presents potential pitfalls when building character matrices for analyses into phylogenetic relationships. A fundamental problem with the different ways bones have been identified is that homology has not always taken into consideration.  Homology refers to similarity between structures due to common inheritance.

This portion of the project will be submitted for publication in a symposium volume dealing with advances in morphological studies of fishes. The findings of this portion of the study do not just apply to palaeoniscoids and the call for the id..."
