 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes program of the Chemistry Division is co-funded by the Biomolecular Systems Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. The award supports work by Professor Michelle Chang at the University of California, Berkeley to develop synthetic biology approaches to engineering microbes for new chemical function. The project focuses on designing and building pathways for the production of second-generation biofuels in Escherichia coli, with the overall goal of using engineered pathways to help understand the design principles that drive metabolic networks in vivo. Problems associated with heterologous pathway construction as well as how foreign synthetic pathways interact with the host metabolic machinery will be examined. The development and implementation of \"Chemistry and Sustainability\" educational modules seeks to build awareness of issues at the science/society interface in young students at the K-5 level and promote science education and literacy in local elementary schools. The overall goal of the integrated research and education program is focused on forming deeper connections between chemistry, sustainability, and society. The research component of the program is aimed at increasing the understanding of how chemistry works inside the cell while exploring the cell as a green alternative for sustainable synthetic chemistry. In education, this project seeks to attract youth to scientific disciplines and emphasize the importance of science to everyday life.",

However, the growing impact of chemical industry on the environment has highlighted the need to develop new and sustainable approaches to scalable chemical processes. Biological systems provide a unique solution to the sustainable production of chemicals since they are capable of rapidly and efficiently transforming simple renewable materials such as glucose into complex molecules under ambient and non-toxic conditions. As such, cells can be genetically engineered to achieve the transformation of these rewable carbon feedstocks to value-added chemicals such as fuels, drugs, and other fine and commodity chemicals if we better understood how to design and build novel biosynthetic pathways inside a microbial host.A major challenge in this area is that cells utilize a complex network of metabolic reactions that are regulated at many levels by cellular decision making. Thus a deeper understanding of the systems-level organization of these metabolic networks is needed to provide the framework for cellular synthesis as well as to yield new fundamental insights into metabolic function and homeostasis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One major area in which microbial synthesis has been tapped is the production of liquid transportation fuels from rewewable plant biomass resources. Although the biofuel pipeline has the promise to contribute to the replacement of fossil fuel energy sources as well as improving net energy and carbon usage, many changes are required in the overall process in order to reach these goals. The current biofuel infrastructure is dedicated to ethanol production due to our expertise in its manufacture as well as the efficiency of its production by yest, but its molecular properties make it a less than ideal fuel candidate. In this projet, we focused on the the design and engineering of a synthetic pathway to produce a second-generation biofuel, <em>n</em>-butanol, iwth improved fuel properites compared to ethanol. Using a design that incorporated a kinetic trap in order to pull carbon flux to completion, we engineered a pathway in a bacterium at titers of 8-10 g/L at lab-scale (&lt;90% yield from glucose) under aerobic or oxygenic conditions&nbsp;(Figure 1). However, anaerobic conditions are preferable for industrial production for numerous practical reasons and we have shown that this pathway is limited by the availability of an important&nbsp;building block, acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), in the absence of oxgyen, offering a unique opportunity to use our synthetic pathway to understand regulation at this key metabolic node (Figure 2). We took two approaches to this goal, one was to study the <em>in vivo </em>regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) that generates acetyl-CoA under aerobic conditions but is turned off under anaerobic conditions. We used n-butanol titers as a synthetic phenotype to examine regulation of PDHc activity in living cells (Figure 3). We were also able to design and implement a genetic selection for n-butanol production that allowed us to evolve strains for improved flux through acetyl-CoA under anaerobic conditions (Figure 4). These studies provide a platform for designing strains for production of compounds from acetyl-CoA, which include a wide range of fuels, drugs, and commodity chemicals, as well as understanding the regulation of key metabolic nodes in living cells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michelle&nbsp;Chang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956161/0956161_10017480_1497298890815_Figure1Butanolpathway--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956161/0956161_10017480_1497298890815_Figure1Butanolpathway--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1. n-Butanol synthetic pathway\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956161/0956161_10017480_1497298890815_Figure1Butanolpathway--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1. n-Butanol synthetic pathway\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A synthetic pathway for the second-generation fuel, n-butanol, for its production in engineered E. coli</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michelle Chang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michelle&nbsp;Chang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1. n-Butanol synthetic pathway</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956161/0956161_10017480_1497299069504_Figure2Metabolicmap--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0956161/0956161_10017480_1497299069504_Figure2Metabolicmap--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
