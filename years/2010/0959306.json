The XRD will support research requiring mineral phase identification and crystallographic structure refinements and will be outfitted with a temperature controlled sample stage to allow for kinetic studies.  The SEM equipped WDS will allow for microchemical analysis of solid materials. PI research will include studies of arsenic speciation in aquifer rocks and groundwaters from northern Vermont to evaluate toxicity and sources.  An existing FTIR will support this research.  Other research application of requested instruments will include studies of Quaternary climate as recorded in lake and marine sediments and soil minerals.  The requested instruments will support PI research and undergraduate student research training at this liberal arts college located in Vermont, an EPSCoR state, as well as collaborators from regional institutions.    The grant is well aligned with ARRA goals as the equipment to be purchased will be through instrument manufacturer U.S. sales offices that support U.S. employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n***",
