 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to accurately remember information is central to human success. Yet, as new information is added every day, the human brain's expanding storehouse of memories requires continual restructuring. How can the massive influx of new information be used to best advantage? With funding from the National Science Foundation, Ken Paller, Ph.D., of Northwestern University is investigating the intriguing hypothesis that brain events during sleep are instrumental for effective memory storage. Although some memories rapidly fade away, others endure for years, presumably because of a progression of changes in brain networks. It remains unclear how memories are enduringly stored in the human brain, and to what extent sleep might be helpful. This project explores a novel way in which memory storage can be improved. Specific sounds related to information learned previously are presented softly while an individual sleeps. These sounds can in theory prompt memory rehearsal during sleep, leading to an improvement in memory tested a short time after awakening. The procedures thus provide an opportunity to observe a potential benefit of sleep -- memory strengthening that could underlie lasting memory storage. This project explores the procedures whereby these \"sleep-sounds\" are effective, including (a) determining whether long-lasting memory improvement can be produced by sleep-sounds, (b) comparing learning of spatial locations, of words, and of specific manual actions, and (c) showing which stages of sleep are amenable to this memory strengthening. Experiments also compare the memory strengthening that is possible when participants are awake versus asleep. Electroencephalographic measures of brain activity are included in the project to further elucidate the brain mechanisms of memory improvement during sleep. Although it is widely thought that new information cannot be learned during sleep, information learned before going to sleep can apparently be rehearsed during sleep. This project provides new evidence about how a period of sleep can lead to memory improvement and how that improvement can be focused on specific information.\r\n\r\nResults obtained through this project provide new leverage on understanding memory storage in general, and memory processing during sleep in particular. This project is expanding knowledge about the special role that sleep can play in the stabilization of memories and in the formation of interconnections among these memories that can be the basis for creative thinking. By advancing understanding of how memories are strengthened during sleep, implications will ultimately arise for promoting optimal educational outcomes in the classroom, enhancing the daily acquisition of new information and skills, and evaluating memory in legal contexts, among other applications. An appreciation of sleep and learning will also aid efforts to emphasize the importance of suitable amounts of sleep for public health.",
