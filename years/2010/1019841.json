 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project continues a collaboration between MIT's Center for Educational Computing Initiatives and TERC focusing on the enhancement of K-12 STEM math and science education by means of technology that supports (1) creation of what are termed \"ink inscriptions\"--handwritten sketches, graphs, maps, notes, etc. made on a computer using a pen-based interface, and (2) in-class communication of ink inscriptions via a set of connected wireless tablet computers. The project builds on the PIs' prior work, which demonstrated that both teachers and students benefit from such technology because they can easily draw and write on a tablet screens, thus using representations not possible with only a typical keyboard and mouse; and they can easily send such ink inscriptions to one another via wireless connectivity. This communication provides teachers the opportunity to view all the students' work and make decisions about which to share anonymously on a public classroom screen or on every student's screen in order to support discussion in a \"conversation-based\" classroom.  Artificial intelligence methods are used to analyze ink inscriptions in order to facilitate selection and discussion of student work.\r\n\r\nThe project is a series of design experiments beginning with the software that emerged from earlier exploratory work. The PIs conduct two cycles of experiments to examine how tablets affect students learning in 4th and 5th grade mathematics and science.  The project research questions and methods focus on systematic monitoring of teachers' and students' responses to the innovation in order to inform the development process. The PIs collect data on teachers' and students' use of the technology and on student learning outcomes and use those data as empirical evidence about the promise of the technology for improving STEM education in K-12 schools.  An external evaluator uses parallel data collection, conducting many of the same research activities as the core team and independently providing analysis to be correlated with other data.  His involvement is continuous and provides formative evaluation reports to the project through conferences, site visits, and conference calls.  \r\n\r\nThe primary products are substantiated research findings on the use of tablet computers, inscriptions, and networks in 4th and 5 grade classrooms.  In addition the PIs develop models for teacher education and use, and demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence techniques in facilitating use of the technology.  With the addition of Malden Public Schools to the list of participating districts, which includes Cambridge Public Schools and Waltham Public Schools from earlier work, the project expands the field test sites to up 20 schools' classrooms.",

The project, a collaboration between math educators at TERC and computer scientists at MIT, developed and tested novel pen-based digital tools in elementary math, focusing on multiplication and division&mdash;difficult concepts in which visual representations can play a key role.</p>\n<p>With our Classroom Learning Partner (CLP) tablet-computer-based software, students use a combination of digital tools and freehand drawing to create and manipulate mathematical representations in electronic &ldquo;notebooks&rdquo;. Students choose from several digital tools to create representations that accurately reflect mathematical quantities and operations; they then use the tablet pen to annotate these representations by drawing, writing, and highlighting. Figures 1 through 3 are examples of student work from a third-grade class studying multiplication and division.&nbsp; Figure 1 illustrates the use of the array tool to model a multiplication problem using skip counting; Figure 2 shows how a student used a number line to work on a division problem; and Figure 3 shows how the stamp tool allowed a student to organize her work on a complex problem by drawing and reproducing images of the objects referenced in the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When they are done, students wirelessly submit their work to their teacher, who can view all students&rsquo; work simultaneously on her own tablet.&nbsp; Looking at student work in this way can help a teacher see common misunderstandings, identify students who might need specific kinds of help, and choose examples of alternate problem-solving strategies for class discussion.&nbsp; CLP includes tools for combining multiple pieces of student work into a single projected display to facilitate student discussion.</p>\n<p>Viewing student work in real time in a classroom, however, can be overwhelming&mdash;even in a class of 20 students, teachers can receive over a hundred submissions of student work in a single class period.&nbsp; To support teachers in using student work, we developed machine analysis routines that can provide insights into the mathematical thinking that is revealed through the way students create and manipulate mathematical representations. &nbsp;Teachers can use the information provided by these analysis routines to focus class discussion on interesting examples of student work, identify students who are struggling, or gauge understanding of a class as a whole. In the analysis depicted in Figure 4, for example, CLP has noted that the student created an appropriate array representation for the problem but then skip-counted by the wrong dimension.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1CxSpFirst\">Designing software that can automatically analyze student work, but that also gives students the freedom to create their own representations, poses a challenge. We met this challenge in the INK-12 project by developing digital tools that strike a balance between the structure needed for machine analysis and the freedom to draw and annotate using &ldquo;digital ink&rdquo;. Figure 5 shows an example of a student combining what the array tool produces (a well-drawn array with dimensions specified by the student) with freehand annotation.&nbsp; In this example, the student drew a horizontal line across the array, labeled each of the resulting smaller arrays and included skip counting numbers down the right side of one of the smaller arrays. The combination of tool-produced and pen-drawn representations illustrates a partial product strategy for solving the original problem, 8 X 8.</p>\n<p>Using CLP, we conducted classroom trials in 12 schools and 5 school districts in the Boston area, working with 17 teachers and over 800 students; trials ranged in length from one week to five weeks.&nbsp; In the most extensive experience, a five-week trial in a third-grade classroom, we compared assessment scores among three classes, the experimental classroom, which used CLP, &nbsp;and two other third grade classrooms in the same school.&nbsp; The experimental classroom&rsquo;s gain scores on an end of unit assessment of multiplication and division were statistically significantly higher than those of the other two classrooms.&nbsp; Additional analysis revealed that students in the experimental classroom were more likely to use visual representations in completing the assessment and had a wider range of strategies for solving problems.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andee&nbsp;Rubin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
