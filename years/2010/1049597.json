 "awd_abstract_narration": "Midwest Verification Day (MVD) is an informal regional workshop, started by the PIs in 2009, with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods.  A chief concern is to provide a forum for students to present their formal-methods research in a supportive setting, and network with colleagues at other regional institutions.  The program for MVD, spanning one and a half days, will consist mostly of student talks, but also include two invited talks by senior researchers.  A social program is also planned, to encourage interaction among students and faculty.  MVD is colocating with a local-chapter IEEE meeting on industrial formal methods, presented by industrial researchers from nearby Rockwell Collins.\r\n\r\nMVD will foster collaboration, student development, recruiting, and exchange of ideas in formal methods and verification, in the Midwest region of the country.  Experience with similar events in other fields strongly suggests they play a crucial role in creating a vibrant regional research community, and offer invaluable opportunities for students.  MVD will help develop talent within the region, and attract it from outside, in the industrially important area of verification.  By connecting students with faculty from other regional institutions, MVD will strengthen opportunities for undergraduates to go on to graduate study, and help prepare regional graduate students for success in the international research community.  The industrial connection with the local-IEEE meeting and Rockwell Collins will contribute to the long-term development of economically important interactions between industry and academia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMidwest Verification Day (MVD) is a regional workshop addressing the\ntopic of verification, a field of Computer Science concerned with\nadvanced methods for ensuring the quality of systems including\nsoftware, hardware, communication protocols, and other formal\ncomputational artifacts.  Methods include automatically finding\nsoftware errors, proving that software will always exhibit some\ndesired (and formally specified) behavior, and many variations on\nthose themes.  The goal of MVD is to bring together researchers\nworking on different approaches to verification, from the Midwest\nregion of the country.  The emphasis of the workshop is on giving\nstudents, primarily at the graduate level but also undergraduates, a\nchance to present their research in front of a supportive audience,\nand make new connections with colleagues in the field.  MVD was first\norganized by Prof. Aaron Stump and Prof. Cesare Tinelli at The\nUniversity of Iowa in 2009.  This report concerns the second edition\nof the workshop, held in 2010 at The University of Iowa.  Since then,\na third edition has been held September, 2011, at The University of\nMinnesota, organized by Prof.  Michael Whalen and Dr. Andrew Gacek.  A\nfourth edition for 2012 is being planned (at the time of this\nwriting).\n\nAround 50 people attended MVD '10 as registered participants: 10\nUniversity professors, 6 industrial researchers, 4 postdoctoral\nresearchers, and 30 students, almost all at the doctoral level.  These\nattendees came from many different institutions in the Midwest and\nnearby states: Iowa State, Purdue, Rice, Rockwell Collins, The\nUniversity of Iowa, The University of Kansas, The University of\nColorado at Boulder, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nThe University of Minnesota, The University of Missouri, The\nUniversity of Nebraska at Lincoln, and The University of Northern\nIowa.  Support was also provided by Rockwell Collins and NEC Labs,\nwith Dr. Nishant Sinha of NEC Labs giving one of the two invited\ntalks; the other was given by Prof. Jan Vitek of Purdue.  The funds\nprovided by the NSF were used to give travel grants to these\nattendees, with almost all awards going to students and postdoctoral\nresearchers.\n\nMVD 2010 succeeded in its goal of creating a vibrant intellectual\nmeeting, in a supportive and welcoming Midwest environment.  Many\nattendees commented on the high quality of the student presentations,\nand there were many lively interactions between researchers and\nstudents meeting for the first time, or renewing previous\nacquaintances.  MVD 2010 made a valuable contribution to the goal of\ncreating a strong regional research network in verification, with\nindustrial connections.  Such a network will help strengthen regional\ncollaborations among faculty, and networking and employment\nopportunities for students. For the significant number of students who\noriginate in the Midwest, MVD helps build the connections to advance\nfurther in academia or make a strong contribution in industry. This in\nturn helps strengthen the domestic talent pool for verification and\nadvanced software engineering, with the long-term goal of\nstrengthening the position of the United States in this industrially\nimportant area of Computer Science.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aaron D Stump"
