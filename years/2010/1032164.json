 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anumba 1032164\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for PI Anumba Chimay from Pennsylvania State University to organize a 4-day international workshop on the use of computing and information technology (IT) as driver of new innovations in the area of sustainable buildings. The workshop will be held in Abuja, Nigeria from Nov. 29 - Dec. 2, 2010. The goal of the workshop is to create a cooperative framework which will allow US and Nigerian researchers to partner on new projects dealing with sustainable buildings using the Nigerian environment as a natural laboratory for studies and experiments. The workshop is also intended to result in improved understanding of the technical challenges involved in engendering a culture of innovation and sustainability in a developing country. Dr. Valentine Ekechukwu, professor at the University of Nigeria and Director for Innovation and Research at the Nigerian Universities Commission will work closely with Dr. Chimay in the organization of this workshop. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Global Center of Excellence in Computing is also providing some support and will post the workshop outcomes on its website.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The primary goal of the workshop is to advance fundamental research in the interrelated areas of innovation and sustainability through their integration based on the use of computing and Information Technology (IT). The first step in this process is the creation of a cooperative framework, which will allow US researchers to work with their Nigerian partners on sustainability using the Nigerian environment as a perfect natural laboratory for studies and experiments, particularly those related to solar power. The next step will involve developing research partnerships (during the workshop and immediately after it), resulting in the submission of a joint NSF PIRE proposal.  The PIs expect that the outcome of the workshop will be a number of joint research projects addressing fundamental research questions, both theoretical and experimental, in the area of sustainability, questions which could not be answered without access to the Nigerian research talents and environment.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. Pennsylvania State University has a well-developed Global Engagement Nodes (GENs) program that has provision for a service learning component, a model that will be used formulate the US-Nigeria collaboration discussions at the workshop.  Graduate students and junior scientists will receive support to participate in the workshop.  As the first NSF workshop in Nigeria being organized in cooperation with the National Universities Commission, its impact on the Nigerian researchers will be significant and will lead to a renewed interest in cooperation with the American scholars and institutions.  The workshop materials will be distributed by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and specifically by the ASCE Global Center of Excellence in Computing, which is helping with the organization of the workshop. The materials will be made available on the Center's website (www.asceglobalcenter.org) and will be promoted by the Center.  Since the Center has members on all continents, the PI expects a global impact.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering's Africa, Near East and South Asia Program.",
