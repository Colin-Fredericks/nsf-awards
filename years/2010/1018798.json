A key feature of such systems is that they are\r\noften deployed in safety-critical scenarios and hence designing\r\nsuch systems with provable guarantees is very\r\nimportant.

As more complex hybrid systems are considered, limiting\r\nsafety properties to a set of unsafe states, as in current methods,\r\nconsiderably restricts the ability of designers to adequately\r\nexpress the desired safe behavior of the system. To allow\r\nfor more sophisticated properties, researchers have advocated\r\nthe use of linear temporal logic (LTL), which makes it possible\r\nto express temporal safety properties. This proposal develops\r\nalgorithmic tools for safety analysis of embedded\r\nand hybrid systems operating under the effect of exogenous inputs\r\nand for LTL specifications.  The problem addressed\r\nis the following: Given a hybrid system and a safety specification\r\ndescribed using LTL, can a feasible trajectory be constructed\r\nfor the system that violates the specification, when such a\r\ntrajectory exists? The problem is called the falsification problem.\r\nThe broader impact of the project is implemented through\r\ncourse development, involvement in research activities of\r\nundergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, efforts to\r\nmentor underrepresented groups, and dissemination of concepts\r\nthrough educational software developed at Rice.",
