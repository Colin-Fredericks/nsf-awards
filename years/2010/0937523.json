Construction of the LAMOST facility is complete, and the telescope is undergoing engineering tests. The principal investigator, with previous NSF support, has established close collaborative ties with the Chinese leadership of the project, and has been a member of the working group tasked with defining the Galactic survey, one of two major projects to be undertaken in LAMOST's initial years of operation. Funding of this project will permit establishment of a partnership between US astronomers and LAMOST. This partnership will formalize participation in the Galactic survey and guarantee the ability of US researchers who join the PLUS collaboration to propose and be PIs on 10% of LAMOST key projects, and to have early access to data.",

As a result of this collaboration, 16 Chinese scholars traveled to the US to work with US astronomers on Milky Way science, and US astronomers contributed to the design of the LAMOST spectroscopic survey of Milky Way stars.  Nine US astronomers were granted the same rights to use data from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey as our Chinese colleagues enjoy, based on their technical and scientific contributions to the Chinese survey.  The head of this project (Heidi Jo Newberg) was named as the head of the Key Project to map the substructure of the Milky Way stellar halo; the substructure is formed by small galaxies falling into the Milky Way and being ripped apart by the Milky Way gravity so that the small galaxies' stars are pulled out into long streams and are then incorporated into our galaxy.\n\nAt the completion of this project, a total of 5,755,126 spectra,  of which 3,177,995 are spectra of Milky Way stars with sufficient quality to measure the properties of the stars, are available to the collaboration in Data Release 3 (DR3).

Many of these are repeated observations of the same  object, so that of the total of ~3.9 million spectra of stars, a total of  roughly 3.1 million individual stars have been observed.\n\nThis project introduced 14 undergraduate students to astronomy research for the first time.  Many of these students have gone on to successful graduate school careers; some went directly to STEM employment and others are still undergraduate students.  It also partially supported two high school research projects.  One of the high school students was named a finalist in the Intel Science Talent Search 2013 and is now studying astronomy in college.\n\nThe grant contributed to the publication of 36 research papers published in refereed journals.  These papers described the Chinese LAMOST survey, measured the properties of the stars in the Milky Way's disk and in star streams in the halo, cataloged unusual stars in our galaxy, and developed techniques for better astronomical calibrations.  Below we describe the results four noteworthy papers from this list.\n\nThe paper \"LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE) &mdash; The survey's science plan\" by Deng et al.
