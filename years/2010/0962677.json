 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feeding systems are the energy-acquiring systems of humans and other primates. The teeth, jaws, and muscles, are the proximal interface between primates and their environments.  Therefore, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape those components is essential to understanding the adaptation and evolution of primates. This work tests hypotheses and models relating diversity in the primate feeding system to size-related changes in food intake rate. It documents how shape and movements of the mandible, the size and architecture of the jaw muscles, and the amount of food an animal eats in a single bite change with body size to meet size-required changes in food intake rate of primates. These data will be collected using computed tomography (CT) scanning of primate mandibles, anatomical studies of primate chewing muscles, and behavioral studies of primates feeding in captivity. Mathematical models of the feeding system will be tested, modified and improved, then used to examine how feeding system designs in different evolutionary groups of primates balance trade-offs between advantages of bite force production, chewing speed and gape. \r\n\r\nThis research will create novel and important data sets that can be accessed in the future by other researchers interested in feeding biomechanics, bone biomechanics, and musculoskeletal systems in general. The investigators will continue to recruit under-represented minority and female undergraduates to receive training and mentoring in research and advice on their paths to graduate, medical, and other professional schools.  These students will collaborate in all aspects of the work, including presentation and publication. The PIs will continue their outreach programs to local schools and their synergistic activities with other NSF-funded projects.",

One of the factors that influences food intake rate in primates is chewing frequency (i.e., how fast primates chew). A biomechanical model, the \"spring model\", was advanced to predict size-correlated changes in chew cycle duration in primates (Ross et al., 2009). This model did a good job predicting the scaling of chew cycle duration in primates but assumed that jaw-muscle physiologic cross-sectional area (PCSA, which is proportional to maximum muscle force) increases at a faster rate relative to increase in body mass.\n\nThe goals of this research at Duke University were to quantify fiber architecture of the chewing muscles in a large primate sample and to determine the functional and scaling relationships of fiber length and physiologic cross-sectional area within higher level groups (e.g., primates, strepsirrhines and anthropoids) and between closely-related species.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we quantified muscle mass, fiber length, pinnation angle, PCSA and in situ sarcomere length for the chewing muscles in a large sample of primates varying in body size, feeding behavior and diet.\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nOur research on jaw-muscle fiber architecture confirmed there is no single scaling relationship between jaw-muscle PCSA and body mass that characterizes all primate groups.  We found that jaw-muscle fiber length and PCSA increase nearly proportionally with increase in body mass in anthropoid primates, but increase at a faster rate relative to body mass in extant apes and modern humans.  By contrast, these same variables increase at a slower rate relative to body mass in New World monkeys. These findings indicate that the larger bodied apes have a relative advantage for producing muscle and bite forces as compared to smaller bodied apes, while larger bodied New World monkeys are actually at a relative disadvantage for producing muscle and bite forces as compared with smaller-bodied New World monkeys. Collectively, these findings suggest the spring model may not be an accurate predictor of the scaling of chew cycle duration and encourage exploration of alternative models.\n\nModern humans have undergone a relative reduction in masseter PCSA compared to small- and large-bodied apes, but retain relatively long muscle fibers.  These findings suggest that modern humans have sacrifice masseter muscle force during chewing but without appreciably altering muscle stretch. \n\nWe also found that using skeletal measurements of the skull to estimate jaw-muscle PCSAs in extant apes resulted in underestimates by as much as 67% and overestimates by as much as 14%, confirming the difficulty of accurately estimating functional variables of the jaw-closing muscles using skeletal measures.\n\nOur research on the functional correlates of the jaw muscles and bony anatomy in adult male and female macaques revealed that male macaques have features that favor muscle stretch and the ability to open the mouth widely as compared with females.

Combined with bony measurements of the skull on the same specimens, this database has substantially improved our knowledge of how primate feeding-system anatomy has remodeled and adapted to meet the demands of both feeding and non-feeding oral behaviors. This database will provide realistic input data for biomechanical models of feeding systems in living primates and for interpreting the functional and adaptive significance of feeding system anatomy in the fo..."
