  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2010 AAAI Robotics Workshop and Exhibition addressed the need for\n\nintegration between the artificial intelligence research that focuses\n\non controlled simulations and robotics research that focuses on\n\nadapting to real world situations.   The full day workshop, \"Enabling\n\nIntelligence through Middleware\", discussed the role of software in\n\nallowing investments to be reused across the research community.   The\n\noutcome of this workshop was an article that compared and contrasted\n\nsoftware strategies and highlighted future goals in robotics software.\n\n The exhibition, held over three days, contained both challenges and\n\nexhibits.    The challenges are important because they allow\n\nresearchers to benchmark different approaches to several important\n\nproblems in identical conditions.  The small-scale mobile manipulation\n\nchallenge consisted of intelligent chess-playing robots that\n\nidentified the opponent\u2019s move, determined the next best move and used\n\na robot hand to move the correct piece to the new position.  Although\n\nchess may appear to be a \"toy\" problem, it was selected because the\n\ncomponent skills (manipulation while moving and visual identification)\n\nare key to successfully using robots in safety and security\n\napplications (i.e. searching car trunks and glove compartments).   The\n\nlearning by demonstration challenge focused on the techniques needed\n\nto successfully teach robots to perform tasks that would be too\n\ndangerous for humans to undertake.   The third challenge focused\n\neducating new computer scientists and roboticists by providing simpler\n\nproblems less advanced students.  Having students solve simpler\n\nproblems works well because not only do students get the experience of\n\nusing their robot algorithms outside of the lab, but students also\n\nparticipate in the workshop and exhibition, giving them important\n\naccess to advanced techniques and researchers.  The exhibition\n\nshowcased the robots and researchers involved in the challenges.   The\n\nexhibition consisted of research groups from 20 schools.  The\n\nexhibition was open to both conference attendees and the public.  One\n\nof the highlights of the exhibition was having high students play\n\ngames of chess against the intelligent robots.\n\n \n\nThe NSF funds were used to provide partial travel support to students\n\nand researchers involved in the workshop, challenges and exhibitions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ayanna Howard"
