 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three Symposia entitled \"NSF Catalyzed Innovations in the Undergraduate Curriculum,\" are being organized and convened at the Fall National Meetings of the American Chemical Society (ACS) to be held in Boston, MA (2010), Denver, CO (2011), and Philadelphia, PA (2012). Three Symposia entitled \"NSF Programs That Support Undergraduate Education,\" are being organized and convened at three different Spring Regional Meetings in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Since 1987, Symposia sponsored by the National Science Foundation have been a part of the Division of Chemical Education (CHED) Program at the Fall National Meetings of the American Chemical Society. Each Symposium has provided a forum for the dissemination and discussion of innovative projects made possible through the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement, the Course and Curriculum Development, and the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement-Adaptation and Implementation - Phase I, and current -Type 1 Programs. These Symposia have been well attended and both anecdotal and survey evidence suggest they have been responsible for numerous curricular changes at other institutions. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  Recipients of recent (last five years) Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement-Phase I or -Type 1 awards are invited to discuss the innovations and improvements that have been implemented into the undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum at their colleges and universities. The Symposia highlight innovative projects that have been pivotal in curricular reforms by providing a forum for discussion between those who have carried out the innovations and those just beginning to explore the means to implement changes. At the Regional Meetings, programs in addition to CCLI offered by the Division of Undergraduate Education are highlighted with the same expected outcomes as the Symposia at the National Meetings.\r\n \r\nBroader Impact.  The Symposia provide a means of dissemination for successful CCLI projects to a broader audience than might otherwise be possible. Faculty members at National ACS Meetings often attend sessions dealing with their research areas at the expense of sessions dealing with science education issues. These Symposia provide a forum in which valuable information is presented in a relatively compact timeframe and at one location. The Symposia at Regional Meetings provide exposure of NSF programs to faculty, especially those at two-year institutions, who may not attend a National Meeting for a variety of reasons. Personal contacts made at the Symposia are often pursued at a later date. The on-going website at http://www.radford.edu/nsfsymposium has provided a convenient source for information about a variety of NSF-sponsored projects, NSF programs, and department and individual results concerning a wide variety of innovations made in the undergraduate curriculum.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe goal of this award was to organize symposia at three American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall National Meetings, ACS Regional Meetings, and other venues as appropriate.  These symposia would provide information to the educational community about the various programs within the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) that support undergraduate education.  The objectives were to provide a forum for dissemination of successful projects, to encourage audience members to consider curricular innovations at their institution based on the presentations in the symposia, and to encourage others within the community to submit proposals to the NSF or other funding agencies from their institution.  Symposia were held at five rather than three ACS Fall National Meetings (2010, Boston, MA; 2011, Denver, CO; 2012, Philadelphia, PA; 2013, Indianapolis, IN; and 2014, San Francisco, CA), two ACS Regional Meetings (2010, Southeast/Southwest, New Orleans, LA; 2013, Northeast, Rochester, NY), and the Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (2014, Grand Rapids, MI).  There were over 100 presentations describing a wide variety of projects within the CCLI-Type 1 and TUES-Type 1 programs at National Meetings and within the CCLI-Type 2, TUES-Type 2, S-STEM, STEP, ATE, Noyce Scholarship, WIDER, and NSDL programs at Regional Meetings and the BCCE.  In addition to these presentations, at National Meetings and the BCCE, a Program Officer from NSF provided a summary of programs both within DUE and across other divisions of NSF.  At the Regional Meetings, a former Program Officer (Rotator) provided the overview.  A question/answer/discussion session after the Program Officer presentations allowed for further exchange of information.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe individual presentations in the symposia consisted of a comprehensive and diverse set of successful awards from DUE over a five-year period.  These included presentations from CCLI-Type 1 awards which were more focused toward smaller local projects, to TUES-Type 1 that were broader in scope, to S-STEM and STEP scholarship programs designed to entice more students into STEM majors and to provide support services to help them be successful, to the NOYCE scholarship program whose goal is to provide financial support for STEM students interested in primary and/or secondary school teaching, to the ATE program designed to increase the number of STEM technicians ready to enter high-tech fields or to continue toward an advanced degree in a STEM discipline, and the NSDL that has developed digital, online resources for virtually any faculty member at any educational level, K-adult.   Presenters were a diverse group, including faculty members from over 100 institutions including two-year community colleges, historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, and four-year private and public colleges and universities, including both predominantly undergraduate and R-1 institutions.  Our audience was just as diverse and included faculty members from all of the types of institutions described above.  Symposia at Regional Meetings and the BCCE were intended to reach more faculty members at two-year institutions as they are more likely to attend regional meetings than national ones partially due to the expenses involved.\n\nTo illustrate the broad nature of the symposium, the following is a list of presentations at the National meetings that are interdisciplinary or could be applied to any specific discipline:\n\n2010\n\nBRAIDing together the science disciplines, Sweeder.\n\nFive years of change in the MTSU general education STEM curriculum: Where we began, where we are now, and where we are going, Iriarte-Gross, Weller, and Greer.\n\n2011\n\nOpening the teaching pipeline for STEM majors at UCLA, Russell and Rudd.\n\nCyber Peer Led Team Learning cPLTL, Varma-Nelson.\n\nCreating a learning community for solutions to climate change, Jorgensen, Hassenzahl, Blockstein, ..."
