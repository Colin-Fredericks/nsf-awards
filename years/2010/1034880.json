 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable the broader impacts of a seminal text that is the main output of a recent NSF-supported meeting of experts in October 2009. The objective of this book is to provide a new conceptual understanding of how human communities live with the dangers of sudden environmental change. The research team will utilize the deep time perspectives provided by their interdisciplinary approaches to provide a rich temporal context to the human experience of environmental hazards and impacts. The research team envisions the book as a seminal volume on these issues for use in a variety of college courses that stress interdisciplinary studies. The approach of the book is to provide eight separate case studies, each examining how one past human community has faced the impacts of environmental change. Different stories of resilience and vulnerability are told and as the book develops, key lessons for successful disaster management emerge.  These case studies will be followed by two incisive overview chapters that develop policy implications and will directly inform disaster management strategies for Government and Non-Governmental Aid Agencies. \r\n\r\nThe majority of specialist contributors to this book work in areas where many of the issues raised are directly relevant for modern day communities. Through existing collaborative partnerships the research team will distribute the book to indigenous leaders and local community activists so that there is a direct dialogue between the scientific and indigenous communities. NSF support to enable this dissemination of the book will enable people who are threatened by sudden environmental change to engage in ongoing debates while also engaging the people who plan future mitigation strategies to learn very important lessons from the past.  In addition, the subvention of publication costs will allow the book to be accessible in soft back to students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF grant # 1034880 \"Living with the Dangers of Sudden Environmental Change\" was awarded to Dr. Payson Sheets, Anthropology, University of Colorado, Boulder.  The grant provided subvention funds ($20,000, plus $5200 indirect costs) to maximize dissemination of research results from a NSF-sponsored conference held at Eagle Hill, Maine, in 2009.  The support of Dr. Anna Kerttula, Arctic Social Sciences Program, is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nIntellectual Merits: The discussions and presentations at the working conference were so successful that Dr. Jago Cooper and Payson Sheets decided to publish a book of lessons from archaeology regarding sustainability and resilience of ancient peoples in the face of significant environmental changes.  Many cases were explored where ancient societies learned where and how to construct environmentally appropriate housing, and how to encode hazard awareness and disaster behavior into their cultures and even religions.\n\nBroader Impacts: A deep committment was made by the group to disseminate research results beyond our academic disciplines.   Each chapter author was required to write a section on the lessons to be learned from past societies, and write that without jargon to the broader public.  Of particular interest is communicating with decision-makers in various countries around the world: planners, politicians, and others.\n\nTo maximize distribution the subvention was intended to decrease the cost of the paperback book, and that was successful at $19.95.   And it was intended to make the e-book maximally available.  That also was successful, at $4.95.   In addition, the University Press of Colorado agreed to make a free downloadable PDF available, and that is accessible by anyone in the world from the press website.   It was not easy to find a press willing to take the risks involved with inexpensive e-books and free PDF downloads, but fortunately an innovative press was found, and the book was published in all three formats in February of 2012.\n\nThe book is titled  Surviving Sudden Environmental Change: Answers from Archaeology.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Payson Sheets"
