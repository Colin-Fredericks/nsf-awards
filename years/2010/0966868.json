Analogous to far-field situations, it is expected that engineered nanostructures can interact with thermally-emitted waves, allowing one to tailor near-field radiation heat transfer rates. This research seeks to identify ways to achieve desirable near-field thermal radiation properties by modifying surfaces using nanostructures. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Experimental and theoretical approaches will be taken to investigate the fundamental physical mechanisms of near-field thermal radiation heat transfer between nanostructured surfaces. Quantitative measurement of the near-field transfer between two parallel plates with or without engineered nanostructures, will be made. A theoretical model will be developed, based on fluctuational electrodynamics, to predict the near-field thermal radiation transfer between such surfaces. The theoretical aspect of the research will improve the fundamental understanding of near-field interactions between thermally emitted electromagnetic waves and nanostructures due to surface plasmon resonance, scattering, diffraction, and photon localization. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Controlling the near-field thermal radiation between nanostructured surfaces may provide a unique opportunity to realize a near-field thermophotovoltaic energy conversion system with high power output. Outcomes of the proposed research will be incorporated into a new graduate course designed to expose engineering students to recent developments in heat transfer research related to nanotechnology and renewable energy. The PI will also conduct K-12 outreach through established programs at the University of Pittsburgh.",
