 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University is conducting a May 2010 two-day workshop that will bring together \"Next Generation\" (NextGen) science communicators (writers, journalists, bloggers, documentary filmmakers, museum professionals); NextGen scholars/researchers in science and technology policy; and publication editors. The goals are: to help improve the communications skills of these professionals, to encourage collaborations of communicators and scholars, and, ultimately, to help the public gain a better understanding of the policy dimensions of STEM by encouraging more effective communications about STEM and policy issues that affect their lives. \r\n\r\nThe workshop provides direct experience in a writing genre called \"narrative nonfiction\" or \"creative nonfiction,\" a domain in which Gutkind has been a leader. The co-PI, Guston, is a scholar in science and technology policy and an active partner of the NSF-funded Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network. In addition, the Spring 2011 issue of Issues in Science and Technology will include works by the collaborating communicators/scholars. This workshop precedes and informs a larger conference on science policy, \"The Rightful Place of Science?,\" funded by others, including NSF's Science, Technology, and Society program (http://www.cspo.org/conference2010/).",

The Next Generation (&ldquo;Next Gen&rdquo;) Communicators comprise a variety of participants, including writers, journalists and bloggers, as well as documentary filmmakers and museum and other communication professionals whose jobs are primarily in writing (such as catalogs, magazines, etc.). The workshop emphasized training these communicators in a genre called &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; or &ldquo;creative nonfiction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The need for such an activity is illustrated not only in the experience of the principal investigators, but also in the quality of contemporary public dialogues around many, high-profile scientific and technical issues. To help bring a new understanding among the public and forge a new relationship among some of the players, we brought together for an intensive two-day workshop three key groups: 1) Next Gen Communicators interested in science and technology; 2) Next Gen science and technology policy (STP) leaders; and 3) editors of major magazines, publishing organizations and documentary film production companies covering these topics. The workshop, took place in May 2010 in conjunction with a larger symposium on &ldquo;The Rightful Place of Science?&rdquo; to help Next Gen Communicators and STP scholars connect by providing them with a cohort experience and shared training in the skills necessary to enlighten a broad and growing audience, articulate ideas and share them with that audience, work with editors and other senior communicators in their fields and, at the end of the process, publish their work.

The workshop was organized by a PI (Lee Gutkind) and co-PI (David Guston) who are, respectively, leaders in the genre of creative nonfiction and the field of science and technology policy. It is intellectually innovative because there are very few examples of the effective informal science education around science and technology policy, especially by STP scholars and those informed by them, rather than by scientists and engineers themselves. Moreover, the workshop introduced both Next Gen Communicators and STP scholars to creative nonfiction&mdash;which has increased awareness of and excitement about science and technology&mdash;as a new method for communicating their work.
