This work adds innovations in optimizing technologies, yielding capabilities for entrepreneurial education that do not currently exist. The software is anticipated to have widespread application for improving economic performance and quality of life on Native American Reservations.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include the potential to:  a) improve entrepreneurial education applications for economic development planning; b) support significant social and economic initiatives; c) design a more effective approach using simulation and optimization techniques to economic planning; d) develop and market commercial-grade software that may be applied to other high-risk, highly complex development environments; e) attract downstream funding from sources including private capital firms, non-government agencies, and business alliance partners as it significantly increases economic performance;  f) add to the body of knowledge in education applications, economic planning, and decision sciences that may be leveraged to enable additional research and development.",

Nevertheless, tribal leaders and native entrepreneurs have lacked an educational, interactive, decision-support tool capable of evaluating the myriad investment options they are confronted with, while accounting for wide-ranging goals and constraints that are unique to their situation.  Through Phase 1 funding, OptTek completed the basic research necessary to develop a model, methodology, and pilot software application, OptDev, simulation and optimization technology to meet this need.  \n\nIn collaboration with our subcontractor, Spirit of the Sun, and with the participation of the Northern Arapaho Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, OptTek has been able to effectively demonstrate the \"proof of concept\" for the OptDev technology.  \n\nThrough close collaboration and software trials with the Northern Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation of NE Washington, as well as meetings and conversations with the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development, the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and ACKCO (Native American Professional Services) we confirmed that OptDev has broad value potential due to the following: \n\nTribal governments and Tribal Colleges are in need of dynamic, interactive educational tools that engage current and future leaders in the analysis and exploration on of trade-offs and complexities inherent in investment decisions.  \n\n\n \n\nNo existing economic development planning tool on the market allows for the incorporation of non-financial, user-defined goals and constraints.\n\n\n \n\nEconomic Development planning is often done in piecemeal fashion.   Economic Development professionals understand the need for coordinated, comprehensive planning, but currently lack a tool capable of supporting such complex decision making.\n\n\nOur Phase 1 collaborations and research confirmed that OptDev would satisfy these customer requirements given that the software:\n\nAllows users to quickly and easily model numerous, unique combinations of goals and constraints enabling a wide range of hypothetical situations to be explored for both educational and real-world purposes, and \n\n\n \n\nProvides outputs which support easy visualization of the tradeoffs between portfolios - each optimized according to a unique set of goals and constraints (e.g., financial, environmental, cultural, etc).
