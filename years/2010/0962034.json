Hughes \r\nUniversity of Pittsburgh \r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the investigators link world polity and social networks to inform the development of a new over-time measure of country-level connectedness to the world polity, labeled the \"INGO Network Country Score.\" This measure will score countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. The resulting published dataset will be useful to a cross-disciplinary audience. In a second part of the project, an in-depth analysis is carried out on one domain of INGOs-Women's International Nongovernmental Organizations, or WINGOs. The investigators draw upon theories of the international women?s movement to provide testable theories about expected changes in the WINGO network structure over time. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe proposed project will have broad impact for academic researchers in the fastest growing areas of political sociology and political science. The dataset generated here will provide a substantial resource for researchers who study global processes, international organizations, and cross-national outcomes.",
