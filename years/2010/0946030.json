 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a system to solve two fundamental problems in personal mobile image information communications: 1) sun-light readability and environmental awareness 2) personal mobile communications device display screen size, weight, resolution, cost, and power consumption. Up-to-now, no existing mobile display solutions solve above two problems satisfactorily. Here we propose a solution that uses fast transient MEMS based dynamically transparency variable display screen to solve both above problems and will result in an all-light usable, thin, light-weight, low power consumption, and low-cost wearable display devices for mobile computing, personal mobile communications and entertainments.\r\n \r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is bringing mobile users high resolution viewing experience. This technology will enable broad commercial applications in mobile computing and mobile communications as a personal viewer accessory for laptop computers, cellular phones, personal data assistants (PDAs), portable TV, and video player such as iPod. It will find broad application in education, industry and military. For example, through this proposed transparent screen and supported by virtual reality software with alignment/registration functions, a student can use empty test tubes to do chemistry experiments with all processes and results displayed virtually to avoid the expense and danger of real chemistry experiments, some of which can be flammable, explosive or toxic. Therefore, this technology will open a broad market across wide range of mobile internet access, education, industry training, consumer wireless, and gaming market sectors.\r\n",
