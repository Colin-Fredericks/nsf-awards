 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues and extends work on subtle gaze direction - a novel technique that combines real-time eye- tracking with image-space modulation to direct a viewer's gaze about a digital image. This proposed project aims to pursue research in subtle gaze direction for dynamic scenes. This is a natural extension of viewers gaze pattern for static scenes. The work will seek improvement in search task performance. Advances in this area are important for many applications from locating anomalies in medical images to identifying camouflaged targets in a scene. The approach will use automatic feature detection algorithms. The project will also address issues relevant to improving information recall. This will involve studies to determine the impact of subtle gaze direction on spatial information recall for images and spatial-temporal information recall for dynamic scenes. The work will also explore gaze direction in the presence of more overt stimuli. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed to enable high quality interdisciplinary research that links technology design with health-based applications. The topics addressed are highly interdisciplinary and will require interaction with faculty and mentors from a number of disciplinary areas. The program will create new opportunities for undergraduates to study health and human behavior using the technology. The PI will pursue two curriculum development projects that are closely related to this research endeavor aimed at computer science and non- computer science majors. The courses are continually refined by inclusion of state-of-the- art computer graphics research and techniques. The Principal Investigator also plans to develop a new course on applied perception in graphics and visualization. In both cases, students are exposed to a broad topical area that draws upon human vision, computer graphics and visualization. The courses are expected to attract students from Rochester Institute of Technology's many programs in imaging related science.",
