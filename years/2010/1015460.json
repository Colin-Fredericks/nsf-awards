Magnetotactic bacteria are a group of bacteria that can synthesize tiny magnets inside of their cells (Figure 1).&nbsp; They do this by bringing iron atoms from their environment (the sediment) into their cells and then using enzymes to build up magnets from the iron atoms; this is one form of what is called biomineralization (for example, humans use calcium, phosphorous, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms to biomineralize teeth).&nbsp; The magnets that they form are approximately 50 nanometers across (approximately 0.0000020 inches), these magnets are composed of a type of iron oxide called magnetite.&nbsp; The size, chemistry, shape, distribution, and number of these magnetite crystals vary from species to species.&nbsp; It is important to determine what type of magnetite different bacteria produce because this will help us to better understand the biomineralization process.&nbsp; This has many important implications such as understanding magnetofossils (magnets left behind by dead bacteria), engineering nano-sized magnets, culturing magnetotactic bacteria in the lab, and understanding biomineralization at different size scales.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the time I left China until now, I have been using the skills I learned in China to identify magnetotactic bacteria from different environments as well as analyzing inclusions inside of the cells.&nbsp; In addition to the magnets, magnetotactic bacteria can also generate small inclusions inside their cells that they use to concentrate different elements such as phosphorus and calcium.&nbsp; I use the scanning transmission electron microscope at Ohio State University to analyze the cells.</p>\n<p>Most of my work so far has been investigating magnetotactic bacteria from a pond near Ohio State University.&nbsp; I have found several different types of magnetotactic bacteria with different morphologies of magnetite (Figure 2a).&nbsp; In addition to the different chains of magnetite, I also discovered that some of the magnetotactic bacteria contain inclusions composed of different elements.&nbsp; In one of the bacteria the inclusion was composed primarily of phosphorous (Figure 2 and 3) and in another bacteria the inclusion was dominated by calcium (Figure 4).&nbsp; This work has helped to increase our understanding of magnetotactic bacteria and brings us closer to being able to use these bacteria in controlled ways such as to engineer very specific forms of magnetite or to learn to manipulate these bacteria in ways that will benefit us.</p>\n<p>I presented these findings at the annual Microscopy and Microanalysis meeting in Nashville in August of this year.&nbsp; Many people were interested in my research and I was fortunate enough to receive an ample amount of useful feedback on my research.&nbsp; I hope to pursue this line of research in order to determine a way to engineer magnetotactic bacteria in a useful way.</p>\n<p>I appreciate everyone&rsquo;s help at the National Science Foundation and the administrators who run the East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes.&nbsp; I feel very lucky to have been chosen to participate in EAPSI and I cannot thank everyone enough at the NSF who made it happen.&nbsp; It was a very unique and valuable experience, which has definitely helped me with my research, and I hope to repay them by making positive use of research, knowledge, and skills in the future.&nbsp;
