 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  This university-industry research project pioneers nanoscale magnetometry measurement techniques for advanced energy-related ceramics.  The work is predicated by the fact that markedly different magnetic responses will be elicited for ceramics in different materials states, allowing an investigation of nanoscale physical phenomena that have been previously inaccessible.  The main scientific objective is to correlate the different magnetic response of ceramic materials with nanoscale-structure features.  The results will have broad implication across many technical energy applications where challenges exist in understanding and controlling nanoscale phenomena, but are also expected to impact the ceramics community by helping to advance the metrology of magnetic based measurements.  The industrial partner, Quantum Design, is a leader in the magnetic equipment industry and will engage students during the project.  The students will also organize and run an annual on-campus conference in ceramics with participation from industry, faculty and members of the local community.   \r\n \r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: A systematic experimental research program is designed to correlate the magnetic behavior of doped ceramic oxides with nanoscale features that will be independently measured with a suite of materials characterization tools and interpreted with kinetics and thermodynamics theory.  The research is based on the fact that the magnetic response of doped ceramics is highly sensitive to different internal material states: (1) the undoped ceramic; (2) metallic ions in solution within the doped ceramic; (3) metallic ions as an oxide; and (4) metal particles.  Two host ceramics, one based on ZrO2 and one based on the perovskite structure, are doped with various transition metals (Ni, Co, and Fe) to create a variety of structures that exhibit different magnetic responses.  The research lays the foundation to advance the state of nanoscale metrology for magnetometry.  Students will be engaged and trained in the potentially transformative magnetometry characterization tools developed.",
