 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feeding systems are the energy-acquiring systems of humans and other primates. The teeth, jaws, and muscles, are the proximal interface between primates and their environments.  Therefore, understanding the evolutionary forces that shape those components is essential to understanding the adaptation and evolution of primates. This work tests hypotheses and models relating diversity in the primate feeding system to size-related changes in food intake rate. It documents how shape and movements of the mandible, the size and architecture of the jaw muscles, and the amount of food an animal eats in a single bite change with body size to meet size-required changes in food intake rate of primates. These data will be collected using computed tomography (CT) scanning of primate mandibles, anatomical studies of primate chewing muscles, and behavioral studies of primates feeding in captivity. Mathematical models of the feeding system will be tested, modified and improved, then used to examine how feeding system designs in different evolutionary groups of primates balance trade-offs between advantages of bite force production, chewing speed and gape. \r\n\r\nThis research will create novel and important data sets that can be accessed in the future by other researchers interested in feeding biomechanics, bone biomechanics, and musculoskeletal systems in general. The investigators will continue to recruit under-represented minority and female undergraduates to receive training and mentoring in research and advice on their paths to graduate, medical, and other professional schools.  These students will collaborate in all aspects of the work, including presentation and publication. The PIs will continue their outreach programs to local schools and their synergistic activities with other NSF-funded projects.",
