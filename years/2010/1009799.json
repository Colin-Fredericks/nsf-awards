This will address frontier problems in the theory of reionization and its feedback on galaxy formation in the Cold DarkMatter model, in order to predict observable signatures.   These will include predictions for the redshifted 21-cm background from the cosmic \"Dark Ages\" and the EOR, an area of great current observational interest.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and participation of individuals from underrepresented groups.",
