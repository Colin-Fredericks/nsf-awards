 "awd_abstract_narration": "Directed block copolymer self-assembly is one of the promising technologies to solve the problems of conventional lithography for advanced semiconductor technologies. In contrast to conventional lithography, block copolymer self-assembly provides sub-20 nm features with lower cost and higher throughput, though defects and precise positioning are fundamental research topics that need to be addressed. The goal of this project is to address these challenges for integrating directed block copolymer self-assembly technology into practical integrated device fabrication process at the circuit level and demonstrate the fabrication of the key features for next generation devices. Block copolymer self-assembly and guided template patterning methods are proposed as a proof of concept demonstration for fabricating ultra-high density memory arrays and sub-20 nm contact holes for high-density silicon circuitry, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project cover both fundamental research and commercial manufacturing at the university-industrial interface. This project can have direct impact to promote block copolymer self-assembly technology as an economically efficient extension to conventional lithography for next generation device fabrication, benefiting the semiconductor manufacturing industry and the broader electronics industry greatly. It also will substantially stimulate the study of polymer materials design for better functional performance. As part of a outreach to the broader society, a few video clips will be produced and posted onto public websites to help the students understand the science and technology of the self-assembly. This university-industry collaboration provides an excellent training ground for the participating students in a multidisciplinary environment at the interface of fundamental research and industrial manufacturing.",
