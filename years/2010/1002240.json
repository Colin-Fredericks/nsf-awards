 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to advance polymer tunnel diodes and circuits for ultra-low power self-powered computing. Advances by this team for the first conjugated polymer based tunnel diode circuitry using room temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) enable new opportunities for low-power consumption circuitry (logic, memory and mixed-signal). NDR circuitry can provide (i) component count reduction (more computational power per unit area), (ii) lower power consumption (fewer devices per logic function). This extends beyond the functionality and on-board intelligence of organic RFIDs while operating autonomously powered. The approach will use a systematic exploration and development of polymer tunnel diodes in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (i) novel materials, (ii) device technology, and (iii) system applications and impact.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will establish a world-class program in polymer tunnel diodes that will advance low-power autonomous powered electronics, low-temperature processing of high-k dielectrics, understanding of role of defects in tunneling through ultra-thin high-k dielectrics, biosensors and polymer solar cells. \r\n\r\nThe integrated research, education and technology transfer will advance SmartCard technology (credit cards and identification cards) with greater on-board intelligence, permitting enhanced data manipulation, distributed computing, radio frequency (RF) input/output (I/O) datalinks, and possibly even hardwired encryption algorithms to protect personal data better than traditional magnetic strips. The proposed research project will create a unique and focused program that incorporates a wide-range of external collaborations with industry, government labs and academia.",
