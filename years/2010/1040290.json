 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Resesarch Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding for the aquisition of a next generation pulsed laser deposition system for thin film and nanomaterials research.  The pulsed laser deposition system will provide immediate and significant boost to the research projects focused on the development of metallic and ceramic biomaterials for biomedical implant applications, synthesis of self-assembled magnetic nanoparticles for data storage devices, and synthesis of high-temperature superconducting thin films embedded with nanoparticles for superconductive electronics. The first research area is directly related to the Engineering Research Center on Revolutionizing Metallic Biomaterials funded by the National Science Foundation in 2008 at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. The uniqueness of the proposed deposition system lies in the provision for laser ablation and direct current magnetron sputtering in the same chamber and capabilities of in situ diagnosis of species present in the plasma by an optical emission spectroscopy system and in situ structural characterization of thin film and nanostructured materials by a reflection high energy electron diffraction system.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation will be used directly in a hands-on fashion by both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also be incorporated into courses on thin film technology and nanoscience and nanoengineering offered currently at graduate as well as undergraduate levels in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. Due to simplicity of operation of pulsed laser deposition system and the visual attractiveness of laser plume and red glow of the substrate heating platform, the facility will also be used for the education and outreach activities for elementary, middle, and high school students and teachers visiting the campus.",
