The co-organizers are Professors Viney Aneja, North Carolina State University (NCSU) and M.P. Singh, Chairman of Ansal Institute of Technology, Gurgaon, India.  The overarching goal is to bring together experts from the U.S. and India to identify and promote collaborative research with specific emphasis on improving the science of the current regional/global air quality modeling system being developed in the U.S.  It is anticipated that the workshop will result in major research initiatives in the U.S. that will enhance the state of science in air quality measurement and modeling.  It will also raise the awareness of open-source modeling tools among the large pool of Indian scientists.      \r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the workshop are to bring together US and Indian participants from academia, industry, and government to: identify the scientific challenges stemming from variability in both meteorological and emission conditions in multi-scale atmospheric photochemical models, plan for future collaborative research involving US and Indian scientists, and develop research proposals for submission to NSF and other agencies in the U.S. and India.  EPA and NOAA have offered in-kind support for this activity and the Government of India's Ministry of Earth Sciences has committed to providing financial support for senior and young scientist participants from India.",

Not only has this led to environmental problems within the region, potential impacts extend to a global scale. The objective of this project was to bring together experts from the U.S., India and Europe with a common vision for identifying priority areas of research and development in the air quality-climate arena, and a commitment to sustaining long-term Indo-U.S. collaboration. \n\n \n\nMajor accomplishments\n\n1. The \"U.S.-India International Workshop on Air Quality: Collaborative Science, Research, and Education in Air Quality Measurements, Modeling and Analysis\" was organized by a team of atmospheric scientists from North Carolina State University (NCSU), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

To that end, the NCSU and UNC scientists have developed a comprehensive research proposal that was submitted to NSF.  \n\nA parallel effort (resulting from the NSF funded workshop) has also been undertaken wherein nine leading institutions in India have come together with a common goal of exploring Air Quality-Climate research. The US scientists have assisted the Indian counterparts in developing this comprehensive proposal. The proposal is ready for submission (mid November 2012) for funding to the India Ministry of Earth Sciences.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2012\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Viney ..."
