 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop methods to characterize and control edge scattering in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The approach is (i) to optimize patterning of narrow-width GNRs, (ii) characterize size-effect in narrow-width GNRs, and (iii) reduce edge scattering by using a combination of surface and edge chemistry. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Graphene has been found to have a variety of interesting and superior properties suitable for post-CMOS nanoelectronics. Long mean free paths and very high mobility have been demonstrated in large-area graphene. With dimensional scaling, edge scattering in GNRs leads to a significant degradation in carrier transport, it was recently demonstrated by the proposing principal investigators that edge scattering sets in at widths of around 60 nm. Extending the superior properties of graphene to GNRs is important for a number of nanoelectronics applications since it allows for fast switching, quantum coherent devices, and high device density. The techniques proposed in this work will hasten the implementation of graphene for various charge-based as well as alternative state variable switches and interconnects. \r\n\r\nBroader impact: Education will be an important component of the proposed work  the PIs regularly involve undergraduates and minorities in their research as part of summer internship programs. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research will get trained on advanced fabrication and characterization techniques. The PIs' also involve a number of teachers as part of research experience for teachers (RET) programs. The PIs' labs are a regular part of tours to middle- and high-school children.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on suppressing and controlling process-induced scattering mechanisms in graphene.  These edge and basal scattering mechanisms result in graphene device-to-device variation that is not tolerable in modern chipsets.  Graphene, a single atomic-layer of carbon atoms, holds promise to support a variety of electron devices that can vastly improve upon existing silicon and III-V technology.  This includes reducing power consumption, improving speed, and increasing the reliability of chipsets.  As graphene is a strictly 2-dimensional (2D) material, its handling requires new methods that are significant departure from traditional bulk (3D) technologies.  Common semiconductor process steps that are optimized for such bulk materials must be refined to handle 2D materials and allow graphene to reach closer to its theoretical limit.  This project explored methods of suppressing line-edge-roughness (LER) scattering in sub-10nm interconnect technologies as well as passivation techniques to suppress process-damage in CVD graphene sheets.  Record breaking mobilities for CVD graphene were presented along with detailed process flows to significantly improve device performance.  Suppression of LER using sp2 to sp3 selective hydrogenation along the graphene edge was shown to increase the mean-free path of nanoscale graphene interconnects.  The results of this project are expected to excite new research focused on the practical and essential control of device performance as required by modern high-volume foundries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Meindl"
