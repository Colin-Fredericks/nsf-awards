Students will be recruited from the 18 consortium schools, and 30% of participants will be from non-Consortium institutions. Summer research projects will be continued in the following academic year as independent study projects, culminating at Keck Annual Research Symposium in the spring. Students will publish short contributions in the annual proceedings volume and will be encouraged to present their work at regional and national disciplinary meetings. The projects involve a mix of field and laboratory research experiences that will make meaningful scientific contributions in the areas of structural geology, paleontology and paleoecology, and paleoclimatology as well as igneous and metamorphic petrology, sedimentology and stratigraphy, volcanology, geomorphology and geoarchaeology. The yearlong Keck Consortium program enhances students? scientific and geoscience research skills and provides a robust scientific experience.",

As a capstone experience, each student wrote a project report summarizing their research and gave presentations to the academic community at the annual Keck Geology Consortium Symposium, this year held at Union College in New York.  In addition to specific scientific outcomes (which are quite impressive indeed and can be found at our website, keckgeology.org) students develop the confidence that they can carry out a major research endeavor from hypothesis formation, to research design through summary of results.  Results from alumni surveys indicate that the Keck experience enhances fundamental scientific and geoscience skills, but also impacts student enthusiasm for science.  The assessment results indicate that the preparation students receive in their Keck undergraduate research experiences translates into skills relevant for their careers.  The Keck Consortium is devoted to meeting the growing need in the geoscience community for high-quality largely field based undergraduate research experiences. \n\n \n\nPublications From the 2010-2011 Program\n\n*Bedame, M., Wojtal, S., Lowey, S., Lackey, J.,S., and Wooden, J., 2010, Zircon ages and trace element compositins link Frys Point Granite and magmatization in the Sequoia pendant, Sequoia National Park:  Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, Annual GSA Meeting,\n\n*Hensley, S., Loewy, S., Lackey, J.S., 2010, Temporal variations in pluton-wallrock interactions in the Sierran arc: Geological Society of America Program with Abstracts, 2010 Denver GSA Annual Meeting (October 31-November 3, 2010).\n\n*Holland, J., Surpless, B., Lackey, J.S., Loewy, S., and wooden, J., 2010, Intrusiv..."
