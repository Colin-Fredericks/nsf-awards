 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of structural components in engineering  can be classified as \r\nplates. Typical examples  of civil engineering structures are floor and \r\nfoundation slabs, lock-gates, thin retaining walls, bridge decks, and slab \r\nbridges. Plates are also indispensable in ship building, automobile, and \r\naerospace industries. The  stress resultants of a thin plate can be calculated \r\nthrough the 3-dimensional elasticity equations. However, under certain \r\nhypotheses, the 3-dimensional elasticity equations for a  plate  are reduced  \r\nto the 2-dimensional equations. The Kirchhoff plate model  is well suited for  \r\nthin  plates. However,  the governing equation for the displacement of  this \r\nplate model is the fourth order differential equation. The conventional finite \r\nelement method is difficult to apply  because  of the complexity of  \r\nconstructing smooth finite elements. Furthermore, moderately thick plates have \r\nother difficulties such as  boundary layer problems and shear  locking \r\nproblems. \r\n \r\nMeshless methods (in which smooth flexible approximation functions are used \r\nand complicated mesh generation is not necessary)  have several advantages \r\nover the conventional finite element method.  However,  these  methods have \r\nseveral major limitations including  the inefficiency in handling essential  \r\nboundary conditions, large matrix condition numbers, and complexity in \r\nconstructing partitions of unity.  Most recently, the PI invented  one of the \r\nmost  flexible  closed form partition of unity, called the Generalized Product \r\nPartition of Unity.  The PI proposes to introduce  Meshfree particle methods  \r\nby using the Generalized Product Partition of Unity,  together with new local \r\napproximation functions that can handle geometric boundary conditions as well  \r\nas force boundary conditions  arising in various plate models. Furthermore, \r\nthe PI proposes to apply  Meshfree particle  methods  to obtain highly \r\naccurate  stress analysis of plates and shells for design and maintenance of \r\nrelated engineering structures. \r\n \r\nThe Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will greatly improve the stress \r\nanalysis of plates, shells,  and laminated composite plates so that design and \r\nmaintenance  of automobiles, airplanes, ships, and all other engineering \r\nstructures related to plates and shells  may be more effective and safer.  \r\nMoreover, without any difficulty, the proposed method is able to surgically \r\nmake the approximation space  enriched with any type of singular function.  \r\nThe proposed method is flexible and effective in dealing with singularities \r\nand  it can be used for accurate prediction of crack propagation. \r\n \r\nThe Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed research can be used to design \r\nfuel efficient automobiles, safer airplanes, ships  and new materials more \r\nresistant to failure. The proposed research   can also be applied to improve \r\nmaintenance of aging airliners, bridges, ships, buildings, and numerous other \r\napplications where structural integrity should be closely monitored. \r\nUltimately,  the  proposed research  will  have  direct impacts on the public \r\nsafety and the environment by increasing efficiency and safety of  common \r\nmodes of transportation and structures used everyday.",
