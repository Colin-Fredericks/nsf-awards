 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The objective of this BRIDGE research project is to design and develop terahertz integrated circuits using dielectric waveguides. In particular, integrated ribbon-waveguide based structures are proposed to make passive and tunable devices such as phase shifters, attenuators, switches, and power splitters. Research will focus on using high-index silicon and polymer-ceramic nanocomposites to fabricate these devices on a planar substrate. These dielectric waveguide based devices will be used to design novel terahertz-integrated circuits for application in antenna arrays and sensors. The proposed technology is a significant advancement when compared to traditional quasi-optical approaches, and in particular provides an avenue to overcome the integration bottleneck of terahertz systems and circuits. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research provides advancements in the general field of terahertz technology, yielding fundamentally new approaches to integrating circuits and systems.  Applications of such a system includes security, biological studies, high-data rate communications, and spectroscopy. Under this project several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an exceptionally interdisciplinary manner as part of the research on integrated terahertz circuits. Integrating with the research program, a new project-based interdisciplinary course that includes terahertz circuit design and fabrication will be developed. Ongoing university programs will be leveraged to attract underrepresented students to engineering.",
