 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is enhancing the learning outcomes of fieldwork-based geoscience education across a diverse range of undergraduate educational institutions. It is leveraging the power of modeling technology (COLLADA and GigaPan) and virtual globes such as Google Earth. A project-related Penrose professional conference at Google Headquarters is enabling a paradigm-shift among a cohort of academic experts and research assistants who are designing, developing, and implementing innovative virtual field trips.  The virtual field trips are allowing geoscience students to act as free-agent learners guided by distributed teacher networks. The project is enabling students to explore a geoscience-enhanced Google Earth experience using models or \"avatars\" to represent themselves and their field vehicles. The virtual terrain is peppered with computer-generated rock outcrops and rock specimens that students are discovering and collecting as they solve problems as virtual detectives. The virtual activities are enabling students to lift and examine specimens, and allowing them to perform virtual physical and chemical analyses that are helping to guide their field mapping decisions. In addition to traditional field destinations, the project is providing a mechanism that allows students to visit and examine virtual places where real field trips cannot take them, including the vents of active volcanoes and the deepest ocean trenches. Students are playing the roles of first-responders in natural disaster scenarios and are exploring Paleo-Google Earths that correspond to a number of past geologic periods, thus expanding their appreciation and understanding of \"deep time\". The project is also enabling students to virtually explore the past and present environments of the Moon and Mars.  Strong formative evaluation components are embedded throughout the project and are informing its development.  A key feature guiding the development of the project is the use of technology to track students' actions and to log and scaffold their virtual field activities. By analyzing their actions and - by comparing of novice versus expert tracks - the project is assessing, in real time, the potential of each exercise to improve student learning while also providing instant feedback, encouragement, and guidance to the students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe overarching goal of this project was to develop virtual globe technologies for use in teaching undergraduate geosciences. It led to the creation of a number of innovative teaching tools:\n \n  Interactive Field Trips - Using the Google Earth API this project developed scalable virtual avatars for movement around the 3D globe. The navigation of avatars can be logged to enable analysis of the impact on individual student learning (Figure 1). \n\nGigapan Galleries and Annotations - Gigapan technology allow users to make use of the digital zoom function of cameras to create high detailed panoramas. Project collaborators created curated collections of geologic gigapans, and developed ways of annotating those gigapans (Figure 2).\n\nVirtual Specimens - Project team members developed ways to create 3D COLLADA models of rock specimens. These models can be imported into and geolocated in Google Earth to provide a geologic setting and context for a given sample (Figure 3).\n \nEarth Reconstructions - Keyhole Markup Language (KML) allows user to create content in Google Earth. Using the timeslider it is possible to animate these objects. This allows polygons, models or overlays to be used to re-create historical geology (Figure 4).\n \nGeology Tools - KML can also be used to generate features representing geologic measurements, for example 3D models showing dip and strike. A combination of the Google Earth API and Javascript creates controls for these models (Figure 5).\n\n \n Dissemination of this work, and similar development in the community, was performed through a combination of peer-reviewed publications, conference sessions and works, and open-access websites. The lasting impact can be seen by how the research and educational communities have come to accept Google Earth as a working tool, rather than a novelty application.  \n\nThe collaborations formed to undertake this project were largely a result of contacts made during a series of special sessions at 2006 to 2009 annual meetings of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). These sessions focused on introducing virtual globes to the scientific community, but the outcomes from this project helped highlight how these tools have now become widely integrated into geoscience research and educational activities. During year one, we organized a Geological Society of America (GSA) Penrose Conference at Google\u00c6s Mountain View headquarters for over seventy scientists, teachers, GIS experts, publishers and developers . This in turn lead to the publication a year later of 36-paper special volume of peer-reviewed work focusing the application of Google Earth in different fields of geoscience.  \n\nThroughout the lifetime of the project the applications, models, lessons plans and other materials produced have been made available via a website  (http://www.digitalplanet.org/). Ultimately this has led to a larger funded collaboration that will further develop methods for integrating Google Earth and related technologies into the undergraduate curriculum.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/25/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John E Bailey"
