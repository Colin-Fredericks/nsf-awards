 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate a novel look-ahead operating paradigm which enables the participation of variable energy resources such as wind and solar power in both energy balancing and frequency regulation. The approach is to (1) formulate a distributed model predictive optimization model which controls the predictable portions of variable generation to provide both electric energy and regulation services; (2) leverage the near-term forecasts and inter-temporal variability of wind and solar generation to do load following and frequency regulation; and (3) introduce the novel concept of regulation service pricing and verification for variable generation resources. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n(1)\tThis project will lead to the new concept of coordinated model predictive control of distributed variable energy resources in providing both energy and regulation services. \r\n(2)\tThis project will investigate the performance of look-ahead coordinated control for large-scale power systems by leveraging the spatial and temporal structures of power systems. \r\n(3)\tThis project will make contributions to fast look-ahead coordination algorithms needed to advance the computational efficiency and robustness of online model predictive control. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe vision of this project will make the societal goals of Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) into affordable and clean realization in the near future. A new course on engineering and economics of sustainable energy systems will be developed. The PI will help start a university-wide student energy organization aiming at raising students? awareness of energy systems innovations. At least one female student will be supported to work on various tasks of this project.",
