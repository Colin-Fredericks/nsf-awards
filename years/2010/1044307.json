 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the global knowledge economy of the 21st century we are witnessing an ever increasing pace of knowledge creation in the sciences and engineering. This exponential growth is gradually reducing the \"half-life\" of science and engineering (S&E) degrees. The developed and developing world economies alike are seeking out new ways to increase and sustain technical competencies and preparedness of their workforce. The U.S. makes substantial investments in higher education (undergraduate through postdoctoral levels). But once in the workforce, opportunities that are available for keeping oneself at the leading edge of S&E developments decline significantly. Despite widespread agreement in policy circles for the need for the U.S. to invest in lifelong learning opportunities for working professionals, an in-depth study on the topic has not been conducted. There are no systematic ongoing or recent efforts that would advance knowledge and understanding of the perceptions and role of lifelong learning as part of the culture in science and engineering professions. The last focused study on the topic was reported in the 1985 National Academies report on \"continuing education\". Since then dramatic changes have occurred in the education and workplace environments, now often characterized as a \"flat world\" in which nations ability to thrive depends on the quality of their workforces.  The 2006 Spellings Commission report on the future of higher education calls for the \"development of a national strategy for lifelong learning designed to keep our citizens and our nation at the forefront of the knowledge revolution.\" The proposed workshop is addressing the urgent need to assess current practices in lifelong learning and understand the unmet needs of the S&E working professional. It will synthesize information about lifelong learning gathered from a 2009 study. It will develop recommendations for policy-makers leading to a national framework for lifelong learning of engineers.",
