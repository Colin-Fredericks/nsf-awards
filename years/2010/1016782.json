 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the ?smart grid? to healthcare to national security systems,\r\nwireless devices are playing an increasing role in technological\r\nsolutions. Their security and trustworthiness should be a major\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nFingerprinting is an important technique in the cyber-defender\r\narsenal, because it helps expose deceptions essential to modern\r\nmulti-step network attacks. We develop methods and tools for wireless\r\nphysical (PHY) layer testing, thus improving trustworthiness of\r\nwireless devices and equipping cyber-defenders with the tools they\r\nneed to protect wireless networks.\r\n\r\nActive fingerprinting methods are the most direct and effective ones,\r\nbecause they allow the administrators to initiate fingerprinting when\r\nnecessary, probe for a broader range of expected behaviors (thus\r\nincreasing the attacker?s workload to fake behaviors in order to\r\nescape detection), and are easily tweaked (further increasing said\r\nworkload).\r\n\r\nWe develop robust fingerprinting techniques for wireless devices\r\nthat are based on active probing -- in the physical layer of 802.11\r\nand 802.15.4 networks.\r\n\r\nTo empower exploration of the attack surface of actual wireless\r\nnetworks and to facilitate active physical-layer testing of wireless\r\ndevices, we also will develop a framework for crafting and injecting\r\n\"marginally\" malformed physical layer signals that correspond to\r\ncommon 802.11 and 802.15.4 frames. In particular, we will facilitate\r\nfuzz-testing of wireless devices.  \r\n\r\nBoth fingerprintable responses and (possibly exploitable)\r\nvulnerabilities of wireless devices amount to differences in\r\nimplementations of protocol logic. We will develop methods for testing\r\nthis logic in the wireless PHY layer, and look for potentially harmful\r\nsecurity vulnerabilities in its common implementations.",
