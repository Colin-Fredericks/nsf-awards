 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is part of the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation. The Office of Cyberinfrastructure, the Division of Computer and Network Systems, and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. \r\n\r\nDeveloping large computational codes such as those used to perform simulations in quantum  mechanics to calculate properties of materials, or to predict the  aerodynamics forces around airplanes, still typically require several human-years.  However the pace of research and industrial product development demands much more rapid software tool development to make progress and to remain competitive. This award contributes to developing the capability to rapidly create high performance large scale codes. \r\n\r\nThe PIs will augment a computer programming language with a very high level language that is interactive in the sense that the developer will enter language commands and get instantaneous interpreted answers, instead of  processing the whole code.  This approach of creating an interactive extensible language framework will provide a way to help speed development of large scale computer software.  Efforts will be specifically targeted at software for materials science applications. This will enable progress in large scale computational research that aims to predict properties of materials starting from a knowledge of the constituent atoms and the way they are arranged in the material. \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the education of knowledgeable specialists capable of developing large and complex computational codes.  The PIs will design new graduate level courses outside of the current curriculum to increase the number of students who receive training in effective development of software for materials research and scientific computing in general. \r\n\r\nThis award also supports the research team's efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups through the existing Alice in Wonderland Program, which aims to recruit members of underrepresented groups at the high school level, and to attract female high school students to science and engineering by  involving them in research over the summer before they make decisions  about colleges. They will also revive the Summer Undergraduate Interns program to recruit undergraduate students interested in high performance computing for summer internships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A major issue within large scale computational research is the sluggish pace in which scientific software is developed. Three decades of improvement in hardware have yielded a gain of at least six orders of magnitude in speed (per Moore\u00c6s Law), while developing large codes such as those in research areas focusing on the electronic structure of materials or fluid dynamics, still typically requires years of concerted effort. Meanwhile, the current wave of multidisciplinary efforts is creating an acute need to build effective large scale scientific software. This unprecedented demand for new scientific simulations on the one hand and the inadequacy of existing methodologies on the other, is likely to lead to a significant software \"crisis.\" This situation is aggravated by the growing scarcity of knowledgeable specialists capable of developing large computational codes. \nWork within this grant addressed this problem by formulating an interactive extensible language framework and development environment that contains new high-level language constructs that will help speed code development.
