 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communications systems often transfer digital data because digital systems are reliable, programmable, and testable. The digital data are converted to analog form by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which produces the input to a channel that makes a physical connection between the transmitter and receiver. Channel nonidealities cause the raw received signals to be continuously variable (analog).  In practice, each location has a transmitter and a receiver operating together. Therefore, the raw received signal at any location consists of an analog signal related to the remote digital data plus a filtered copy of the local transmitter signal (an \"echo\"). An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts this combined signal into digital form.  An echo canceler adaptively removes the echo but usually cannot remove noise or distortion. Therefore, ADCs and DACs used in digital communication systems must have high resolution (for low noise) and high linearity (for low distortion).  Inside the ADCs and DACs, unintentional mismatch between elements causes distortion, which is commonly reduced by calibration. However, calibration is often done in the foreground, which means that it interrupts the conversion and reduces the communications rate. To overcome this problem, background calibration can be used. Background calibration operates during normal conversion and has been much less thoroughly studied in DACs than in ADCs. \r\n\r\nThis project involves investigating the digital background calibration of high-speed, high-linearity DACs used for data-communication systems.  Unlike in previously reported work, the calibration architecture considered here senses and corrects for signal-dependent output resistance effects.  Also, it can improve not only the static (or low output frequency) DAC performance, but also the dynamic (or high output frequency) performance, which is the main limitation in state-of-the art DACs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project was to improve the performance of both digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digital-communications and signal-processing systems.  Four papers have been published with support from this project.  Two of the papers studied a downsampling interpretation of quantization in the Fourier series domain.  In the first of these two papers, the behavior of quantization residuals in pipelined ADCs was analyzed.  It was shown that the residual distribution becomes uniform and white at an exponential rate proportional to the product of the number of quantization bits and the degree of smoothness of the input distribution.  For pipelined ADCs with  redundant stages, it was shown that the limiting uniform distribution has only half of the full ADC range, so that ADCs with redundant stages have actually one more bit of resolution than expected.  The second paper analyzed the use of digital (instead of analog) dither signals with less than half of a least-significant bit amplitude in single- and multi-stage quantizers. It was found that by inserting elementary digital dither signals in successive quantization stages, the input and quantizer residual become progessively independent, which should prove useful in implementing dithering systems.\n\nAnother paper studied comparator metastability.  ADCs use comparators to convert analog signals to digital form, and comparators have finite gain in practice.  When the analog input is close enough to a comparator threshold, the comparator fails to produce a digital output.  Instead, its output is an analog signal, and the comparator is said to be metastable.  Metastability cannot be completely eliminated and can cause huge ADC errors.  Although metastability is usually rare and has little effect on applications such as digital video, metastability is important in storage and communications applications because it increases the bit error rate (BER).  By showing how to use time interleaving of some but not all elements in a pipelined ADC, the outcome of this work was to reduce the cost of achieving a low BER (&lt; 10^-12), which is important in applications such as instrumentation, ultra-wideband communications, and serial-link receivers.\n\nFinally, the last paper studied the background adaptive cancellation of digital switching noise in pipelined ADCs.  Increasing the level of integration to include data converters and digital signal processing on the same integrated circuits is important to reduce cost and power dissipation.  However, increasing the level of integration increases the opportunity for digital circuits to interfere with analog circuits.  By showing how to overcome the effects of switching noise generated by digital circuits on pipelined ADCs, the outcome of this work was to overcome one obstacle in increasing the level of integration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen H Lewis"
