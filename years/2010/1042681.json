The project will enable QEM to assess whether providing these conditions leads to the desired results. Increased STEM faculty participation and awards in NSF's research directorates will lead to enhanced infrastructure and increased research activity at HBCUs as well as bring the experience and perspective of increasing numbers of MSI faculty to the Nation's STEM knowledge base.",

The factors/conditions studied included: release time (reduced teaching load) to conduct STEM research-focused activities; support for undergraduate research assistants; senior faculty research mentors; extensive professional development experiences; guidance in preparing and mentoring students in research; and training in research proposal preparation.</p>\n<p>QEM's experience in helping STEM faculty at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to enhance their scholarly productivity led to the project&rsquo;s implementation of the QEM <strong>Professional Development and Mentoring (PDM) Program</strong> to facilitate participants&rsquo; career advancement and professional growth. Through PDM, QEM provided a cadre of 12 STEM faculty members from 7 HBCUs with a series of professional development workshops and a peer support network as well as mentoring by experienced senior researchers.</p>\n<p>QEM collected data over five years on a range of participant progress indicators: Research Proposal Submission/Success; Presentations; Publications; Mentoring; Other Scholarly Activities, including career advancement (promotion and tenure); and Recognition/Honors. Analyses of the data show that PDM participants made extensive progress in their career growth as a result of their participation in the project. Their resulting scholarly productivity includes: nine promotions; 50 peer-reviewed publications; 32 funding awards; and over 50 presentations at professional conferences. This represents increased capacity for sustaining and strengthening the STEM research and education infrastructure at participating HBCUs.</p>\n<p>QEM conducted seven workshops for the PDM participants that totaled more than 100 hours of training. Key sessions focused on knowledge and skills needed to enhance scholarly productivity: development of a research agenda; integration of research into teaching; career advancement planning; engagement and mentoring of undergraduate students in STEM research; securing funding through competitive proposals; and active involvement in professional societies. STEM department chairs and other faculty/administrators participated in project activities to ensure their involvement in the development and implementation of institutional action plans to sustain the PDM members&rsquo; professional growth.</p>\n<p>QEM developed and published two major resources:</p>\n<p>1) The <em>PDM Anthology: Perspectives from the Field</em> (January 2016), to provide the PDM cadre&mdash;a peer network of early career STEM faculty at HBCUs&mdash;the opportunity to share their project experiences and enhanced knowledge of STEM research, teaching, and outreach with each other as well as with other faculty. The <em>Anthology</em> is comprised of articles that offered their perspectives on various project features and conditions that they found beneficial to their scholarly development and advancement.</p>\n<p><em>2) A Research Mentoring Guide for Early Career STEM Faculty at HBCUs </em>(February 2016).<em> </em>The <em>Guide </em>captures the insights, lessons learned, and best practices in research mentoring that were central to the project&rsquo;s success in enhancing STEM faculty scholarly productivity. The <em>Guide </em>consisted of articles from five PDM senior mentors and three faculty consultants who detailed ways to ensure healthy and productive relationships between mentors and mentees</p>\n<p>Project findings and publications were disseminated through a February 2016 QEM workshop, focused on research mentoring of early career STEM faculty, that brought together 73 participants (teams of STEM junior faculty, their research mentors, and senior administrators) representing 22 HBCUs. The <em>Anthology</em> and <em>Research Mentoring Guide</em> were also shared with over 200 faculty members at HBCUs and other MSIs and with a variety of stakeholders, including NSF program officers, QEM Advisors, STEM deans, chairs, and&nbsp; faculty on participants&rsquo; campuses. QEM encouraged participants to share PDM resources with their campus colleagues.</p>\n<p>Project strategies were found to be effective at enhancing participants&rsquo; research capacities. The workshops provided&nbsp; opportunities for STEM faculty from various institutions to develop ongoing relationships and potential research collaborations. The PDM publications as well as a research summary white paper being prepared for journal submission are new resources for STEM faculty development, especially for underrepresented groups. Knowledge and information obtained from this project was shared with faculty and senior administrators at HBCUs to encourage them to adapt project strategies to enhance their faculty&rsquo;s scholarly productivity.</p>\n<p>HBCUs are the baccalaureate-degree of origin institutions for approximately 20 percent of African American Science and Engineering doctorate recipients. This project worked with HBCU faculty to enhance their research capacity and scholarly productivity, which in turn provided increased research opportunities for their students. The PDM cadre mentored more than 39 STEM students in research as a result of the project. All of the 17 students who directly benefited from the project-funded support graduated with degrees in STEM fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The QEM HBCU-UP Education Research/PDM project&rsquo;s findings can support faculty development efforts at a wide range of institutions.
