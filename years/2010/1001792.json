 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to continue his work (joint with David Ginzburg) on integral representation of Langlands L functions with the study of several new examples which appear in exceptional groups.  These include an integral representation of the adjoint L function of GL(5), and an extension of the so-called doubling method to the exceptional group G2. \r\n\r\nLanglands L functions are certain functions of a single complex variable which appear in the subject of automorphic forms, at the intersection of number theory and representation theory.  The simplest example is the Riemann zeta function, which plays a crucial role in estimating the number of prime integers less than a given number.  The next simplest examples are the Dirichlet L functions, which play a similar role in estimating the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression.  Other examples were defined using modular forms and elliptic curves, resulting in functions with properties nearly identical to these classical examples.  In the last century it emerged that it was possible to study modular forms and elliptic curves from the point of view of representation theory, which is essentially the study of collections of linear operators acting on a vector space.  At the same time, certain complex functions with nearly the same properties as the classical number theoretic functions discussed above arose naturally in representation theory.  These are Langlands L functions.  The main strategy for studying these functions is via integral representations.  This means, simply, that one tries to take a function of two variables, one of which is complex, and integrate it over the other one.  The result is a function of one complex variable, and one hopes that by setting everything up right one can arrange for it to be a Langlands L function.  To date, no one really knows exactly what it takes for this to work out, although a number of useful heuristics have been suggested.  The PI wishes to continue his study of this intriguing phenomenon.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research is concerned with automorphic forms and Langlands L functions.  An automorphic form is a certain type of mathematical function, defined on a multi-dimensional space, and satisfying a periodicity condition with respect to symmetries of that space.  They appear frequently in number theory, but also in string theory and mathematical physics.  Number theory is the study of problems related to the whole numbers: 1,2,3, etc.  It is part of discrete mathematics and finds applications in cryptography and computer science.  An important problem in number theory is the distribution of the prime numbers (those which have no factors other than one and themselves) in the set of whole numbers.  The best approach known to this problem involves a function calle the Riemann zeta function, which is intimately related with certain automorphic forms called theta functions and Eisenstein series.  To build upon what we have learned from the Riemann zeta function, we can study certain generalizations of it called Langlands L functions.  In order to get information about these Langlands L functions, we need a formula for them in terms of things which are better understood.  An integral representation is this type of formula.  It is not currently known what principles govern the existence of these integral representations.  We have a good number of them, and in the course of doing so have developed some sense of where to look.  We do not know why they are found in the places they are found, or whether they might also be found elsewhere if we knew how to look.  In the course of this research, several new integral representations were found.  These should yield applications in automorphic forms and number theory.  In addition, a large survey was undertaken in which a broad famly of integrals was considered in a more cursory fashion.  This will inform current and future inquiry into the principles which govern the existence of integral representations.  The work is computationally intensive, and software was developed to facilitate it which will be of use for future research in this area and also in other areas which involve the so-called exceptional groups (which are five highly symmetric objects which appear throughout mathematics and physics).  As a side effect, a better understanding of some of the automorphic forms which have recently been cropping up in string theory was obtained. Finally, the educational mission of Southern Illinois University Carbondale was supported, as grant support for travel allowed the students and faculty to hear more outside viewpoints on mathematics, and three graduate students gained valuable research experience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Hundley"
