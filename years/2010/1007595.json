This workshop seeks to address problems for societies created by changes in the regional hydrological cycle as a consequence of ongoing glacier and climate change. Its goals are to (i) review the sensitivity of glaciers to climate change on a near-global scale, (ii) to identify key regions on earth where the urge and potential for a cross-cutting projects are highest, and (iii) design strategies to work towards adaption and mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This workshop is to our knowledge unique in including leading experts from disciplines such as glacial geology, glaciology, climatology, hydrology, anthropology, human ecology, and international affairs, providing a forum to create modern approaches to tackle burning environmental problems. The workshop includes young female scientists from the US and Europe and will foster the communication and cooperation between social and natural sciences. Beyond, it will be an excellent opportunity for Columbia University/Lamont students to gain insight in modern environmental sciences.\r\n",
