Wilson Observatory (MWO) 150-foot solar tower telescope. MWO records of solar surface magnetic fields and flow velocities go back to 1967, and the Principal Investgator for this project notes that this long duration record provides a unique database for tests of existing solar cycle models. \r\n\r\nMeasurements of the state of motion and magnetism on the Sun's surface are necessary for defining and testing models of solar variability and instability, and MWO data will be provided to the scientific and operational communities who develop quantitative predictions of the space environment.   MWO data will continue to help improve our understanding of the sunspot cycle, and potentially make it possible to predict the level of solar magnetic activity for future cycles, thereby contributing to operational space weather forecasting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe sun influences society, especially our modern technical society, through its dominant energy outputs in the form of light and particles.  The most of the energy output is very stable over time but at high energies solar magnetic fields are the governing agent.  Solar eruptions such as flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can disrupt vital societal systems such as power grids and communication spacecraft.  The solar magnetic fields undergo an eleven-year cyclic variation as well as shorter and longer term changes.  Knowledge of the solar magnetic fields and the velocities that influence their changes is essential both to predict the future state of the sun and to understand its past history.\n\nThe project of regular magnetic and velocity observations of the solar surface carried out at the 150-foot tower telescope at the Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) has provided data that is fundamental to our understanding of solar variability.  A graphical representation of the magnetic field evolution is shown in the first image.  This shows that the first two cycles are shorter than the most recent one and that they are stronger.  Analysis of the long record has revealed the presence of a pattern of magnetic ripples shown in the second image.  This pattern may indicate the operation of a previously unknown oscillatory process as the magnetic field undergoes its longer and larger 11-year cycle. \n\nThe polar reversal characterizing the solar cycle depends on the migration of the fields from near the equator to the polar regions as driven by circulation currents. The MWO observations allow the determination of the circulation from the line-of-sight Doppler shift velocities.  The long duration of the MWO data allows the identification of changes between solar cycles 22 and 23 as is shown in the third included figure.  The polar reverse flow, present in cycle 22 but absent in cycle 23, determines whether the magnetic fields must traverse all the way to the poles or if they are swept inward at an intermediate latitude.  The longer duration of cycle 23 may be a consequence of the absence of the reverse cell so that the surface field must migrate a greater distance before the flow turns into the solar interior.  This circulation pattern difference is shown in the fourth included figure.\n\nThe Doppler shift velocities supplement inferences obtained using the newer technique of helioseismology which can track the flow below the solar surface.  Helioseismology has suggested that the circulation pattern shown in the fourth figure does not extend to the convection zone base as illustrated but rather has a complex, multi-cellular structure with reversed flow at a point about 10 percent in from the solar surface (Astrophysical Journal Letters, 774, L29 [2013]).  The results from the MWO Doppler shift analysis are not altered by the helioseismic inferences which do not probe the polar regions.\n\nThe torsional oscillation is the deviation in the rotation velocity as a function of time and latitude.  The pattern consists of a zone of speeded-up rotation velocity that begins at the time of sunspot minimum near latitudes of 35 degrees and migrates toward the equator over a period of about six years.  Although the pattern is closely associated with the positions of sunspots, the cause of the torsional oscillation is not understood.  The newest torsional oscillation map from the MWO project is shown in the fifth figure. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roger K Ulrich"
