One useful sensor for this purpose is scanning laser rangefinders, know as LIDAR. These sensors sweep a laser around the environment and collect distance measurements for millions of points around the autonomous system or robot.  This 3D point cloud must be processed to extract a useful map of the environment, where the ground and various objects are segmented from one another so navigation or object manipulation can be performed.  This research project involved developing a software tool for testing the performance of LIDAR processing and segmentation algorithms. Segmentation is an important step before objects can be classified into general types such as a car, a tree, or a person.  Segmentation results can also directly be used for navigation, because obstacles and ground planes are identified.\n\nThe software utility developed during this project performs segmentation of LIDAR data and visualization of the results of these algorithms. With this software a user can view a 3D rendering of the resulting segmentation for a given algorithm, and change parameters to see how the segmentation results are effected.  The utility also allows a user to hand label the segmentation of a data set, and then  a test can be run which compares between the results of a segmentation algorithm and the manually selected segmentation. The utility can be used to run a series of tests with different parameters, while measuring the accuracy of the segmentation for each set of parameters and each dataset. The data produced by these tests can be analyzed to tune algorithms and determine the most effective techniques for segmenting different densities of data and object in different environments.\n\nThe improved segmentation algorithms that have been developed during this project and more that may be developed with the use of the software created in this project have important potential impacts in the realm of autonomous systems.  Better segmentation performace can lead to more accurate navigation by an unmanned vehicle.  The use of unmanned vehicles or \"drones\" is constantly increaseing.  Unmanned aerial vehicles have shown their potential as effective tools for surveilance, surveying, and military uses.  Unmanned ground vehicles are beginning to come into more widespread commercial and military use, where they can also save lives by taking humans out of harms way.  This research has the potential to help improve the performance of these systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Noah Kuntz"
