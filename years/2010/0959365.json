 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\nFunds from the NSF MRI-R2 program have been awarded to the University of Connecticut to support the purchase of an Applied Biosystems SOLiD3 massively parallel nucleic acid sequencer.  The new sequencer supports research endeavors in a broad range of traditional and non-traditional model organisms addressing questions at the forefront of ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, cancer biology and molecular genetics.  The 20 primary users of the instrument are part of a non-fee-for-service consortium of users, the Center for Applied Genetics and Technology (CAGT).  The CAGT members use the SOLiD3 instrument and data in training and outreach activities from K-12 education through postdoctoral training.  SOLiD3 training has been added as a new section to the highly successful course \"Theory and Practice of High-Throughput Genome Analysis\", and is used to provide hands-on training for faculty, staff and graduate students.   The CAGT provides assistance to support the inclusion of modern genomics technology acquired under this MRI into the research sites involved in the UConn Mentor Connection program for high school students each summer and offers a one day workshop during the Mentor Connection period to introduce students to the \"future of genomics research\" facilitated by next generation sequencing platforms.  In addition to active involvement in recruiting minorities to STEM disciplines through such collaborations as the NSF AGEP and PSM programs in the CAGT at UConn, the instrumentation will be used in a planned workshop associated with the Next Generation Sequencing in Non-Traditional Model Systems conference.  The acquisition of the SOLiD3 further enhances the workforce through training future scientists in this technology, upstream molecular techniques and downstream data analysis.  Results from the research and outreach efforts will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, and through student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.",
