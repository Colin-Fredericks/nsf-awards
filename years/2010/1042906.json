 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative grant to UNAVCO, Inc., an EAR supported national geodetic support Facility (EAR-0735156), and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), an AGS supported consortium that manages the National Center for Atmospheric Research Facilities (NCAR), supports a five year planned development of a plate-scale integrated geodetic and atmospheric/regional climate observational system in the pan-Caribbean region.   A goal of the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet) is to add 50 new semi-permanently monumented, continuously operating, Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) stations spanning multiple Caribbean and Caribbean bordering nations. COCONet goals also call for the integration of GPS data from up to 50 existing stations operating in the Caribbean.  The new cGPS stations will, in some cases, be co-located with existing tide gauges, thus supporting studies of sea level change in response to current global warming, and will be mated with surface meteorological observational equipment (Metpacks) to significantly expand spatiotemporal geodetic and atmospheric observational infrastructure in a region of complex tectonics with substantial earthquake, tsunami, volcanic, tropical storm and hurricane, flooding and landslide hazards.  COCONet will provide a backbone fiducial and meteorologic observational network and COCONet data and data products that will be freely available through the UNAVCO archive will be available to serve a broad range of basic tectonic and atmospheric research investigations and enable observations of immediate relevance for advancing understanding, mitigating and perhaps predicting regional geohazards.  Some specific questions that COCONet data could help to address include:  1) How rigid is the Caribbean plate?; 2)  What are the slip rates along active faults that bound the Caribbean plate?; 3)  How is stress released at convergent plate boundaries and how is stress transferred across plate boundaries?; and 4)  How can we better understand and assess hazards in the Caribbean and Central American regions?  Atmospheric questions that could be advanced by proposed GPS meteorological determinations and surface measurements of atmospheric physical properties include: 1)  How sensitive is tropospheric water vapor content to changes in sea surface temperatures?; and  2) How does the distribution of precipitable water vapor across the Caribbean region influence the genesis, intensification and vectoring of tropical storms and hurricanes?    \r\n\r\nCOCONet data will flow via the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) data management system and be available via the Web-accessible UNAVCO data archive.  Low-latency data telemetry will be via cellular modem or through VSAT satellite communications to the PBO Network Operations Center in Boulder, Colorado.  These data will be processed into derived geodetic products, including combined GPS station position and velocity estimates, simplified position time series and velocity field estimates in multiple formats, at the existing PBO GPS Analysis Centers at Central Washington University and New Mexico Tech and the Analysis Center Coordinator at MIT.  In addition, UCAR will estimate tropospheric precipitable water vapor (PV) every 30 minutes from observations of GPS radio frequency signal propagation delays along the path length between the satellite transmitter and the receiver coupled with concurrent surface measurement of barometric pressure.  The PV observations will feed into operational numerical weather models run several times per day.  \r\n\r\nThe project will engage Caribbean researchers, their students and governmental agency representatives with the goal of empowering these nations to utilize COCONet data for both scientific and socioeconomic purposes.  Real-time data from COCONet will be made available to the International GNSS Service (IGS) to help densify GPS observations in a region of the globe with few existing real-time data streams and thereby improve GPS satellite orbit calculations and help to refine the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF).",

These observations have been used to test climate models and to increase the capacity in the region to predict the natural hazards that pose such a significant threat to the Caribbean.  In addition, data from COCONet GNSS stations have been used to assess Caribbean plate rigidity and kinematics, providing a revised reference frame to examine regional effects adjacent to the plate boundaries.  Research stimulated by COCONet promises fundamental improvements in climate and weather forecasts in large areas of the Caribbean as well as improvements in the understanding of the earthquake cycle.\n\nThe original proposed siting plan called for the installation of 50 new cGNSS-Met stations.  One of the recommendations adopted at the first COCONet community meeting in Puerto Rico, however, was to refurbish some of the existing stations in the region as well as to install new stations, in order to maximize the scientific benefit of the network (Figures 1-a and 1-b).  In 2018, UNAVCO engineers installed the last of 85 cGNSS-Met stations (59 new and 26 refurbished, Figure 2) installed as part of the COCONet project.   During the construction phase of COCONet, UNAVCO engineers also installed two cGNSS-constrained sea-level tide gauges and augmented two existing sea-level tide gauges with cGNSS in the Caribbean region as part of a supplement approved for this award.  UNAVCO engineers worked with personnel from the University of Colorado, University of Hawaii, NOAA and commercial specialists to validate the design and location of these sea-level tide gauges.  After the construction phase of the project came to end in December 2016, UNAVCO continued to provide in-field engineering support and advise to local partners in the operations and maintenance of the GNSS, meteorological, and tide gauge instruments.\n\nCOCONet was a multi-national project involving partners from over 30 countries in the Caribbean region.  In addition to the new and refurbished cGNSS-Met stations installed during the construction phase of COCONet, these partner organizations also contributed GNSS data from 59 cGNSS stations.   UNAVCO currently archives 157 COCONet-designated cGNSS stations, including some that are now retired and thus are no longer providing new data to the UNAVCO archive.   High-rate (1-Hz) GNSS data streams for 51 COCONet cGNSS-Met stations continue to be delivered through the NTRIP caster at UNAVCO.\n\nProject successes include:\n\nCompletion of all planned tasks on time and within budget, including the installation of additional new and refurbished stations.\nPublication of dozens of abstracts and research articles.\nTraining of local engineers and technicians in installation techniques and data archiving using Dataworks for GNSS.\nDevelopment of strong public outreach and community engagement in the Caribbean region, including the use of an email list serve (coconet-all@unavco.org), UNAVCO webpage, and Facebook page.\nDevelopment and use of Dataworks for GNSS software with funding from this award and other sources, to enhance capacity in the Caribbean region through development of the COCONet Regional Data Centers at the Instituto Nicaraguense De Estudios Territoriales(INETER, Nicaragua), The Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology(CIMH, Barbados), and the Colombian Geological Survey(CGS, Colombia).\nOrganization and management of four regional workshops focused on COCONet site selection, project scientific objectives, network sustainability, community engagement, and other outreach activities.  \nImplementation of the COCONet Fellows Program, offering funding for 8 graduate students working on research within the Caribbean region (Figure 3).  Many of the former COCONet Graduate Fellows are thriving in their geoscience careers andmaking significant contributions to advancing geosciences. COCONet Science Fellows appreciate the support theyreceived during their graduate work from the NSF COCONet project and many continue to usethe skills they learned from using COCONet in other research.\nBroadcasting via NTRIP real-time 1 Hz data streams from 51 stations for hazard applications.\nObservation of seismically generated surface waves and co-seismic displacement from three large earthquakes within the COCONet footprint in 2017. GNSS real-time position time series yielded magnitude estimates derived from peak ground displacements in excellent agreement with final values.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glen S Mattioli"
