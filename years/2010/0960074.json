 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Brooks H. Pate of the University of Virginia, David W. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Steven T. Shipman of New College of Florida have submitted a proposal in response to the MRI-R2 solicitation to construct a 3rd Generation Chirped-Pulse Fourier Transform Microwave spectrometer (CP-FTMW) for applications in molecular structure determination.  The proposed instrument will advance microwave spectroscopy for the analysis of conformational flexible molecules, molecular complexes and chemically reactive species such as ions and radicals.  In addition, powerful new double-resonance techniques using fully shapeable microwave pulses produced by a high-speed arbitrary waveform generator will be designed and implemented. These techniques will make it possible to use the spectrometer's performance gains to speed the analysis of spectra, not just the acquisition of spectra.  \r\n\r\nThe CP-FTMW technique exploits advances in high-speed digital electronics to achieve excellent speed and sensitivity in obtaining molecular rotational spectra.   Analysis of the spectra provides detailed structural parameters for the molecules, ions and radicals under investigation.  Structural information is the sine qua non necessary to understand chemical properties and reactivity.  The development of this spectrometer will train undergraduate and graduate students in the construction and use of modern instrumentation.",
