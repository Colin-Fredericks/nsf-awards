 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merits: The main objective of the proposed career research is the realization of nanoelectrochemical systems through a marriage of microelectronics and electrochemistry for low-cost, high-throughput bench-top nanofabrication. The PI proposes a highly unconventional yet powerful candidate to realize such nanoelectrochemical devices ? that of top-down fabricated silicon CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) die as functional substrate for controlled nanofabrication. This new paradigm extends the role of CMOS technology beyond conventional areas of computation, signal processing and communication towards directed nanoassembly and nanofabrication. The proposed research will develop two approaches: (1) CMOS for Nanoassembly: Electric field manipulation and assembly of already synthesized nanostructures and (2) CMOS for Nanofabrication: Controlled electrochemical growth of different types of nanowires directly on CMOS. Built-in integrated circuits will facilitate real-time feedback control for assembly and growth, and can be reused as front-end circuits for sensing. The research provides a direct path for heterogeneous integration of multiple nanomaterials on same silicon chip. As a proof of concept, the PI plans to implement a nanoelectrochemical sensor for bioanalysis, primarily detection of neurotransmitters, and environmental sensing of trace heavy metal ions in actual samples.\r\nBroader impacts: The research, if successful, will have tremendous economic and societal impact through innovation and product development in areas of chemical and biological sensing, high-speed electronics, and devices for energy generation and storage. The PI will implement four key initiatives as part of the integrated education and outreach plan: (i) Project-based learning initiatives in undergraduate courses (ii) Graduate level course on Bottom-up nanomanufacturing, (iii) Interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduates, and (iv) Web based modules for public audience. Plans for participation of minorities and under-represented groupa include: (i) Summer and semester long research opportunities for women students from Tufts University and Simmons College, an all-women undergraduate institution (ii) Summer internship opportunities for under-represented groups advertised through the Center for STEM Diversity at Tufts University and (iii) K-12 and community outreach through student teacher mentorship programs and seminars at local high-schools in the Medford and Malden areas.",
