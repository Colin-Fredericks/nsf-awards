 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the development and analysis of numerical methods \r\nto probe the complex energy landscapes related to various interface and defect \r\nproblems, such as microstructures in materials undergoing phase transitions, \r\nquantized vortices in geometrically frustrated configurations, and so on. \r\nThe associated stochastic dynamics and hydrodynamics, as well as their \r\nnumerical approximations will also be investigated.\r\nHe will also study robust and adaptive algorithms that are useful in the \r\nstatistical analysis of the underlying structures and important features. \r\nThese research issues, on one hand, are driven by practical applications \r\nthrough collaborations with other scientists, and on the other hand, also \r\nmotivate new studies of mathematical subjects ranging from geometry and \r\ntopology to numerical and stochastic analysis. The research to be carried out is of interdisciplinary nature, encompassing subjects like computational mathematics, physics, information, materials and biological sciences. \r\nThere are many mathematical and numerical challenges involved in the research \r\nsuch as the understanding of the collective behaviors of families and paths of \r\nsolutions of nonlinear PDEs and stochastic dynamics, and the exploration of \r\nthe hidden structures and statistics in the simulated results.\r\n\r\nThe research on the algorithmic development and numerical simulations can help \r\nenhancing the capability as well as the predictive power of scientific \r\ncomputations, which has potentially significant scientific, social and \r\neconomic impact and is one of the top research priorities internationally. \r\nMeanwhile, interfaces and defects are also ubiquitous in nature which play \r\nfundamental roles in many aspects of physical and biological systems. A better \r\nmathematical and computational understanding of interfaces and defects,  \r\nespecially in a stochastic setting,  will enrich the scientific knowledge base, which in turn may  aid the efforts by physicists, materials scientists and engineers in discovering new materials with desirable properties and in \r\ndeveloping new scientific devices and commercial instruments. This project \r\nwill also provide valuable interdisciplinary research opportunities for the \r\nfuture generation of workforce and researchers. With an emphasis on the TEAMS \r\n(Training in Experiments, Analysis, Modeling and Simulations) spirit, young \r\nstudents can be better prepared to conduct interdisciplinary research in their \r\ncareer.",
