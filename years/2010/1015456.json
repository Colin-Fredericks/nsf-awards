  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of our current research is to develop rigorous scientific methods that leverage data to build adaptive personalized support for learning.  These data driven techniques will greatly reduce the required time to develop intelligent tutoring systems, expediting the adaptation of personalized learning. \n\nThe advancement of personalized learning is part of the National Academy of Engineering\u2019s 14 grand challenges.  Creating technologies, such as intelligent tutoring systems, computer tutors that can adapt education to individual students, has the potential to transform education.  The PUMP Algebra intelligent tutor, used in thousands of schools, improves student performance on standardized tests by 15&mdash;25%. However, it takes between 100&mdash;1000 work hours to create one hour of intelligent tutor content.  This research aims to enhance infrastructure for education by designing faster methods to create and improve intelligent tutoring systems. \n\nThe research performed as part of this award focused on the design and evaluation of data-driven methods of generating basic intelligent tutoring system behaviors. The goal is simplifying the process of creating these systems in order to broaden their adaptation in schools.  We used data collected before the award to find the effects of these automatically generated hints on student performance; the results showed that students who were given the automatically generated feedback out performed those without.\n\nWe also worked on developing new techniques for analysis of problems with multiple steps, such as solving propositional logic proofs.  We developed a method of classifying individual steps of the problem as being useful / not useful and correct / incorrect.  Using this method we can apply our automatic feedback generation techniques to domains where there are not always clear correct or incorrect answers.  Future research can combine these techniques with other student model tracing research to generate more complex intelligent tutoring system behaviors.\n\nData-driven knowledge tracing, combined with automatically generated feedback will advance discovery and understanding in learning sciences, educational data mining, and intelligent tutoring systems.  Personalized learning can provide equal opportunities across wide geographic locations and adapt to any student, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or economic status. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Eagle"
