 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to test the hypothesis that superior surface integrity enables a significant increase of corrosion resistance of novel biodegradable orthopedic magnesium-calcium implants. The research approach is to adjust surface integrity of magnesium-calcium implants by a new hybrid dry cutting-finish burnishing process. The specific methodology includes: (1) fabrication of biodegradable, biocompatible, and lightweight magnesium calcium alloys via calcium alloying and characterization of dynamic mechanical behaviors and microstructures, (2) creation of desired surface integrity of implants through the novel hybrid dry cutting-finish burnishing process with acoustic emission process monitoring, (3) development of a microscale finite element analysis model to provide a fundamental understanding on the process mechanics and surface integrity, and (4) characterization of process-induced surface integrity and its effect on biodegradation performance in simulated body fluids.\r\n\r\nThe research results will enable progress in biodegradable orthopedic implants via solving the pressing issues of stress shielding and surgical interventions associated with commercial permanent metallic implants. It will provide an insight into the basic relationships between process parameters, surface integrity, and biodegradation performance of orthopedic implants. The benefits to society include the improved life quality and reduced financial burden of the affected individuals. The socioeconomic benefits of biodegradable magnesium-calcium implants will also help boost the competitiveness of the booming medical device manufacturing industry.",
