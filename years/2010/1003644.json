What can account for this labor revitalization? This research develops a comparative case study of labor mobilization in two industrial cities (General Pacheco in Buenos Aires province and Puerto Tirol in Chaco province). The ethnography will be combined with the quantitative study of labor market dynamics, in order to understand the interactions between social structure, cultural politics and organizational dynamics in the formation of labor protests. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis study will deepen our knowledge about union possibilities to organize workers outside their traditional social base.\r\n",

Findings from fieldwork were included as sources for the design of the syllabus for the class so that they became the starting point for discussions of students about their own work and union experience. Finally, findings from research were presented at a radio show broadcasted to the Spanish speaking community of Madison, Wisconsin.
