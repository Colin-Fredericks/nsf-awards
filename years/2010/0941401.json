 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the pervasive role played by databases in our society and the increased demand for students with interdisciplinary skills, the next challenge for educators is the design of database curriculum suitable for a variety of majors.  This challenge is consistent with the enhanced awareness of computational thinking, which introduces computational methods and models to non-computing majors.  The objective of this project is to develop a collection of learning materials to support student learning of  relational databases.  The collection includes student learning outcomes, engaging animations and several cooperative learning exercises.  This project has the potential for significant impact on the future workforce by providing students with the necessary understanding of data and the exchange of data in order to solve problems in our information-centric society.",
