 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cloud computing provides economic advantages from shared resources, but security is a major risk for remote operations and a major barrier to the approach, with challenges for both hosts and the network. NEBULA is a potential future Internet architecture providing trustworthy networking for the emerging cloud computing model of always-available network services. NEBULA addresses many network security issues, including data availability with a new core architecture (NCore) based on redundant connections to and between NEBULA core routers, accountability and trust with a new policy-driven data plane (NDP), and extensibility with a new control plane (NVENT) that supports network virtualization, enabling results from other future Internet architectures to be incorporated in NEBULA. NEBULA?s data plane uses cryptographic tokens as demonstrable proofs that a path was both authorized and followed. The NEBULA control plane provides one or more authorized paths to NEBULA edge nodes; multiple paths provide reliability and load-balancing. The NEBULA core uses redundant high-speed paths between data centers and core routers, as well as fault-tolerant router software, for always-on core networking. The NEBULA architecture removes network (in) security as a prohibitive factor that would otherwise prevent the realization of many cloud computing applications, such as electronic health records and data from medical sensors. NEBULA will produce a working system that is deployable on core routers and is viable from both an economic and a regulatory perspective.",

Previous research  had shown that network disruptions often stem from transient instabilities  within the network routers that results in slow delivery of data to the user.   The user experiences choppy audio or video, slow page downloads, and such  efforts could be dangerous in the future when we start to see control systems  for the smart power grid, or for smart cars, that may depend on network access  to databases and other services. \n\n \n\nCompanies  such as Cisco (with which we partnered) have made their hardware routers more  reliable, but the software infrastructures have lagged.  For example, Cisco  showed us examples of routing instability that lasted two or three minutes,  triggered by rebooting a router daemon: an event that would normally require  less than a second to perform.  In these episodes, the hardware and the routing  daemon were quickly back to normal, yet the Internet would \"ring like a bell.\"    The brief disruption to the routing protocols employed at the Internet\u00c6s  lowest levels could be seen to propagate widely, dying out only over an extended  period of time.  Clearly for the future Internet to play the intended roles,  this kind of issue needs to be resolved.\n\n \n\nWithin  FIA, Cornell (Ken Birman, Robbert Van Renesse and PhD student Robert Surton) teamed with other groups to help Cisco demonstrate a  solution to this problem.

Cornell\u00c6s specific contribution was to show how we can completely mask the  daemon restart events from the perspective of other remote routers.

With standard network  cards this would not have been feasible because the granularity..."
