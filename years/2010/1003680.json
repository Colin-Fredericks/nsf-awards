 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project features six interrelated activities that advance community college leadership in STEM education, encourage more community colleges to develop ATE-related programs, and promote the value, accomplishments, and impact of the ATE program. The activities build upon the successes of previous efforts supported by the National Science Foundation, and include: three National ATE Principal Investigators Conferences in 2011, 2012, 2013, improved access to ATE PI Conference presentations and materials through a conference blog, YouTube channel, video and audio downloads, and webinars, continuation of the MentorLinks program with an additional 10 community colleges establishing new programs or strengthening existing programs in STEM fields, a project brief focusing on the outcomes of the MentorLinks program, a series of student video profiles highlighting 10 ATE students and their accomplishments, and increased dissemination of information about ATE programs and their impact through presentations, feature stories, web site, and the use of social media technologies. The impact of these activities is helping community college leaders to make the important connections and partnerships necessary to build and sustain their STEM programs. The activities are helping to expand, shape, and focus the future of the ATE program as it positions itself to meet the increasing demand for a trained technical workforce amid the challenges of maintaining U.S. competitiveness in a global economy.",

In addition, the Broadening Impact Conference offered professional development opportunities to more than 300 attendees, and included targeted NSF Program Director-led sessions focused on activities to strengthen partnerships and share information about NSF programs open to community colleges.\n\nAACC managed the MentorLinks: Advancing Technological Education program and assisted eight \"mentee\" community colleges in developing, strengthening, and sustaining their STEM technician education programs.  AACC awarded two-year grants of $20,000 to the mentee colleges and paired each college team with an experienced mentor in their disciplinary field.
