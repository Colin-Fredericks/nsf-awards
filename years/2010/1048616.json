Thermoelectric materials to be investigated include filled-skutterudites that are currently being investigated by the corporate partner, General Motors, as well as nanowire-based materials, nanocrystalline ceramic compounds, and metal/conductor superlattices to be developed at Purdue. Systems-level thermal modeling will be conducted to maximize the temperature difference across the thermoelectric material, thereby increasing the efficiency with which waste heat can be converted to electric power. Novel durable nanoscale  thermal interface materials will be developed to  minimize thermal resistances in order to promote high energy conversion efficiency.. Properties will be measured using a photoacoustic method and a laser thermal reflectance method at Purdue in conjunction with use of facilities at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The collaboration between researchers at Purdue and General Motors will accelerate the development of new technology that will promote the efficient and cost-effective thermoelectric conversion of waste heat to electric power in vehicle applications. Successful development and ultimate implementation will improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. The research results will be disseminated by traditional means, as well as through Purdue?s nanoHUB and thermalHUB web portals. The research will provide graduate students with interdisciplinary research experiences, as well as industrial experience through internships in industry. The research will be integrated with undergraduate and graduate courses and serve as the basis for undergraduate design projects. Outreach activities to high school students, including students from underrepresented groups, have been planned.",
