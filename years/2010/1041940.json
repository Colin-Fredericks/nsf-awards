The rig sank in waters approximately 5,000 feet deep, resulting in three leaks, spewing about 5,000 barrels (or 210,000 gallons) of oil a day from the uncapped well. Crude oil continues to discharge from the well at an alarming rate. Work on drilling a relief well which would\r\nstop the leak, if successful, will take at least three months. Even if the oil was secured today (May 5, 2010), the true impacts on this region will take years to calculate. The entire Gulf region is currently, or potentially will be impacted through fisheries, tourism, human health, and general environmental hazards of this spill.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
