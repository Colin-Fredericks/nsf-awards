 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the known photochemistry of the ultraviolet and visible photolysis of nitrate as a study system, the interfacial aqueous phase ice-atmosphere surface photo-oxidation mechanisms expected to be active in snow, firn and on atmospheric ice-crystals are to be investigated. \r\n\r\nAdvanced surface techniques such as in-situ (ambient pressure) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (AP PES) and in-situ near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) will characterize, at the molecular level, the interactions of probe hydrocarbons, in the presence and absence of nitric acid, in the Quasi-Liquid film layer (QLL) that covers solid ice surfaces. Actinic irradiation ( > 300 nm) of sorbed nitrate will yield an experimental system capable of studying reactivity of OH radicals with target hydrocarbons. This is in turn to lead to a broader understanding of the importance of these surface photochemical mechanisms relevant to snow-pack and ice chemistry of polar and cold regions of the atmosphere at intermediate, yet environmentally relevant, temperatures (> -20C to 0 C).\r\n\r\nDr John Newberg has been awarded an OPP Post-Doctoral Fellowship to conduct this research under the mentorship of Dr Hendrik Blum, Chemical Sciences, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The project is interdisicplinary, and is supported by the OPP-AOAS, GEO- Atmospheric Chemistry, and MPS - Environmental Chemical Sciences programs.",
