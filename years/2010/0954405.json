Various measures will be employed to quantify the causal chain that associates climatic variability with streamflow and water quality variability.  Multiple General Circulation Models (GCMs) forecasts will be utilized to develop streamflow and water quality forecasts, which are ingested into water allocation and water quality management models.  Retrospective analyses using these forecasts will be performed to develop an integrated water management plan.  This research aims to create a fundamental body of knowledge on understanding the role of climate variability in modulating streamflow and water quality in river basins.  It is expected that findings from this research will offer insights on the vulnerability of water quality attributes to climatic variability.  Streamflow forecasts developed using GCM forecasts will reduce model uncertainty and improve seasonal water allocation and water quality management plans.  Generalizing the findings will help in understanding the potential utility of climate forecasts in promoting water resources sustainability.",
