The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) in Japan will fund the travel of the Japanese delegation to the US and cover the expenses of hosting the US delegation's visit to Japan. NSF would cover the travel expenses of the US delegation to Japan and expenses of hosting the Japanese delegation's visit to the US.\r\n\r\nExchange opportunities for researchers are expected to capitalize on research synergies across institutions, address current challenges in nanomanufacturing concepts, techniques, and practices, and form enduring collaborations between individuals, institutions, and countries.  The bi-lateral exchange of participants includes a US visit by the Japanese delegation in October 2010 and a Japan visit by the US delegation in December 2010; these visits will include activities at host institutions, tours of facilities, discussions, and presentations of research.",

The 2010 symposium featured seminars from leading researchers addressing current challenges in nanomanufacturing, micro/nano-fluidics-based toolbits, devices, and aptamer arrays, among others.  Exchange opportunities included 1) exploiting research synergies across institutions, 2) addressing current challenges in nanomanufacturing concepts, techniques, and practices, and 3) forming lasting collaborations between individuals, institutions, and countries. \nIntellectual Merit\nThe phenomena that scientists have been able to observe by controlling the composition of matter at the nanoscale have far-reaching implications for a wide range of technologies, including electronics, computation, communications, energy, transportation, health care, and medicine.  However, to realize the economic potential of this technology in the form of products, the capability to \u2018manufacture\u2019 at the nanoscale is a challenge that must be addressed in order to make \u2018nano-enabled\u2019 products an economic reality.   The symposium fostered a synergetic approach to determining and solving key research challenge areas requiring not only an interdisciplinary but international approach to meet the challenges of working at the nanoscale. \n\nPresentations at the U.S. sites covered various research frontiers and challenges in nanomanufacturing. UIUC presentations (October 4 and 5) focused on fluidics and flexible electronics and combinatorial chemistry applications.   Featured speakers included Professors Takao Someya (University of Tokyo), Katsuaki Suganuma (Osaka Uni&shy;versity), and Osamu Tabata (Kyoto University), Placid Ferreira (Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC), and Kent Choquette and Rashid Bashir (both of Electrical Science and Computer Engineering, UIUC).

The scope of presentations at NIMS (December 6) focused on nanomanufacturing with scalability, nano-imprinting, organic materials processing and devices, MEMS/NEMS and process simulations.

It has helped increase the number of talented researchers across national boundaries and helped solidify the possibilities of collaborative research initiatives between industry, government and academia in both countries.  Associations established through this program have facilitated the investigation of key research challenges in nanomanufacturing which promise to have a broad impact on medicine, electronics, and materials in the next two decades, and have facilitated the cross-fertilization of the latest research advances, theories, and applications developed across the participating institutions.
