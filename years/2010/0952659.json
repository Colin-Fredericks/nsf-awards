Recent work shows that sexual selection is a ubiquitous process creating new species, yet almost nothing is known about how it creates reproductive isolation at the genomic level. The proposed work focuses on mate choice in species of stickleback fishes. Measures of sexual selection and sexual isolation from field behavioral experiments will be combined with genetic mapping to identify the parts of the genome that underlie male reproductive success and generate isolation between species. Laboratory experiments will evaluate the role of sensory bias for particular colors in generating sexual selection and speciation. \r\n\r\nSeveral of these fish species are endangered due to hybridization following species introductions; this research addresses urgent priorities for the stickleback recovery team and has broad implications for understanding how environmental change threatens endangered species. The educational plan addresses increasing public understanding of evolution through public outreach and training for K-12 teachers. The researchers will develop formal and informal educational materials based on real-world examples of Evolution in Action to enhance public insight into how evolution generates new species. The research will also train graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoc in evolutionary genetics and behavioral research, and in public outreach.",

Speciation is the process that creates diversity, and understanding this process is fundamental to our ability to stem the tide of species loss. Our funded project delved into the speciation process, asking two controversial questions. First, how does sexual selection act on behavior, morphology, and genomes to create new species? When we started the work, even though scientists knew that sexual selection is ubiquitous, almost nothing was known about how it works to isolate species especially at the genomic level. Second, can sexual selection cause species loss through hybridization?</p>\n<p>Our work focused on mate choice and mate competition in species of stickleback fishes. We estimated how strongly sexual selection acts to cause isolation between species using a field behavioral experiment over several years. Lab based experiments teased apart the ways in which fish mate choice is changed when the environment is altered, similar to how lakes have been changed by pollution and invasive species. And finally, we found regions of the genome that contain genes coding for mating competition, mate choice, and fitness. We found that the intense battles males engage in when competing for mates can cause divergence that results in speciation which increases diversity, and has stronger effects than natural selection in many cases. However when environments are disturbed by humans, this same competition can cause species to fuse resulting in a loss of species diversity. We also found that mate choice is affected by changing environments, because pollution can interfere with how well fish can see or smell potential mates. When fish cannot tell the difference between their own or another species, then hybridization is more likely. Therefore, these environmental changes are likely to result in additional species loss.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts affect conservation of endangered species, public education on evolution, training the scientific workforce, and enhancing diversity in the sciences. Several of these fish species are endangered due to hybridization following species introductions; this research addressed urgent priorities identified by the stickleback recovery team as essential to efforts for conserving them. It also has broad implications for understanding how environmental change threatens endangered species. The educational plan addressed increasing public understanding of evolution through public outreach and training for K-12 teachers. The researchers developed formal and informal educational materials based on real-world examples of Evolution in Action emphasizing our own work funded by this grant, and used these to enhance public insight into how evolution generates new species through more than 40 public outreach events. In addition, members of the lab spent many hours in Michigan classrooms, helping teachers develop curricular material and directly teaching students about ecology and evolution in our changing world. The research trained numerous undergraduate students, four graduate students, and two postdoctoral scientists in evolutionary genetics and behavioral research, and instilled in them the importance for scientists to engage in public outreach. Diversity was enhanced in several ways. First, many people in the lab are members of under represented minorities and even more are women, and the experience provided by the grant funding facilitated their career success. Second, the PI initiated numerous activities to foster the success of women in the sciences, working at local, regional, national, and international levels. These activities also instilled in participants and administration the importance of diversity for enhancing scientific progress and diversity in our society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Janette&nbsp;W&nbsp;Boughman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0952659/0952659_10017493_1506549350676_mcompfitnessland--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0952659/0952659_10017493_1506549350676_mcompfitnessland--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Divergent sexual selection favors 2 male types\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/0952659/0952659_10017493_1506549350676_mcompfitnessland--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Divergent sexual selection favors 2 male types\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reproductive fitness for male stickleback fish competing for females.
