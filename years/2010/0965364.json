 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development and implementation of new quantitative methods to provide a deeper understanding of science policy interventions. By building analytic tools that capture the diversity of science, this project moves beyond existing methods that typically analyze the rate of scientific innovation. This move is an important next step in the \"science of science policy\" agenda:\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Although understanding of institutional changes on the rate of inventive activity has improved markedly in recent years, effective science policy interventions must also be grounded in an understanding of their impact on diversity as well as productivity, construed both in terms of idea diversity -- the array of different ideas derived from novel scientific insights -- and individual diversity -- the variety of people and organizations in social space engaged in scientific progress. To move forward with this crucial agenda requires a rich new set of tools. In developing such tools, this project extends prior work that focuses on \"citation-counting,\" combining novel approaches from social and computer sciences to represent and analyze publication, patent and grant data in idea and social space. Specifically, the tools  integrate two powerful methods: (a) statistical topic modeling and (b) social network analysis. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: These methods can also be extended to examine diversity across national, social and topic boundaries, thus providing quantitative tools to characterize issues of key significance in debates over national competitiveness. While these science policy questions could be addressed in a wide variety of settings, this project focuses on the varied data associated with the human genome and human genetics.\r\n",

This is an established topic, having been noted in the title of Kenneth Arrow's seminal work on the \"Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity\", and yet more attention has traditionally benn paid to the rate of inventive activity (i.e. the number of publications, patents, citations, new products etc), rather than its direction.  In part, this gap arises from the fact that there are considerable challenges in measuring the direction of research.\n\nIn this project we have sought to develop new tools to capture the direction of progress.  These are based on new datasets which link publications and patents, publications and retractions of those publications in the scientific literature, and patents to patent citations.  We have also sought an inter-disciplinary approach using novel computer science approaches that build on advances in machine learning to pursue systematic topic modelling.\n\nTaken together, these data and approaches allow us to explore the ways in which scientific and technical activity, particularly in the context of  scientific research moving to commercialization, has shifted direction.  We have demonstrated their validity through exploring the impact of particular institutional \"shocks' e.g. patent grant, new licensing rules, retractions, organizational change etc. and how these have shaped research direction.\n\nWhile this work has mainly been used in the context of academic research, we have also used this work to inform the decisions of policy makers in the United states as well as around the world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fiona Murray"
