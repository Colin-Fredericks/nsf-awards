Specifically, the plan is to maximize lipid production from selected yeast strains.  This project investigates an innovative process that produces transportation grade biodiesel fuel from a novel microbial bioenergy source. It will demonstrate the feasibility of continuously producing biodiesel from renewable lipids harvested from oleaginous yeasts.\r\nThe yeast strains will be carefully selected through a well designed screening process and culturing conditions will be extensively tested to maximize lipid production. Continuous biodiesel production is possible by utilizing the nonconventional Mcgyan process.\r\n\r\nThe broader/commercial impact of the project will be to improve the science of producing biodiesel from non-food based, cellulosic fermentable sugars which are derived from corn stover, various types of straw, hay, wood chips, saw dust, switch grass, etc.",
