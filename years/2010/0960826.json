 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years the quantification of oceanic energy sources and sinks has generated much interest, due to arguments that mixing driven by energy dissipation exerts a strong control on meridional heat and carbon transport. This project examines the hypothesis that both quadratic bottom boundary layer drag and topographic internal wave drag contribute significantly to the energy budget of the oceanic general circulation, and have a major impact on the dynamics and statistics of mesoscale eddies. The hypothesis will be tested by employing bottom drag coefficients of various strengths in both idealized models and realistic eddying global ocean general circulation models, and by employing wave drag in the realistic models. Horizontal length scales and energy levels of ocean surface eddy kinetic energy in the models will be compared to satellite altimeter observations, and the vertical structure of modeled eddy kinetic energy will be compared to a database of subsurface current meter observations. Based on previous work by the investigators with idealized two-layer quasi-geostrophic models, it is expected that eddies will compare most closely to observations when the bottom drag is moderately strong. It is also hypothesized that bottom boundary layer drag and wave drag both contribute significantly to the energy budget of the general circulation. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Bottom drag sensitivity will be investigated in models which remedy several deficiencies of the two-layer quasi-geostrophic models previously employed by the PIs; the truncation of oceanic stratification to two layers, the missing surface boundary effects, the flat bottom, and the horizontally homogeneous mean flows. The project will utilize a new idealized model which simultaneously resolves multiple interior quasi-geostrophic modes and the surface mode, as well as realistic eddying  general circulation models with high vertical resolution, inhomogeneous forcing, and rough topography.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will build upon their previous experience inserting topographic internal wave drag into ocean tide models, to insert wave drag into ocean general circulation models. The investigators have on hand a wave drag scheme which is appropriate for the low-frequency flows of interest here. The scheme comes from a collaborator in the atmospheric community, which has been employing schemes for wave drag on low-frequency flows in general circulation models for over twenty years. The wave drag calculation also builds upon collaborations with marine geophysicists, which have resulted in the construction of synthetic datasets of small-scale (on order 1-10 km) topographic roughness. Small-scale roughness is insufficiently represented in state-of-the-art global bathymetric datasets, yet, according to theory, is responsible for the generation of internal waves by low-frequency flows over rough topography.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The work proposed here will contribute to the discussion of oceanic energy dissipation, through investigations of two plausible energy sinks and their impacts on the dynamics of the eddying circulation. The work proposed here should also lead to improvements in eddying ocean models, which are sensitive to the damping coefficients they employ. As computer power continues to increase, the ocean models used in climate simulations will soon become eddy-resolving. Thus it is important for climate studies as well as other applications for eddy-resolving ocean models to be improved and tested. The work proposed here will contribute to that goal. The project will support a post-doctoral scientist and a graduate student. The post-doc will work with the realistic models, and a graduate student will work with the idealized models. The project also provides funding for the lead PI to continue working with high school student and undergraduate summer interns, as he has every summer starting in 2006. Finally, the project provides travel funds for the lead investigator, Dr. Arbic, to continue to participate in the pre-departure meetings Dr. Jurgen Theiss will hold every year to prepare students for their involvement in the NSF-funded Zanzibar Channel Project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe developed a flexible and general model for studying ocean eddies and jets with emphasis on the interaction with the surface and bottom.  The model uses the standard simplifications of the dynamics used in many studies of both the atmosphere and ocean, but is configured by simple external program so that it is not tied too tightly to a particular one.  Eddies play an significant role in transport and mixing of heat, salt, and tracers; thus, the way the ocean responds to climate change or other perturbations can only be understood by\nincluding their effects.\n\nOur collaborators are using the model to study the effects of bottom\ntopography on the turbulent eddies (tens to hundreds of kilometers in size,\nweeks to months in duration), and, together, we have shown that these can\ntransfer energies into motions with longer and longer periods.\n\nIn addition, our theoretical studies of the interaction of Agulhas rings with\nthe continental shelf have shown that these energetic motions in the upper\nthousand meters interact with deeper flows, causing significant translation of the ring.  When they run onto the sloping topography, they can generate\nsmaller eddies which can pull shelf water into the deep ocean and push oceanic water onto the shelf or upper slope.  These exchanges, which seem to play a role in the biology of the shelf, can be strongly enhanced by the deeper currents. Previous observational studies by the Postdoctoral Researcher on the project were examined and show similar features to those seen in the models.\n\nThe degree to which subsurface flows could be inferred from satellite\nobservation of sea-surface temperature and sea-surface elevation was examined; since we have very little other global data, this could be a very important use of these data sets.  Our study showed that it will often be successful, but there are limitations.  We hope to understand these limitations and use them to make assessments of the quality of estimates of the currents at different depths.\n\nIn addition to the postdoc training and the participation of the graduate\nstudents, we will use some of the models as part of our  Numerical Fluid\nDynamics: an Interactive Textbook.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn R Flierl"
