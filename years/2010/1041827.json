 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program and co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering, Prof. Murray Loew of George Washington University and Drs. John Delaney and Suzanne Lomax at the National Gallery of Art are undertaking studies aimed at developing in situ methods capable of comprehensive examination of entire artworks, providing images, or media maps, of the pigments used, which in turn provide insight into the artistic working method.  Specifically, the team is constructing an infrared imaging spectrometer capable of standing off from and scanning an entire painting, with high spatial and spectral resolution.  The scans will be analyzed to provide maps of the composition of the binding materials used in the paints. That knowledge will help historians to better understand, and conservators to better restore, important works of art.  It will help art conservators and historians understand how evolutionary changes can influence an artist's painting technique and style.  It will clarify how painters worked to alter the appearance of painted surfaces by experimenting more with the binders than with the pigments alone.  Finally, for the conservator, finding regions of common binders is important for determining treatment approaches. \r\n\r\nThe new instrument is likely to have utility beyond the field of art conservation; there are challenging material-identification problems in both biomedical imaging and homeland defense to which the standoff, high-sensitivity, high-resolution capabilities would be directly applicable.  The work will provide hands-on experience to graduate and postdoctoral students by making clear the value of analytic techniques from chemistry and engineering in art conservation.  Students will join collaborators in Perugia, Italy, for several months, learning their approaches to the issues and conducting some of the benchmarking, calibration, and new-sample-library studies.  That exposure should be invaluable because it will make clear the similarities and differences of various points of view that are present in this interface, and force the students to examine problems from multiple directions.  There also will be benefit from cross-cultural exposure and understanding.  Results will be disseminated broadly, such as by publication in scientific and popular journals and by Web sites and exhibits at both George Washington University and the National Gallery of Art.",

The hyperspectral NIR reflectance imaging revealed that Jackson Pollock used at a minimum oil-based paints and alkyd resin-based paints to make Lavender Mist.  The results also showed that he chose two off-white paints having similar color but different drying properties to make his famous \"drips\" at different stages of the painting.  This can be seen in the image maps of the two binders in Figure 6.  These results show the earlier \"drips\" were done with the faster drying alkyd paint and the final \"drips\" done with the slower drying oil paint.\n\n \n\nThe research project involved supporting and training a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student in the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science.

This NSF grant has resulted in 12 published papers to date, some of which document new findings related to paintings or works of paper in the National Gallery of Art\u00c6s collection.
