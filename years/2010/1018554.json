 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Semantic Web is an emerging technology that stipulates that the content of\r\neach Internet web site provide self-describing metadata encoded using standard\r\ngraph representations, (using the OWL and RDF computer languages). In the\r\ncommon Internet it is optional for web sites to provide topical descriptions of\r\ntheir content. Further, the optional methods that are provided simply allow \r\ndevelopers to list keywords.  The methods do not provide a way to detail the \r\nmeaning of those keywords, i.e. their semantics.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate algorithms that \r\nleverage  the new, semantic aspects of the Internet and make it much easier \r\nto treat multiple web sites and their underlying databases as a single \r\nunified database.  This is distinguished from the existing Internet where \r\na browser enables people to view documents and data, in the form of \r\ndocuments, from different web sites in a single place. While the use \r\nof Internet browsers is now endemic and trivially intuitive, creating \r\ncomputer applications that process data from multiple web sites remains \r\na highly skilled and labor-intensive process.\r\n\r\nThis project comprises two components.  The first component helps create \r\nthe Semantic Web by developing methods that automatically map existing \r\ndatabases to the Semantic Web graph languages. The methods comprise data \r\nmining techniques that discover the semantics already present, but not \r\nexplicitly encoded in relational databases and recast those semantics \r\nin graph-based form. The second component comprises the development of \r\na distributed query execution environment for processing graph structured \r\nqueries, expressed in SPARQL.\r\n\r\nThe PI is an invited expert on the W3C working group on standards for \r\nrelational database to RDF translation (RDB2RDF), the subject of this \r\nresearch.

Beyond that, only on rare occasion may an Internet user collect and integrate data from two web sites without facing the same labor and requiring the same technical skills faced by a circa 1975 computer science researcher.  That is a user must examine the contents and structure of the data, determine which fields are compatible and write computer programs that combine the data between compatible fields\n\nThe Semantic Web is an emerging technology that stipulates that the content of each web site is associated with metadata encoded using a graph-based data structure derived in Artificial Intelligence called a knowledge-graph, also known as an ontology.

SPARQL is the name of the graph-query language.\n\nThis research concerns the development of a foundation in the Semantic Web technology stack for algorithms that automate data integration.
