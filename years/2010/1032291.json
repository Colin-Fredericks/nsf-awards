Designing &amp; Proceeding-Experiment \n\nGeneral considerations: We are in the process of setting up the experiment for demonstration of lasing action at 3.4 nm using our recent computer modeling results, experience with generation lasing action in transition to ground state of Li III ions, and a new approach to create narrow, high aspect ratio plasma channels. We do not yet have a full simulation of lasing at 4.0 nm in He-like CV ions to ground state, preliminary results indicate, when lasing action takes place at 3.4 nm, its ground state is rapidly populated leading to a high rate for 3-body recombination from CVI to CV and population inversion in CV singlet transition to ground state (21P1 &ndash;11S0). Therefore, by creating the condition for lasing action at 3.4 nm in CVI, in a short time sequence lasing  action at 4.0 nm is also feasible.\n\n          For preparation of lasing conditions in CVI ions at 3.4nm and in CV at 4.0 nm, as for soft-X ray region in general, it is important to create a small diameter channel (high aspect ratio of diameter to the length of the channel) in such medium for high intensity pumping beam propagation. \n\nExperiment: To observe the creation of very narrow plasma channel and laser beam propagation in it requires high resolution in space and time interferometer. Fig.1 shows a schematic of the interferometer, and an interferogram for plasma channel with aspect ratio ~ 1000 is shown on Fig.2a; radial electron density profile for area indicated by red is shown in Fig.2b. The plasma channel was created in a supersonic gas jet with a pulsed gas valve and using 2 pre-pulses from Ti/Sapphire laser at wavelength 800nm. Pre-pulses are referred to as pre-pulse1 and 2, where pre-pulse 1 is \"short\" (100 fs pre-pulse) and pre-pulse 2 is \"long\" (200ps). The pre-pulse1 was focused by conical lens (axicon) and the pre-pulse 2 was focused by spherical lens or off-axis parabola mirror through the hole in axicon.

Demonstration Large Aspect Ratio Narrow Plasma Channel \n\nFig.3a shows a schematic of the experimental arrangement with a Ti/Sapphire laser intensity of 1019 Wcm-2 in 50 or 100 fs. Details of setup for creating a plasma channel using two pre-pulses is shown in Fig 3b, as well as the photograph of the spark (plasma channel) obtained by means of focusing 200 ps (\"long\") pre-pulse with the axicon into the N2 gas jet (just for testing the axicon\u00c6s ability to create an elongated plasma column with low intensity laser beam). Fig.3b shows the setup of the interferometric measurement using a 400 nm, 200 fs beam. The interferometer, the optics for two laser pre-pulses and for \"main\" laser pulse (high intensity pumping pulse), which are located in a vacuum chamber are shown in Fig.3b. Incorporated into the system is a grazing incidence soft X-spectrometer; the role of the line intensity measurement is more clearly presented in Fig.3a. \n\nWe will proceed the continuation of the investigation of very high intensity (~ 1018 -1019 W/cm2 in 50 or 100 fs) laser beam propagations (pumping laser beam propagations) in very narrow plasma channels which was recently successfully created (Figs.1, 2). The time evolution of the channels can be seen in Fig.4, which was obtained from high resolution interferograms using Abel inversion. We will measure the propagation efficiency and uniformity of laser beam diameter in ethane pre-plasma using a high resolution interferometer. However, initial experiments on propagation laser beams will be conducted..."
