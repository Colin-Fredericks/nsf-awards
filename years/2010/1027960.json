 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronological datasets that span large periods of time are the focus\r\nof study in several diverse disciplines: climatology, geology,\r\nbiology, history, and anthropology, to name just a few. While these\r\ndatasets share strong links to time scales, they exhibit a great\r\ndiversity in most other aspects.  For example, some datasets are\r\nderived from ice cores, while others arise from archaeological\r\nartifacts, instrumental records, and numerical modeling.  In each\r\ndiscipline, researchers have spent considerable effort to carefully\r\ndeveloping a time scale for each such dataset, and to interpreting the\r\nresulting temporal data, in turn leading to scientific insights.  Such\r\nchronological datasets are growing rapidly in both size and diversity,\r\ndue to not only increasing activity by scientists worldwide but also\r\nimproving technology.  The integration and analysis of this large and\r\ndiverse collection of datasets promises to yield significant\r\nscientific breakthroughs. However, such integration and analysis\r\ncurrently requires a very significant human effort, which severely\r\nrestricts our ability to realize its potential value.  Most of the\r\nanalysis techniques developed in the past do not scale up to the size\r\nand diversity of data we must now analyze. The goal of this project is\r\nto break this barrier to scientific breakthroughs by developing\r\nmethods to solve the problems arising from the diversity and volume of\r\ndata, and to implement, test, and apply these methods in an\r\ninteractive workbench.\r\n\r\nDeveloping the above workbench requires work in multiple\r\ncyberinfrastructure research topics, which by themselves have received\r\nconsiderable research attention.  By their nature, however, these\r\ntopics do not admit many universal solutions and there is currently a\r\nlarge gap separating the generalized results available in the\r\ninformatics literature and their realization in operational systems\r\nthat are ready for use by domain scientists. Our effort will focus on\r\nbridging this gap by adapting and specializing known methods, and\r\ndeveloping new ones when needed, to the characteristics of the\r\nchronological data of interest. This work is not limited to the task\r\nof implementing cyberinfrastructure for the described domains based on\r\nknown methods.  Rather, the work requires research effort to map\r\nconcepts and techniques from computer science to various scientific\r\ndomains, and vice versa, carefully adapting prior results and\r\ndeveloping new ones. This work requires not only expertise on both the\r\ncyberinfrastructure and domain sciences sides of the gap, but also a\r\nclose- knit collaboration that can overcome traditional inter-domain\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nBy enabling effective use of the large and diverse collection of\r\nchronological data, our workbench opens the door to scientific\r\nbreakthroughs in multiple disciplines. As just one specific example,\r\nour workbench will improve our understanding of one of the most\r\nimportant scientific and societal problems: the operation of the\r\nglobal climate system, past, present, and future. In addition to\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the scientists specializing in each\r\ndiscipline, our work will allow researchers from other disciplines,\r\nand people with a more casual interest, to easily access and,\r\nimportantly, process and interpret the same data from which key\r\nresearch results and forecasts emerge. This aspect is particularly\r\nimportant as it demystifies the related research that may otherwise\r\nappear arbitrary or opinionated. Shared examples will be traceable by\r\nothers all the way back to raw data. Our results will be disseminated\r\nnot only through the traditional professional channels but also\r\nthrough outreach to the broader community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project was improving the effectiveness\nof the data-management workflow in order to advance climate-change\nresearch.  All aspects of the data workflow are considered, including\nacquisition, cleaning and verification, processing using built-in,\nuser-defined, and external functions, interactive exploration and\nvisualization, and conventional rendering as charts and other\ngraphics.  The focus is primarily on large, four-dimensional climate\ndatasets that span vastly different periods of time and spatial\ndomains.  While these datasets share the characteristic of a strong\nlink to a time scale, they exhibit a great diversity in many other\naspects. For example, some datasets are derived from physical and\nchemical properties of ice cores, while others arise from numerical\nmodeling of various physical phenomena such as atmospheric and oceanic\ncirculations and glacier dynamics, along with instrumental records.\nThe integration and analysis of this large and diverse collection of\ndatasets promises to yield significant scientific\nbreakthroughs. However, such integration and analysis currently\nrequires a very significant human effort, which severely restricts our\nability to realize its potential value. Most of the analysis\ntechniques developed in the past do not scale up to the size and\ndiversity of data we must now analyze.  The goal of this project was\nto break this barrier to scientific breakthroughs by developing\nmethods to solve the problems arising from the diversity and volume of\ndata, and to implement, test, and apply these methods embodied in an\ninteractive workbench.\n\nWe have designed and implemented an interactive software workbench for\nworking with chronological datasets.  While our focus has been on\nclimate science data sets, our work is also applicable to other data\nsets that have a strong chronological component.  A key feature of our\nwork is that it allows a researcher to interactively explore the data\nat all stages, ranging from the initial data importing to various\ntransformations and computations, to the generation of\npublication-quality graphics.  Our approach is not limited to any\npredefined set of tools (although we provide several).  Rather,\nresearchers can interactively compose existing tools to generate new\nones as they learn more about the data.  While our work has addressed\nmany research topics, it is also noteworthy that our workbench is in\noperational use by several researchers.  The system is very stable and\nwe have received very positive feedback from students and staff\nmembers who use the system for managing their datasets.\n\nAlong the way, we developed many software tools and underlying\nmethods.  Some of these are useful on their own as well.  For example,\nwe developed methods for developing robust Web applications using \nReST (representational state transfer).  These methods are used Web\nsites we have developed, such as 10green.org and icereader.org.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sudarshan S Chawathe"
