 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cariaco Basin, a deep, presently anoxic depression along the northern margin of Venezuela, has proven to be an important repository of paleoclimatic information by virtue of its rapidly accumulating, virtually undisturbed sediments. Focusing on the core with the longest sediment sequence currently available (ODP1002), this research will generate the first continuous decadal resolution marine record of climate and environmental change over the last ~550,000 years. The researchers employ XRF scanning to generate high-resolution geochemical records from Termination II (~140,000 years ago) back to the base of the recovered sequence, providing a cost-efficient and logical extension of high resolution XRF scanning already completed on the younger part of the core. The XRF data will provide insights into the rates and magnitudes of climate change on multiple timescales and over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles when natural climate forcing differed substantially. The data will shed light on tropical climate sensitivity on the timescale of human generations. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research.",

Using support from this award, we generated an approximately 600,000 year record of paleoclimate change with decadal resolution from the western tropical Atlantic&nbsp; Ocean.

Cariaco Basin is unusual in that the deep water therein currently has no oxygen below a water depth of about 300 meters. These anoxic conditions preclude the presence of burrowing organisms that mix the sediment in most sea floor environments; hence sediments that accumulate in the deep basin today are characterized by fine layering that represents the seasonal contrast in settling particles. The climatology responsible for this fine seasonal layering is driven by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and associated variations in trade wind intensity and precipitation. During winter-spring, the ITCZ is in its most southerly position; rainfall is at a minimum and strong easterly winds cause intense upwelling and high productivity along the Venezuelan coast. As the ITCZ migrates north during the summer-fall, the trade winds diminish, upwelling ceases, and the rainy season begins.

Given the high sediment accumulation rates at Site 1002, this interval translates into measurements of elemental concentrations at approximately 15 year spacing. A key elemental record from the scanning-XRF dataset is that of molybdenum (Mo), an element highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, which records a history of ventilation changes in the presently anoxic Cariaco Basin. Over the last glacial-interglacial cycle, Cariaco Mo closely mimics the record of air temperature preserved in Greenland ice cores, with high Mo and anoxic conditions occurring in Cariaco Basin during warm intervals (e.g., interstadials) over Greenland, and negligible Mo and oxygenated conditions prevalent when Greenland is cold (i.e., the Last Glacial Maximum and cold stadials).&nbsp; Greenland ice core temperature records and Cariaco Mo records can be mechanistically linked through changes in the position of the ITCZ during the last glacial period, with southward excursions during cold stadials limiting productivity and organic decomposition/oxygen consumption rates through decreases in riverine inputs as the rain belt associated with the ITCZ shifts southward.</p>\n<p>The longest ice core record from Greenland currently reaches back 123,000 years.
