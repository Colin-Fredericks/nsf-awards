 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) is the US center for peer reviewed community access to ground based optical-infrared astronomical observing facilities.  A primary goal for NOAO is to maintain a suite of world leading capabilities that allow the community to do research at the highest level.  A key aspect to fulfilling this goal is fostering collaborations and research across all of modern astronomy facilities including space based and radio observatories. Modern astronomy has evolved to a panchromatic endeavor that utilizes data obtained from gamma rays to radio waves.  NOAO astronomers involved in research collaborations that take advantage of space telescopes (e.g. Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer) and radio/sub-millimeter telescopes (e.g., VLA and ALMA) enhance the development of NOAO's ground based facilities through complementary observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Research collaborations with these other facilities ensure NOAO astronomers are engaged in the most relevant areas of study in modern astronomy, and so they maximize the contribution from NOAO's own ground based telescopes to this effort through significant ground based observing programs, technology development, and the training of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  This support via interagency transfers from other governmental agencies will provide research support to NOAO scientists.  This support will help NOAO carry out its core mission of developing the best ground based facilities for the entire US community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll of the research supported by this grant either developed or used the techniques of multi-telescope optical interferometry.  This is a method where several telescopes operate in synchronism, achieving the resolving power of a much-larger telescope.  Most of the work was carried out at the CHARA telescope array on Mt.

There, the telescope spacing of 300 meters achieves resolution approximately 100 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope.  The method currently works only for bright stars, and so the applications are for the study of stellar physics as revealed in some of the most familiar targets, such as the stars Betelgeuse and Aldebaran.  As in most of astronomy, multiple techniques are needed for in-depth study, and the programs undertaken in this research also employed the large 10-meter telescope at the Keck Observatory; adaptive optics imaging at the large European telescope, the Very Large Telescope (VLT); optical imaging from the Hubble; and microwave imaging from IRAM, a radio telescope observatory in France.  These programs were directed toward the study of stars in the late stages of evolution, at a time when enormous expansion of the atmosphere and increasingly violent convection and pulsation lead to the ejection of clouds of gas and dust, and the formation of shells and spectacular nebulae.\n\nSome of the grant resources were used to support advances in instrumentation related to high-resolution imaging.
