These instruments will enhance current projects including using fission track analysis in dating geological samples, polymer nanocomposites for photovoltaic application, identification of environmental pollutants in aerosol samples, sorption and photochemistry of environmental contaminants, thermodynamics of nanoscale confined systems, nanomaterials characterization, and art conservation research. Micro-Raman and micro-FTIR are complementary instruments and in combination will broaden the capabilities of our characterization lab to allow for molecular and structural characterization of samples.  Noninvasive capability of the micro-Raman system along with its long working distance will be especially helpful to several of these research projects.  In addition, the acquisition of these instruments will support Union's long-standing commitment to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary teaching and research opportunities through state-of-the-art instrumentation. These instruments will be integrated into individual student faculty projects and classroom laboratory training to enrich the research experience of our undergraduates.  They will also be used during our open house workshops designed to showcase modern characterization instruments for local high school students and their teachers.\r\n\r\nLayman Summary: \r\nThis award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nMaterials characterization is important in many areas of engineering and scientific research.  Researchers in materials characterization use a variety of instruments and laboratory measurement methods to learn about the elemental and molecular make up, and the composition of the samples they are investigating.  This information not only helps with the understanding of how the materials were formed, but also their function and behavior.  The micro-Raman and micro-FTIR instruments are two of the most versatile and most commonly used instruments for micro characterization.  Researchers at Union College will use these tools to further their analysis of geological samples and environmental pollutants, characterize nanomaterials in polymer nanocomposites for photovoltaic applications as well as nanoscale confined systems,  and aid with identification of pigment and binders in art conservation research. The acquisition of these instruments will support Union's long-standing commitment to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary teaching and research opportunities through state-of-the-art instrumentation. These instruments will be integrated into individual student faculty projects and classroom laboratory training to enrich the research experience of our undergraduates.  They will also be used during our open house workshops designed to showcase modern characterization instruments for local high school students and their teachers.",
