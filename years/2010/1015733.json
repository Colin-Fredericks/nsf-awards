My research focused on the interaction between economic development, desertification, and environmental migration in Northwestern China. With the financial support from EAPSI, I did archival research in the provincial and municipal library and records offices in China. In addition, I interviewed local officials and village level cadres to understand the role played the Chinese state in facilitating migration and economic development in the region. During these two months, I analyzed quantitative data on migration pattern in Northwestern China gathered in 2009. I also gathered 891 copies of government policy from the provincial and prefecture records office. The years of these records spanned from 1951 to 2009 with the majority centered on the last decade. The data collected was used to compose three journal articles, all of which are currently under review.</p>\n<p>I also established close relationship with Dr. Shi Yaojiang and the affiliated faculty of the Northwest Socioeconomic Development Research Center (hereafter NSDRC). We agreed to co-author several grant proposals and publications in the coming years. I already submitted a Social Science Research Council (SSRC) short collaborative grant proposal for the center. I will continue to work as a visiting researcher on several projects related to rural development and education. I was extremely blessed to have the opportunity to live in Xi&rsquo;an and to visit field sites in northern Shaanxi. The Summer Institute provided a solid platform for young scholars like me to experience local culture. Even though I had visited NW China many times in the past, I never had the opportunity to actually blend in as the rhythm of daily life in northern Shaanxi and Xi&rsquo;an. The friendship, images, and stories I have gathered have surely become a lifelong memory of mine and have made me dedicated to continue the collaboration with Chinese scholars for the benefits of both the U.S. and China.</p>\n<p>My research finds that the anti-desertification measures in Northern Shaanxi have achieved tremendous success since 2003. However, it is doubtful whether this success can be continued as neo-liberal economic development ideology spread into the government decision processes. The current stance of the Chinese government is a developmental state within neo-liberal framework. The Chinese state intervention to alleviate severe regional disparity is to direct most of its investment spending to the region and encourage FDI by providing tax breaks. Northern Shaanxi clearly follows this pattern. In order to increase local revenue under the current resource-extraction economic system, the local governments provide free land; huge tax breaks to attract petro-chemical industries. Even though the central government aimed to create sustainable economic growth, in Northern Shaanxi, short term economic gains still triumphs over long term sustainable development. Water resource is diverted for industrial usage and regional aquifer is dropping 5-10 meters every year. The government clearly faces a tough dilemma in maintaining job growth while protecting local environment against the approaching desert</p>\n<p>My findings also show that the Western Development Projects should be analyzed as a product of growth fetish within a global, super-capitalist system. To survive in the age of globalization, most nation, region, and city have to continuously grow in its economy and to expect constant profit. This mode of production eventually creates stagnation. The current definition of growth (GDP) does not put the overall wellbeing of the society and the environment into consideration. Its effect on the economic institution hinders fair allocation of resources and creates perverse subsidies that promote the interests of the few and further disguise the environmental and social costs. In rural villages in Northern Shaanxi, there are clearly indications that allocations of resources have become rather tilted towards the interests of local elites. This may prove to be rather dangerous when ecological stress become too stringent for economic growth as The neoliberal solution to the tragedy of the common is to private and securitize everything public domains. Consequently, the widening inequality and the failure of market on a global and regional scale beget the issue of accountability in a neo-liberal system. Since economy is embedded within the natural ecosystem, the most serious challenges facing the economy of Northern Shaanxi may be the exhaustion of natural resources and the capacity for the natural environment to absorb waste and pollution. For the sake of sustainable growth and livelihood of millions, I sincerely hope that the good policy intention of the central and provincial government can gradually change current pattern of growth in the region I visited last summer.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kuoray&nbsp;Mao</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015733/1015733_10016914_1314988729201_DSC_0165--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015733/1015733_10016914_1314988729201_DSC_0165--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interviewing the village secretary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015733/1015733_10016914_1314988729201_DSC_0165--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interviewing the village secretary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">To understand desertification's impact on rural development, I interviewed 40 officials at the village and provincial levels.
