 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the role of thermospheric composition in producing changes in the F-region ionosphere. The mechanism for producing an increase in the O+ density in the F-region (a positive ionospheric storm) or a decrease (a negative ionospheric storm) is not well understood. Much of the information of thermosphere and ionosphere is either confined to vertical profiles at a particular point or column integrated quantities.  For  this study, the investigators will use vertical profiles of the topside ionosphere, simultaneous common-volume determinations of neutral composition, and in situ measurements to test understanding of the processes that determine F region electron density. Simple model calculations will be used to guide the investigation and aid in the interpretation of the results. The ground-based and space-based measurements will be obtained for several carefully selected events. By combining the measurements with the output of computation models, the investigators will the understanding of the mechanisms that create stormtime disturbances in thermospheric composition and ionospheric plasma density in low-middle latitude F region.  The results will be valuable in improving the prediction of the extent and severity of space weather storm impacts to society.  Two female researchers at the Korea Astronomy and Space science Institute (KASI) will participate in the project. KASI manages a newly created national space weather program in Korea. As well as teaching and training young researchers from an under-represented gender and ethnic background, this project promotes essential international collaboration in the investigation of global space weather phenomena.",
