 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have uncovered evidence for a huge store of diversity in marine planktonic protists (protozoa and other eukaryotic microorganisms), matching or exceeding the incredible diversity observed for marine bacteria and archaea.  Understanding relationships between this diversity and ocean ecosystem function is critical as humans navigate the effects of global change such as climate warming and ocean acidification.  The two overall goals of this project are: 1) to discover and compare the diversity of marine protists across ocean gradients, and 2) to generate reference genomes of dominant, uncultured protist taxonomic groups, to serve as a resource for a broad scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project teams Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences' new Single Cell Genomics Center with the Tara Oceans Expedition to explore protistan diversity across important oceanographic gradients.  Tara Oceans is an independently-funded, three-year, circum-global expedition to describe the diversity of marine plankton (oceans.taraexpeditions.org).  The boat, Tara, is a modern 110-ft sailing schooner with wet and dry laboratories and a complete suite of oceanographic instruments.  The expedition is collecting samples for high-throughput pipelines for genome sequencing as well as digital imaging protist morphology.  Single protistan cells will be sorted from samples collected on Tara.  The genomes of sorted single protist cells will be amplified, and these single amplified genomes (SAGs) will be phylogentically screened using DNA bar codes to identify the most abundant and diversed taxa for further genomic characterization.  The French national sequencing center, Genoscope, has agree to sequence hundreds of SAGs (at no cost to this project) to form reference genomes for subsequent community-level molecular analyses (parallel samples will also be sequenced by other Tara Oceans partners using state-of the-art methods such as metagenomics, meta-transcriptomics, and pyrotagging).\r\n  \r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the training of undergraduate and postdoctoral students, and involvement in various established education and outreach programs at Bigelow Laboratory and via the Tara Oceans platform.  In addition the project will create a large library of marine protist SAGs to be archived and shared with other researchers interested in screening them for specific genes or performing whole genome sequencing in the future.",
