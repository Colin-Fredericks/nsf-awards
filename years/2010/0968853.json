During the 11th and early 12th centuries, Chaco Canyon was the center of a complex cultural system that extended across the northern U.S. Southwest. Pueblo Bonito, an 800-room pueblo located in Chaco Canyon, was the major ceremonial and/or political center for the Chacoan regional system during its florescence (A.D. 950-1100). Aztec Ruin, a 450-room structure located 60 km north of Chaco Canyon, was a major center in the 13th century, after the decline of the canyon communities. \r\nCross-cultural research has shown that personal adornment is often a key visual indicator of social group identity; worldwide, jewelry signals social differences of various kinds, including tribal affiliation, gender, age, status, and ideological beliefs. It is expected that ornaments would convey such social information in the past as well. Archaeologists have recovered large numbers of ornaments at both Pueblo Bonito and Aztec Ruin, particularly in association with other unique artifacts in burials and ritual structures. Ornaments are thus an ideal artifact type for investigating change in Chacoan identity in the period of demographic reorganization represented by the shift from Pueblo Bonito to Aztec as regional centers.\r\nMs. Mattson's research will advance knowledge of changes in social identity and ritual practice that accompany periods of demographic upheaval. In addition, her research focuses on an understudied artifact class, ornaments, and includes the study of museum collections that have never been fully analyzed, such as the collection of ornaments from Aztec Ruin. Furthermore, the study involves the application of a relatively new and non-destructive technique within archaeology - the use of a spectrophotometer for color measurements of ornaments. \r\nThis research will also have broader impacts by reinforcing partnerships between several national parks and research institutions. The results of this research will be presented at professional meetings and submitted for publication in national journals, as well as provided to descendant native communities. Upon completion, the research will also be presented to both native jewelers and the general public at various museums. Public lectures for visitors will be given at Aztec Ruins National Monument and at Chaco Canyon Historical Park. Finally, as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, the research will aid in the training of a young scientist.",
