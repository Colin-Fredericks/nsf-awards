 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will utilize both VHF radio and a network of GPS sensor data collected in the southern (Western Australia) hemisphere, in a collaboration between the US, Australia, and India, to improve the  understanding of the storm-time response of the mid-latitude ionosphere.  The observations will be obtained in a longitude sector which has a large offset between geographical and geomagnetic sectors, thought to be important for storm-enhanced plasma density (SED) plume generation, and which is similar to that in the northern hemisphere where the proposers have conducted such investigations in the past.  Specifically, the investigation will focus on the dynamics and evolution of SED structures, including a comparison between SED behavior in the two hemispheres, as well as on associated total electron content (TEC) gradients and generation of scintillation, which will be observed at unprecedented spatiotemporal detail.  This project will provide access to data and research opportunities to students as well as support full-time post-doc involvement.",

The impact on SHI science objectives had to be reviewed to take into account the smaller array size (128 tiles versus 512 tiles).  Several ionospheric goals were compromised by this reduction, although there is still ample opportunity to investigate scintillation over a wide range of frequencies.  The primary SHI science goal that has not been affected by this reduction in size is solar imaging, and a fraction of our work on this grant was involved with this.  Some of the focus of this proposal was switched to solar imaging.  This research project led to the publication of 6 papers and 3 conference proceedings.
