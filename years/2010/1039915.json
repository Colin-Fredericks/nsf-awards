This proposal requests funds to acquire a 3D stereoscopic PIV system with added capabilities to perform shadow-sizing, micro-PIV and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) to support research and education efforts in aerospace, wind engineering, hydraulics, biomedical, environmental and earth sciences, microfluidics and nuclear safety at UPRM. The equipment uses a dual head laser to illuminate a slice of a flow field, and 2 CCD cameras coupled to specialized software for image acquisition with post-processing capabilities to determine 3D velocity fields in fluids. The characteristics of this equipment will further ongoing UPRM research initiatives related to bubble and Janus particles dynamics, nearshore hydrodynamics, pollution dispersion within urban areas, wind interaction with civil structures, behavior of bacteria populations and whole-cell manipulation in microfluidic devices. The versatile PIV system requested in this proposal will strengthen research efforts conducted by the PI, Co-PIs and Senior Personnel, all faculties from underrepresented groups serving in an Institution with a proven track record of producing high-quality bilingual Hispanic professionals.",
