 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Materials World Network award supports a joint research project on chiral/polar liquid crystals showing fast analog electrooptics activity between investigators at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, the University of Stuttgart, Germany, Queen's University, Canada, and the University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom. The research focus is on exotic chiral and polar smectics: the \"V-shaped switching\" smectic C's with the most rapid analog liquid crystal electro-optic effects; the \"de Vries\" materials exhibiting analog behavior via extended molecular tilt correlations in the smectic A phase; the closely related \"orthoconic\" high-tilt antiferroelectrics; and bent-core liquid crystals with a polar smectic A phase that give phase-only electrooptic modulation.\r\n\r\nThe research highlights fundamental studies of structure-property relationships of these novel liquid crystal systems, with ramifications for a variety of areas in soft materials science.  The corresponding materials development will enable a range of novel applications, including holographic data storage and projection, beam steering, and chirality detection. Exchange visits of junior researchers and faculty promotes cultural diversity and the professional development of the participants.  The partner groups will share and adapt appropriate outreach materials, including modules for K-12 science enrichment classes.",
