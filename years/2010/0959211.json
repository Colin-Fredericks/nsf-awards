 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). \r\n\r\nFunds from the NSF MRI-R2 program were awarded to the University of Mississippi Medical Center to support the purchase of an Aviv AU-FDS Fluorescence Detection System.  The new system is used to perform hydrodynamic, thermodynamic and macromolecular interaction studies on a wide range of cutting-edge biophysical projects by six major users. Projects include investigations of the interaction of proteins that regulate microtubule assembly, the aggregation of biologically important peptides, self association properties of kinesin molecular motor domains, self association of Hfq and its binding to sRNA and mRNA targets, aggregation properties of thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), and assembly properties of coilin, including its cellular size distribution.   These projects will also result in the development of advanced Analytical Ultracentrifuge (AUC) methods and software.  The Aviv Fluorescence Detection System brings capabilities to the AUC Facility that greatly enhance the kinds of studies and applications utilized by researchers.  The projects enabled by the new equipment also greatly benefit and impact the students and post doctoral fellows involved in those projects by exposing them to state-of-the-art biophysical techniques. Investigators at UMMC are involved in several programs designed to encourage outreach and diversity in science. These include MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers), MFGN (Mississippi Functional Genomics Network), and the Base Pair Program for high school students in Jackson. In addition, undergraduates participate in summer research at UMMC supported by grant funds or SURE monies. The impact of the new equipment on projects at UMMC and throughout the state is further enhanced by the presence of the Mississippi Biophysical Consortium (MBC). Results of the research projects enabled by the AU-FDS system will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and by student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.",
