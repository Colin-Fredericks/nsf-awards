They will launch a 3-year international research experience for 22 US graduate and undergraduate students in geological and geophysical field research in the Western Desert of Egypt in partnership with Egyptian faculty and students.  The objectives are 1) to involve students in hypothesis-driven, original research on fold and fault structures in the Stable Platform of Egypt, and 2) to provide multi-faceted experiences and training that increase students? capacities to undertake collaborative international research in the future.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit High resolution satellite imagery reveals extraordinary and largely unstudied fold and fault structures in the Western Desert of Egypt over a distance of nearly 600 km between 23.0\u00b0 and 27.7\u00b0 N.  The  reconnaissance work shows that these structures define fields of small domes separated by narrow synclines in the north and elongate domes and basins that are commonly, but not always, aligned along discreet fault zones in the south.  Structures that are a hybrid of both end member types occur between the two regions. \r\n\r\nThe research hypotheses are: 1) dome fields in the north resulted from selective diagenesis of silica in limestone above a polygonal fault network, as suggested for structures previously studied only in the North Sea, and 2)  elongate domes and basins along faults in the south resulted from a complex interplay among slip along reactivated basement faults, fault-related folding, and existing folds initiated by processes that produced the dome fields in the north.  US and Egyptian students and faculty will engage in multidisciplinary research to test these hypotheses and to constrain possible models for origin and evolution of these structures. \r\n\r\nPrior to working in the field, US and Egyptian students and faculty will collaborate to conduct detailed structural mapping using high resolution satellite imagery at visible and infrared wavelengths.  In the field in Egypt, the project will consist of targeted detailed geologic field mapping and sample collection for fabric and chemical analysis, and acquisition of both seismic reflection and refraction data to constrain the 3D geometry of the folds and faults.  The project will use wikis and web video conferencing to enable participants in the U.S. and Egypt to collaborate effectively on satellite image analysis before going into the field and to sustain discussion and analysis of the data well beyond the field experience.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts The northern dome fields are a good candidate for the only on-land example of North Sea-style dome fields, and the extraordinary, unvegetated bedrock exposures in the Western Desert over thousands of square kilometers offer a unique opportunity to add to the literature on the geometry and kinematics of fault-related folds.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop permanent collaborations between US and Egyptian faculty and students by integrating collaborative investigative activities via wikis and web video conferencing into courses taught at the collaborating institutions.  Outstanding examples of structural interpretation using remote sensing that emerge as research on the project progresses will be used to develop these activities, and students from other institutions will benefit as well, because all activities developed will be submitted to the online collections of the NSF-funded project On the Cutting Edge for teaching undergraduate geoscience. The project will also hold a workshop at the annual national meeting of the Geological Society of America in Year 3 of the project focused on best practice in international collaboration and preparing students for international work.  The outcomes of this workshop will be submitted to the Cutting Edge collections.",
