Algorithm design\r\nhas been one of the most fruitful\r\nareas of computer science in the past few decades.\r\nBuilding a bridge between this intellectual discipline\r\nand the ever-growing area of complex systems\r\ncould potentially have a major impact on science as a whole.\r\nAccordingly, the present project will involve\r\ncollaborations with computer scientists, control theorists,\r\nphysicists, and systems biologists.",
