 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to identify the role of nanoparticles secreted by ivy for high strength surface adhesion.  We propose to use insight from this natural system to elucidate the principles that govern the extraordinary affixing capability of the ivy.  The specific aims of this study are centered around characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the ivy nanoparticles and the adhesive matrix.  We will also systematically study the amount of nanoparticles present in the adhesive matrix and their contribution to the overall adhesive properties.  These efforts will not only improve our understanding of the fundamental role of nanoparticles in surface affixing for biological systems, but also inspire bio-mimetic approaches to design high strength adhesives.  Deliverables include quantitative methods to introduce nanoparticles for high strength adhesives, and discovery of fundamental principles of the nature to use nanoparticles for surface affixing.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide an opportunity to design and create bio-inspired adhesives that are capable of generating large adhering forces and are water resistant.  The results will be significant in terms of both understanding fundamental biological affixing mechanisms and developing new bio-inspired nano-materials. Example applications include strong adhesive materials for aerospace, underwater, and biomedical applications.  The results will be disseminated to allow the creation of commercial adhesives that have strong and tunable adhesive strength.  Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will be directly involved in this research and gain experiences on interdisciplinary research experiences on bio-inspired materials and nanotechnology.  This project will also support pre-scholar high school students and minority students in summer research.  The lab conducting this research is a representative lab for diversity program at the university, and will use this project as a demo project for diversity summer program for high school students each year.",
