 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide a long-sought independent check of the Parity Non-Conserving (PNC) measurement in cesium, and especially of the nuclear spin dependence of these measurements. Tests of the Standard Model, the theoretical description of the physical world that unifies two of the four fundamental forces (the weak forces and electromagnetic forces), are critical to our understanding of matter at the atomic and nuclear level. New laboratory measurements of higher precision will allow for an even more precise determination of the weak charge, a fundamental quantity within the Standard Model. Even more important will be measurements of the PNC interaction on the different hyperfine transitions, which will probe higher-order effects such as the nuclear anapole moment. Prior measurements of nucleon-nucleon scattering in atomic systems have produced constraints of coupling constants that are at odds with those from high-energy scattering measurements, and the proposed measurements are designed to help resolve these discrepancies.\r\n \r\nThis work will (1) advance our understanding of interactions beyond those typically encountered in atomic physics, (2) lead to advances in detection of weak interactions, and (3) provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in disciplines of Physics and Engineering. In addition to mastery of topics of current interest, students in the laboratory learn important technical skills such as optics and lasers, electronics, data analysis, and computer programming. The PI is committed to education at the graduate and undergraduate level, promoting diversity in science and engineering, and integrating research and education. Participation by undergraduate students in the PI's laboratory is an active facet of this program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe understand four types of fundamental interactions between the particles that make up our universe: Gravitational, Electromagnetic, Weak and Strong Forces.  We often think of Weak and Strong forces as being restricted to the physics of black holes and the cosmological beginnings of our universe in the Big Bang.  As such, these interactions are usually investigated at high-energy laboratory facilities, which are capable of accelerating particles to high energies, by studying the reactions that follow collisions between energetic particles.  During these collisions, the particles can approach one another at\nextremely small distances, and the Strong and Weak forces can take over,\ndominating the interactions between the particles. \n\nConversely, in atomic systems, we can understand almost all there is to know in terms of electric and magnetic forces between the particles.  Electrons, with their negative charge, are attracted to the nucleus, which consists of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons.  Protons and neutrons are much more massive than the electrons, so we can picture the electrons in orbits around the nucleus.  (We have painted this in a very classical picture, which ignores quantum effects, but this is a useful picture for much of what we understand.)  Magnetic effects are important too, as the electrons are in motion around the nucleus, and as such represent currents. Likewise, the \u00e6spin\u00c6 of the electrons and protons produce additional magnetic effects.  But this picture is not complete, since the Weak Interaction between the electrons and the nucleons, while very small, is none-the-less still present in atomic systems.  The extreme precision made possible by stabilized lasers and well-collimated beams of atom can therefore be brought to bear on measurements of the effect of the Weak Interaction in an atomic system. \n\nThe purpose of the proposed experimental program, therefore, is to develop a precision technique for the measurement of weak optical transitions, with the ultimate goal of a new measurement the weak-force-induced amplitude of a transition between two energy states of atomic cesium.  Related measurements in cesium, performed by Carl Wieman\u00c6s group at JILA in Boulder CO, were successful at measuring the weak charge QW to an accuracy of 0.35%.  (The weak charge is a number that describes the strength of the weak force in this atom.)   While this measurement\nrepresents a remarkable confirmation of Standard Model which describes this\ninteraction, it also revealed a much larger dependence on the nuclear spin than was expected.  These so-called nuclear spin dependent effects have motivated many experimental and theoretical investigations, yet none have been successful at explaining these larger-than-expected effects.  \n\nThis experimental program is a laboratory based program designed to probe this interaction in greater detail. We have chosen to return to cesium for these measurements for two reasons.   First, because of cesium\u00c6s \u00e6simple\u00c6 electronic structure, experimental techniques are available in this atom that are not available in most other atomic systems.  In addition, theoretical\ncalculations of the atomic structure of cesium can be carried out with high\nprecision.  This makes cesium an ideal system to work in. \n\nIn the four-year program that is now concluding, we have successfully applied our laboratory measurement scheme to a determination of the magnetic dipole transition amplitude in cesium.  The precision of our measurement was better than 0.4%.  While stronger than the weak-force-induced amplitude, the magnetic dipole transition is also a very weak transition, and therefore a good candidate for developing the measurement technique.  We have used this measurement to lay the groundwork for the next phase of the easurement, that is, of the weak-force-induced transition moment. Through our measurements, we have identified a number of improvements to our apparatus that will be necessary, a..."
