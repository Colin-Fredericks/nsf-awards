The proposed acquisition will complement gas chromatographic (GC) and GC-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) instrumentation already in use. It will allow analyzing low volatility, non-GC-amenable compounds. The fraction collector will allow the PIs to purify and isolate compounds which can then be subjected to carbon isotope analysis. The instrumentation will be used for reconstructing past terrestrial, lacustrine and marine temperatures from sediment archives using ether-bound archaeal and bacterial lipids; isolating and purifying target \"biomarker\" compounds for stable isotope analysis using natural abundance or labeling to better understand biogeochemical cycling;  and assessing organic material provenance and age in a varied depositional settings using compound-specific radiocarbon dating which will provide new constraints on the carbon cycle and the age of past sediment deposits. The underlying theme to research proposed is using compound-specific biomarkers to constrain and interpret geological data. Using HPLC-MS will provide analytical range to \"new\" groups of biomarkers not able to be measured by GC or other more standard techniques. Purification and isolation procedures will be developed using the fraction collector which will greatly reduce analytical labor. The instrument will be shared by several PIs and across the Department. The instrument will expand capabilities in several disciplines. Current programs are established for attracting undergraduates and disadvantaged students. Two lab-based courses will also directly benefit. The PI will retain overall supervision of the instrument. A mass spectrometry facility  manager will be responsible for day-to-day scheduling. Annual maintenance and consumables costs will covered by per sample fees. Pilot studies and method(s) development will be scheduled on a case-by-case basis. The PI has two years of full-time technician support. \r\n\r\n***",
