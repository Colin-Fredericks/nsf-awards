 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University is awarded a grant which will enable its Ecology Research Center (ERC) to collaborate with a local natural area, the Hueston Woods State Park (HWSP), in the development of a plan for a Watershed Education and Research Center.  Miami ecologists have developed a unique understanding of the ecological processes operating in the watershed that drains into the HWSP reservoir and the impact regional landscape changes have on the aquatic environment.  Formalizing this relationship between the ERC and HWSP will make this watershed research accessible to a broader audience. The project includes: (1) focus groups targeting varied stakeholder communities (including boaters, vacationers, local residents, area farmers, researchers, educators, and others) to gather ideas for the center, (2) an interdisciplinary team of faculty and students from the Miami Design Collaborative (MDC), which includes marketers, psychologists, graphics designers and architects, to develop a plan for the graphical, virtual, and physical layout of the center, and (3) researchers, university administrators, state and federal legislators, private foundations, and granting agencies to create a plan for funding the center.  The vision is for a center that enables visitors to interact with researchers and participate in realtime data collection and hypothesis testing through both virtual and hands-on experiments.\r\n\r\nSoliciting the input of varied stakeholder communities in the planning process, including explicitly seeking input from minority communities in nearby urban areas, is likely to ensure their support for the collaboration. Involving a truly interdisciplinary team in the planning process will result in a dynamic plan that incorporates the interests of that broad audience. In the long-term, generations of students, researchers, teachers, fishermen, boaters, and others will experience first-hand the challenges of interpreting data, the intricacies of designing experiments, and thrill of discovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlanning grant:  Developing a plan for a Watershed Education and Research Center\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project was to formalize the collaboration between Miami University and a local natural area, the Hueston Wood State Park, which is managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.  Much of the aquatic and watershed research at Miami focuses on the Four Mile Creek watershed that drains into Acton Lake located in the state park; manipulative studies conducted in ponds and mesocosms located at Miami\u00c6s Ecology Research Center complements the long term data collected on the Acton Lake reservoir and its watershed.   Our hope was to develop a plan that would make the research conducted on this system accessible to a broader audience. \n\n \n\nOur planning process had three components:  (1) We used surveys and focus groups to gather input from a range of stakeholder communities, including students, boaters, farmers, children, educators, and researchers.  Synthesis of that ideas and impressions held by these various groups helped us understand the current perspectives on the ecology of the area and exactly how a Watershed Education and Research Center might be serve the various constituents.  (2) We held two semester long design events in which interdisciplinary groups synthesized the various perspectives and developed plans. In one event, teams of students in interior design and architecture collaborated with scientists and educators to design the interior and exterior space of a center including the integration of research and public space.  In the second event, teams of students in the sciences, studied content presentation and exhibit design, which helped them design exhibits that would showcase the research that occurs in the Four Mile Creek watershed that drains into the Acton Lake reservoir. (3) We worked (and continue to work) to secure funding to implement the center.  In 2014, we secured sufficient funding to have a traveling exhibit constructed that was a composite of the designs generated by the student teams.  It showcases the local watershed and its linkages with human activities in the region.   We hope that this exhibit will attract attention to the research, help to educate the public on watershed ecology and bolster our efforts to secure funding for the facility.   We continue to meet with legislators, university administrators and Miami\u00c6s development office to hopes of fully funding the construction of the building and on-going infrastructure of our research and education facility. \n\n \n\nMost of the activities in this project contributed to its broad impacts.  Our surveys and focus groups raised awareness of watershed research among the various stakeholder communities.  The design projects helped students outside the sciences gain an appreciation for the space and facility requirements of the scientists and provided the science students with a framework for synthesizing and communicating their findings to others.  The installation of the exhibit will provide the many park visitors with an intimate view into cutting edge research on aquatic ecosystems and help them see the manner in which human manipulation of the landscape as well as their daily activities can impact the water quality across the region.\n\n \n\nThe intellectual climate was improved and research was enhanced by this project.  During both design projects, researchers and graduate students were asked to develop specific research plans and share them with the larger group, which helped the design students understand how the space might be used and how the nature of the research could be communicated to the general public.  During the course of this planning grant, Miami University created a Center for Watershed and Aquatic Science.  This center creates a clearinghouse for the long-term data that researchers have been collecting on several watersheds (including the Four Mile Creek watershed) and provides an umbrella for much of the aquatic work that occurs h..."
