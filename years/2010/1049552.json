 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) is to demonstrate that the laser-induced plasmonics would improve resolution, increase throughput and reduce cost of nanolithography processes and will be superior to the existing grating-based, mask-containing plasmonic systems.  A nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam will be enlarged and impinged on a unique plasmonic lens that consists of nanoporous alumina deposited with silver to generate and transmit plasmons; the constructive interference of the plasmons in the near field can create numerous nanodots on the silicon substrate.  A piezoelectric actuator nanopositioning system will then be utilized to move these nanodots in direct-writing fashion to pattern the resist or etch silicon and fabricate copious two dimensional nanopattern of arbitrary shapes in a high-speed, massively-parallel manner. The proposed research represents an unprecedented application area for basic science as well as practical contributions learned from how laser-induced plasmons interact with materials, and what feature sizes and capabilities can be obtained.  \r\n\r\nThe novel nanolithography system proposed in this study has potential to advance the capabilities of lithography required in high-density integrated circuit device fabrication and for producing nanoscale devices for microelectronics, MEMS, tribology, optics, electro-optics, magnetics, communication, and medicine. The educational efforts include recruitment and participation of woman and/or underrepresented student in the research and assimilation of the research outcomes into a cutting edge laboratory for the undergraduate manufacturing course.",
