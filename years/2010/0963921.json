 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to develop new algorithms and algorithmic\r\ntechniques for solving fundamental optimization problems on planar\r\nnetworks. Many optimization problems in networks are considered\r\ncomputationally difficult; some are even difficult to solve\r\napproximately. However, problems often become easier when the input\r\nnetwork is restricted to be planar, i.e. when it can be drawn on the\r\nplane so that no edges cross each other. Such planar instances of\r\noptimization problems arise in several application areas, including\r\nlogistics and route planning in road maps, image processing and\r\ncomputer vision, and VLSI chip design.\r\n\r\nThe investigators plan to develop algorithms that achieve faster\r\nrunning times or better approximations by exploiting the planarity of\r\nthe input networks. In addition, in order to address the use of\r\noptimization in the discovery of some ground truth, the investigators\r\nwill develop algorithms not just for the traditional worst-case input\r\nmodel but also for models in which there is an unusually good planted\r\nsolution; for a model of this kind, the investigators expect to find\r\nalgorithms that produce even more accurate answers.\r\n\r\nThe research will likely uncover new computational techniques whose\r\napplicability goes beyond planar networks. In the recent past, once a\r\ntechnique has been developed and understood in the context of planar\r\nnetworks, it has been generalized to apply to broader families of\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, new algorithms and techniques resulting from this\r\nresearch might enable people to quickly compute better solutions to\r\nproblems arising in diverse application areas. For example, research\r\nin this area has already had an impact in the computer vision\r\ncommunity. Further research has the potential to be useful, for\r\nexample, in the design of networks, the planning of routes in road\r\nmaps, the processing of images.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlanar instances of optimization problems arise in several application areas including designing delivery routes and selecting facility locations subject to road networks, telecommunication network design and VLSI chip design. An instance of an optimization problem is considered planar if an input to the problem is a graph that can be drawn such that no two edges cross.\n\nThis project has developed several techniques for designing algorithms that are very efficient for planar inputs; that is, these algorithms perform much better than using techniques that work for general graphs.  For example, we show how to find the maximum amount of flow (or information) that can be transmitted through the network and how to find the cheapest way to cut the graph so as to separate any given pair of vertices.  These results and others have been made freely available on the site arXiv.\n\nMaximum flow and minimum cut problems as described above are often used in image segmentation problems.  Early maximum flow results have been implemented and used in the computer vision community.  Likewise we expect the results of this project to have implications in these fields that go beyond the auspices of theoretical computer science.\n\nThe project has provided a training environment for many students including those from underrepresented populations; three female students and two Hispanic students have participated in this project.  The PI (Borradaile) has written several posts on issues facing female researchers in this highly male-dominated field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/12/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glencora Borradaile"
