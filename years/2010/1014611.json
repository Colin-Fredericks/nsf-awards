  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            The goal of this project was to investigate the reaction mechanism of methanol electro-oxidation on a platinum electrode. Methanol has been viewed as a possible alternative fuel source for low-temperature fuel cell applications.  In direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), methanol is oxidized at the anode of a polymer-electrolyte-membrane (PEM) fuel cell to form CO2, protons and electrons.  These fuel cells have many of the same advantages as the traditional hydrogen (H2) PEM, fuel cells, including high power density and theoretical efficiency.  Furthermore, the storage issues limiting wide use of H2 fuel cells can be avoided. However, still, the economic costs of Platinum-based catalysts are prohibitive to commercial viability, necessitating the development of new anode materials.  In order to engineer new catalytic materials for this reaction, it is essential to understand the fundamental challenges in the electro-oxidation reaction mechanism.\n\n            In order to understand the fundamental surface chemistry involved in this reaction, we utilize simulations at the atomic scale to probe the energetics and mechanism for the reaction.  In particular, we utilize quantum-mechanics based molecular dynamics simulations (density functional theory) to track the time-evolution of the system.  As these calculations require thousands of computer hours to complete, we limited the scope of this project to study only the first two, competing, elementary steps within the overall reaction network.  Specifically, we calculate the activation energy and reaction energy for two competing reactions, methanol (CH3OH) oxidation to hydroxylmethyl (CH2OH) and methanol oxidation to methoxy (CH3O).  A schematic for these surface-mediated reactions are shown in Figure 1.  In collaboration with the Morikawa laboratory1,2 at Osaka University in Japan, we applied their effective screening medium (ESM) method to simulate the real reaction environment.  Our model consisted of a slab of platinum atoms that is surrounded by water and we introduce an artificial charge the surface (that can be correlated to the voltage of a real electrode).     \n\n            Preliminary results of our work reveal that the water environment preferentially stabilizes hydoxymethyl over methoxy due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl (OH) group in CH2OH with the surrounding water molecules.  This increases the selectivity of the reaction towards hydroxymethyl over methoxy when comparing the reaction in the aqueous phase versus the vapor phase.  Studying these two elementary steps provides information on the relative difficulties of breaking C-H versus O-H bonds, in alcohols.  We also determine how the electrode potential affects the reaction thermochemistry and kinetics.  Furthermore, by comparing reactions which lead to formation of intermediates with hydrophobic (methoxy) and hydrophilic (hydroxymethyl) groups we can demonstrate the importance of the surrounding water environment.       With the fundamental knowledge obtained through this study, we can better develop targeted materials which will increase reaction rates while minimizing the reliance on precious metals.\n\n \n\nReferences:\n\n \n\n1.
