 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Austin will deploy and support a powerful HPC system that will provide support for a broad range of scientific applications. The system is a 302 TF Dell cluster with 44 TB memory and 1.2 PB disk. This balanced system has 5x the peak performance, and will also deliver 2x the ?real? performance per-core on science applications through much greater memory and interconnect bandwidth than the current system. It also offers 4x the total memory and 10x the disk capacity, with a scalable path to adding more computational and storage capacity.  The system will provide 75 million hours of computer time to the current TeraGrid allocation process and an additional minimum of 15 million hours through the TACC allocation process.  Thus approximately 50% of the system will go to NSF peer reviewed scientific research.",
