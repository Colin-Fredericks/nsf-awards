 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Galen Stucky and colleagues Ram Seshadri and Trevor Hayton from the University of California Santa Barbara will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffraction system, equipped with a modern charge coupled detector (CCD) to serve the chemistry department as well as campus-wide research and education programs. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as characterization of micro-size crystals, weakly diffracting materials, poorly crystalline soft materials, and phase-transitions of single- or poly-crystalline samples, as well as the characterization of texture, orientation, crystallinity, and crystal growth associated with oriented polycrystalline samples.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.",
