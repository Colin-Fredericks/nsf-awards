 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Walter J. Bowyer of Hobart and William Smith Colleges develops strategies for the use of in situ photomicroscopy for the study of surface reaction kinetics.  Applications of indium mediated allylations (IMA) have proven of wide benefit to synthetic chemists, but the mechanism and rates of the formation of organoindium intermediates at indium surfaces have received very little attention. The measurement of rate constants for these heterogeneous reactions is difficult because the active surface area of the metal changes continuously during the reactions. Professor Bowyer and his students recently developed a method for measuring rates of reaction at indium surfaces and this project extends that strategy to determining heterogeneous rate constants and energies of activation of IMA. They combine these kinetic studies with NMR spectroscopy to identify the organoindium intermediates formed in the reaction.  The improved understanding of IMAs facilitate more rational design of synthetic conditions by explaining solvent effects and illuminating the mechanism of the reaction. \r\n\r\nIndium-mediated allylation (IMA) reactions are important in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.  These reactions generally proceed in water with high yield and correct product configuration, offering the benefits of environmentally-friendly chemistry.  The development of creative photomicrosocpy methods to examine the IMA reactions provides a unique means of investigating the speed and extent of reaction.  Hobart and William Smith Colleges emphasize research as both the foundation and the pinnacle of undergraduate education.  This project will further strengthen the Colleges' abilities to prepare students for careers in science. The students working during the summer and the academic year will participate in all phases of this research project: experimental design, performance, data interpretation, and dissemination of results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIndium mediated allylations is a remarkable chemical reaction.  Discovered approximately twenty years ago, the reaction has demonstrated itself to be useful for two very important reasons:  1.  It involves less hazardous, more environmentally friendly solvents than used to be used for similar reactions.  2.  It allows chemists to precisely control reactions, allowing more efficient use of chemicals, leading to both environmental and economic beefits.\n\nHowever, most research on the reaction has been empirical.  That is: chemicals are mixed together to see what kind of reaction results on a trial and error basis.  There have been relatively few research projects to understand why and how the reaction proceeds.\n\nIn order to understand the reaction better, we have measured rates of the chemical reactions under a range of different conditions.  For example, solvent, concentration, structure of reactants, and temperature effects have been studied.  The conditions are carefully designed to elucidate hints as to what the molecules actually look like as they are reacting.  By comparison to similar reactions, we have been able to explain for example why water is a remarkably good solvent for this reaction even though water is bad for similar reactions.  Our results have also helped to explain the remarkable selectivity of the reaction.  These results shoud allow more rational design of experimental conditions for chemists using the reaction, increasing further its popularity and allowing broader environmental benefits.\n\nIn addition to the chemical results, the research funded by the NSF has led to high quality training of young scientists.  The research has incorporated fifteen undergraduate students who have performed experiments, analyzed data, written and presented results, and desined further experiments.  This real world training of young scientists is critical to producing the next generation of America's scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Walter J Bowyer"
