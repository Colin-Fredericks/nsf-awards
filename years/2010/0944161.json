 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fundamental questions in earthquake physics remain unresolved, largely because of\r\ndifficulties in obtaining high-quality, near-source recordings of small earthquakes and\r\nderiving reliable source parameters. The overarching goal of this project is to provide an\r\nimproved understanding of earthquake source processes for a wide magnitude range\r\n(approximately -4 to 4). We are performing detailed seismological investigations of\r\nsource properties that characterize several distinct classes of seismic events (earthquakes,\r\nrockbursts, and blasts) in a 3.6 km deep South African mine. We will also conduct a short\r\nfield campaign to record seismic events at the extremes of the magnitude range and in\r\nclose proximity to fault structures. Full source tensor inversions, second moment\r\nanalysis, and spectral methods will be used to determine comprehensive sets of source\r\nproperties including scalar potencies/moments, focal mechanisms, corner frequencies,\r\nstrain/stress drops, radiated energies, rupture velocities, and source time functions.\r\nSpecial effort will be devoted to detecting isotropic components of faulting. Theoretical\r\ncalculations of expected radiation from different event types will help in the\r\ninterpretation of results.\r\nApplying the above analysis to the small-magnitude, near source seismic data will allow\r\nus to obtain constraints on many aspects of earthquake physics including nucleation\r\nprocesses, the prevalence of isotropic components of seismic radiation, changes in the\r\nphysics of rupture with event magnitude or with proximity to geologic and mining\r\nstructures, and source parameter differences between earthquakes, explosions, and other\r\nseismic sources. The high-resolution results on seismic source properties and scaling\r\nrelations will significantly impact the earthquake physics and rock mechanics\r\ncommunities by helping to resolve long-term controversies on earthquake nucleation and\r\nrupture processes, scaling of laboratory results to natural faults, and earthquake energy\r\nbudgets, among others. In addition, the findings on spatially dependent seismic properties\r\nwill be useful for decision-making concerning when and where to suspend mining\r\nactivities to enhance underground safety",
