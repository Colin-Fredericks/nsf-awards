 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks travel support for US-based student participants to the 12th International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and Security (SSS 2010) to be held in New York City during September 20-22, 2010. With the rapid growth of large-scale networks, the issues of stabilization, safety and security have assumed critical importance in dynamic distributed systems. To foster the growth of research in these areas and to maintain global leadership in the future, it is vital for US-based students to participate in this symposium, meet the leaders in these disciplines, and update themselves on the state-of-the-art. \r\n\r\nWhile stabilization helps distributed systems spontaneously recover from the effects of failures and environmental perturbation like user demands and node mobility, safety and security are of critical significance in a world where physical and cyber security are under constant threat. Atendance to the SSS conference will enable US-based students gain first-hand knowledge in the key areas of stabilization, safety and security in networks and distributed systems, and bring back the knowledge to their home institutions for the enrichment of their research. The broader impact of this proposal is that US-based students will be better prepared to maintain global leadership in a competitive world. The travel support will be used to specifically encourage the participation of women and minority students, so that these underrepresented communities become motivated towards advanced computer science education and research.",
