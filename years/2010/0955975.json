 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor Sarah Trimpin at Wayne State University (WSU) seeks to develop, study, and employ new ionization mechanisms for mass spectrometry (MS).  Co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering enables extension of the work to pair powerful mass spectrometric tools with separations expertise in the group of Dr. Steffen Weidner in the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) - Berlin.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in MS have made it a critically important tool for characterization of a wide range of systems including bio- and synthetic polymers.  Dr. Trimpin's work is expanding the range of problems approachable by enhancing capabilities for characterizing biological and physical processes in systems (e.g. cell membranes) where limited solubility impedes study with existing technology.  The long-term goal is to develop MS methods that operate without the use of solvents, providing for molecular sampling at the cellular level and enabling complete tissue analyses.  Dr. Trimpin's innovative modifications to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) offer the first coupling of hybrid ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) MS with high spatial resolution analysis of high-mass analytes (e.g. proteins).  The approach produces ions with multiple charges, enabling exploitation of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation, a powerful characterization method previously usable only with electrospray ionization (ESI).  Dr. Trimpin's group seeks improved understanding of this new MS ionization method, which in turn should enhance understanding of MALDI and ESI ionization processes.  \r\n\r\nThe work will have broad impact in research areas throughout chemistry and biology.  It can provide information that will help us understand the functioning of cells and the materials properties of plastics.\r\n\r\nImpact of this work is enhanced by Prof. Trimpin's dedication to interdisciplinary teaching and training in promotion of scientific learning for preparation of the ethnic- and gender-diverse student body at WSU for the technology-driven 21st century workplace.  In concert with her research and teaching activities, Prof. Trimpin pursues her strong interest in encouraging women to follow scientific careers by interacting with high school and university female students.  She is also developing a \"Women and Science\" support group at WSU.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdvances in science, health, and safety among other fields are frequently preceded by new analytical methods for characterizing materials on the molecular level.  A case in point is the development of two methods to convert vanishingly small amounts of compounds even from complex mixtures regardless of their volatility to gas-phase ions for analysis by mass spectrometry.  These methods termed electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) extended the applications of mass spectrometry, one of the most powerful analytical instruments, to analysis of biological compounds at concentrations found in living systems.  The inventors received a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Advances in analytical technology are not only about new discoveries and opening new vistas, but about advancing technology through ease of use, speed, reduced cost, etc. \n\nSupport from this NSF CAREER award began from an unexpected discovery in which the expectation of gas-phase ions having only a single proton and thus one positive charge was not observed.  Instead the molecules had multiple protons attached and thus multiple positive charges.  Fundamental studies supported by this award aimed at understanding how multiply charged ions were being produced by laser ablation of a small molecule matrix compound with incorporated peptide led to the finding that the multiply charged ions were not being produced by the expected MALDI process,but by an entirely new ionization process.  It was shown that the multiply charged ions were being produced by laser ablation of the solid matrix:analyte crystals into a heated tube linking atmospheric pressure and the vacuum necessary for the operation of the mass spectrometer and not by a photochemical ionization process.  The laser was not necessary as physically inserting the matrix:analyte into the hot tube produced identical results.  A focused laser, however, can be used to ablate exceedingly small volumes of matrix:analyte into the inlet tube for ionization.  This approach was developed into a means of obtaining molecular images from biological tissues at atmospheric pressure.\n\nFurther studies discovered that the heated inlet tube of certain mass spectrometers are a general ionization chamber producing multiply charged ions from analyte not only incorporated into a solid small molecule matrix, but also in solutions.  This latter method allowed the mass spectrometer to be interfaced with liquid separation techniques such as liquid chromatography without the need for high voltage as is necessary with the ESI method noted above.  For certain compound types, the inlet ionization approach provides enhanced sensitivity, allowing analysis of, for example, steroids with ca. 10X lower amounts than when using the standard ESI method. \n\nFurther research supported by this CAREER award led to a series of discoveries related to ionization in mass spectrometry.  These discoveries provide basic knowledge relative to the ionization processes for which the Nobel Prize was received.  We have proposed that all efficient methods for producing gas-phase ions from nonvolatile compounds require a small molecule matrix and that the matrix can be a liquid or a solid.  Thus, MALDI uses a solid matrix and ESI uses a solvent matrix, but both produce ions from nonvolatile compounds through production of gas-phase charged matrix particles.  This concept suggests that removal of the matrix from the charged matrix particles was key to releasing the analyte ions in the gas-phase for analysis using mass spectrometry.  We demonstrated that a process identical to MALDI, which produces a preponderance of singly charged ions, will produce highly charged ions if evaporation or sublimation of the matrix from the charged matrix:analyte clusters occurs prior to mass analysis in the mass spectrometer.\n\nUsing the fundamental concepts developed over the course of the project led to an astonishing discovery which is..."
