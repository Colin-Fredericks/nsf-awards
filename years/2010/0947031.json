Hines, Jeffrey J. Rack, Eric Stinaff and Paul G. Van Patten of Ohio University will acquire a femtosecond transient absorption and luminescence spectrometer system.  It will be employed to investigate colloidal nanoparticles, RNA structures, photochromic ruthenium and osmium polypyridyl complexes, solid-state nanostructures and organic supramolecular structures.  \r\n\r\nFemtosecond spectrometers use ultrafast laser technology to study molecular phenomena on very short time scales.  Arguably, some of the most fundamental processes in chemistry, biology and materials science (e.g., bond breaking and formation, electron transfer, molecular dynamics and others) occur on ultrafast time scales. This acquisition will exploit the versatility of the instrument in the growing field of ultrafast spectroscopy.  All aspects of the work will be performed by graduate students, select undergraduates, and postdocs as part of their academic experience. This will provide a rich training experience in the growing field of ultrafast methodology with state of the art instrumentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award to the Department of Chemistry at Ohio University provided funds for the purchase of a femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectrometer.  The instrument has been used to enhance research on photochromic transition metal complexes and on semiconductor quantum dots.  These interesting classes of materials have unusual and interesting optical properties that are expected to yield important technological advances in coming years.  This TA spectrometer uses a series of ultrashort laser pulses to excite and then probe a sample in order to measure the changes that occur within the first few picoseconds (ps, 10&ndash;12 seconds) after a photon of light is absorbed.  This information is critical for understanding how energy is redistributed in these materials, and it allows researchers to design and optimize new materials that can harness this energy in new and improved ways.\n\nThe spectrometer has been used over the past two years to study semiconductor nanocrystal that are of interest for solar energy conversion applications.  Research to date has demonstrated that CdTe nanocrystals contained within a thin CdS shell show very fast charge separation, on the picosecond time scale.  The excited electron moves into the shell, leaving behind a positive core.  This fast charge separation suggests that it might be possible to efficiently convert light into electrical energy using these types of materials.  In addition, it has been demonstrated that the presence of the shell material slows down the energy loss of the excited charge carriers.  This observation may eventually enable the design of devices that are able to collect a higher fraction of the absorbed light energy than has been possible in conventional solar cells.  The TA spectrometer has also shed light onto the mechanisms of the light-mediated chemical processes that lead to degradation of CdTe-based materials in air.  It is hoped that this new insight will enable us to circumvent these problems with improved core/shell nanocrystals.\n\nResearch with the TA spectrometer has also yielded a new method for measuring a key optical property of quantum dots and other nanoparticulate materials.  We have demonstrated a straightforward method for measuring the molar absorption coefficient that does not require a priori knowledge of the particle concentration.  This is an important advance because it is often very difficult to determine the concentration of these materials without first knowing the absorption coefficient.  This new method can be used to corroborate previous absorption coefficient measurements that were made using other methods.  It should also permit the measurement of absorption coefficients for a host of materials for which such measurements have not been previously made.\n\nThe Rack Research group has employed this instrumentation to measure how fast bonds may be broken and formed in an excited state.

These materials and measurments are the first on transition metal photochromic compounds and among the first for photochromic compounds in general.\n\nIn addition to enhancing existing optical materials research at Ohio University, the TA spectrometer has also been used as a tool for education.  Several graduate and undergraduate students have participated in associated research projects.  Th..."
