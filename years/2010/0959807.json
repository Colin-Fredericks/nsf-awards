 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\r\n\r\nWith this award from the Major Research and Instrumentation (MRI) program, Tyler A. Sullens and his colleagues Tarek Abdel-Fattah, Kathleen E. Brunke and Lauren Ruane will acquire a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (WDXRF).  It will support the Center for Coastal, Environmental, and Atmospheric Studies (C2EAS) at the university.  The following areas of research will be impacted: a) fate of fissionable material in plant and soil environments, b) elemental characterization of atmospheric aerosols, c) effects of mycorrhizal fungi on metal accumulation in plants, d) development of nanomaterials for the absorption of heavy metals from contaminated soils, e) remediation of contaminated soils and air: detecting and quantifying heavy metals on military sites (focus: lead), f) preservation and restoration of marine artifacts, and, g) uptake efficiency and fate of metals in a created wetland.\r\n\r\nWavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectroscopy enables researchers to obtain elemental analysis of materials through non-destructive means.  X-rays irradiate a sample causing core electrons from atoms to be promoted to higher energy orbitals. The relaxation of these electrons results in emission (fluorescence) of secondary X-rays characteristic of the element.  Since this will be the only regional WDXRF facility in SE Virginia, it will be made available to other research institutions in the area (Hampton University, Elizabeth City State University, Norfolk State University, Old Dominion University, and College of William and Mary, NASA, Jefferson Laboratory National Accelerator Facility).",
