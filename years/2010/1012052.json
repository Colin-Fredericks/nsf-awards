The general goal of the research would be to provide useful experimental data and insight into the question of equilibrium or long-lived mesoscale structures.\r\n\r\nThe results of the proposed research may have a broad impact on the understanding of the role which water and aqueous solutions play in nature, industry, and in biological systems. In particular, the research may be relevant to various possible applications, such as nano-encapsulated oxygen delivery or protein unfolding and protein dehydration in aqueous solutions, and new smart materials resulting from self-assembly in solution.",
