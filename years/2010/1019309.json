This is a unique meeting that combines scientific talks interleaved with vivid discussions, whose goal is to explore paradigm shifts that disrupt the status quo in security research. \r\n\r\nNPSW is thought provoking, research stimulating, and is a highly valuable and unique experience to it participants. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students and junior faculty who would otherwise be unable to attend NPSW.",

The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) is an annual, small  invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and  related disciplines.  NSPW's focus is on work that challenges the  dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security.  In the past,  such challenges have taken the form of critiques of existing practice  as well as novel, sometimes controversial, and often immature approaches  to defending computer systems.  By providing a forum for important  security research that isn't suitable for mainstream security venues,  NSPW aims to foster <em>paradigm shifts</em> in information security. In order to preserve the small, focused nature of the workshop,  participation is limited to authors of accepted papers and conference  organizers. As a computer security venue, NSPW is unique in format and  highly interactive in nature. Each paper is typically the focus of 45 to  60 minutes of presentation and discussion. Authors are encouraged to  present ideas that might be considered risky in some other forum, and  all participants are charged with providing feedback in a constructive  manner. The resulting intensive brainstorming has proven to be an  excellent medium for furthering the development of these ideas. The  final proceedings are published after the workshop, giving authors an  opportunity to incorporate feedback from the workshop.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Angelos&nbsp;D&nbsp;Keromytis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
