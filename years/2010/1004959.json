 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site program at Iowa State University is focused in the area of Microscale Sensing, Actuation and Imaging.  Ten undergraduate students each year will pursue fundamental investigations in the area of design and manufacture of sensors, actuators and smart materials as well as imaging and diagnostic systems.  The key components of this REU program include: 1) a research project chosen by the student and advised by a faculty member and graduate student; 2) a series of technical short courses; 3) professional development activities such as Lunch-n-learns with local researchers, workshops on career opportunities and graduate school, journal clubs and e-portfolio maintenance; 3) social and cultural events designed to complement the research activities; and 4) an REU Research Symposium to provide feedback on student work and to recognize exceptional achievement.  Participants will also receive training in ethical implications of engineering.  At the end of the REU Site program, students will present a paper discussing ethical issues raised by the research projects in which they participated and the research they may plan to pursue in their careers.  Participants will be encouraged to present a technical paper/poster at the Annual International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition (IMECE) or the Materials Research Society (MRS) meeting.\r\n\r\nRecruitment efforts will be targeted to undergraduate students from 4-year colleges, community colleges and incoming freshman.  A talented and diverse group of students will be recruited at a regional and national level, with special efforts that leverage College and University wide programs to attract women and minorities, namely the SPEED (a summer mentoring program for incoming women and underrepresented minority freshman) program, Program for Women in Science and Engineering and the Iowa-AGEP program.",

During this time, the program attracted an average of ~100 applicants each year.  \n\nIntellectual Merit:  \n\nThe students pursued fundamental investigations in the area of design and manufacture of sensors, actuators and smart materials as well as \"state-of-art\" imaging and diagnostic systems. The research performed by students has led to development of computational tools for the design of organic photovoltaic devices and solar cells, ultrasound-based techniques to selectively destroy harmful biofilms, high resolution cantilever-based sensing mechanisms for biochemical species and development of calibration techniques for high speed 3D optical imaging systems.  Several REU students have won awards for research performed as part of the MoSAIc REU.  Student participants over the first three summer cohorts have produced 4 journal publications and more than 15 technical presentations at regional, national and international conferences.  \n\nSummative assessment of program based on pre- and post-program surveys showed that impact of the REU experience on the student participants  was particularly effective in: improving research skills including understanding of the scientific method, understanding the nature of the mechanical engineering research, improving skills needed for future career, ability to think critically, and interest in continuing research. \n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nOver 33 undergraduate students from 1) Four year colleges in the midwest:; 2) National institutions serving minority students and 3) Incoming URM and women freshman thave obtained: a) a research experience in topics that are of national interest; b) an appreciation for cross-disciplinary nature of such research; c) an appreciation of the ethical implications of engineering research and; d) a fostering environment for career development.  The program has focused on engaging a very diverse and talented cohort &ndash; 45% URM students and 33% women students participated in the program.     The impact on workforce development and pursuit of graduate school was also very high &ndash; of the 33 students -, 45% are in graduate or professional school (22% women and 13% URMs), including 5 students who have joined the ISU ME program.  In addition to the higher education, 2 students form our cohort have pursued high school teaching careers in the sciences and have been able to draw upon their REU experiences in encouraging high school students to pursue STEM careers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2013\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pranav Shrotriya"
