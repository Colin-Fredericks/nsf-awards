 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project will increase the enrollment and retention of wounded, injured, and ill veterans in engineering programs.  Multiple interventions are planned and the project is based on social cognitive theory.  The proposed program additionally takes into account needs assessments and prior knowledge from other model programs.  The project is comprehensive; students will be exposed to role models, resources, and support systems, and additionally have a chance to explore myriad engineering career options.  If successful, this project will provide a valuable data point in characterizing engagement and retention of participants who have a strong personal stake in the careers and technologies their education program is preparing them for.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project lies in its great potential for improving the accessibility of engineering and technology degree programs for wounded veterans.  The program will provide numerous opportunities for veterans that would not otherwise be available and additionally provide broad insights on effective means of engaging this group.  If successful, this project may engender systematic changes in the ways universities engage and support wounded veterans as well as the educational preparation they receive for future engineering careers.",
