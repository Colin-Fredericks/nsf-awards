The goal of the short-course is to enhance education in plant breeding for drought tolerance by providing training opportunities to next generation plant breeders, plant physiologists, geneticists, and agronomists, and to increase the diversity of representation within these disciplines.  The workshop involves a combination of hands-on activities, lectures, field exercises, and laboratory, and a two-day symposium on plant breeding, physiology and genomics of drought adaptation.  The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of tuitions and/or travel for graduate students and junior scientists including women and individuals from underrepresented groups from the scientific communities of the US and developing countries.",
