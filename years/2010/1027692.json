Specific tasks of this planning visit include: (i) coordination of basic and applied research activities to understand the phenomena associated with the synthesis of hard and tough multiphase nanocomposite materials in plasma-assisted processes; (ii) collaborative studies of the mechanical properties, long-term tribological performance, corrosion and thermal stability of such materials through the optimization of the composition, microstructure, surface morphology, and smart design of the interfaces; and (iii) discussion of international student research and training perspectives and establishment of multilateral student training programs in the areas above.\r\n\r\nThis award is sponsored jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Ceramics program in the Division of Materials Research.",
