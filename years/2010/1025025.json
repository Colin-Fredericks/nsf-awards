 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit.  Genes are linearly arrayed on chromosomes, and their basic features are preserved between simple and complex organisms.  This research uses a model organism, baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to explore the ways in which genes are regulated.  In both yeast and humans, genes are either turned on (activated) or off (repressed) as a consequence of the activities of specific proteins that bind DNA in a sequence-specific (gene-specific) fashion.  This research will focus on studying the detailed role of a large, evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed Mediator that receives signals from these DNA-binding proteins and integrates them in a way that dictates the expression of individual genes.  Thus, Mediator function is akin to that of a computer: it processes large amounts of input information, in the form of intracellular signals, and creates an output, e.g., the complex pattern of gene expression that defines the unique biology of an organism or cell type.  This research will take advantage of a set of unique genetic mutations within five subunits centered at Mediator's core. These mutations strongly perturb the expression of genes that respond to environmental stresses such as elevated temperature, chemical toxicity, or oxidative stress.  Therefore, characterization of the mutations, and the five subunits they affect, will provide important insight into the biological function of Mediator.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts.  Benefits of this project, beyond the anticipated scientific discoveries, include the training of three full-time Ph.D. graduate students, three high school teachers (who will do summer research internships of six weeks each) and one high school student.  The high school student will engage in an intensive 12-month research experience as a participant in LSU Health Science Center's Science and Medicine Academic Research Training program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  David Gross\u00c6s laboratory uses the model organism, baker\u00c6s yeast, to explore ways in which genes are regulated.  The proper regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance in the maintenance of normal growth and development, as misregulation of genes can lead to such outcomes as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease.  Genes are linearly arrayed on chromosomes and their basic features are preserved between simple and complex organisms.  In both yeast and humans, genes are either turned on (\"activated\") or off (\"repressed\") as a consequence of the activities of proteins that bind to specific sequences in the DNA.  A key step in gene regulation occurs during the transcription of chromosomal DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) by the enzyme, RNA polymerase II (Pol II).  In this project, the Gross lab studied the detailed role of a large, evolutionarily conserved protein complex termed \"Mediator\" that previous work has shown receives signals from these DNA-binding proteins and integrates them in a way that dictates the expression of individual genes.  Mediator function is therefore akin to that of a computer: it processes large amounts of inputted information (in the form of intracellular signals) and creates an output &ndash; the complex pattern of gene expression (Pol II transcription) that defines the unique biology of an organism or cell type. \n\n \n\nEmploying the power of yeast genetics, the Gross lab made several important insights into how Mediator contributes to the cell's transcriptional response to thermal stress.  While it was previously known that all eukaryotic organisms &ndash; from yeast to human &ndash; transcriptionally activate HSP (\"heat shock\" protein / molecular chaperone) genes when exposed to elevated temperatures (or other proteotoxic circumstances), it has remained unclear what role Mediator might play in this vital process.  Findings of this project have led to three cardinal findings, each of which has been published or is submitted.  First, this work has shown that Mediator is critically involved in regulating multiple steps in HSP gene transcription, from recruitment of Pol II to the gene\u00c6s \"promoter,\" escape of Pol II from the promoter, to productive elongation of Pol II within the gene body.  At all three steps, Mediator contributes to the opening of chromatin &ndash; \"chromatin remodeling\" &ndash; by facilitating the disassembly of nucleosomes (bead-like chromosomal subunits).  This in turn facilitates traversal of Pol II along the gene\u00c6s DNA leading to the synthesis of a full-length pre-mRNA transcript.  These latter roles &ndash; facilitating nucleosome disassembly and enhancing productive Pol II elongation &ndash; are novel findings of this study that extend what is known of Mediator\u00c6s in vivo activity.  Second, this project has identified the detailed mechanism by which Mediator is physically \u00e6recruited\u00c6 to the upstream regulatory regions of HSP genes following heat shock:  through physical interaction between Mediator and the DNA-binding and thermal stress-inducible transcription factor, Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1).  Upon sensing thermal stress, Hsf1 rapidly binds DNA sequences located upstream of HSP genes and then uses its so-called \"activation domains\" to bind a Mediator Tail subunit, Med15, that in turn brings the intact complex to the HSP gene promoter region, where Mediator stabilizes assembly of the Pol II initiation complex and triggers transcription.  Third, through use of state-of-the-art in vivo techniques, both molecular and microscopic, the Gross lab discovered that in a physiologically relevant setting,  Mediator\u00c6s Tail module structure differs in an important way from what has recently been reported for the biochemically isolated complex using cryo-electron microscopy, chemical crosslinking and X-ray crystallography. Namely, that Med15, along with two other Tail subunits (Med2 and Med3), are located at the distal end of the Tail and exist both as pa..."
