 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is expected that the tracks and intensities of extratropical cyclones will change over coming decades as climate warms, though the magnitudes and even the signs of these changes remain uncertain. The potentially competing effects of weaker lower-tropospheric temperature contrasts and enhanced specific humidity, further complicated by the uncertain influences of an expected deepening of the troposphere, stronger baroclinicity in the upper troposphere, and an altered global circulation, lead to great uncertainty in projecting changes in extratropical cyclones and stormtracks and, in turn, in projecting how their roles in Earth's climate system will change.\r\n\r\nStudies of the dynamics of individual storms reveal that the release of latent heat, through the diabatic production of low-level potential vorticity, is critical for storm development and for producing damaging winds and flooding rains. These dynamics should be more vigorous in a warmer and moister atmosphere, but the scales of the relevant features fall below the resolved spatial scales of global climate models. This project will test the hypothesis that individual storms and the stormtracks, including their climatically important poleward transports of heat and moisture, are sensitive to model resolution, and that this sensitivity is greater in a warmer climate. \r\n\r\nA program of high-resolution model simulations of the North Atlantic stormtrack under current day and climate-change conditions will be carried out to test this hypothesis using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, in regional and global configurations. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in systematically exploring the two-way interactions between diabatic effects in storms and the global climate system. Changes in extratropical storms and stormtracks have potentially important impacts on society, through their effects on the availability of water and on the risks of damaging winds, flooding rains, and high waves. More reliable projections of these changes and improved understanding of their associated uncertainties are a potential societal benefit from this research and a broader impact of this project. Additional broader impacts include the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate researchers, education and outreach based on project results, and the value, to the broader climate research community, of using the WRF model in climate applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn middle latitude locations, weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems) are of vital importance to society.  Low-pressure systems, or cyclones, bring beneficial precipitation, but can also be accompanied by weather extremes, including severe winds and heavy precipitation.  Cyclones derive some of their energy from heat released when water vapor condenses to form clouds and precipitation.  It is challenging to study this process, because to do so requires very detailed datasets.  Our goals in this study were (1) to use computer model simulations to determine how much detail is required to accurately represent the effects of clouds and precipitation on cyclones over the North Atlantic Ocean, (2) to determine how the effects of clouds and precipitation would change with climate warming, and if these changes are sensitive to resolution, and (3) in how climate change might affect the severity of weather impacts accompanying these weather systems.\n\nIn middle latitudes, the regions through which weather systems most frequently travel are called storm tracks.  In the Northern Hemisphere, the storm tracks are most evident during winter over the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, and we primarily focused our study on the North Atlantic storm track.  Owing to the need to account for year-to-year changes in the storm tracks, we produced simulations for ten winter seasons.  For each winter, we conducted two simulations: one for present climate conditions, and another that used weather patterns on the edges of the model that were similar to present conditions, but with account of warming, consistent with what would result from an increase in greenhouse gases.  We also sought to analyze individual cyclones, especially those producing impactful weather along the US East Coast.  For a set of strong storms that took place in the 1990s and 2000s, we ran computer simulations of the same storms in both present and warmer conditions to see how the simulated storm impact would change with warming.  Finally, to determine the sensitivity of our results to our experimental design, we also ran a set of simulations using global models.  The global simulations allow the model solution to evolve more freely compared to the simulations that were run for a smaller North-Atlantic domain.\n\nFirst using present-day conditions, we found that the amount of detail used in many climate model simulations is inadequate to fully represent the effects of clouds and precipitation on cyclones.  Only when the size of grid pixels in the model was as small as about 20 km on a side did we find adequate representation of these processes.  We also found greater sensitivity of cyclones to warming when more detail was included in the simulations (higher resolution).  This is important because it suggests that climate model simulations will need to be run with considerably more detail than has been done in the past in order to fully capture the effects of warming, especially for the storm track regions.\n\nWith warmer conditions, most of the individual East Coast cyclones we simulated were stronger than their present-day counterparts, but some of them became weaker with warming.  This indicates that the changes in the structure of the cyclones brought about by warming are complex, and many events must be analyzed before we can reach general conclusions about how warming will change the storm intensity.   An important finding was that the future, warmer storms produced significantly heavier precipitation, by 20-30%.  Also, the structure of the cyclones changed with warming; consistent with the precipitation increase, future cyclones obtained a larger fraction of their energy from condensation (clouds and precipitation).  This led to stronger winds near the surface in many of the future storms, which could have important societal impacts.  These results also held for composite simulations of a large number of cyclones from all across the North Atlantic storm track.  When averaged over the entire set of storms for ten winters, the overall change in strength was small, but the change in structure and precipitation was significant, and consistent with the individual storm simulations.\n\nWhen we repeated the storm track analysis with global model runs, we found  that unlike in the regional simulations (where cyclone sensitivity to warming increased with resolution), sensitivity in these runs did not increase. However, for larger, more slowly moving weather systems, we did find an increase in sensitivity to warming at higher resolution in these global experiments.\n\nAnother important outcome of this project was the training of five graduate students, including three M.S. students and two Ph.D. students, all of whom are embarking on successful careers.  The skills gained in data analysis and interpretation, numerical modeling, science communication, and the writing and publication process are already serving them well in their early scientific careers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary M Lackmann"
