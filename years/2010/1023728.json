 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States Congress is among the institutions most closely studied by political scientists, and with good reason.  The House and Sentate provide excellent laboratories in which to examine theories of collective decision making.  Likewise, the relationship between the House and Senate provides a setting in which to consider how strategic political actors coordinate.  However, to the extent that these issues are addressed by scholars of Congress, they are analyzed in isolation.  Scores of studies examine the problems of collective choice idiosyncratic to Congressional chambers.  A smaller set of studies examines how chambers coordinate on policy.  This project combines both approaches and examines how mechanisms of collective choice with chambers and coordination between chambers interact to influence policy outcomes and the chambers' decisions about internal organization.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the use and impact of conference committees, a formal netotiation between members of the House and Senate that produces a compromise bill.  How bills arrive at a conference and the legislators that serve as conferees have significant bearing on the types of policies conferences produce.  Information related to these issues are provided in Congressional publications like the Claendars of the the United States House of Representatives, but an easily analyzed version is currently unavailable publicly.  Data collect from thses volumes as part of this project will provide a perspective on the ways that the House and Senate make intra-chamber choices and inter-chamber compromises.\r\n\r\nThe interaction of issues associated with collective choice and coordination between groups has implications for many other social phenomena that fall outside of the scope of subjects typically addressed by political scientists.  Hiring and tenure decisions are made by groups that benefit from coordinated action but subject to internal requirements to make a socil choice.  Decisons made by share holders and corporate boards in the realm of corporate governance also serve as an analogy to the Congressional provlems of collective choice and coordination between groups with potentially conflicting interests.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch and Education Activities:\n\n Kenneth Kollman was the chair of the committee for Daniel Magleby's dissertation research.  \n\nDaniel Magleby's dissertation research:  The National Science Foundation provided support to create a new dataset drawn from Calendars of the United States House of Representatives and History of Legislation (HC) for the 93rd Congress (starting in 1973) through to the 110th Congress (starting in 2009).  The HC contains the legislative histories of every bill reported out of committee in the House and Senate. In addition, the HC contains information about which legislators are appointed to serve as conferees.  An analyzable version of these data is currently unavailable publicly.\n\n \n\nDevelopment of the dataset occurred in three phases; first, he collected copies of the HC. For many recent congresses, electronic copies of the HC are available and easily collected. These recent HCs were coded in HTML which madding coding simpler.  In the case of Congresses for which HTML versions were unavailable, he sought out PDF versions and hard copies from the Hatcher Graduate Library and the Law Library at the University of Michigan.  From these and other sources, he obtained a complete version of the calendar for every Congress extending back to the 91st Congress (starting in 1969).\n\n \n\nThe second phase of data collection consisted of converting the scanned image of the HC into a computer-readable format using optical character recognition (OCR) software.  OCR programs recognize alpha-numeric characters on printed pages.  The OCR software then converts those characters to a machine-readable text file.  Using digital scanning technology and OCR software, he generated searchable versions of every edition of the HC he collected.\n\n \n\nThe final phase consisted of developing and training a specialized program to code relevant information from the HC.  A customized program must be trained to extract the content of searchable versions of the HC.  \n\nInitially, he limited the period of inquiry to the period from the 93rd Congress, which began in 1973 to the present, but the availability of earlier HCs made it possible to extend the period of inquiry back to the 91st Congress, which began in 1969.  Focusing on this period provides several advantages.  First, limiting the scope of the study allowed him to manage costs.  Likewise, limiting the study to this time period allowed him to compare the new dataset to the information available on THOMAS, the Library of Congress' online collection of bills and bill summaries.  The Library of Congress developed THOMAS for use by the public, but it is notoriously inaccurate, intractable for analytic purposes, and does not include information about conferees; however, it does provide a rough inter-coder check on the information he will extract from the HC.  Finally, this period provides significant variance in terms of party control of Congress and the Presidency.  There have also been changes in the chamber rules and committee structure.\n\n \n\n \n\nFindings:\n\n \n\n \n\nHe relies on data drawn from Calendars of the United States House of Representatives and History of Legislation (HC) to learn which legislators served on the conference committee. In my analysis, he limits the period of inquiry to the period from the 106th Congress which began in 1996 to through the 110th Congress which ended in 2008.  These are the data for which searchable, HTML versions of the HCs for this period are accessible though the Government Printing Office.  While limited, this period includes variance that will provide leverage on the questions addressed in his dissertation.\n\n \n\nHe uses a measure of legislator preferences called DW-NOMINATE developed by Poole and Rosenthal (1997). They compare all votes cast by legislators and give them a score -1 (liberal) to 1 (conservative).  He combines these scores with information about conference committee membership from the HC in order to determine which legislators occup..."
