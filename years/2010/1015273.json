By some accounts, the named species of flatworms underestimate the true diversity by well over an order of magnitude, and higher Linnean categories (e.g., at the Family rank) are regularly being discovered even today. The goal of my dissertation research at Harvard University is, using extensive field sampling, molecular biology, and microscopical investigations, to revise the knowledge one such group of flatworms, Prorhynchidae, at present known from 29 species in terrestrial and freshwater habitats the world over. Their diversity, however, has not been evenly sampled on all continents - the southern continents in particular remain poorly known, with only one endemic described species on each S. America, Africa, and Australia. The purpose of my EAPSI award was to support the first large-scale survey of the diversity of Prorhynchidae in Australia, and to place this diversity in an evolutionary and biogeographic context.</p>\n<p>Because my Australian host, Dr. Nick Murphy, is faculty at La Trobe University, the first two months of my sampling was focused on streams and swamps, dry sclerophyll forests, and temperate rainforests in the vicinity of Melbourne. Particularly noteworthy localities were Kinglake and Wilson's Promontory National Parks, Bunyip State Park, and the Great Otway Ranges in Victoria. However, the geographic scope of sampling was greatly expanded by a series of visits to colleagues in Adelaide, South Australia, Christchurch, New Zealand, and Hobart, Tasmania; these visits also served to demonstrate improved sampling methods in difficult-to-access habitats, such as in subterranean waters. Perhaps the most difficult and remarkable sampling trip was a 10-day excursion into desert South Australia, to sample flatworms for the first time in the geologically unique \"mound springs\", with the generous permission of pastoral landowners and traditional aboriginal owners. Drs. Andy Austin (Uni. Adelaide), Remko Leijs (SA Museum), Karen Johnson (Uni Tasmania),&nbsp; Duncan Gray (Uni. Canterbury), and Mr. Rick Moore are all thanked for extending lab resources and for assistance in the field.</p>\n<p>Three months of effort were sufficient to uncover nearly 30 undescribed prorhynchid species from diverse habitats in Australia and New Zealand, <em>effectively doubling the diversity of Prorhynchidae</em>, and making Australasia species-for-species the best known region globally for prorhynchid diversity. In addition, samples yielded specimens in very many other poorly-known groups, such as cavernicolan triclad flatworms, typhloplanoid rhabdocoels, and the phylum Nemertea, comparatively rare in freshwaters. All specimens were documented thoroughly in the live condition via photomicrography and illustration, before preservation for histological study and genetic sequencing. Formal descriptions of these specimens as new species, using data from both the microscopical preparations and DNA sequences, are currently pending. These Australasian specimens will also likely represent a major portion of the leaves on the evolutionary tree of Prorhynchidae to be published at the end of my ongoing thesis research.</p>\n<p>Although the final outcomes of this survey must await peer-reviewed publication, several preliminary conclusions may presently be drawn. Firstly, it is clear that our present conception of the habitats in which prorhynchids flourish is strongly biased by a historical tradition of research in Western European countries. In particular, Prorhynchidae appear to be extremely successful in rainforest habitats, at least in Australia, where they have so far been all but totally unsampled. By contrast, no prorhynchids were represented in the waters of the desert mound springs (although this preliminary survey yielded specimens from several other flatworm groups). Secondly, though recognizing that knowledge of the full geographic ranges of the new species must await further study, several preliminary biogeographic conclusions may be drawn. Particularly, early analyses point to the existence of at least one evolutionary group of microscopic prorhynchids endemic to Australia alone (particularly, rainforest habitats); there are also indications of a group of largely subterranean, giant-bodied prorhynchids from New Zealand and Tasmania, which may descend from ancestors already widely distributed on the former supercontinent Gondwana. However, the most striking outcome of this survey may in a sense be the biodiversity which remains yet unsampled. Clearly, one scientist's efforts over the course of only three months, and restricted to three states, is insufficient to completely sample the diversity of Prorhynchidae in Australia - yet even this effort yielded nearly 30 undescribed species! It is reasonable to expect that even Australia, a developed country with a strong tradition of biodiversity research, still harbors a large magnitude of undiscovered species for groups such as Prorhynchidae. What then, is the implication for even more poorly-known areas of the globe, which have little infrastructure for research? Clearly, further surveys, particularly in (increasingly threatened) rainforest habitats, are urgently needed to understand the true diversity and evolutionary history of this remarkable group of organisms.</p>\n<p>-<strong>Christopher Laumer</strong></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/24/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;E&nbsp;Laumer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015273/1015273_10016569_1314740004008_dscn0404--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015273/1015273_10016569_1314740004008_dscn0404--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eucalyptus regnans in a Victorian temperate rainforest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/1015273/1015273_10016569_1314740004008_dscn0404--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eucalyptus regnans in a Victorian temperate rainforest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eucalyptus regnans, perhaps the tallest tree in the world, grows natively only in wet, temperate forests of SE Australia.
