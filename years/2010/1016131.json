  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe general goal of this research is to understand a class of materials called mixed ionic-electronic conductors.  These solid materials are unique in their ability to conduct both ions and electrons, hence the classification of mixed conductor.  The specific material of interest is Silver Sulfide (Ag2S), commonly known as Silver Tarnish.  Although this material may be the bane of many jewelers, it has remarkable properties that can make it suitable for use as a switch, or memory. \n\nBecause Silver Sulfide can conduct silver ions, it can act as an electrochemical switch when certain voltages are applied to specific types of metal contacts.  As an example illustrated in the figures below, a Silver Sulfide film may be contacted by an inert metal such as platinum, and a reactive metal such as silver, forming a three layer device.  Initially, the Silver Sulfide is in a highly resistive state.  However, the Silver Sulfide may be transitioned into a highly conductive state.  When a positive bias is applied to the silver contact relative to the platinum contact, 1) silver ions will oxidize from the contact and form positive silver ions that will 2) migrate through Silver Sulfide toward the platinum contact.  The silver ions will 3) reduce to silver metal at the platinum contact, incrementally forming a conductive silver filament that eventually bridges the silver and platinum contact.  When the silver filament bridges both contacts, the device is in a highly conductive or ON state.  The device can be transitioned back into a highly resistive state by applying a bias of opposite polarity, a negative bias at the silver contact relative to the platinum contact.  Under this operation, the silver filament will A) oxidize into silver ions, and B) migrate back toward and C) deposit on the silver contact.  In this way, the device can be switched back and forth between highly conductive and highly resistive states. \n\nAn ideal switch would have clear ON and OFF states, (i.e. no electronic conductivity in the OFF state, and very high conductivity in the ON state), and be able to switch quickly.  Tuning the ionic and electronic conducting properties of these films may enable control over properties of the switch.  For example, increasing the ionic conductivity may enable faster switching, and decreasing the electronic conductivity could reduce the electronic conductivity in the OFF state.\n\nIn this study, films of Silver Sulfide are formed by heating nanoparticles of Silver Sulfide.  Depending on the heating conditions, thin films with different grain sizes of Silver Sulfide are formed.  Experimental measurements showed that the ionic and electronic conductivity of the Silver Sulfide thin films could be controlled as a function of grain size and heating.\n\nThe purpose of the research conducted at NTU is to develop a theoretical understanding of these experimental results.  Modeling results from COMSOL showed that the as grain size of the particles decreased, interfacial effects resulted in higher electronic conductivity, compared with larger grain sizes.  This was consistent with the experimental data that showed electronic conducting films at small grain sizes, and ionic conducting films with larger grain sizes.  An additional effect of the encapsulant of the nanoparticles is being investigated.\n\nThe results of this work may provide a framework for studying other mixed ionic electronic conductors such as other Silver Telluride and Silver Selenide for switch applications.\n\nThe generosity and resources provided by the Host Advisor at NTU, Professor Chan Siew-Hwa, Home Advisor at UC Berkeley, Professor Vivek Subramanian, and the NSF EAPSI program made this research possible.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shong Yin"
