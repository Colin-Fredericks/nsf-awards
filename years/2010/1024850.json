 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate past climates in the circum-Pacific region.  Specifically, the project will evaluate hypothesized linkages between Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere climatic processes during the last glaciation, 100,000 to 10,000 years ago.  Scientists have long recognized that Northern Hemisphere cooling and warming influence Southern Hemisphere climate, particularly in determining the broad patterns of glacial-interglacial cycles.  Conversely, Southern Hemisphere climatic processes have only rarely been invoked as influences on Northern Hemisphere climate.  Initial evidence shows apparent correlations in the timing of mountain glacier fluctuations in New Zealand, southern South America, the northwestern United States, and possibly other regions of the circum-Pacific.  Those fluctuations occur during minima in Southern Hemisphere solar energy cycles, suggesting that Southern Hemisphere cooling is transmitted through both hemispheres in the Pacific region.  This project will investigate glacial sediments and fossil insects in New Zealand and the northwestern US to test that hypothesis.  The processes of mountain glaciation in both areas will be determined through detailed evaluation of glacial sediment sequences.  The timing of the glacier fluctuations will be determined through optically-stimulated luminescence(OSL) dating of sand grains in the sediments, as well as crystal damage from ambient geological radiation, and on radiocarbon dating of organic sediments.  Because glaciers fluctuate in response to both temperature and precipitation changes, the project will utilize fossil chironomids (non-biting midges)preserved in adjacent lake and pond sediments to determine water and air temperatures at specific times during the last glaciation.\r\n\r\nA thorough evaluation of the timing of climatic changes around the Pacific Ocean margin will provide important insight into how the Earth's climate system functions.  Climatic linkages are important to the modern climatic system,as shown by the global influence of El Nino and related processes. This project will therefore also help improve knowledge of how modern climate fluctuates.  The project will enhance professional development of students and early career scientists, foster international collaboration, and strengthen educational offerings at three institutions. The project will provide ample opportunities for student research at both undergraduate and graduate levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMountain glaciers respond quickly to climate fluctuations, and their past periods of growth and shrinkage inform us of the climatic conditions at those times.  We have determined the timing of mountain glacier changes in the recent geologic past (since 100,000 years ago) in two areas of the middle latitudes with humid climates, western Washington and New Zealand\u00c6s South Island.\n\n \n\nIn order to determine the history of the mountain glaciers, we studied the sediments they deposited in major valleys of the Olympic Mountains and the Southern Alps.  We observed the character and arrangements of silt, sand, and gravel deposits to determine the behavior of the glaciers and their water drainage systems, and evaluated the landscapes of the valleys to determine the size of the glaciers.  We used a relatively new method, sediment luminescence, to determine when particular sand deposits were laid down and buried.  Using this information, we determined the timing of those past glacier changes and related them to changes in the patterns of westerly winds and atmospheric cooling.  We found that glaciers in these areas expanded and retreated much earlier than did many mountain glacier systems in North America and Europe, and we identified changes in westerly wind patterns as an important factor in the glacier behavior.  Our findings will be used to understand why climate varied through the last 100,000 years and thereby help understand how the climate system works.\n\n \n\nThe project provided in-depth scientific and technical training for 5 students and three university faculty members.  Four of the students and one of the faculty members are women, and all of the students are now employed as geoscientists in industrial, governmental, and academic settings.  The project participants, including the students, were able to work overseas and collaborate with scientists in New Zealand and Australia, as well as with their counterparts at universities in the United States.  The new scientific findings of the project have been used to improve course instruction at the three universities, and have impacted dozens of students being trained in science and other fields.  Finally the findings have been incorporated into public science presentations and articles, informing the public of variations of past climate and how the climate system operates.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn D Thackray"
