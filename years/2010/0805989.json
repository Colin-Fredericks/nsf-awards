The goal of these projects is to\r\nexpress physical quantities in terms of arithmetic geometry over\r\np-adic numbers and to use these expressions to prove integrality\r\ntheorems.  Another set of investigations deals with\r\nsupersymmetric deformations of quantum field theories.  This is\r\njoint work with M. Movshev and applies the theory of L-infinity\r\nand A-infinity algebras.  Another project is devoted to the\r\nanalysis of the relation between string theory and quantum field\r\ntheory. The principal investigator has argued that quantum field\r\ntheory can be formulated such that time and space do not appear\r\nas primary notions, and is planning to show that string theory\r\ncan be regarded as a quantum field theory in this sense.\r\n\r\nThese research projects are based on the application of methods\r\nof modern mathematics to physics, particularly making use of\r\narithmetic geometry and homological algebra to improve our\r\nunderstanding of quantum field theory and string theory.\r\nSophisticated mathematics originally developed for other purposes\r\nsuch as the study of Diophantine equations in number theory seems\r\nto bear directly on challenging issues in theoretical physics.\r\n",
