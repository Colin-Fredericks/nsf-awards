The workshop will bring together 15 dissertation-stage doctoral students in the field of CSCW for one day of talks and interaction with six mentors who are distinguished CSCW researchers from Universities and top research laboratories. The focus of the CSCW DC is the students? doctoral dissertation research which represent state-of-the-art research in the field of computer-supported cooperative work. The DC allows the students to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. The students and faculty will be a diverse group on several dimensions (gender, race, nationality, scientific discipline), broadening the students? experiences at a critical stage in their professional development.",
