Enabling the investigation of determining how recent advances in sensing, networking, and computing research can benefit agriculture practice (specifically, high-tunnel greenhouses), the work provides a window to expose practical problems that arise from setting up and operating the smart greenhouse system. Aiming to produce affordable and reliable CPS that can support automation in high-tunnel greenhouses the project looks into:\r\n-\tWater management in high-tunnel greenhouses,\r\n-\tRandom scheduling for sensor networks,\r\n-\tLocalization of sensor nodes that leverages radio tomographic images,\r\n-\tFault-tolerant agriculture CPS, and\r\n-\tHigh programmer productivity environments for heterogeneous CPS.\r\nThe project might lead to broader acceptance and use of the systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe research instrument should foster collaboration among computer science and agricultural faculty, providing a field laboratory where students can conduct meaningful research-oriented experiments and thus increase the involvement of minority and women students in science, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. The research should contribute to affordable and robust systems and application in precision agriculture, and lead to sustainable agricultural practices and higher crop yields, indeed, a strong benefit for society at large. Moreover, undergraduate and graduate research and instruction and training should see improvement with the incorporation of more sophisticated real-world motivating examples and experiments.",
