 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program supports Professor Robert M. Waymouth at Stanford University and Dr. James L Hedrick at IBM for a research project that will explore new patterns of reactivity of organic catalysts for controlled polymerization reactions. Specific objectives are to: (1) develop novel bifunctional strategies for organocatalytic polymerization reactions; (2) develop a detailed kinetic and mechanistic understanding of zwitterionic polymerizations for the synthesis of macrocyclic polymers; and (3) develop new organocatalytic methods for the synthesis of biodegradable and biocompatible polyphosphates. The zwitterionic polymerization mediated by N-heterocyclic carbenes is a new conceptual advance for the enchainment of monomers to high molecular weight cyclic polymers. Mechanistic and kinetic insights on the details of these reactions will provide a conceptual and quantitative picture of the scope, power and limitations of this new synthetic method. Organocatalytic polymerization strategies provide an environmentally friendly approach for the synthesis and recycling of major commodity polymers. Mechanistic insights on new mechanisms of enchainment will create new opportunities for the generation of novel polymer architectures, including new families of polyphosphates for biomedical applications.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Drs. Waymouth and Hedrick will perform research that will provide new catalytic strategies for the design of biodegradable polymers derived from renewable resources. New synthetic methods developed as part of this program will enable new strategies for the synthesis of well-defined polymer architectures. These developments will enable studies of the role of polymer structure on properties and  function, issues that are fundamental to our understanding of chemistry and to the application of macromolecules in modern technologies. Broader impacts include involving students in an exceptional training environment involving a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative effort between an academic institution and an industrial laboratory. The PIs have taken an active role in recruiting and mentoring underrepresented minorities and disabled students. In addition, IBM is committing significant resources to this effort, including laboratory and office space for a postdoctoral coworker and visiting Stanford students, materials and supplies, extensive access to IBM facilities and infrastructure as well as 25% of Dr. Hedrick's time.",

Our fundamental studies led to a new strategy for making large cyclic macromolecules (molecular loops).  Most plastics are derived from long chain-like molecules; if the ends of these long chains are connected in a cycle, the properties of the resulting materials differ from the linear analogs in ways that remain poorly understood.  Our catalytic strategy for generating these large cycles is enabling us to address the basic question of how the connectivity (linear vs. cyclic) of large molecules influences their behavior.\n\n            The unique reactivity of these organic catalysts allowed us to generate shorter chains containing chemical functionalities that mimic those found in naturally-occurring proteins.
