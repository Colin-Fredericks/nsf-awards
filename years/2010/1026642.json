 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop bendable Ceramic Paper Membranes for various applications including oil and gas, automotive, food and beverage, biotech, and pharmaceutical.  Bendable ceramic paper membranes possess ultrahigh packing density, excellent chemical and thermal stability, high filtration performance and low manufacture cost.  Based on the success of the Phase I program, the Phase II project will fully develop and standardize Bendable Ceramic Membrane Technology and set up a foundation necessary for the large scale commercial manufacture of this innovative technology\r\n\r\nBendable ceramic paper membrane technology will alter the landscape of membrane manufacturing by improving its economics, product performance, and breadth of applications. This will have a sweeping impact on dozens of industries that either currently rely on membrane technology or represent potential new markets for membranes as a result of this breakthrough.  These industries include chemicals, gas and oil, automobiles, food, beverage, biotech, and pharmaceutics, and represent a global membrane separation market of potentially $15.1 billion by 2012.  Further, given its potential applications in waste treatment, environmental protection, and green energy conversion and storage, this new membrane technology will have additional far-reaching societal benefits.",
