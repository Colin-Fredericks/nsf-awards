 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will update and analyze surface synoptic observations from weather stations on land and ships in the ocean to determine the global distribution of the various cloud types and their seasonal and diurnal variations, as well as a study of how clouds have changed in the past half-century. Fourteen years of land data (1997-2010) will be added to the cloud-observations database and to the cloud-averages database created by the previous grants funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The analyses of interannual variations and trends will also be updated to include these 14 years. The resulting database will cover 55 years for the ocean and 40 years for land.\r\n\r\nThe updated database will enable a number of climatic investigations. Clouds generally cause cooling in daytime but warming at night, so the radiative effects of clouds depend on their diurnal cycles. The databases will be analyzed for diurnal cycles of individual cloud types worldwide. Trends in the cloud types will be analyzed for day and night separately and compared, in order to investigate possible changes in the cloud radiative forcing over the past several decades. In past decades the total cloud cover has shown a slight increase over the ocean and slight decrease over the continents. Whether these trends continue into the more recent years will be investigated, as well as whether interannual variations also show the same anticorrelation. There have been modeling and remote-sensing studies of the relation of cloud height to surface temperature, which will be investigated on interannual time scales using the reports of base height in the surface-based cloud observations. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work are in the area of climate research. The databases resulting from this project will be distributed widely for use by the scientific community, with potential applications in climate modeling, cloud process studies, evaluation of satellite observations of clouds, and in detection and attribution of climate change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      Clouds are important in the Earth's climate system because of their effects on solar radiation, terrestrial radiation, and precipitation.  These effects depend on cloud height, thickness, horizontal extent, horizontal variability, water content, phase (liquid or ice), and the sizes of droplets and crystals.  It is therefore useful to distinguish different types of clouds.  The visual appearance of clouds is often taken to indicate characteristic atmospheric dynamical processes, so the traditional classification by weather observers of cloud types based on their appearance continues to be a useful classification in studies of cloud processes.\n\n      The climatic effects of clouds further depend on the geographical location of the clouds, the albedo and temperature of the underlying surface, and the season of the year and time of day.  The effect of clouds on the earth's radiation budget, the \"cloud radiative forcing\", is generally negative in the daytime but positive at night, so an accurate determination of the diurnal cycle of each cloud type is important.\n\n      A study of the global distribution of the various cloud types and their seasonal and diurnal variations, as well as a study of how clouds have changed in the past half-century, was carried out.  Databases were created that were designed to be useful in clarifying the interactions of clouds with other components of the climate system and to infer changes in cloud radiative forcing.  For global-change studies involving clouds, a long period of record with global coverage and with consistent observing procedures is necessary.  Routine surface weather observations of clouds from land stations and from ships in the ocean meet these requirements.\n\n      Under a prior grant the ocean cloud databases were updated to 2008.  Under this grant the land cloud analyses were updated in parallel to what had been done for the ocean analyses.  Our cloud databases now cover 55 years for the ocean (1954-2008) and 39 years for land (1971-2009).\n\nOcean cloud changes \n\n      Among the cloud types, the most widespread and consistent relationship is found for the extensive marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds (MSC) over the eastern parts of the subtropical oceans. Strong negative correlation is found between MSC and sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern north Pacific, eastern south Pacific, eastern south Atlantic, eastern north Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean west of Australia. By contrast, a positive correlation between cloud cover and SST is seen in the central Pacific. High clouds show a consistent low-magnitude positive correlation with SST over the equatorial ocean.\n\n      In regions of persistent MSC, time series show decreasing MSC amount.  This decrease, combined with observed increases in SST and the negative correlation between marine stratus and SST suggests a positive cloud feedback to the warming sea surface. The observed decrease of MSC has been partly but not completely offset by increasing cumuliform clouds in these regions; a similar decrease in stratiform and increase in cumuliform clouds had previously been seen over land.\n\n      Interannual variations of cloud cover in the tropics show strong correlation with an index of El Nino and the Southern Oscillation.\n\nLand cloud changes\n\n      Global-average trends of cloud cover suggest a small decline in total cloud cover, on the order of 0.4 % per decade, mainly due to trends in middle latitudes at high and middle levels. An analysis of zonal cloud cover changes suggests poleward shifts of the jet streams in both hemispheres; the observed displacement agrees with other studies. \n\n      Changes seen in cloud types associated with the Indian monsoon are consistent with previous work suggesting that increased pollution (black carbon) may be affecting monsoonal precipitation, causing drought in North India. A similar analysis over northern China does not show an obvious aerosol connection. \n\nDiurnal cycles of low cl..."
