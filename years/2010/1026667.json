 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory reaction chamber experiments will be undertaken for the comprehensive characterization of the conditions for fast uptake of glyoxal on ammonium sulfate aerosol, identification of the reaction products formed within the aerosol under conditions of fast uptake, and determination of whether gas-phase or aerosol phase reaction products primarily contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields. Whereas analogous laboratory studies on bulk samples have been previously undertaken, the work proposed here is exploratory in that it is one of the first to investigate with molecular detail and mechanistically the pathways in which a small high-volatility compound is taken up by aerosol and processed to form high-molecular weight, low-volatility compounds. The results will not only provide information critical to modeling SOA formation from glyoxal, specifically, but also have the potential to lend fresh perspective on general questions about SOA formation and aging.\r\n\r\nThis exploratory research is related to factors affecting climate change (aerosol radiative forcing) and human health (respirable particles), which affect society at large. The research will engage students in teaching and learning as part of a multi-disciplinary group gathering the type of expansive dataset necessary to capture the complexity of atmospheric chemical processes. The students will have the opportunity to analyze their own data in the context of broader datasets and to draw conclusions concerning both the scientific and societal implications of their work.",
