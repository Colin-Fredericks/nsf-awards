 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daytona State College is adapting and implementing a series of best practices for recruitment and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) associate of arts (AA) programs. The goal is to expand the talent and diversity of students entering and completing STEM degree programs. The STEM Community Scholars Program is motivating and recruiting graduating high school students and first-year college students to pursue STEM degrees by providing services that support participants' academic success, including setting high expectations, continual and intrusive academic advising, strong social ties, financial assistance, and transfer assistance. \r\n\r\nThe program strategies are helping students learn to be successful in STEM fields. The focus of the project is increasing enrollment in STEM programs; impacting graduation rates both in the program and across the STEM disciplines; assisting students in applying to STEM baccalaureate programs; and comprehensively evaluating the selected strategies.\r\n\r\nThe program is serving nearly 300 students over five years. Underrepresented groups in STEM fields are being recruited to broaden the diversity in STEM fields. The project team consists of educators who are committed to ensuring the success of the students and institutionalizing the strategies and activities that are most successful.",
