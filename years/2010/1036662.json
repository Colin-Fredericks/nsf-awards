 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between (1) access to and use of STEM-related social, cultural, and economic \"capital\" (or resources) and (2) specific educational pathways in college for a group of academically talented, mostly minority young women who participated for 3 years in a high school program intended to spark and sustain their interest in engineering. The high school program, Female Recruits Explore Engineering (FREE), was implemented in 10 public schools in 3 states (CO, IA, and OH), from 2006-2009. FREE began with 131 mostly urban, Latina, Black, Native American and Asian American girls who were strong students in math and science. The proposed study will follow all the young women who stayed in FREE during high school and their first post-high school year (n=81). In this group, 22% are pursuing engineering majors, 35% are in other STEM majors, 33% are pursuing non-STEM majors, and 10% are undecided. Pierre Bourdieu's \"social capital\" framework will be employed to analyze the capital the participants brought with them and will have used in college, including that gained in FREE, to pursue their college goals. The concept of \"educational pathways\" will be used to examine the dynamic interplay between institutional structures for pursuing college degrees, sources of support in college, and individual decisions and choices made in college. Data will include information about the young women's high school backgrounds, experiences and lives (observation; interviews; demographic, self-efficacy and social network surveys; Blackberry PIN, Messenger and email messages; website and Facebook postings) from the FREE project. Comparable new data will be collected about the women's college experiences through Facebook postings, interviews and surveys. The qualitative data will be analyzed by creating a coding scheme of a priori categories (based on the research questions) and in situ (emerging from the data) categories and managed with the ATLAS.ti software program. Survey data will be analyzed with descriptive statistics, and where survey questions have been drawn from national surveys, those data will be used to make national comparisons.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This research seeks to impact the broader education community and society as a whole by: illuminating the connections between forms of capital and choice for or against careers in engineering and other STEM fields; contributing to policies and programs for increasing diversity in STEM fields; involving non-privileged students in research related to their STEM circumstances and options; preparing graduate students in Education, Women's Studies, and STEM fields for research on education-related issues, particularly those involving under-represented populations; and widely disseminating results through diverse sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, STEM-oriented associations, the FREE website, college-oriented websites and magazines, local and national press, and speaking engagements.",

The program, Female Recruits Explore Engineering (FREE), was implemented in 10 public schools in 3 states (CO, IA, OH) from 2006-2009 and included 132 young women.  The current study, FREE Pathways, followed for 4 more years all the young women (n=81) who wished to continue.  In this group, 22% chose engineering majors when they went to college, 35% chose other STEM majors, 33% chose non-STEM majors, and 10% were undecided or not in college in 2009-10.  Bourdieu's \"theory of capital\" and Yosso's \"community cultural wealth\" framework were used to analyze participants' college-going experiences and capital.\n\nThe primary research question was:  How does economic, social, and cultural capital brought to college, as well as gained and used in college, affect young women's persistence in engineering and non-engineering STEM in college?  Data about the young women's backgrounds, high school experiences, and college lives were collected through Facebook postings, face-to-face interviews, and online surveys.\n\nAmong the 57 women for whom we have complete data, 47% of those who started college in engineering graduated in engineering; 24% of those who started in engineering graduated with a degree in non-engineering STEM; 79% of those who started college in non-engineering STEM graduated with those STEM degrees; and 69% of those who started in non-STEM fields graduated in those fields.  Overall, 54% of the young women graduated with a STEM degree.\n\nMuch of the success in engineering was achieved by upper middle-class, white women whose families had considerable financial resources (&gt;$80,000/yr), powerful social connections, and elite cultural knowledge that made it relatively straightforward for the women to assume they would go to a good college, have college costs covered, and be successful, regardless of major.  Those who chose and stayed in non-engineering STEM were more likely to be from middle- or low-income families with much less college-going capital.  The lower-income women, most of whom were women of color, who succeeded in non-engineering STEM, and the one who succeeded in engineering, had to rely on financial resources from uncertain or inconsistent sources (competitive scholarships, federal grants, loans), social contacts facilitated almost entirely by school personnel, and cultural capital acquired in school-based programs (courses, minority support groups, scholarship-linked study groups, sororities).\n\nAlthough the sample was small, the outcomes were impressive and uncharacteristic for this population.  We found that the interests of the young women and the general support of family and friends, enlarged by an attentive high school environment, including enrichment and on-going support from FREE, enabled some of the women to access and activate the capital they needed to pursue STEM in college.  Once in college, however, they struggled to stay on course.  For none was this a straightforward or seamless process.  Even the privileged young women questioned their abilities in the face of pressure to be woman in engineering and other predominantly male STEM fields.  For the young women of color from middle- and lower-income families, the erratic patchwork of economic, social and cultural supports available for students like them presented an on-going obstacle course that had to be constantly negotiated.  For most, sufficient economic capital was a constant worry, and the social and cultural capital with which they entered college was not sustaining throughout.  New forms of social capital were necessary to acce..."
