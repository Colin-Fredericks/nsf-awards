 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Xavier University implementation project entitled: XU Pre-Graduate Scholars Program, addresses the problem of the underrepresentation of African Americans in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Increasing the number of African Americans graduating in STEM disciplines and moving on to graduate school is one of the primary goals on which Xavier University has been focusing for two decades.  Xavier's previous HBCU-UP program was relatively successful in addressing this issue, but was unable to fully reach its project goals due to the disruption that occurred in the first year of implementation caused by Hurricane Katrina; 87% of the faculty and staff lost their homes and 25% of the faculty had to be terminated due to loss of tuition revenue. Although enrollment dropped dramatically after Katrina, HBCU-UP helped Xavier to consistently increase post-Katrina STEM recruitment and retention rates, and to continue to send high percentages of STEM students to graduate school.  \r\nThe goals of this project are to: 1) increase and retain the number of highly qualified undergraduate students majoring in science/math education matriculating towards initial teacher certification and the Masters Degree (M.A.T.) by 100% over the next five years; 2) increase and retain the number of entering freshman majoring in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics and Dual Degree Engineering by at least 50% over the next five years; and 3) increase the number of STEM undergraduate students entering graduate school in STEM disciplines by 20% over the next five years. These goals will be accomplished by expanding STEM teacher preparation activities, including summer enrichment programs for potential STEM education majors, strengthening recruitment of STEM students from targeted high schools,  continuing to improve strategies for student retention, providing undergraduate research experiences, and expanding outreach to parents of STEM students.",
