 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs have requested a RAPID award to recover a surface buoy 2-point anchored in the middle reaches of the York River, VA. The buoy was deployed in 2009 as part of the NSF-funded Multi- Disciplinary Benthic Exchange Dynamics (MUDBED) project, as the surface link between an underwater particle settling camera system and real-time cell-based data transmittal to an ftp server.\r\n\r\nThe underwater sensor package was recovered in August 2009. An attempt was made to recover the surface buoy at the end of April 2010, which failed because important elements of the planned recovery system had been cut and because of station-keeping difficulties under difficult wind and tide conditions. The surface buoy must be recovered during 2010.. From a scientific equipment perspective, the buoy with its attached solar panels and electro-optical data/power cable are valuable resources for future oceanographic field programs. The most important aspect of this proposed effort is avoiding potential hazards to navigation. The chain and/or connecting shackles will inevitably fail through corrosion or wear and allow the buoy to become detached, at which time it will swing widely (if only one chain breaks) or float free with the tide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project funded recovery of a surface buoy stranded in the middle reaches of the York River, VA.  The buoy was deployed in 2009 as part of the NSF-funded Multi-Disciplinary Benthic Exchange Dynamics (MUDBED) project, as the surface link between an underwater particle settling camera system and an ftp server where the camera images and ancillary data were stored.  The underwater sensor package and cell modem on the buoy were recovered in August 2009.  An attempt was made to recover the surface buoy at the end of April 2010, which failed because important elements of the planned recovery system had been cut and because of station-keeping difficulties under difficult wind and tide conditions.  The April 2010 attempt used up all available funding for recovery attempts.\n\nFrom a scientific equipment perspective, the buoy with its attached solar panels and electro-optical data/power cable are valuable resources for future oceanographic field programs.  For example, the PI and collaborators need them to carry out field work in Chesapeake Bay during 2012 and 2013.  The buoy, electro-optical cable, solar panels, chain, and anchors would cost approximately $12,500 to replace, as well as the technician time required to re-order and reassemble the systems. \n\nAnother important aspect of the recovery effort was avoiding potential hazards to navigation.  The chain and/or connecting shackles inevitably would have failed through corrosion or wear and allowed the buoy to become detached, at which time it would have swung widely (if only one chain broke) or floated free with the tide.  In either case it would have been a significant hazard to navigation.  Successful recovery of the buoy prevented these potential negative consequences.\n\nOn Saturday, Oct 23, 2010, the participants assembled in Gloucester Point, VA.  All participants met at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) marine facility, boarded the salvage boat, and proceeded upriver to the mooring site.  After tying up to the buoy, Capt. Younger used his surface-supplied salvage diving rig to attach lift bags to the two anchors, which were buried in the mud at the bottom of the river.  Inflation of the bags eventually worked each of the anchors out of the mud, one after the other.  They were then hoisted onto the back of the boat and the buoy towed back to VIMS.  The mooring system was disassembled and loaded onto the UMCES trailer, where it was cleaned and tied down.  Since it was almost dark at that point, all participants decided to stay overnight in Gloucester and travel home on Sunday morning, October 24.\n\nRecovery of the stranded buoy using the small, readily maneuverable salvage vessel, a skilled salvage diver, and large capacity lift bags was much more effective and ultimately safer than attempting to grapple for the anchors from a larger research vessel.  When necessary, and for suitable water depths and environmental conditions, this technique is highly recommended.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2011\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence P Sanford"
