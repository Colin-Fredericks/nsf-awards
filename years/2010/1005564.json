His study will address two questions: 1) How is the limiting distribution of the quantum walk related to the level of decoherence to which the quantum walk is exposed? and 2) How does the measure of entanglement between the subsystems (coin and position) depend upon the level of decoherence?  In this approach, the measure of entanglement is reflected by the mutual information between the subsystems, which, in turn, is defined in terms of the von Neumann entropy. \r\n\r\nThe outcomes to flow from this proposal will be of interest to a wide audience of active investigators at the forefront of research in the fields of quantum computing and quantum information.
