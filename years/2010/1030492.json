 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant provides funding for the development of a fundamental understanding of the mechanical, thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical behavior of thermal spray fabricated structures rationalized through analysis of natural counterparts. Thermal spray materials, which are layered structures comprised of micron-thick 'bricks' and nanoscale interfaces, have been shown to display similar mechanical properties as nacre (mother of pearl), including non&#8208;linear elasticity, anelasticity and enhanced toughening. Noteworthy is the discovery that these biomimetic properties are tunable via process and material manipulation, opening up opportunities for microstructural design of industrially relevant coating systems. Through process engineering of interfacial structures, relationships between microstructure and elastic properties will be determined. By coupling thermal and mechanical testing with modeling, microstructural analysis and process science, while considering natural structural principles, a fundamental understanding of how the unique thermal spray material structure influences elastic properties and toughness will be developed.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary flexibility of thermal spray with respect to materials and scalability enables its consideration as a tool for large scale synthesis of biomimetic structures. Thus, this research will enable a symbiosis between the remarkable attributes of natural systems and the desire to optimize functionality and damage tolerance of industrially important materials and coatings. The research will identify phenomena having an impact on the performance and design of essential classes of engineered materials. Appreciation of the fundamentals will provide enhanced confidence, increased applicability and accelerated insertion of new concepts in the thermal spray industry. Our innovative, industrially linked higher education and K-12 outreach efforts will provide: (a) Interactions between students and their industrial collaborators, (b) Opportunities to communicate results and receive feedback from industry, (c) Industrial internships priming students for a long-term commitment to materials science and thermal spray technologies, and (d) Inspiration for K-12 students and teachers through summer programs.",
