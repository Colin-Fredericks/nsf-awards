 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project seeks to create an accelerated track for engineering bachelor and master degrees for veterans at Kansas State University focused on the energy industry.  The program integrates elements of accelerated programs, credit for military experience, and a clearly defined pathway into the renewable energy industry.  This program, if successful, can serve as an example to other universities who seek to allow students with military experience ways to translate that experience to faster engineering degree completion.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project comes from addressing the needs of the large population of veterans, and additionally preparing those veterans for careers in the energy industry.  Energy, particularly sustainable energy, is burgeoning field that has become a national priority.  The approach pioneered by the research team can serve as a model which can be emulated by other universities who wish to target military veterans.",
