 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene flow is a potent evolutionary force. Gene flow among populations and between species (hybridization) can have important applied consequences such as the evolution of invasive species and extinction by hybridization.  This project will result in a monograph that synthesizes the PI's career body of research on the consequences of gene flow both within and between species. The work will be broadened in perspective through consultation with other experts whose research on gene flow supplements and complements the PI's research. \r\n\r\nThe project has inherent societal benefits because it focuses on the applied consequences of gene flow and hybridization. For instance, gene flow can result in new invasive species, the extinction of rare ones, and the unintended spread of engineered genes. Thus, the project will improve our understanding of the role of gene flow in issues of societal importance. The monograph to be produced will communicate useful scientific synthesis to a broad audience of scientists, civil servants, and the public, including policy-makers, Congressional staff, resource managers, and industry scientists.",
