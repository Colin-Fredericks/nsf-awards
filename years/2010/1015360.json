 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well-established that Earth's magnetic field arises from motion within its electrically conducting liquid outer core by way of a dynamo process; however, a complete understanding of field generation remains enigmatic.  In particular, the problem of polarity reversal remains elusive.  Observation of field behavior (variations in direction and intensity) during reversals comes from laboratory analysis of the magnetic information \"fossilized\" in rocks at the time of their formation.  The bulk of our knowledge about the structure of reversing fields has come from drilled core samples at locations in the Northern Hemisphere.  Hence, a complete understanding of transitional field behavior on a global scale, and the dynamo process responsible, requires considerably more input from the Southern Hemisphere.  Such is the focus of our study of an extensive sequence of Tertiary lavas from the Liverpool Volcano in eastern Australia, which is known to contain the record of an ancient field reversal at about 40 million years ago. Our goal is to obtain the most complete paleomagnetic documentation of polarity reversal recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, both with regard to the progression of directional swings, as well as the changes in field strength.  In addition, we are using isotopic dating techniques to date the lavas in order to determine the precise age and duration of the reversal.  Results from the project will be used to develop improved global models of dynamo reversal and to supply needed constraints for sophisticated computer simulation.\r\n \r\nStudies of the geomagnetic field are important because it shields the Earth from harmful cosmic rays and provides the means for human and animal navigation.  The field is decaying in strength at a rate that, if it were to continue, would vanish in less than 2000 years.  If this occurred, it could signal the onset of an attempt by the dynamo to reverse polarity.  Through our study of the Liverpool Australia Reversal we hope to better understand the nature of transitional magnetic field behavior, which has important implications for our understanding of the processes in the deep Earth's interior that give rise to the geomagnetic field. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is supporting the training of undergraduate students at California State Polytechnic University, and is contributing to research infrastructure at the University of Wisconsin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of this research has been to better understand the process by which Earth's magnetic field reverses its polarity.  The work involves the sampling of lavas in the Liverpool Range, New South Wales, Australia, that were erupted during the time when a field reversal had taken place some 40 million years ago.  These rock samples hold onto and furnish the paleomagnetic information about what was experienced at that time.  Each fieldwork mission was followed by laboratory analysis in the paleomagnetic laboratories at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, CA and the University of Montellier, Montpellier, France.  A record of this particular field reversal--the most detailed known from Southern Hemisphere--was first discovered in the late 1960's and later published in Nature in 1986, authored by the present PI.  The focus of this work has been to enhance the detail of this reversal record by finding in the original and nearby creekbeds lavas not found thus far that could be incorporated into a composite record of this magnetic field event. \n\nPrior to the present NSF grant the PI along with Dr Pierre Camps from Montpellier, France, found a second section of lavas exposed along Coolah Tops Road that provided information about the reversal.  This section is situated 14 kilometers from the original site where the reversal was discovered--Yarraman Creek.  Because of this find it was suspected that the reversal could be found throughout the Liverpool Range--that the lavas were flat-lying and extended for great distances. During the grant's tenure we sampled a number of long lava sequences in the Liverpool Range starting with a resampling of the Yarraman Creek section.  However, in the intervening years since sampling was performed in the 1980's, landslides had covered much of the of creek bed making sampling of additional lavas nearly impossible.  Only one previously unsampled lava was sampled that held relevant new information about field behavior during the reversal.  We then sampled several sections in the Coolah Tops National Park within the Liverpool Range and found that, apart from the Coolah Tops Road section, lavas erupted during the Liverpool Reversal were not to be found. \n\nThere was a second goal of this research, namely, to ascertain whether the enhanced reversal record might help to test the so-called SCOR-field Hypothesis which asserts that the magnetic field generated in the fluid outer core, universally understood to be due to a dynamo process, is the result of a two-tiered dynamo. Specifically, the assertion that the field generated near the top of the core behaves quasi-independently from the field generated at further depth--the latter being the source of the axial dipole, the holder of field polarity.  The primary outcome relevant to the SCOR coming from the Liverpool lavas was the finding that the strength of the magnetic field at the site during the reversal was much stronger than would be expected, a result that is consistent with the hypothesis.  The paleofield strength could not come from the axial dipole alone since the field directions were atypical, what we call \"transitional.\"  Thus, there need to have been a significant field source at play other than the axial dipole.  The fact that there is currently such a source of strong magnetic field coming from Earth's core directly beneath Australia, and that there is evidence that it has existed for millions of years, suggests that it could be the source of the strong field strength at a time when the axial dipole was attempting to change polarity some 40 million years ago.\n\nThis finding led this PI to focus more on the second goal of the research project and to look beyond the Liverpool record.  All available lava-based records of transitional fields, a total of 16, that were found and analyzed from sections in and around Australia spanning the last 40 million years of Earth history were analyzed en masse. The focus was a search for any sign of..."
