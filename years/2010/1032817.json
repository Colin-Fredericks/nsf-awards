The overall goal of this conference is to engage undergraduate student researchers, primarily from groups underrepresented in the sciences, in high-level scientific discussions, professional development activities, and networking activities.  \r\n\r\nIn order to maintain its global competitiveness, the United States must work vigorously to tap neglected pools of intellectual talent.  Students from underrepresented groups are, by definition, represented in the sciences at rates smaller than their fraction of the population.  The goal of programs like this is to provide young scientists from these groups with the tools that they need to become successful, productive members of the American technological workforce.",
