 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues an ongoing program to develop fundamental theories of many-particle systems, ranging from nuclei and nuclear matter to cold atoms, with applications to astrophysical and condensed matter systems.  A major focus is on understanding new states of matter formed under extreme conditions, especially quark gluon plasmas produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.  The program applies nuclear theory to neutron stars and supernovae, with the aim of understanding observations and, conversely, using observations to learn the properties of matter.  The research on atomic Bose-Einstein and superfluid Fermi systems, a vital facet of the study of unusual states of matter, focusses on atomic states at low temperature, as well as under extreme rotation.  This research also makes important interdisciplinary connections between ultracold atomic systems and dense nuclear matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The nuclear and atomic systems being studied are very unusual many-particle systems which provide broad intellectual insights.  By working across the boundaries between nuclear and atomic physics this program enables the building of bridges and cross-fertilization between the hottest and coldest many-particle systems in the universe.  A vital component of this research program is the education of young scientists who, through the broad training they receive and their intimate involvement in the research of the PI's and colleagues, develop the ability to combine nuclear, particle, astro, condensed matter and cold atom physics research on forefront problems.  The scientists trained in this program have generally gone on to have significant impact in research at U.S. universities and national laboratories, as well as abroad.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMatter can take on many forms, from familiar gases, liquids, and solids,\nto unusual states such as superfluids which flow without friction to superconductors which conduct electricity without resistance.    In recent years, physicists have created several new forms of matter -- the densest hottest matter in the universe called a \"quark-gluon plasma,\" and the coldest matter in the universe, in the form of trapped atomic gases.   The former has been created since the turn of this century at the Brookhaven Relativistic Collider (RHIC) in the U.S., and more recently at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland.  The latter has been explored in table-top experiments in laboratories originally in the U.S., and now at laboratories around the world.  Research on this Grant has been aimed at expanding our knowledge matter of under extreme conditions.\n\nImportant technological applications have the potential to flow eventually from our deeper understanding the properties of such extreme states of matter, particularly when we examine these states from an interdisciplinary perspective. Understanding how groups of particles, from quarks to atoms, behave and act in concert provides deeper insights into the laws governing the microscopic universe and the basic properties of the world we live in.  Research on this Grant continues the building of new bridges between nuclear-particle physics, atomic physics and condensed matter physics.\n\nAn important component of the present research program is its interdisciplinary approach to problems of many-particle systems that crosses subfields, bringing to bear experience over the years in a wide spectrum of research in condensed matter, atomic, nuclear, and astrophysics. Our research in one area continues to generate new insights and approaches in other areas, e.g., laboratory superconductivity studies leading to new approaches to superconductivity in quark-gluon plasmas, and nuclei and quark matter studies raising new issues in relativistic many-body theory. Expertise developed for condensed matter and atomic systems has been a significant aspect of the group's study of dense and hot matter.   We mention more salient facets of our research.\n\nOne facet of our research centered on the question of understanding what matter is like at the highest possible densities and temperatures.  Such matter, which filled the early universe prior to a microsecond after the big bang, can be created in the laboratory in highly energetic collisions of large atomic nuclei, and should be present in the cores of neutron stars -- stars weighing about as much as the sun, but only some 15 miles across, that are left behind when normal stars burn up all their nuclear fuel, first collapse and then generally explode.  Here we have made detailed determinations and predictions of the phases that quark matter can assume, including possible superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensed states in which the quarks act coherently in locked step, and also determined how such matter appears in neutron stars.  \n\nA second facet has concentrated on exploring possible new states of clouds of electrically neutral ultracold atoms.  One main interest has been the properties of matter in which artificial magnetic fields are generated through clever use of external lasers, and act on the atoms as if they had an electrical charge.  In particular, in studying the possible states of \"spin-orbit\" coupled matter, in which the lasers couple the momentum of the atoms to their internal states of excitation, the hyperfine states, we have predicted that coherent Bose-Einstein condensed states can stably exist at sufficiently low temperatures.   In addition we have studied how one can create states of cold atoms that are analogs of some of the unusual coherent states of quarks in high density matter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2014\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon A Baym"
