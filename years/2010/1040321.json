 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the development of a deep water remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to support a variety of benthic ecology and coral studies.  The primary use of this instrument is to explore and characterize the diversity and biology of deep-water coral reef habitats (>30 m), also known as the Coral Reef \"Twilight Zone.\" The ROV allows coral reef scientists to 1) explore and quantitatively record the biogeography and biodiversity of deep reef communities at depths from 10 to 750m with particular emphasis on the deep coral, sponge and microbial communities worldwide; and (2) examine the issue of connectivity between shallow and deep reefs, and between reef systems worldwide using both molecular genetics and assessments of phenotypic variation between reef systems.  The ROV also enables in situ sampling and preservation at depth to facilitate the study of deep reef physiology and taxonomy of new species on coral reefs.  In addition to the standard faculty research, summer undergraduate research project participants utilize the ROV and post their findings on the American Museum of Natural History 'Science Bulletins' website.  Science Bulletins is an innovative online and exhibition program that offers the public a window into the excitement of scientific discovery.  Additional outcomes from these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.",
